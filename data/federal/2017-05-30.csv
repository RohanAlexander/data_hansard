1,Mr MORRISON,BILLS," I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Turnbull government is committed to Australia having a world leading financial sector. Our banks must be unquestionably strong, but they must also be unquestionably accountable, unquestionably fair and our banking system must be unquestionably competitive. The government is also committed to ensuring that Australia's largest banks are held to account and make a fair additional contribution to the Australian community which they serve. Australia's financial system is strong, stable and well-regulated and has weathered global volatility well. Nevertheless, the banking system in Australia-with a small number of large and highly profitable banks at its core-is highly concentrated. The government and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) have taken, and continue to take, steps that will force banks to take greater responsibility for their own resilience and avoid the need for taxpayer-funded bailouts. The major bank levy will build on these critical prudential reforms by making stable and secure funding sources relatively less expensive. Importantly, it will also support competition in the financial system by providing a more level playing field for smaller banks and other providers of financial services who compete with the larger banks who enjoy cheaper costs of funding. Australia's five largest banks are highly profitable-earning more than $30 billion a year after tax-and benefit from a regulatory system that has helped to embed their dominant position in the market. For example, the major banks are accredited to use internal ratingsbased models that allow them to reduce the amount of capital that they must hold, lowering their funding costs relative to the smaller banks who rely on standardised risk weights. They also contribute to systemic risk through their scale and concentration to the financial system-risks that ultimately fall on the broader Australian community. Hence, from 1 July 2017 all authorised deposit-taking institutions (ADIs), foreign and domestically-owned, with greater than $100 billion in licensed entity liabilities will be liable to pay the major bank levy, which will include the big four banks.  Unlike the previous bank deposits tax measure, which was abolished by this government, smaller banks will not be liable to pay the major bank levy. The threshold will be indexed to growth in nominal gross domestic product. The major bank levy will equal 0.015 per cent of each affected bank's licensed entity liabilities each quarter (0.06 per cent per annum), excluding additional tier 1 capital, deposits protected by the Financial Claims Scheme (FCS) and the quarterly average value of Exchange Settlement Account (ESA) balances held with the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). Unlike previous proposals considered by earlier governments, this levy will not apply to everyday household deposits. Nor will it apply to banks' assets-such as mortgages. It will also not apply to other financial institutions, such as insurance companies or superannuation funds. It is not a levy on depositors or savers or mortgage holders. Liabilities captured by the levy include, for example corporate bonds; commercial paper; certificates of deposit; Tier 2 capital instruments; operational liabilities and non-FCS protected deposits. Treasury estimates that the levy is expected to raise around $1.5 billion a year. This represents a fair contribution by the banking sector to the Australian community and contributes to a long-term balanced budget. To minimise additional red-tape costs, assessment of the levy will largely rely on data already reported to APRA and will be payable quarterly to the Australian Taxation Office. The government is working with the banks to ensure a smooth transition to the new regime. To assist major banks to begin to comply with the levy, the first levy calculation and instalment will be delayed by three months-at no cost to revenue-to provide additional time for banks to make necessary systems changes. The levy will be administered by the ATO, with APRA's role being solely to assist with data collection. The levy will support efforts to improve financial system resilience. The Turnbull government and APRA are working diligently-in line with the recommendations of the Murray Financial System Inquiry-to improve the resilience of Australia's financial system. This includes:  setting bank capital requirements such that Australian banks are 'unquestionably strong';  strengthening APRA's crisis management powers;  improving bank liquidity and encouraging more stable funding; and  ensuring that our banks have appropriate loss-absorbing capacity. The major bank levy will complement these important reforms. By excluding Additional Tier 1 capital and FCS-protected deposits from the levy base, the levy will work in tandem with APRA reforms. The effective exclusion of liabilities used to fund ESA balances held with the RBA will also ensure that the levy does not impinge on the operation of Australia's payments system. The levy is also designed to support competition.  The House of Representatives Economics Committee's review of the four major banks, commissioned by the Prime Minister and myself last year, concluded that Australia's banking sector is an oligopoly and that Australia's largest banks have significant pricing power which they have used to the detriment of everyday Australians. This is not a situation that I or the government are willing to accept. In the 2017-18 budget we announced a range of measures to improve competition in the financial system, including:  a reduction in regulatory barriers for new and innovative entrants in banking;  an enhanced regulatory sandbox, to support innovation-particularly in the FinTec sector;  an extension of the Crowd-Sourced Equity Framework, to help get new businesses off the ground; and  a commitment to open banking, to empower consumers to have control over their data and get the best possible deal. We have also established a Productivity Commission inquiry into the state of financial system competition, to be supplemented by regular in-depth inquiries into specific financial system competition issues by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. These measures will support economic growth and deliver better outcomes for consumers and small businesses. The major bank levy builds on these reforms. The levy will help create a more level playing field for smaller banks and non-bank competitors. This will give existing and new players-including the FinTecs-a better chance to grow their businesses and deliver improved services and experiences to all Australians. The major bank levy does not give any bank an excuse to increase costs for their customers. That is why I have directed the ACCC to undertake an inquiry into residential mortgage pricing. The ACCC will be able to use its information-gathering powers to obtain and scrutinise documents from any bank affected by the levy and to report publicly on its findings. Following the introduction of the levy, it is my expectation that, in setting their prices, banks will effectively balance the needs of borrowers, savers, shareholders and the wider community. The ACCC inquiry will illuminate how the banks respond to the introduction of the levy and give all Australians the information they need to get a better deal elsewhere from any of the more than 100 other banks, credit unions and building societies, as well as other non-bank competitors. The Turnbull government has been a world leader in making sure that big companies pay their fair share of tax. To close, this bill delivers on the government's promise to ensure that Australia's largest banks are held accountable to the Australian community. It is evidence of our government's utmost commitment to long-term budget sustainability, structural measures and to ensuring that Australia's largest banks make a fair contribution to the community.  It builds on our program of prudential reforms, contributing to the resilience of our financial system and helping to ensure that banks can stand on their own two feet without recourse to taxpayers at times of financial stress. Finally, it enhances competition-supporting economic growth and delivering better outcomes for Australian consumers and businesses. Full details of the measure are contained in the explanatory memorandum. Debate adjourned. Treasury Laws Amendment (Major Bank Levy) Bill 2017 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Morrison. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",15
2,Mr MORRISON,BILLS," I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Treasury Laws Amendment (Major Bank Levy) Bill 2017 is the second bill to introduce the major bank levy. This bill makes a number of amendments to support the effective operation of the major bank levy. These include:  setting out how to index the levy's $100 billion threshold to growth in nominal gross domestic product, ensuring that only the largest banks are levied in the future;  allowing the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) to collect the data necessary for the major banks to calculate the levy;  allowing APRA to provide information relating to the major bank levy to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) to assist the ATO in monitoring compliance with the levy, and for the ATO to give information relating to the levy to APRA;  ensuring that when the major bank levy is payable to the ATO the ordinary collection and recovery provisions apply; and  introducing an anti-avoidance provision to protect the integrity of the levy. Full details of this measure and the major bank levy are contained in the explanatory memorandum. Debate adjourned. Criminal Code Amendment (Protecting Minors Online) Bill 2017 Reference to Federation Chamber",18
3,Ms MARINO,BILLS," I declare that, at the adjournment of the debate on the Criminal Code Amendment (Protecting Minors Online) Bill 2017, the bill is referred to the Federation Chamber for further consideration.  ASIC Supervisory Cost Recovery Levy Bill 2017 ASIC Supervisory Cost Recovery Levy (Collection) Bill 2017 ASIC Supervisory Cost Recovery Levy (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2017 Second Reading Cognate debate. Consideration resumed of the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.",18
4,Dr LEIGH,BILLS," I rise to speak on the ASIC Supervisory Cost Recovery Levy Bill 2017 and related bills. Labor is supportive of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission industry funding model on the principle that ASIC's regulatory costs should be borne by those entities it regulates. Under this model, in the 2017-18 financial year ASIC's regulatory costs will be recovered from the corporate sector and the financial services sector instead of being borne by the taxpayer. These costs are anticipated to be $240 million in 2017-18. The opposition notes that the cost recovery levy is similar to the arrangements currently in place for funding the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. The principle that regulation is paid for by the entities that have created the need for it rather than by the Australian public is uncontroversial. Reflecting ASIC's function as the corporate regulator, the levy will apply to all companies and in 2017-18 is expected to raise $81 million, with costs ranging from $5 a year for small proprietary companies to $662,000 for listed public companies with a market capitalisation above $20 billion. Reflecting ASIC's function as the financial services regulator, additional levies will apply to entities in the financial services sector, and these levies are expected to raise $159 million from the financial services sector in 2017-18. We note that some existing ASIC fees, the government has foreshadowed, will be reduced in lieu of the cost recovery levy. The total levy is to be implemented in a rather complicated manner. ASIC's regulatory costs are apportioned between subsectors, with about 50 different formulas to be included in the regulations. To take one example: payday lenders are expected to be liable for $2 million of ASIC's regulatory expenses in 2017-18. Each payday lender is expected to pay a $2,000 minimum levy, with an additional graduated levy to be charged based on the amount of credit provided. The regulations will be supplemented by an annual legislative instrument made by ASIC to specify the amounts in each formula so that costs relating to particular subsectors are attributed to that subsector. The disallowance periods in this bill are shortened from 15 sitting days to five sitting days in order to provide greater commercial certainty. An adjustment is also made to the default position under subsection 42(2) so that if a motion is unresolved in accordance with that subsection at the end of the disallowance period, a provision of the instrument is not automatically taken to have been disallowed. We do note the significant complexity in the way the ASIC mechanism has been designed. A lot of the heavy lifting of this model is left to the regulations, which have only just been released in draft form. Labor will be watching implementation closely. We note too that the regulations will be the centre of action, and so making sure that those regulations are appropriately drafted will be absolutely critical.  If you read the minister's second reading speech to this bill, there is too much rhetoric about tough cops on the beat and encouraging regulatory compliance. These are words that will ring hollow to anyone who has been watching the government's performance in this space. Since coming to office in 2013, the coalition government slashed ASIC's funding by $120 million in the 2014 budget-reflecting a massive free pass to corporate and financial sector misconduct. We should reflect on that as we look at this bill today, which Labor supports. For all the talk of those opposite, we do know that this is the government that has cut funding to the corporate regulator. The government took no action to unwind those cuts until Labor proposed a royal commission into the banking and financial services sector in April 2016. Those cuts to ASIC had a devastating impact-the loss of staff and of expertise, and on the ability of the regulator to address misconduct appropriately. Cuts to ASIC have hamstrung ASIC and continue to have an ongoing impact today. That is similar to the record of the coalition on financial protections more broadly. It was not so long ago that the Liberal and National parties were voting against Labor's Future of Financial Advice reforms and voting against reforms that were all about improving trust and confidence in financial planning. They were voting against reforms that would give ASIC, the very subject of this bill, its much-needed powers to oversee financial advice. Upon coming to office the coalition attempted to unwind Labor's Future of Financial Advice reforms under the guise of removing red tape. This so-called red-tape repeal, taking powers away from ASIC, was only ever going to advantage those who would seek to rip off honest borrowers and lenders. In debating this bill, it is absolutely critical to understand that anything relating to financial services, as this bill does, must take into account the need for a royal commission into the banking and financial services sector. In the wake of Storm, Trio and Westpoint, and the many other scandals-in the wake of the bank bill swap rate scandal and the Comminsure scandal-it is critical to get to the bottom of what has gone on in the banking and financial services sector. It is critical that the government stops standing in the way of a banking royal commission, because only a banking royal commission can go to the bottom of the cultural and systemic issues that have led to thousands of Australians having their lives ruined. A Productivity Commission review is merely going to be about competition in the banking sector, but it cannot get to the bottom of the misconduct. It cannot forensically examine documents and witnesses, follow leads to get to the bottom of these scandals. Neither can the House economics committee hearings serve the role of a royal commission. A cup of tea with big bank CEOs is no substitute for a proper royal commission. Since Labor called for a royal commission in April last year we have seen more and more misconduct. In the past 18 months alone the big banks have been forced to pay in excess of $300 million in fines or compensation for fraud, misleading conduct, illegal conduct or breaching consumer protections. Since this bill relates to ASIC, I will take just one ASIC example. In October 2016 ASIC released its report Financial advice: fees for no service. The report revealed that Australia's biggest banks have spent years charging over 200,000 customers fees for services they did not receive-yet more proof that we need a royal commission into the banking and financial services sector. That October 2016 report revealed that AMP, ANZ, CBA, NAB and Westpac will have to pay almost $180 million-excluding  interest-in compensation, because again they have failed to do the right thing. A recent update by ASIC, on 19 May 2017, says that that figure is now over $204 million in fees that were charged for financial advice that was never received. In an Senate estimates hearing in April, ASIC advised that the number of customers affected is now up to 330,000. These were not just technical glitches. In its October report, ASIC found that these organisations: …prioritised revenue and fee generation over the delivery of advice and services paid for by their customers. Customers were charged fees for advice from financial advisers who had left or retired, and for services that involved nothing more than three unanswered phone calls. ASIC found: …advisers were allowed to have many more ongoing advice customers on their books than they would have been able to monitor or advise on an annual basis. For example, some advisers had many hundreds of customers-often having 'inherited' these customers, and the stream of fee revenue, from other advisers who had departed from the licensee. ASIC found that licensees did not have systems in place to ensure that services were provided in return for the fees being charged. We have seen the pressure that has been place on ASIC by the big banks. A freedom of information request by The Australian's Ben Butler reports a case in 2014: '… as ASIC worked on a press release about losses caused to customers who used NAB's Navigator investment platform, a worker in the regulator's media unit wryly emailed colleagues: ""This is one of those releases that has been drafted by everyone other than ASIC!""' We had an example in relation to a review of Macquarie Equities Limited, the Macquarie Group's financial planning arm, by EY. According to The Australian, Adrian Borchok, a senior manager in ASIC's enforcement team, was questioned about a draft press release about the matter. Mr Borchok was asked: 'In paragraph 5, do we really want to say ""superficial"", as Macquarie Equities Limited did engage EY to do a review of their compliance system?' Mr Borchok responded: 'I think the use of ""superficial"" is appropriate because it reflects the situation. Further, the EY review was a sham, therefore they are getting off easy with ""superficial"".' Then there were documents relating to the Commonwealth Bank's media releases. Adele Ferguson wrote of one of the documents: 'In one press release dated May 2014 that relates to ASIC imposing new licence conditions on two of CBA's financial planning arms, an original draft press release called it for what it was: the business had ""misled"" ASIC over its compensation scheme and the methodology used to compensate clients. But the word ""misled"" was dropped by an ASIC executive.' These documents only emerged after a twoyear battle between The Australian and ASIC through the freedom of information process. This again raises significant concerns about the cuts that have been made to ASIC under this government. Labor supports these laws that ensure that the corporate sector pays for regulatory costs within ASIC. We also recognise that it is important to have appropriate laws in place to curtail dodgy phoenix operators. The tax commissioner today told a Senate estimates committee, 'I could appoint you as a company director without you even knowing it, and have me then controlling the company.' An expert has recently been quoted as saying, 'You can almost register your dog as a company director, literally.' That is why last week LaborBrendan O'Connor, Senator Katy Gallagher and I-announced a package of measures to  crack down on dodgy phoenix activity, including a unique director identification number, with a 100-point identity check, which makes it as difficult to become a director as it currently is for a regular Australian to open a bank account. That call for a director identification number from Labor has been supported by the Productivity Commission, the Australian Institute of Company Directors, the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Master Builders Australia, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Australian Restructuring Insolvency and Turnaround Association, and the Phoenix Project, which comprises experts from Melbourne University Law School and Monash University Business School. The only significant entity in Australia that does not support a director identification number is the Turnbull government. Labor's package on dodgy phoenix directors would also increase penalties associated with phoenix activity, introduce an objective test for transactions depriving employees of their entitlements and clarify the availability of compensation orders against accessories. We cannot let dodgy directors off the leash, because they are hurting workers, firms and taxpayers. A report seven years ago estimated the cost of phoenix activity to be $3.2 billion per year: $0.6 billion to taxpayers, $0.7 billion to employees and $1.9 billion to business. Labor's package to crack down on dodgy phoenix directors is a pro-business measure, because it is honest businesses-the vast majority of businesses are honest-that are the worse hurt by dodgy phoenix activity. The cost today is almost certainly well above that $3.2 billion estimated from five years ago. As we support this bill, we call on the government to provide the same measure of bipartisan support to the introduction of a director identification number and other measures to make sure that dodgy phoenix directors can no longer rip off taxpayers, workers and honest businesses.",19
5,Mr COLEMAN,BILLS," I rise to speak on the ASIC Supervisory Cost Recovery Levy Bill 2017. I will make some remarks about this specific bill and then some broader issues of relevance. This bill gives effect to an important recommendation of the Murray inquiry back in 2014, and that recommendation was that industry should pay the cost of ASIC's operation and that the level of cost should broadly reflect the usage of ASIC's time. So, an industry which ASIC spends a lot of time regulating would be required to pay more than an industry which ASIC spends a minimal amount of time regulating. As a consequence, a formula has been arrived at. ASIC staff will allocate their time based on activity, as occurs in many professional services firms in the private sector. ASIC will determine the amount of time that is spent on particular activities, and then each industry subsector will be charged an amount based on the cost of regulating it. What that means is that industries with a poor record of conduct, where ASIC spends a lot of time regulating them, will pay more than industries with good conduct. The entities within that specific sector will then be allocated a proportion of the cost, and that cost will broadly reflect the entity's market share. The idea is that an entity which might have a five per cent market share in a particular subindustry would pay five per cent of the cost that is apportioned by ASIC to it for the regulation of that industry. That is entirely fair, because obviously the larger the entity, the more time that ASIC will spend regulating it relative to a smaller entity.  Importantly, the need for ASIC to apportion its time also puts some pressure on ASIC to be transparent about its own internal activities and to publicly account for that time. If ASIC is spending a very large amount of time, for instance, regulating one industry, with minimal practical benefit, then the question would obviously be asked as to why ASIC is spending so much time on that industry. Conversely, if ASIC is spending a lot of time regulating a particular industry and is demonstrating practical outcomes as a result, that would be a sensible outcome and something that would be encouraged. Similarly, organisations that may have a large number of different licences from government will, through this system, be encouraged to look at those licences and those operations and see if they indeed need all those licences. For instance, if an entity has a licence to operate in a particular subsector, it will be apportioned some of the cost of regulating that subsector and, if that entity turns around and says, 'Actually, our activities here are next to nothing; we don't want to pay that regulatory cost,' perhaps it would hand back its licence if it is not actually acting in that sector. So it will require entities to think carefully when they do in fact seek government licences to operate, particularly in the financial services sector. This model is quite similar to the APRA model and brings ASIC more in line with the existing APRA model. Importantly, this new regime will be phased in over time. It is effectively an 18-month phase-in process. In June of this year it is expected that ASIC will publish forecast cost data and indicative levies for next year. There is a range of other activities that will happen during the course of 2017, including in October ASIC is expected to publish in its annual report and cost-recovery implementation statement the proposed allocation of resources to address particular strategic risks. And it will continue to publish information over an extended period throughout 2018, with the invoices to individual entities due in January 2019 and payment in February 2019. It is a change to the way that entities contribute to the cost of their regulation, but it is not being rushed and everyone will have ample time to understand its implications. It is pleasing that this bill has bipartisan support, implementing as it does that important recommendation of the Murray inquiry. But there are very substantial differences in this broad area of corporate supervision and the need to take action now, and there is very, very significant disagreement between the government and the opposition. I want to talk particularly about the activities of ASIC and the regulatory activities as they pertain to banks and the financial services sector. The reality is that an enormous amount is happening in this space at the moment under this government, and absolutely nothing happened under the previous government. It is important to understand that, when those opposite rail against the financial services sector and call for a royal commission and so on, the Leader of the Opposition was actually the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation from 2010 to 2013. So, in fact, from October 2010 right up until the election lost in July 2013, the now Leader of the Opposition was the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation. He was also the Assistant Treasurer for a year between 2010 and 2011. What did the then government do about the regulation of banks during that entire three-year period when the current Leader of the Opposition was the responsible minister? The answer is absolutely nothing. There was no substantive achievement in the regulation of the banking sector at all in that entire three-year  period when the Leader of the Opposition, who now rails against the banks and purports to be the friend of the consumer against the banks, was the responsible minister. He did absolutely nothing during those three years. And the only policy that the Leader of the Opposition has in this space now is to have a royal commission. And, of course, that is not a policy; that is simply a call for an inquiry. It is not actually a practical solution to any particular issue; it is basically saying, 'Have another inquiry to make some recommendations in a few years time.' That is a completely inappropriate approach to regulation in this area. By contrast, this government is taking very firm action in relation to the regulation of the financial services sector. It was very pleasing to see in the budget a range of initiatives in this area. Foremost among them is the creation of the Australian Financial Complaints Authority. This new authority, overseen by ASIC, will be a one-stop shop which will allow consumers to come forward and press their claims against banks. At the moment, there are three different bodies-the Financial Ombudsman Service, the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal and the Credit and Investments Ombudsman. This is a really difficult process for people to navigate through. It can be very confusing, very time consuming, and there are three different entities to go to. In the future, there will be one entity which will regulate the banks and have the capacity for binding resolutions of consumer complaints. It was good to see that this was welcomed by the CEO of the Consumer Action Law Centre, Gerard Brody. He said: 'Australians need one high-quality service to resolve their disputes against financial institutions quickly and fairly. The one-stop shop announced today is a sensible move that can help Australians get justice.' That is a very welcome and sensible comment. In contrast, those opposite did nothing between 2010 and 2013, when the now Leader of the Opposition was the responsible minister, and they have made not one constructive contribution to this debate in the ensuing period. Another important area where the government is taking action concerns executive accountability. One of the things that came out of our recent House Economics Committee inquiry into the banking sector was the complete lack of accountability in the senior ranks of the banks for the various bad examples of consumer treatment we have seen in recent years. The reality is that, until this government took action to announce this executive accountability regime, there was not a regime in place. Those opposite, in three years of government, did not do anything to address the issue of executive accountability in the banking sector. We are taking action on that. There will be fines of up to $200 million for large institutions that do the wrong thing. APRA will have the power to remove and disqualify directors. For the first time, there will be a register of senior executives in the banking sector. That will mean a much greater emphasis on the actions and conduct of senior bank executives. Again, nothing was done by the previous government but this government is taking action in this area. Another important area concerns competition in the sector. The reality is that, when interest rates rise out of step with the Reserve Bank, our committee's work demonstrated that that is overwhelmingly to the detriment of the consumer. Between 2000 and 2016, there were 20 occasions when interest rates moved out of step with the RBA. On 19 of those occasions, that movement was bad for customers. What that suggests is a lack of strong competition in the banking sector. Again, the architecture that those opposite left when they left government in 2013 was a system where no regulatory body had specific responsibility for regulating  systemic competition issues in banking. Frankly, under the previous government, nobody was regulating systemic competition issues in banking. So what this government has announced is that the ACCC, commencing now, will have ongoing power to investigate competition issues in banking. In particular, in an inquiry that will run through to May of next year, it will look very closely at residential mortgage pricing in the banking sector. That is extremely important. What happens now when interest rates move out of step with the RBA is that people rightly criticise that. People say, 'Why is this bank moving interest rates out of step with the RBA?' In a practical sense, there is no regulatory supervision of that activity. And that changes now, through the ACCC's new team focused on competition issues in banking and specifically interest rates in the mortgage market. Again, those opposite did not do that, and they did absolutely nothing about competition in the banking sector during those long three years of the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government. When the now Leader of the Opposition was responsible for the financial service sector, he did not take action on any of these issues. Another concerning issue in the sector that we are taking action on is this issue of the lack of new entrants into the banking sector in Australia. Between 2006 and 2016 the total number of new banking licences for new Australian start-up companies was one. So, we had one new entrant into the banking sector in an entire decade. That basically says that there are a whole range of rules that make it very difficult to start up a bank. There are shareholding restrictions and capital restrictions and a whole range of things that in practice mean it is incredibly hard to get a new bank licence and to get a bank off the ground. That needs to change and, again, the government announced that change in the budget through relaxing the 15 per cent shareholding rule and through having a more two-stage process to enable people to get banking licences and a range of other initiatives. Again, it is action taken now to improve the sector for consumers and, similarly, the opening up of consumer data so that consumers can go to their bank and say, 'I would like you to share my data with another bank or another financial services provider so that they can offer me a better deal.' The government said in the budget that it will be taking action on this issue, which is a very important long-term structural issue in the banking sector. What we have here, through the ASIC supervisory bill and a range of other initiatives, is the government taking strong action in the banking sector. When the Leader of the Opposition was the minister for financial services for three years, he did absolutely nothing. We are taking action now. The opposition has no policies and no constructive contribution on this. (Time expired)",22
6,Mr THISTLETHWAITE,BILLS," The ASIC Supervisory Cost Recovery Levy Bill 2017 and related bills implement the Australian Securities and Investments Commission's industry funding model. Under the model, from the 2017-18 financial year, ASIC's regulatory costs will be recovered from the corporate sector and the financial services sector instead of being borne by the taxpayer. The costs are anticipated to be $240 million in 2017-18. The cost recovery levy is similar to the arrangements that are currently in place for funding of the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority. Entities that are regulated by ASIC will be required to pay a levy that will recover ASIC's regulatory costs for the financial year from entities that were regulated in that financial year.  The amounts payable each year will be set through a combination of regulations and legislative instruments, and the regulations will set out the methods or formulas that will be used to apportion ASIC's regulatory costs. ASIC will issue a legislative instrument that will set out what its regulatory costs were in relation to the financial year as well as information about how those costs are apportioned across leviable entities. After the levy amounts have been determined for a financial year, ASIC will then issue the notices to entities setting out the amount of the levy and when it is due and payable. The explanatory memorandum explains that that levy will be sent out in the year following the year in which the levy was determined. Failure to pay the levy by this date will attract a late payment penalty at a rate of 20 per cent per annum unless ASIC has granted the entity an extension. The increased regulatory burden arises because around 7½ thousand entities will have to establish new reporting systems to provide ASIC with additional data and around 55,000 entities will have to provide additional data to ASIC each year. Labor is supportive of these reforms. We have said from the beginning that we are supportive of this ASIC industry funding model. And we support the principle that ASIC's regulatory costs should be borne by those entities that it regulates. But-forgive me for being cynical-at the heart of this the government is really not fair dinkum about this reform. It is not something they believe in. It definitely goes against this Liberal philosophy of reducing regulation within markets and freeing up markets. It is not something that ordinarily a Liberal government-let alone the Turnbull government-would put to the parliament as a reform that is necessary in financial services. This is evidenced by the fact that in the government's 2014 budget they actually slashed ASIC's funding by $120 million. It was a massive free pass to corporate and financial sector misconduct. Of course, as a result, there was a devastating loss of staff and expertise, which has had a significant effect on the ability of the corporate and financial service regulator to address misconduct. Really, the only reason they have come to this policy-developing this policy and putting it to the parliament-is because of Labor's calls for a royal commission. In the wake of the scandal-ridden banking sector-financial services, wealth management, in particular, and insurance-these issues have been highlighted through numerous parliamentary inquiries and also through the media. The government really was forced to do something about it. They have taken the approach of, 'We'll do anything but a royal commission.' We have seen in the recent budget they have announced the new bank tax. That legislation was introduced today, finally. Finally we will be able to get a look at what the government is proposing. And, of course, we have reforms such as this. Despite the depth of the cuts and their massive impact, the government took zero action to partially unwind those cuts until Labor began its calls for a royal commission into the big banks. It has long been Labor's strongly held position that the only way to restore trust in the banking system and the only way to restore integrity to the banking sector and financial services in Australia is through a royal commission. It is a policy Labor has had since the last election. It is a policy that has garnered well over 70 per cent support of the Australian public through published opinion polls. It is a policy that anyone who has been involved in these financial scandals with the banks supports. It is a policy that many small businesses in Australia support. It is a policy, clearly, that the Australian finance and banking sector needs.  It has been made abundantly clear through the House of Representatives economics inquiry into the banks that there is a need for a royal commission in Australia. Simply calling the banks down to Canberra once a year for 20 minutes worth of questions from this committee, in which we cannot delve in depth into particular scandals and issues on behalf of victims, is not sufficient. It is not going to cut it and it is not going to remove the wish of the public and the calls for a royal commission. They are not going to die down because of the measures the government is introducing here or because of the bank levy. In fact, it was Labor that first proposed a levy on the banks to fund the implicit guarantee they had in the wake of the global financial crisis to ensure the banks in Australia do not fail. It was Labor, based on the advice of the regulators and of the Reserve Bank, that proposed an initial levy on banks to set up a special fund for a rainy day, if you like, when there may be a situation in future downturns where a bank may fail and the government may need to ensure depositors' finance with that bank. Let's never forget what those on the opposite side did: when Labor proposed it, they opposed it. In fact, we all recall the member for Warringah calling it a 'trouser tax' and saying that this was Labor's attempt to get their hands into people's hip pockets with respect to their bank accounts. Here we are, a couple of years later, and that is exactly what the government is going. They are saying it is regulated on deposits above a certain level with commercial institutions and that the banks are not going to pass it on. Deputy Speaker, I think you would have to be living in a dream world to think the banks will not find a way to pass this on to the customer. The other point to make is that no Australian worth their salt believes the government when they say the banks will not pass this on-in fact, people probably wonder who these fools are in Canberra, in cabinet, who are running this policy when they can propose something like this, try and make it different from what Labor is proposing, and think that it will not be passed on by the banks. We will wait and see how they are going to do that, and hopefully some of that information will be contained in the proposal that has finally been released today in the form of legislation. I mentioned earlier the Economics Committee inquiry. In hearings over the last couple of years we have heard about the scandals and the rip-offs that are continuing in the banking industry. They are not exceptional-they have become, unfortunately, the norm in the Australian banking sector. That is why the public are wholeheartedly sick of it and want a royal commission. The government's budget was nothing more than a misdirected attempt to protect the big banks in Australia-a bit of smoke here and a well-placed mirror there. Unfortunately, nothing in the budget will obviate the need for a royal commission into the banking and financial services sector in Australia. ASIC has had a very difficult time of it over recent years because of the cuts that I mentioned earlier that the government initially undertook in the 2014 budget but that they have sought to reverse in recent years because of all the scandals and because of Labor's call for a royal commission. Through its wealth management project, ASIC has been investigating financial advisers and as a result it has issued temporary and permanent banning orders against multiple financial planners in each of the banks. I will not go through them at length, but they include CBA wealth management licensees-15 advisers were terminated in October 2015 and October 2016, with a further 20 advisers terminated; NAB had 21 planners  dismissed for conflicts of interest, bad advice and compliance issues in 2014; there have been temporary and permanent banning orders against at least three ANZ financial planners in recent times; and there have been banning orders against two Westpac financial planners. In September 2016 ASIC announced that ANZ had refunded $29 million to hundreds of thousands of accounts for failing to disclose certain periodical payment fees, and also in September 2016 ASIC announced that Westpac had refunded $9.2 million in bank fees that should have been waived in one case and $20 million in credit card foreign transaction fees in another. In October 2016 ASIC announced that CBA would repay $105 million to customers who had been charged for financial advice that was never provided. We have seen the poor way in which the government has treated the financial regulator in the past, and one of the things that a royal commission would look into is whether or not regulators are best equipped to deal with the financial crimes that have been occurring in this industry and to tackle and try to prevent some of the scandals we have seen in recent years. The government is proposing this bank tax, but the one group of people it has ignored through all of this are the victims of bank fraud. The victims of the bank fraud are voiceless when it comes to the Turnbull government, and they are the ones who want the royal commission and the opportunity to put their case and be heard and who want an independent arbiter to make suggestions to government about ensuring that these things do not occur again. This legislation is no substitute for getting to the bottom of what has gone on in the banking sector and the financial services sector more broadly. The only way to do that is through a royal commission, and only Labor will give the Australian public the royal commission that they deserve into the banks.",25
7,Mr KEOGH,BILLS," The ASIC Supervisory Cost Recovery Levy Bill and cognate bills would establish a levy on industry to recover ASIC's regulatory costs. ASIC is a regulator that I had a long-running involvement with in the past as a federal prosecutor before coming into this place. In particular, I worked in the area of prosecuting corporate crime and I worked closely with ASIC throughout that time. This legislation and this idea have had a long genesis, which I have followed quite closely. The bills implement a new industry funding model. Under that model, from the next financial year, ASIC's regulatory costs will be recovered from the corporate sector and the financial services sector instead of being borne by the taxpayer. It is anticipated that next year those costs will be in the order of $240 million. Labor supports this legislation and the principle underpinning this legislation: that the industry that is regulated by ASIC should fund its costs. This is a principle that already applies to a number of other regulators. I know many before me have mentioned that this principle applies to APRA, which of course regulates banks and insurers and superannuation to some extent. But the principle also applies in a number of other areas, such as NOPSEMA, its predecessor NOPSA, and a number of other spaces in state government that are funded by the industries that they regulate. Part of this is intended to establish a price signal to drive economic efficiencies in the way in which resources are allocated within ASIC and to improve its transparency and accountability to the industries that it regulates and of course to the public at large about the work that it is doing and where it is spending the money that it has. It also, I suppose, provides a bit of a price signal overall to industry, in that, if it does not need as much surveillance and enforcement maybe it will cost a little less to run.  On the basis of what is being put forward, the financial sector will contribute to some of the needs for the services and the benefits of them and it should contribute to some of the costs. That is going to be reflected in that ASIC as a corporate regulator will recover some of its costs from all companies. Different costs will be recovered from companies of different sizes. And, of course, as the regulator of financial services, financial service providers will provide other parts of those costs. For a long time the banks, in particular, and the ABA-as their representatives-were opposed to this idea, figuring that they were already contributing too much to APRA, as their other regulator. But then suddenly we saw a shift; we saw a movement from the ABA and the Australian banks where they fully supported this concept of industry funding for ASIC. I have to say that took me a little by surprise. But it would appear that the reasoning behind that was that the Australian banking sector came to a realisation and said, 'Actually, ASIC needs our support; ASIC needs some help; ASIC needs greater funding, and we need to be able to kick that in.' There is an interesting concept that arises here. One of the really important things about any sector that is funding its own regulator is making sure that we keep that distance between the regulator and those that they regulate. But I think the fundamental point that was being put by the banks and why they support this is that they see that this is the way in which the regulator can become better at doing its own job. I do not say that in a cynical way of better regulating the banks from the banks' point of view. What they appreciated was that ASIC, in particular, needs to not only upskill but also expand its capability in a range of complex financial areas that it regulates. Effectively what the banks are saying is, 'We know government won't give more money to ASIC.' In fact, if we look at the history of this government we see that it took a large chunk of funding out of ASIC only to discover that that was such a bad idea that it had to put some of it back in. It put it in and then it took a very long time for ASIC to get to the point where it was able to hire more staff, fill those roles and expand its capability. But what underlies this is that they are saying, 'We'll fund this because we know there needs to be an expansion; there needs to be better capability in ASIC. We know that they need to be able to expand their cost base and pay for that, and government won't supply that.' This brings me to one problem that I am foreseeing in this legislation. It is not a reason to oppose the legislation, but it is something that government is going to have to think through and work out on a different model. The way this works is that government will allocate a cost base to ASIC and say, 'This is what you are going to be able to spend for the year,' and then that money will be recovered through this levy at the end of each year. That means that the capacity for ASIC to say, 'We need to expand; we need to add some more capability over here; we need to increase our capacity to investigate, enforce or regulate in a particular sector,' without diminishing its capability and capacity in other parts of its role, will require additional upfront funding from government. Even if it can recover that levy subsequently, it will still require a decision of government to fund that additional capability and capacity for ASIC. I know from speaking to other regulators that have similar models where they have to go to government to get an advance decision on being able to expand a capability or capacity that often that is not forthcoming. The idea that what sits behind is that industry has to pay where see the need to expand  capability and capacity in our regulator will not actually exist unless the government makes a decision. That is different to some of the other levy models that are in place in other areas in this sector-I think the NOPSEMA model operates a little differently to the way that is being implemented here for ASIC. I flag that as something for government to be aware of. If part of the idea here is to make sure that you have a regulator that is able to respond to issues in the sectors that it is regulating, its capacity to do that is not being freed up by this legislation necessarily, and that is something that we need to be fully aware of. As I said before, that has to be viewed from the point of view that in the 2014 budget this government actually slashed the funding for ASIC. It took money out of ASIC. Of course, it took a long time. It really took until this opposition made the strong call, which is supported so resoundingly by the Australian community, for there to be a royal commission into the banking sector and highlighted that, time and time again, ASIC as a regulator had failed to be proactive and to pick up on issues which had to be brought forward by whistleblowers coming out of the banks and coming to parliamentary committees and to other inquiries. It was not until then that the government finally tried to bite a bullet and said, 'Okay, we'll put more money back into ASIC.' They said they were putting more money into ASIC, but really all they were doing was restoring the money that had been previously taken away from ASIC by the government. So I highlight this problem with the funding model. Which then brings me back to this: it is excellent that we have a well-functioning, wellfunded, highly capable corporate regulator in this country. That is absolutely necessary. It is especially necessary in a country like Australia where we have such a high proportion of corporatisation of businesses of all sizes. It is especially important when we have such a wide variety of companies incorporated in Australia, from mum and dad businesses and the corner store all the way through to some of our biggest multinational mining companies, our retail sector and our tech sector. All of those different areas need to be regulated by ASIC and, of course, our financial services sector, which are not just regulated as corporates but are regulated for the essential services they provide to our economy. Which brings me, then, to a royal commission into banking. When we talk about the capability and the capacity of ASIC, one thing is fundamentally true here: the regulation of our banking sector is quite diverse and separated across many different regulators. There are some clear strengths in having a separate financial services regulator, consumer regulator and prudential regulator, but what we have seen-especially what we have seen through a number of inquiries that are currently running in this parliament and that have previously run in this parliament-is that the capacity to look behind is not currently sitting in the way our financial services sector, and in particular our banking sector, is operating. What we have not had is the great capability of being able to look at not just whether the law is being broken but also how effective we are at catching that. I can tell you right now, as someone who has worked in the corporate regulatory space, as someone who has worked as a prosecutor in corporate crime, that one of the biggest issues is actually working out whether our law is effective in making sure that these things do not happen, whether our regulators are effective at finding those things when they occur and what the unintended consequences of our law are in the way that it operates and the way that it drives behaviour. So much of the financial services sector and the way that it operates is about looking at what the unintended  consequences of behaviour that is driven by the law as it operates are and what policies are put in place. That brings me fundamentally to culture, and this is where I want to finish. The chairman of ASIC, senior people in ASIC and senior people across all of our regulators have spoken often-and in fact, every banking CEO who has was appeared in front of our banking inquiry, which I am a part of, over the course of the past 12 months has made the point-about culture. But what has fundamentally not been looked into is what the actual culture is. One of the great missings from all of the inquiries that we have had to date in this parliament and in so many other fora has been what is happening at the board level and what is happening at the ground level. Everyone talks about culture coming from the top, and we have heard a lot of talk from the CEOs of banks about culture and the culture that they are instilling in their organisations. But the reality is that the top is above that. The top is the chairman and chairwomen of those boards and the directors of those boards. What is the culture that they are instilling in the senior executives of their banks? And what is the culture that those executives are distilling all the way down through their organisations? The key thing here is this: the capacity of a single parliamentary inquiry, the capacity of a prudential regulator, the capacity of an ABA led inquiry or the capacity of ASIC to look deeply and to think deeply about what the fundamental causes of the problems are that we are seeing and therefore what changes are required-not just in the law and not just in our regulators but in the culture of these organisations-for what does not exist in the existing entities that we have. We need to have a full exploration of all of these issues, because we know from time and time again and from people coming before us is that there are many individuals throughout this nation who have been ripped off badly and that have had a bad experience. They have seen themselves suffer financially and therefore suffer also the mental anguish and mental health issues. In some of the worse experiences people have taken their own lives because of these sorts of activities; we need to be able to get to the bottom of that, but we also need to be able to make sure that we fix it going forward. That will only happen if we have a full exploration of all of these issues-not just the law and not just the regulator but also the culture within these organisations. I commend this legislation. I do, as I said, think there is a problem that government needs to look out for. At the end of the day we cannot just leave all these things to ASIC; we need to have a royal commission into banking as well.",28
8,Mr LAUNDY,BILLS," I rise today to sum up the ASIC Supervisory Cost Recovery Levy Bill 2017. Firstly, I would like to thank those members who have contributed to this debate. This bill continues to deliver on the government's commitment to strengthen the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, ASIC, and to better protect Australian consumers. The government recognises that our financial institutions have not always lived up to the reasonable expectations of all Australians. That is why we are empowering our regulators to take action today, rather than spending three years holding a royal commission into the financial services sector that would provide no practical benefit to everyday Australians but, of course, plenty of benefits to barristers.  Introducing any industry funding model for ASIC will increase the transparency of the regulator. It will make the industry directly accountable for its conduct and it will make ASIC more efficient and proactive as a regulator. It is a critical component of our plan to improve outcomes in the financial services sector and it builds on other measures in the government's comprehensive financial sector program, including the $127.2 million funding package allocated to ASIC in 2016 to ensure that it continues to be the tough cop on the beat. Industry funding will do four main things: firstly, improve equity; secondly, encourage regulatory compliance; thirdly, improve ASIC's resource allocation; and, finally, enhance ASIC's transparency and accountability and, by extension, its performance. Equity between taxpayers will improve because from 2017-18 only those entities which are regulated by ASIC and create the need for that regulation will pay for it rather than the Australian taxpayers, who too often bear the cost of the financial sector's misconduct. There will be greater compliance with regulatory requirements, because industry sectors with good conduct records will require fewer ASIC resources and will face lower regulatory costs than those sectors that continue to pose unacceptable risks to Australian consumers. ASIC will become more efficient, agile and innovative as a result of the collection of new rich data on actual business activity. Coupled with the government's $61.1 million investment in ASIC's analytical capabilities, this data will allow ASIC to better identify emerging risks, prioritise its resources and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. Industry funding will also increase ASIC's transparency. These bills will require ASIC to publicly explain its regulatory priorities, to demonstrate how it will address them and to account for its performance, including the dollars it spends and the regulatory tools it uses. This will encourage ASIC to ensure that it is as efficient as possible whilst boosting investment in performance assessment, as recommended by the ASIC capability review. Finally, to ensure that industry funding delivers on its promise, the bills will grant ASIC powers to enforce the industry funding model, which will provide industry with confidence that everyone is paying their fair share. For entities that are not operating with the correct licence or authorisation, ASIC will be able to impose on those entities the cost recovery levies that would have been payable had the entity been properly licensed. In addition to whatever other enforcement ASIC deems necessary, ASIC will also be empowered to charge penalty interest at 20 per cent per annum and to take appropriate administrative action, including the possible suspension or cancellation of a licence. As demonstrated, these bills deliver on the government's promise to strengthen ASIC and better protect Australian consumers. I commend the bills to the House. Question agreed to.

12,Mr DREYFUS,BILLS," For parents, protecting our children from harm is a duty that goes above and beyond nearly everything else. It should also be a first duty for parliament to make laws that protect children, some of the most vulnerable members of our society, from those who wish to do them harm. Keeping our children safe from predators has never been more challenging. This is because of one thing: the internet. For many parents, trying to monitor what their child is up to online seems nearly impossible. The internet is a vast place and our children learn far quicker than adults do how to navigate it and how to hide what they are doing. It is a world that often seems out of reach. So you can understand the anxiety that many parents have over who their child may be interacting with on the internet and their wish to see laws made by their elected MPs to help provide some protection.  This bill is a reflection of that wish. It has been driven by one parent in particular: Sonya Ryan, whose daughter Carly was let down by the law 10 years ago. Like millions of young Australians, Carly was an avid internet user. In 2006, at the age of 14, Carly started chatting with someone she thought was a 20-year-old musician named Brandon Kane. Tragically, Brandon Kane was not a real person, but one of many alternative identities of 50-year-old Garry Newman, an online sexual predator, who had a complex web of online alter egos that he used to groom underage girls. Carly was the first Australian girl to be murdered by an online predator, in 2007. Newman, who was arrested for Carly's murder while at his computer chatting to another underage girl online, lied about his age to Carly to gain her trust. At the age of just 15, Carly was lured to her death by Newman, and her short life ended in the most horrific way. Carly's mother, Sonya, has since dedicated her life to finding ways to stop this ever happening again. The Carly Ryan Foundation, run by Sonya, has become an effective advocacy organisation for cybersafety, and has online fact sheets and counselling services to reduce the harm of online bullying and predatory behaviour. Sonya Ryan is a great Australian, fighting for the protection of Australian children like her Carly. All Australian parents owe her a debt. The bill that is before the House for debate today is the result of her efforts. Although it has a long name, the Criminal Code Amendment (Protecting Minors Online) Bill 2017, it is known as Carly's law, because it has been brought to parliament in her memory. It seeks to allow police to intervene to stop an online predator at an earlier stage and thus play a greater preventative role. It amends the Criminal Code to insert a new offence for an adult to use a carriage service to prepare or plan to cause harm to, engage in sexual activity with or procure for sexual activity a person under the age of 16. For example, it would cover an older person using social media to masquerade as someone younger in order to convince a child to meet with them with the intent of causing that child physical or mental harm or to engage in sexual activity. In some ways the proposed legislation is similar to existing grooming laws at the state and federal levels, which have helped stop hundreds of online predators from hurting our children. Making new laws which aim to regulate the internet or how it is used is inherently difficult. Nevertheless, it is important that our laws evolved to reflect new online threats. This is what Carly's law is driven by. This is the fifth version of Carly's law that has been introduced to parliament, and it is the only government bill. The other previous four attempts at legislation have been introduced by the Nick Xenophon Team, who are to be commended for their commitment to Sonya Ryan's cause and to this bill. The first bill, the Criminal Code Amendment (Misrepresentation of Age to a Minor) Bill 2010, was introduced in February 2010 and sought to criminalise an older person lying about their age to a person under the age of 18. It was the subject of a report by the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee of the Senate, tabled in June 2010, which recommended that the Senate should not pass the bill. This was for a number of reasons, including the committee's judgement that the bill was a duplication of existing procurement and grooming provisions and was too broad. The bill then lapsed at the end of the 42nd Parliament in September 2010.  The Criminal Code Amendment (Misrepresentation of Age to a Minor) Bill 2013 was then introduced in February 2013 and was the subject of another inquiry by the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, with a report tabled in June 2013. This version of the bill introduced a new element of intent where the misrepresentation of age had to be done with the intention of committing an offence or encouraging a physical meeting. Again, the inquiry recommended that the Senate not pass the bill. This bill then lapsed at the end of the 43rd Parliament in November 2013. In a submission to the inquiry, the Attorney-General's Department argued that there was a danger that non-criminal activity could be caught by the bill, such as an 18-year-old lying about his age to ask a 16-year-old out on a date. The bill was then re-introduced in December 2013 in a substantially similar form to the first version of the 2013 bill. The main difference in that bill was that it dealt with intentional misrepresentation of age to persons less than 16 years of age, rather than 18 years of age in the first version of the bill. This change was made because 16 years is consistent with the age of sexual consent in the majority of Australian states and territories. This bill was the subject of a third inquiry by the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee of the Senate, with a report tabled in August 2015. The inquiry recommended that further consultation be conducted on the bill prior to its consideration by the Senate. That bill lapsed at the 2016 election. The fourth bill, the Criminal Code Amendment (Misrepresentation of Age to a Minor) Bill 2016, was identical to the third version of the bill, and it was introduced by Senator Skye Kakoschke-Moore at the end of last year. In her second reading speech introducing the bill, Senator Kakoschke-Moore stated: New forms of communication mean we need new laws to protect our children … Research conducted by the Office of the Children's eSafety Commissioner showed that teenagers spend 33 hours per week online outside of school … ……… … In cyberspace, we cannot stand by their side as they explore the world. We cannot always set rules and curfews, because our kids can be sitting safe in their rooms even while they are in danger. This bill is an attempt to address some of the techniques used by online predators, so that we can put an additional safeguard in place for our children. The government has now adopted the Nick Xenophon Team's agenda as its own. We are currently presented with the fifth bill, introduced by justice minister Michael Keenan 30 March 2017. It is important to understand the specific measures contained in this latest version of the bill, as there are major differences to its previous versions. It is also very important to note here that every bill, no matter how noble its aim, should be heavily scrutinised to ensure that there are no unintended consequences that would arise from its implementation. Labor absolutely supports the intent of this bill, but it is important to ensure the principles of good law making are upheld and proper scrutiny is undertaken. With any bill, particularly those which involve the criminal law, it is key to ensure two things: first, that any new legislative measure will be properly targeted and effective, and will ensure prosecutions can be made; second, that it does not unintentionally capture activity which is not normally considered criminal.  As mentioned earlier, the most significant part of this bill is an amendment to the Criminal Code to insert a new offence: for an adult to use a carriage service to prepare or plan to cause harm to, engage in sexual activity with, or procure for sexual activity a person under the age of 16. The penalty for this offence is 10 years in prison. This bill is different to existing procurement or grooming offences because it is far broader. It targets preparatory conduct where an offender has not proceeded far enough for the conduct to be captured by those existing offences. For instance, it catches someone who has prepared to communicate with a minor online, even if they have not made any communication, and that is a significant difference from the earlier forms of this bill. It is something that will ensure that it is possible to capture, if you like, broadcast activity on the internet without the need for the prosecution to prove that a particular person has been the target of the communication, let alone has received the communication. The bill also introduces the concept of 'harm' for the first time in the context of online protection for minors, which is defined as both physical and mental harm, whether temporary or permanent. The way in which the bill has been drafted provides that harm does not have to be inflicted for this offence to be committed; the offender must only be shown to be intending or preparing to cause harm. In a submission to the Senate committee, the Law Council of Australia-which invariably does good work in commenting on legislation, particularly amendments to the criminal lawhas noted that the aspects of the bill that I have just mentioned represent a significant departure from the traditions of the criminal law, which should be treated with caution. Socalled preparatory offences are used very, very sparingly in Australian criminal law. At present, the only places in which we see preparatory offences are in the context of terrorism and child sex tourism. The Law Council of Australia has noted in its submission that, in the case of this proposed legislation, the preparatory nature of the offence means that it may be triggered before there is any attempt to cause harm, procure or engage in sexual activity with a person under 16 years of age, and that actual communication with that person is not required. In fact, the offence can occur even before a child is identified by an offender, and that is indeed the element that I mentioned earlier where, unlike earlier versions of the bill, in this form of Carly's Law that is now before the parliament, it will not be necessary in order to establish the offence to show that a particular targeted child has been identified by the offender. The Law Council of Australia states in its submission: This represents an extraordinary extension of criminal liability and there is a real risk that benign or otherwise unobjectionable conduct may be caught by the proposed offence. That is a statement that should be taken into serious consideration when scrutinising this bill. The Law Council of Australia goes on to express further concern about the element of harm introduced in this bill. The Law Council argues that causing harm to a person under the age of 16 is not in and of itself an offence, as defined in the Criminal Code. Therefore, what this bill does is to criminalise preparation for an act which is not of itself criminal conduct. As the Law Council points out, that is a very unusual provision to find in the criminal law-that is, to criminalise the preparation for an act or an attempt to perform an act when the act itself is not criminal conduct-and that is something that obviously will need to be looked at when  this bill is considered further by the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee of the Senate. I can assure Sonya Ryan, the Nick Xenophon Team and the government that Labor absolutely shares the noble aim of this bill to protect young people online. But we have to make sure that we get this right. That is why I am very glad that the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee of the Senate is currently scrutinising this bill and is expected to hold a public hearing before producing a report on 13 June 2017. I do urge the government to take heed of the submissions put to the committee and to consider amending the bill in the Senate if necessary to reflect any committee recommendations. It is important that the proper consultation is done on this bill because we all want to see Sonya's noble aim to stop what happened to Carly ever happening again made a workable reality.",33
13,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, The debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 43. The debate may be resumed at a later hour. NA Coalition Government,37
14,Mr FITZGIBBON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise to provide an update for the Australian people on my attempts to secure a copy of the coalition agreement-a battle which has now moved to the Federal Court, where the Prime Minister is spending tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of dollars of taxpayers' money to pay highly-qualified lawyers to keep the coalition agreement a secret. It is a David and Goliath battle, but the Australian people can be assured that I will continue to take on the Prime Minister in the Federal Court on their behalf. Nothing could be more basic to our democracy, particularly under the Westminster system, where governments are made and unmade in this place-often between two parties. Nothing could be more fundamental than what is in that agreement. The question is: what is the secret? What does the Prime Minister have to hide? What deals did he do with the Deputy Prime Minister in order to form a government and to remain the Prime Minister of this country? Surely, this is information that the Australian community should have access to? I am going to ensure that they do have access to it. The other best-kept secret is: who is using the Deputy Prime Minister's Armidale ministerial office? There has been $300,000 worth of taxpayers' money spent on an office in Armidale which is not used as a ministerial office. It is just another pork barrel by Barnaby Joyce. (Time expired) Forte, Senior Constable Brett",37
15,Dr MCVEIGH,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Today, Toowoomba is in mourning. Early yesterday afternoon we lost one of our finest. Senior Constable Brett Forte was gunned down in the line of duty just east of our city. On behalf of the Parliament of Australia. I pass on our heartfelt and deepest condolences to his family: to his wife, also a serving officer, and their three children. He was a member of a police family. They grieve for their husband, their father and their son. Toowoomba is a peaceful place, and the loss of Brett Forte is being met with dismay, disbelief and grief in our community. Each day our police officers willingly place themselves  in harm's way simply to protect us and to maintain that peace. I have been in contact with Commissioner Ian Stewart and some of Brett's colleagues. I say again today to the fine men and women of the Queensland Police Service: we thank you, each and every one of you. We cherish your commitment and your courage. Senior Constable Brett Forte: our community will stand with your family and we will never forget your bravery. With honour he served. Cambodian-Australian Community",37
16,Mr DREYFUS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Today I join the member for Hotham, Clare O'Neil; the member for Bruce, Julian Hill; the member for Gellibrand, Tim Watts; and the member for Fowler, Chris Hayes, to meet with community leaders from the Cambodian-Australian community, including members of the Cambodian Buddhist Association of Victoria who are with us now in the House. Melbourne's south-east is home to a large Cambodian-Australia community which has contributed so much to our country over the past decades. Australia's vibrant Cambodian community includes thousands of refugees who fled the Khmer Rouge regime and settled in Melbourne, Sydney and elsewhere. The Cambodian community in Australia has lobbied hard for action on human rights around the world, including in their homeland. Human rights abuses and acts of political intimidation and violence in Cambodia have rightly received worldwide condemnation. I add my name to that condemnation. Human rights abuses in Cambodia have been well documented: suppression of free media, the imprisonment of thousands of Cambodians without trial and the torture and murder of Cambodian democracy activists are too common in Cambodia. The recent murder of Dr Kem Ley, an icon of the pro-democracy movement in Cambodia has, like many murders in that country, passed without any one of influence being held accountable. As a regional power, and as a force for good in our region, the Australian government must take it upon itself to encourage the Hun Sen regime to commit to democratic reform and human rights. And I can assure the Cambodian-Australian community that Labor is committed to taking such action. (Time expired) Goldstein Electorate: Olivier, Ms Emma Mr TIM WILSON (Goldstein) (13:34): Today we celebrate the achievements of yet another wonderful woman of Goldstein-Hampton's own, Emma Olivier. Emma is the first woman with one arm to pass the Bronze Medal and serve as a lifesaver during Black Rock Life Saving Club's summer patrol. I met Emma last year on my visit to the club. In particular, I saw their need to redevelop their facilities as part of this important community institution. At the time, Emma was preparing for the Bronze Medal test. Since then, the 46-year-old has trained in running and swimming throughout the week, learnt CPR, learnt how to use a defibrillator, learnt how to treat injuries and even learnt how to use a trusty radio as a communication tool. Emma has demonstrated that the challenges life has presented to her do not act as a barrier to her achievement. She wanted to prove to herself that she could do this but she also did it to set an example to others. In a recent newspaper article she was quoted as saying: 'There might be a kid out there who is like me who goes, ""Well, actually I never thought that I could do this, and maybe I can.""' Emma understands that, for so many young people, 'you cannot be  what you cannot see'. But, even with that saying, there is always someone out there who has to be a trailblazer-and that is you, Emma. On behalf of the entire parliament I would like to say how proud of her we are. Brand Electorate: National Broadband Network Ms MADELEINE KING (Brand) (13:36): For many months now, my electorate office has been contacted by residents living in Baldivis and Port Kennedy-in particular, the Long Beach Estate and Kennedy Bay. It is a beautiful community-some would say idyllic-near a beautiful coastline and some of the best beaches in Australia. But not only that: being only 40 minutes south of the CBD, in the city of Rockingham, these residents also benefit from the conveniences of modern metropolitan living-that is, apart from the convenience of modern and accessible telecommunications. You see, unfortunately for the residents living, working and studying in these communities, there are no ports available to connect them to the local exchange. The internet infrastructure is abysmal. This means slow internet speeds, connection dropouts or non-existent internet connections. And there is no end in sight. The NBN is not expected to be in Port Kennedy until at least the second half of 2018. This government's farcical rollout of the NBN is so abysmal it is making international headlines. The New York Times, no less, has documented in all its ineptitude the Turnbull Liberal government's diabolical bungling of the rollout of high-speed internet in this country. It is what this country wants, and needs, to be competitive on the international stage. Instead, all we get are international headlines, embarrassingly, because we lag in an essential area of modern life and commerce-high internet speeds. I call on this government to do its job-or at very least try. Have a go at delivering a working NBN. (Time expired) La Trobe Electorate: Infrastructure",38
17,Mr WOOD,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise to speak on the progress-or, sadly, the lack of progress-of the Monash Freeway. Back in April 2016, Prime Minister Turnbull came up with a $1 billion plan to fix the Monash Freeway. That included $500 million of federal funding but also required state Labor to commit $500 million. So far, we have seen only stage 1 work being undertaken between the Clyde Road and the South Gippsland Highway. There is now $500 million of federal funding which has not been spent and is now in Labor coffers in Victoria. In the recent state budget, they have only committed $2.5 million for a business plan. It is a disgrace that work has not started on the Beaconsfield exchange. It is a disgrace that work has not started on O'Shea's Road. It is a disgrace that work has not started on the Warragul section or on Cardinia Road. Enough is enough. People are sick and tired of being stuck in traffic. We have the intention of creating a great pathway for innovation and also advanced manufacturing, yet nothing is happening because the Beaconsfield exchange has not commenced. I call on the Premier and state and federal Labor members to get involved and get behind this. Suicide Prevention: Plebs, Pros and Personalities",39
18,Mr THISTLETHWAITE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Last weekend I was pleased to once again take part in the Plebs, Pros and Personalities 24-hour treadmill run to raise money for suicide prevention. The event, which was hosted in our community, at Maroubra Surf Club, started in 2013 after a group of locals mourning the loss of another mate decided that, in  a community renowned for toughness, something needed to be done to break through the stigma surrounding depression and suicide. Four years later, the event has spread to all corners of the nation, with sites in Perth, Queensland-and I congratulate the member for Rankin, who took part in the run up there-South Australia, the Central Coast, Melbourne and Sydney, both at Maroubra and on the Northern Beaches. At our local sites, six treadmills operated throughout the night, with celebrities and local heroes including Shannan Pontin, Mario Fenech, the Rabbitohs' Adam Reynolds and Ironwoman Tara Coleman, all pounding the plastic to raise money for this worthy cause. I am pleased to say that nationwide, after the 24-hour event, $80,000 had been raised, and the money continues to roll in. I would like to thank the team of volunteers at a local level who put in a great effort, including Katherine Stewart and Ben Higgs from the Rise Foundation. Thanks to Vision Personal Training, the Maritime Union of Australia, F45, PRDnationwide and the Dreamtime Academy for their support. Congratulations and thank you to everyone who took part in this important event. Berowra Electorate: Glenorie Bakery",39
19,Mr LEESER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Tomorrow night is the first match in the State of Origin, but it is also the beginning of the more important grudge match that is the Pie of Origin competition between New South Wales and Queensland, a battle of bakers that will see rampaging Rob Pirina from Glenorie Bakery in my electorate take on meaty Mark Hobbs of Beefy's Pies on the Sunshine Coast, in the electorate of the member for Fisher. The scoreboard is currently New South Wales 3, Queensland 2. Glenorie Bakery has been consistently voted one of the best bakeries in the country and was a triple medallist at this year's Royal Easter Show. One dollar from every pie sold during the Pie of Origin will go to charity. And this year Rob Pirina is donating money from pies sold at Glenorie Bakery to the Westmead Children's Palliative Care Fund. Rob lost his nephew, Charles Sciberras, to a rare degenerative disorder, and that palliative care unit at the Westmead kids' hospital was particularly good. This year my friend the member for Fisher is also representing his state in the match-up. And I note that Blues player Peter Wallace has been ruled out of round 1 because of injury. Perhaps the member for Fisher should also consider sidelining himself, to avoid a bruising of his ego when our side wins! Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time to get down to Glenorie Bakery and buy yourself, your family, your whole team a Pie of Origin pie for this great cause. Support your state, support your mates, get a pie on your plate-and go the Blues! Hotham Electorate: Cambodian Community Ms O'NEIL (Hotham) (13:42): I want to welcome to our parliament a large delegation of Cambodian community and religious leaders, including some Venerables from temples around Australia. Welcome to our parliament. It is a huge privilege to represent so many of you in this House. I will say a few words in Khmer first. [Khmer language not transcribed]. To those of you here, I will say that we have had a number of incredibly important meetings today. We have with us in the gallery today people who have fled the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia and who have made a life in my community, in the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne.  But what they see when they look back to Cambodia is, unfortunately, a regime that has regressed. We have heard today about some awful repressive practices that have come backa ban on campaigning during elections, an opposition party that has been thrown into exile. We have seen violence against members of parliament, violence against people in the community. And these leaders have told us today that what they want from this parliament is for us to stand up and say something about these problems. I will say to you in the gallery that we on the Labor side of politics are so concerned with what we hear, and we will continue to speak out-not to clink glasses with Hun Sen but to be out there protecting your rights and trying to restore democracy in Cambodia. Thank you for being here. (Time expired) Fisher Electorate: Beefy's Pies",40
20,Mr WALLACE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise today to respond to the challenge by the member for Berowra. As State of Origin and Pie of Origin grip both his state and the great state of Queensland, I accept the challenge on behalf of Beefy's Pies on the Sunshine Coast. I would just like to point out that whilst the scorecard reads three to New South Wales and two to Queensland, you are only as good as your last game, and Queensland has won the last two Pie of Origins and we are now going for three in a row. Every dollar from every pie sold by Beefy's will be donated to the Lady Cilento Hospital in Brisbane, another great outcome. Beefy's Pies' owner, Mark Hobbs, knows just how important it is to support Lady Cilento, as his son benefited from being in the ICU there. Whichever bakery sells the greatest number of pies will win this challenge. Last year, Beefy's Pies raised $17,000 and this year they are trying for $20,000. It is mate against mate and state against state. Just as Queensland continues to wipe the floor with New South Wales on the football field, so too will we do with this Pie of Origin. Sunshine Coast locals can buy their pies at Aussie World, Buderim, Cannon Hill, Glasshouse Mountains, Gympie, Mango Hill, Ningi, North Lakes and Maroochydore. (Time expired) Cambodia",41
21,Mr HAYES,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Like the member for Hotham, I would like to welcome representatives of the Australian Cambodian communities to the House today and Venerables from the various temples in Victoria and New South Wales. Cambodia has had a tragic past. They suffered the regime of Pol Pot-a murderous regime many of the Cambodians that live in this country are refugees from. They have made themselves model Australian citizens. Certainly, young people have been well represented throughout our professions. They are great members of our community. They believe passionately in democracy, freedom and human rights. That is why the Cambodian community is here today. They see what is occurring in Cambodia. They see an administration where the police and security are subject to the direct control of the ruling government in Cambodia, an electoral commission that is under government control and the number of political prisoners growing. The tragic part of this is that Australia is a country that supports the development of Cambodian trade. We actually give significant amounts of aid to Cambodia. Our aid should be tied to tangible improvements in human rights and certainly the immediate release of all political prisoners in Cambodia.  I also thank my colleague the member for Hotham for facilitating today's meeting. I think there was a very good exchange of views. I do hope the government takes heed of the request to show some leadership, particularly in our region- (Time expired) Watts On Our Minds",41
22,Mr ANDREWS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Readers of Melbourne's Herald Sun newspaper may have noticed a story two Sundays ago headed 'Boys lose both parents'. This story relayed the tragic circumstances of two young boys in my electorate, 10-year-old Dylan and 13-year-old Connor, who lost both of their parents within 10 weeks of each other this year. Their father, Jason Watts, died of B cell lymphoma, aged just 45. Ten weeks previously, their mother, Julie, had died of breast cancer, aged just 47. This is a tragic event for these children. Jason was a major in the Australian Defence Force. In fact, I understand that he served at the Australian Defence Force Academy with my colleague across the chamber the member for Solomon. He was a major. He served in East Timor and in Papua New Guinea. There is an appeal for the family-for these two young boys. I encourage anybody who can to find their way to make a donation to this appeal. It will be very well received. The website is wattsonourminds.com. I commend it to anybody who happens to be listening to this broadcast today. Solomon Electorate: United States Marine Corps",42
23,Mr GOSLING,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I would just like to thank the member for Menzies for supporting that great initiative. I was fortunate yesterday and today to have a good chat with Senator John MCCain. As this House would be aware, in Darwin we have a great relationship with the US Marines there, being almost 2,000. Also, back in World War II, Australian and American sailors, soldiers and airmen fought side by side when Darwin was bombed. Senator MCCain also likes rugby, so he was happy to hear that we are organising in the near future a rugby game between the US Marines and Darwin's own 1st Brigade. We are going to have marching bands, anthems, hotdogs, popcorn, cheerleaders, fireworksAn honourable member interjecting",42
24,Mr GOSLING,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"and pies-why not? I commend Rugby NT and the Darwin Basketball Association. There is going to be a US Marines versus Darwin basketball game as well. So it is going to be a great day. It was also with great pleasure that I told Senator MCCain that, as we speak, today, US Marines are digging out of the sand the propellers of a World War II combat veteran patrol boat, the Rushcutter. Members may have heard me speaking about it before. With the Royal Australian Navy, the US Marines are helping us save the Rushcutter, and I want to thank them very much. Chisholm Electorate",42
25,Ms BANKS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I am so proud to rise today to discuss the people of Chisholm, who are dedicated and committed to our community. First, I would like to recognise dynamic volunteer Margaret Taylor, who is the chairperson of the Amaroo Neighbourhood Centre. Margaret is one of those Australians who passionately and genuinely cares for their community and action proactive and constructive initiatives. For example,  Margaret did a fantastic job in setting up and coordinating a crime and safety community open forum, where members of the Chisholm community could voice their concerns about local safety and rising crime rates and then have experts provide expert advice. The forum was held in conjunction with Victoria Police, where the community audience heard the expert advice from Monash Crime Prevention Officer James Egan and Senior Sergeant Peter Arnold from the Mt Waverley Police Station. I have also had the pleasure of meeting Graeme Hanson, director of Box Hill South Neighbourhood Watch, and Judith Clancy, Gwenda Smythe and Brett Smart from Neighbourhood Watch. Their passionate and genuine work for the community always goes above and beyond. With Judith's amazing baking and organisational skills, I had the pleasure of attending a morning tea which was organised as part of the Biggest Morning Tea program, designed to raise funds for medical research. Such goodwill and good spirit is constantly at play in the heart of Chisholm morning, noon and night thanks to the wonderful people who care for our community and their fellow Australians. Eqypt: Coptic Christians",42
26,Mr KHALIL,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I am a Copt, a migrant from Egypt. The Copts in Egypt today are under siege and are attacked relentlessly by Islamic State. So I have a question for the coalition government and Minister Dutton: why is he forcibly sending back 20 Coptic families, asylum seekers, back to Egypt when the whole world can see that Islamic State and their affiliates have made the Copts their primary target over the past 12 months? Time and time again, horrific terrorist attacks have been inflicted on the Copts. A suicide bombing at a Cairo church during Christmas killed 29 people. The entire Coptic population had to flee en masse from the Sinai town of el Arish in February. Two suicide bombings during Palm Sunday services killed 46 people. And just this past weekend, a busload of Copts, mostly children, were attacked by Islamic State gunmen and shot at point-blank range while they were driving to St Samuel's Monastery. The Turnbull government has callously and cruelly turned a blind eye to the plight of Coptic Christians. Worse; they are forcing Coptic families who have come to Australia seeking protection back into harm's way. These families have been told that their applications 'do not meet the minister's guidelines'. I have kept quiet about this until now, because I wanted to give the government every chance to do the right thing, and I did not want to prejudice these cases. But now is the time to speak. Minister Dutton, do the right thing. Reconsider the cases of these families that have fled terror and have sought asylum in Australia. Mallee Electorate: Education Funding",43
27,Mr BROAD,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise to clear up the confusion in the electorate of Mallee that seems to be propagated by the Australian Education Union. The 119 schools and the 23,069 students of Mallee are all going to be better off under the education funding that we announced in the budget. This is a great initiative. It is fantastic. If you talk to these schools you see that they are a bit confused about what is going on, and I wanted to clear this up for them: St Brigid's College, Horsham-better off; St Patrick's College, Stawell-better off; St Patrick's College, Nhill-better off; Red Cliff's-better off; Horsham Secondary College better off; Mildura Christian College-better off. Every one of the 119 schools are going to be better off. We have funded the things that we are going to deliver. The three words that you should always say to members of parliament are: 'Yes, but how?' 'How are you going to pay for it?' In contrast, Labor are making lots of big statements but have not allocated how they are going to pay for anything. We have money on the table to pay for these education reforms and ensuring that every school in Mallee is better off. Labor have not learnt. Labor still see the money of every Australian as a credit card. Instead of putting money aside to pay for things, they want to rack it up onto your bill, and your children and grandchildren will pay for it in the future. People with Disabilities",43
28,Ms BRODTMANN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," People with disabilities are a marginalised group in Australia. People with disabilities are 29 per cent less likely to take part in the workforce, 2½ times more likely to experience poverty, have lower levels of education, and experience stigma and stereotyping, and isolation and social exclusion. And they experience violence-in all its shapes and forms, such as withholding essential disability aids or supports, being pushed out of wheelchairs, being left stranded and defenceless in their own homes, having their fears or paranoia incited, being left in uncomfortable or humiliating situations, being the victim of chemical or physical restraint, and being subject to sexual violence. Seventy per cent of women with disabilities have experienced sexual violence; 90 per cent of women with intellectual disabilities have experienced rape or sexual assault; and 25 per cent of rapes are against women with disabilities. In Canberra, 46 percent of women who reported violence were women with disabilities. I commend the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow ministers for committing a Shorten Labor government to a royal commission into violence and abuse against people with disability. I call on the Turnbull government to begin work to establish a royal commission immediately, because the countless harrowing accounts of people with disability being abused and assaulted cannot be ignored. (Time expired) Immaculate Heart of St Mary Catholic Primary School",44
29,Mr BROADBENT,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," The Immaculate Heart of Mary Catholic Primary School in Newborough has been completely rebuilt, taking it from a 1950s Catholic primary school to a 21st century learning space. It is absolutely fantastic. There to open the new building were my favourite bishop for Gippsland, Patrick O'Regan; Ms Maria Kirkwood, director at the Catholic Education Office; and Father Harry Dyer, a favourite priest in the area. The deputy principal, Ms Kerry Wadey, led the choir, which sang so beautifully. It is fantastic to see the way in which the Catholic Education Office has revamped the old Newborough school. What is the greatest gift we can give our children? It is an education. The Catholic Education Office said to the community, 'Our kids are so important that we are prepared to invest in this new resource-this beautifully revamped, rejuvenated building.' The entranceway to the brand-new building at the front is a sight to behold. Of course, we had a magnificent afternoon tea, which only the ladies of St Mary's could provide.  Egypt: Coptic Christians",44
30,Mr HUSIC,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise to join with many others in expressing disgust at the targeting of Coptic Christians in a horrific attack last Friday. With many children among the victims, gunmen struck at three vehicles travelling in convoy, containing many worshippers, heading to the Monastery of St Samuel, home to about 100 monks. The death toll stands at 30 people. It is one of the deadliest attacks on Egyptian Christians in recent history. Unfortunately, it was not the first attack on Egypt's Copts this year. On Palm Sunday, two Cairo churches were bombed. During those twin assaults at least 45 people were killed and over 100 were injured. Such conduct is simply unacceptable and is condemned in the strongest terms. We will always condemn all acts of terrorism and violence. Nothing should restrict one's peaceful expression of one's religious beliefs. My heart goes out to all the families of those affected by this attack. My thoughts are also with Australia's Coptic community. I want to mention my support for His Grace Bishop Daniel, the head of the New South Wales and affiliated regions Coptic Orthodox Church. There is a strong and highly valued Coptic Christian presence in the Chifley electorate, and the prayers of many local residents go out to all of you during this difficult time. Finally, I would like to throw my support behind the call made by the member for Wills and urge the government to reconsider their decision to return 20 Coptic families back to Egypt. This decision must be reversed. Wright Electorate: Scenic Rim Eat Local Week",45
31,Mr BUCHHOLZ,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," All members of the House would know quite well that all politics is local, and there is nothing more local and significant in my electorate than Eat Local Week in the Scenic Rim, hosted by the Scenic Rim Regional Council. Eat Local Week starts on 24 June and goes through to 2 July. It is hosted in the most iconic rolling hills of my electorate and is home to no fewer than 90 different eating and culinary activities, ranging from cooking classes with some of the top chefs in the country to farm tours through Kalfresh-and you should see the look on little kids' faces when they are in the paddock and discover that, at the bottom of this weedy looking thing, when you pull it out of rich black soil, there is a carrot, and that that is where their food comes from, and then when we take them through robotic dairies; it is such an eye-opener for them. This is a great way for us to showcase our region and to show the world and the region some of the product that comes out of our backyard. There are long lunches at O'Reilly's vineyard, degustation dinners at Kooroomba Vineyard and tastings at Rathlogan Olive Grove, and of course we have got a couple of distilleries where you can often blow a couple of hours away of an afternoon just as you are swinging by! Eat Local Week is now in its seventh year of celebration of the growers, producers and businesses who make up such an important and significant proportion of the Scenic Rim. Ladies and gentlemen of Australia, if you were lying in bed last night wondering, 'What's the best time to come to the Scenic Rim?' the answer is: 'Now!'",45
32,The SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"In accordance with standing order 43, the time for members' statements has concluded.  NA Pauline Hanson's One Nation",45
33,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. When there have been legal questions surrounding the actions of senators, such as former Senators Day and Culleton, or of former ministers, some of whom are still in the parliament, the Prime Minister has referred the matters to the appropriate legal or administrative authority. Why has the government taken no such action in response to serious allegations involving Senator Pauline Hanson, including allegations about inflating invoices, conspiring to conceal the donation of an aircraft and breaching electoral laws?",46
34,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," The honourable member's colleague the member for Isaacs asked about these matters last week, and they are being investigated or reviewed by the Australian Federal Police, and that has been confirmed to me by the Federal Police Commissioner. So the matter is in hand. That has been confirmed to me by the Minister for Justice. The matter is in hand. And the Australian Federal Police should be allowed to do their work independently. I recall some eloquent speeches from the Leader of the Opposition about the independence of the Australian Federal Police and how government should not attempt to influence it. The matter is in hand. The police are investigating it, and they should be allowed to do their work. Schools",46
35,Mr LITTLEPROUD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister update the House on how the government is delivering record schools funding that is fair, transparent, needs based and nationally consistent? Is the Prime Minister aware of any threats to this approach?",46
36,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the honourable member for his question, and I can say that-because of the government's commitment to fair, national, consistent, needs based funding for schools across Australia-in the honourable member's electorate of Maranoa, schools will receive an additional $391 million over the next decade. Last night, this House passed the legislation",46
37,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,46
38,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"that moves Australia one step closer to finally delivering the fair, transparent and nationally consistent funding model that David Gonski recommended. Honourable members opposite call, 'Shame!' Well, they should be ashamed! They should be ashamed for their hypocrisy, their inconsistency and their dishonesty. For how many years did they preach about Gonski funding? 'Do you give a Gonski?' they said. Well, the answer was: they did not. They corrupted the Gonski funding model, as Ken Boston, Gonski's co-author, described it. Under our changes, over the next decade, schools will not only be $18.6 billion better off, but they will finally be funded based on need and, within the decade, the federal government will provide 80 per cent of the Schooling Resource Standard for non-government schools and 20 per cent of the Schooling Resource Standard for government schools. Ms Plibersek: Why? ",46
39,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am so glad the honourable member for Sydney has spoken up. Why indeed! Why indeed is the honourable member for Sydney unable to count? She said this morning that thousands of Catholic schools are going to lose out under our model-there are only 1,700 Catholic schools in the whole country! She is drawing one long bow after another, unable to defend any element of her inconsistency. She twisted and turned, tying herself into a tighter and tighter knot, in what must have been one of the more memorable train wreck interviews that the honourable member has engaged in. The first thing you need to know for a school funding model is how many schools there are, just like it is important to know the difference between a continent and a country when you get into foreign policy. All of these things are fundamental threshold points that I would encourage the honourable member to pursue. We are not pursuing 27 secret deals-there is one consistent, national, needs based funding model. We are not going to be distracted by the opposition's baseless scare campaigns, contradicted by the Catholic education authorities, not the least of which was the Archdiocese of Brisbane, which confirmed to the parents of their students that school funding from the federal government will increase and they thank the federal government for that commitment. (Time expired) Pauline Hanson's One Nation",47
40,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. In question time on 15 February the Prime Minister defended preferencing One Nation with these words: … parties will reach preference deals in order to maximise their chances of success. Does the Prime Minister stand by the answer he gave in question time that day and, if so, how can this still reflect the position of the government given today's allegations and their implications for the required probity between members of parliament and the Australian Electoral Commission? When will the government depart from that answer and stop pretending that One Nation is the same as any other political party?",47
41,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I can understand why the opposition does not want to ask any questions about schools or the NDIS or Medicare; I can understand why they are not interested in asking questions about energy or the budget. They are only interested in politics. The answer I gave back in February, to which the honourable member refers, was a penetrating glimpse of the obvious-just as penetrating and just as obvious as the fact that the AFP should be allowed to get on with their job, free from political interference. Schools",47
42,Mr VASTA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for the Environment and Energy representing the Minister for Education and Training. Will the minister inform the House how the government's needs based funding model will provide the greatest funding increases to the most disadvantaged students in schools in Brisbane, like the St Agnes school in Mount Gravatt and Rochedale State School, Rochedale, both in my electorate of Bonner? Is the minister aware of the Queensland government's record on funding public schools, and is the minister aware of any other approaches?",47
43,Mr FRYDENBERG,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Bonner for his question. I know that he is deeply committed to the  Turnbull government's massive boost to school funding throughout this country-$18.6 billion, a 75 per cent increase; more than 9,000 schools will benefit. There are 45 schools in the electorate of Bonner, with 27,000 students, and they will benefit from the Turnbull government's announcement-like the Rochedale school, with more than 1,300 students, which will get an extra $11 million, and like the St Agnes Catholic Primary School, with more than 300 students, which will get a significant funding boost of more than $4 million. I am asked about funding by the Queensland government for public schools in that state. The most recent Productivity Commission report provides telling reading, because it says that the Queensland government has increased funding for public schools by only 2.1 per cent. Commonwealth funding for Queensland public schools during the same time has increased by 9.5 per cent-a complete contrast. I am asked about alternative approaches. We know that the Leader of the Opposition claimed that Catholic schools will face fee increases. The member for Sydney went even further: she said that there will be fee increases and schools will close. So, what does the executive director of the Brisbane Catholic Education Office say when she writes to all her parents? I quote-listen closely: 'We will receive an increase in government funding, not a reduction. We thank the federal government for its continuing support and its commitment to providing fair and equitable funding for the next decade.'",47
44,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,48
45,Mr FRYDENBERG,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"'Hear, hear' says the coalition's front bench and back bench, because we know that we are increasing funding significantly to more than 9,000 schools. So I say to the member for Sydney, go and say to the schools across your electorate that under the Turnbull government's plan they will receive, on average, $2.5 million more. And in the electorate of the member for Maribyrnong, do you know how much more the average school will receive under the Turnbull government? $7.5 million. Over $7 million!

46,Mr SHORTEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister.

48,Mr SHORTEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Last night every member of the government voted not once, not twice but six times, in the House, for cuts to school funding-a cut which, according to this document from the Prime Minister's own office, means that $22 billion will be ripped away from schools over the next 10 years. Prime Minister, how is it fair that your government is cutting $22 billion from schools at the same time as you are giving $65 billion to big business in tax cuts? ",48
49,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," How is it fair that honourable members have to have such an exercise in hypocrisy and cant inflicted on them? This is the Leader of the Opposition who said again and again, 75 times, that needs based funding was a commitment of the Labor Party, and the Liberals and the Nationals had abandoned it. Again and again he went on about needs based funding. That is exactly what we have delivered. He said, 'Labor is absolutely committed to the Gonski needs based funding formula. We believe fundamentally that needs based funding will give our children across Australia the best start in life.' The fact is that they corrupted the Gonski vision. We are delivering the Gonski model of needs based funding as David Gonski and his panel recommended, consistent and transparent across Australia. More importantly than anything, we do not need the endorsement of the Leader of the Opposition, because he swings from one side of the fence to the other. We have David Gonski's endorsement. David Gonski stood up with the education minister and me and confirmed that the policy that we were presenting, the $18.6 billion of additional funding over a decade, the needs based formula that was being applied to every school in Australia, regardless of what state it was in and whether it was a government school or a nongovernment school-David Gonski confirmed that fulfilled the recommendations he had made. He confirmed need based funding, fair, equitable, right across the country, additional funding for every school-and, as the minister confirmed a moment ago, not least the schools in the Leader of the Opposition's electorate. The Leader of the Opposition's nonsense-his hypocrisy, his inconsistency, his secret deals-have run out of credibility. The time has come for Labor to honour and live up to the rhetoric it has been mounting for years and years, and to back the Gonski needs based funding formula that my government is delivering. Mining",49
50,Mr BANDT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. Up to 70,000 jobs depend on a healthy reef. But, according to a transcript on your website, on 11 April this year you justified tipping $1 billion of public money into the ticking Adani time bomb by stating that it 'will create tens of thousands of jobs'. Yesterday your energy minister said the figure was, '4,000 direct jobs and up to 8,000 indirect jobs'. Adani itself has said that it wants to automate the project from mine to port, and its own expert witness said in court that 'around 1,464 direct and indirect jobs will be created'. Knowing that there are penalties for deliberately misleading the House, are you prepared right now to repeat your false claim that the Adani project will create tens of thousands of jobs?",49
51,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the honourable member for his question. It gives me cause to ask this: does the Greens party believe, with their friends in the Labor Party, that Queenslanders should not have jobs? Or do they believe that Indians should not have electricity? Because the reality is this: India is going to need four times as much electricity between now and 2033, and they are going to generate that from many means-from renewables, from gas, from coal. They are going to use more coal in absolute terms for many years. And, if they do not import it from Australia, they will import it from somewhere else. So for all of his sanctimony, for all of his empathy, the reality is this: the people of India are entitled to have the electricity they need; they are entitled to deliver it in the manner they  deem appropriate. They will burn coal less in proportionate terms over the future but more in absolute terms for many years.

NA Budget",49
52,Mr COLEMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer outline to the House how the government is acting to make our financial and taxation systems fairer and more accountable? Is the Treasurer aware of any alternative approaches?,50
53,Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Banks for his question and for his leadership of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, which has done such an excellent job in raising the many issues that were addressed in this year's budget when it comes to saying yes to protecting the interests of Australian consumers in our banking and financial system. The government in the budget announced a new banking executive accountability regime. This regime will introduce stronger powers for our regulators to disqualify senior banking executives and directors who do the wrong thing by their shareholders and by their customers. The new powers will enable the regulator to deregister senior banking executives who have been found to be not doing the right thing within banks, and to prevent them from going from bank to bank inflicting the same sort of havoc on their customers and shareholders. This is an important process that ensures integrity in our banking and financial system. We are increasing the penalties to ensure that banks are following through on monitoring the suitability of their executives and their behaviour in their banks. Where they fail to do so, they can face penalties of up to $200 million-genuine, real fines impacting on ensuring an accountable banking regime. We want our banks to be unquestionably strong but we want our banks to be unquestionably accountable to ensure that we can have integrity in this system. It has served us well, but we must always be vigilant when it comes to the integrity of our banking and financial system, so bonuses can be clawed back and so senior executives cannot profit from where they do the wrong thing by their customers and the wrong thing by their shareholders. When the Labor Party were in office, they did no such thing. They stood silent as we saw crisis after crisis in that system. They would not even support the Liberal Party's and the National Party's call for a financial systems inquiry when they were in government. They said 'no' to acting on banking executive accountability when they were in government. But this government has said 'yes' to ensure that we do act on these issues. But, also, they said 'no' when it came to acting on multinationals paying their fair share of tax. When they were in government they did absolutely, and when they were in opposition they voted against the government's multinational anti-avoidance taxation laws. The deputy commissioner has said  today that the multinational anti-avoidance laws was the game changer when it came to ensuring that multinationals fundamentally changed how they were accounting for income in this country and making sure they paid their fair share of tax. The deputy commissioner said the MAAL, the multinational anti-avoidance legislation, settled the issue. The Labor Party said 'no' to these laws. They said 'no' to acting on banking and executive accountability in government and they just keep saying 'no'. (Time expired) Schools",50
54,Mr KHALIL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. Last night, every member of the government, including the member for Chisholm, voted six times to push through a $22 billion cut to schools. Prime Minister, how is it fair that over the next two years $600,000 will be cut from the Aurora School for deaf and deafblind children in Chisholm while Geelong Grammar gets a funding increase? How is that fair, Prime Minister?",51
55,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the honourable member for his question. What he knows full well is that the school funding model that we have presented, and which was passed through the House last night, is an achievement which we are very proud. What it does is set up now the prospect of, for the first time, David Gonski's vision of transparent, consistent, needs based school funding being delivered.",51
56,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,51
57,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They call out 'needs based'. Well, it is needs based because it is based on the schooling resource standard, which is adjusted for non-government schools on the basis of the school community's ability to pay, using the socio-economic standard which has been used by governments for many years, both Labor and Liberal governments. That has been as consistent as recommended by David Gonski and as utilised by the Labor Party itself. The difference between our model and what Labor had is that they had 27 secret deals. The same student in the same school, were that school in one system or another, or one state or another, could get dramatically different funding. No consistency, no transparency, no equity, not needs based, only based on the political emergency of the Gillard government, desperately wanting to collect a few signatures for their 27 secret deals. National Disability Insurance Scheme",51
58,Ms LANDRY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Social Services. Will the minister update the House on the government's commitment to the rollout of the National Disability Insurance Scheme in Queensland, especially in my electorate of Capricornia? How is the government ensuring the National Disability Insurance Scheme is fully funded? And is the minister aware of any alternatives?  question and also for her advocacy on behalf of NDIS applicants in her electorate. As the member knows, we now have over 80,000 people in the scheme and the Commonwealth and Queensland governments have very recently agreed to bring forward the start date in the next three NDIS regions in Queensland. That means state disability clients in Ipswich, Bundaberg and Rockhampton will have earlier access to the scheme. This change makes the most of unused capacity in the bilateral agreement. It also brings Queensland clients into the scheme sooner, which also means we can grow the provider market by generating demand and creating jobs.  Very importantly, this budget includes the 0.5 per cent increase in the Medicare levy from 1 July 2019, which will once and for all ensure the scheme is fully funded. I am asked about alternative approaches. Labor's approach is to oppose this very fair increase in the Medicare levy and thereby oppose fully funding the NDIS. The question arises: why on earth would they adopt this position? As of last night, we can now see three reasons why Labor opposed filling the funding gap by the very measure they have long argued was fair. First, Labor say there is no funding gap. Second, they say there are better ways to fund the NDIS-that is, better ways to fill the funding gap that they also say does not exist! Third, last night, from the member for Ballarat, we had this absolute gem of a reason why they will not fill the funding gap: 'The funding gap was actually created by the coalition'! Let's all have a think about this. The funding gap that Labor sometimes says does not exist, Labor now says does exist but was caused by the coalition. When asked on Lateline last night whether Labor had double counted savings, the member for Ballarat responded: 'The NDIS was fully funded by Labor. This coalition government took the savings for the NDIS and spent them on something else.' Consider the Labor savings from private health insurance. The Labor savings from private health insurance were first announced on 22 October 2012. They were originally spent on Labor's dental healthcare reform package. They were also spent on budget repair and much, much later they were spent on the NDIS. And now the member for Ballarat says that we spent them a fourth time-on something un-nominated. Member for Ballarat, the reason that we have not created this gap and the gap exists is the same reason we cannot spend it four times, the same reason you cannot spend it twice and the same reason you cannot spend it three times. So get the tinfoil hat off, get off the grassy knoll and pay for the NDIS.

62,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Last night the member for Chifley together with his colleagues voted to do their very best to prevent the 60 schools in the electorate of Chifley from getting an average of $7.6 million each in additional funding from the government. That is what he voted for-an utter failure!  What he has done is see the opportunity to support additional funding based on need for the schools in his electorate and, for pure political reasons, vote against it. He knows, as every member of the opposition knows full well, that the needs-based funding they talked about for years but failed to deliver is now being delivered by my government. They should stop the games, stop the politics and vote for it. They should support the Gonski vision of needs-based funding across the nation-transparent and fair. They should stop all the exaggerations-like the member for Sydney talking about thousands of Catholic schools losing funding when there are only 1,728 in the whole nation. When the Catholic Archdiocese of Brisbane's very sensible letter thanking the government for increasing funding to their schools and assuring parents that our policy would not cause them to increase fees was pointed out, she dismissed it and said they only had a little more than 100 schools in their electorate. The administrators, the managers, of the Catholic school system in Brisbane know a lot more about their schools' situation than the member for Sydney. They know that, every year over the next decade, their schools and the Catholic systems right across the country are getting more funding and that they will be able to provide more education and more services to their students. The same loadings for disability and for disadvantage will continue. The funding will be based on need, as it should, consistent with the Gonski vision which Labor once trumpeted and now betrays.

It is also incredibly important that we understand some of the misnomers that are peddled around. Misnomers such as it being on the Great Barrier Reef have to be dealt with.

Justice  MCMurdo, of the Queensland Supreme Court, said that if the Carmichael mine proceeded it would not increase the amount of global greenhouse gases or any environment impact resulting from those gases. There would be the same or greater harm if the mine did not proceed. What we need from the Australian Labor Party is support for coal miners. It was disappointing last night to hear the member for Shortland saying, to quote from the Hansard: The truth is that our power station fleet is very old. He then went on to say: The replacement is very unlikely to be new coal-fired power. That is saying something to the people of the Hunter Valley. When are you going to stand up for the coalminers of the Hunter Valley? When are you going to start believing in the miners of the Hunter Valley? When are you going to stand up for them? When are you going to change the policy of your party and stand behind the Carmichael mine? Stand by the Carmichael mine so that the Labor Party can once more start standing up for blue-collar workers. They can start standing up for blue-collar workers, start believing in blue-collar workers, rather than believing in Balmain. Balmain is fine! Coffee shops are fine! But coal mines are all right too. We stand behind coal mines and we look forward to the Australian Labor Party and the former head of the AWU, who turns his back on coalminers-and the camera is fair and square on the back of your head as we speak!-turning around and start believing in their core constituency.

Or there is the other alternative Leader of the Opposition-the one who is leading in the polls with 30.7 per cent-the member for Sydney, who gave up that foreign affairs portfolio to get closer to the action only to be gazumped by the education minister when it came to schools funding! In her electorate of Sydney, as a result of the Turnbull government's policies 40 schools will get an average of $2.5 million each. And the list goes on. But the reality is that the member for Sydney went on this morning in what the Prime Minister said was a train wreck of an interview on AM. She was confronted with the comments from the Archdiocese of Brisbane, which said, 'We thank the Turnbull government for the work that they have done on education-increased funding, no decreases in fees.' And what did the member for Sydney say? 'Oh, they only represent 140 schools.' So suddenly, the Archdiocese representing 140 schools does not count. But, really, when it comes to those opposite",55

83,Mr FRYDENBERG,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. The message is clear to the member for Richmond that schools in her electorate will benefit greatly, just as they will in the member for Sydney's electorate and the member for Maribyrnong's electorate. When the Labor Party talk about increased funding for schools, we know that they do not fund it. And we know that it is funny money, because the member for Sydney said, 'We will replace every cent of that $22 billion,' and the final word goes to the member for Port Adelaide, because he said, 'Well, it's not going to be $22 billion necessarily.' So not only are they denying the constituents of  their own electorates more funding under the Turnbull government's plan; they do not even know how much of that they will be providing to schools across Australia. Small Business Mr TED O'BRIEN (Fairfax) (14:40): My question is to the Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment. Will the minister update the House on how the government's small business tax cuts are supporting exporters in my electorate to grow and employ more hard working Australians? Are there any alternative approaches to this policy?",55
84,Mr CIOBO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Fairfax for his question. Like those on this side of the House, he understands that you must have a national economic plan that is about making Australia's smalland medium-sized businesses more competitive. He also understands what the coalition has been focused on about opening up more trade export opportunities for Australian smallto medium-sized businesses. On the tax enterprise plan, we were very pleased, as part of the Turnbull coalition government, to put through the first tranche of tax cuts, because we on this side of the House believe that we should do everything we can to make Australia's smalland medium-sized enterprises as competitive as they can be. That is why, as a result of our tax enterprise plan, businesses with a turnover of less than $50 million will ultimately have their tax rate cut to 25 per cent. This is an important step alongside opening up export markets for all Australian businesses that are keen to grow exports or to move into exports, because, fundamentally, that drives economic growth and drives jobs. One of the key export beneficiaries that we have seen is in fact a business in the member's electorate-Buderim Ginger. Buderim Ginger have been enjoying increased export success as a direct consequence of this government's export policies. This is a business that is taking advantage of those increased export opportunities by further investment. Buderim Ginger recently acquired a Victorian bottling factory to help grow their exports of ginger beer and cordial to export into China. But there is a small hitch: Buderim Ginger have a turnover of more than $50 million and, although they employ 400 Australians in their business, under Labor's plans, they will be denied a tax cut that will enable them to keep growing their business and enable them to be more competitive. When the member asks whether there are alternative plans, our side would say, 'What alternative would you sensibly put forward for a tax cut?' But Labor has an alternative. Labor's alternative is to increase taxes. The Leader of the Opposition is actively promoting a policy to increase taxes on Australia's smalland medium-sized business. That is Labor's plan: to increase taxes. The fundamental problem with Labor's approach is this: they are a policy-free vacuum when it comes to a way to take this nation forward. This Leader of the Opposition stands for absolutely nothing. Four years ago he argued for tax cuts for small businesses; now he argues against them. Four years ago he said that the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement was a dud deal. The simple fact is that Labor cannot be trusted on trade policy, they cannot be trusted on lower taxes and they certainly cannot be trusted to create the right business conditions for stronger economic growth and more jobs for Australians.  Schools",56
85,Ms PLIBERSEK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. Wasn't Stephen Elder, the executive director of Catholic Education Melbourne, absolutely correct when he told Alan Jones this morning: … a small parish primary school that is opposite housing commission flats, where parents are making sacrifices to send their kids to this school ... 10 per cent of the kids are on healthcare cards … they are sayingthe governmentthat it is richer than Geelong Grammar. That is how flawed this system is.",57
86,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," The remarks you referred to are not correct; they are wrong. And they are wrong for a number of reasons, but I will cite Catholic Education from the Archdiocese of Brisbane, which makes this point that applies across Australia. All federal funding for Catholic schools, under our model, is calculated on a per-school basis, consistent with other non-government schools, the purpose being to deliver on David Gonski's vision of ensuring that school funding is needs based and consistent so that a non-government school in the same location with the same students will get the same funding, whether Catholic or Anglican or any other denomination. That is the vision. But the funding is provided, as the archdiocese observes and as the gentleman you referred to knows very well, to the Catholic system in a lump sum, and they can distribute it as they wish and explain how they distribute it. The government is being thoroughly transparent in how it calculates the funding on a transparent, consistent needs basis, using the same SES criteria that have been used by federal governments, both Labor and Liberal, for many, many years. The honourable member knows that, and she is betraying the principles she has claimed to adhere to for many years. She can twist and turn as much as she likes. She can tie herself into tighter and tighter knots on the ABC if she wishes. But she cannot escape the fact that everything she argued for, every principle she said she stood for, she has abandoned; every skerrick of commitment she gave to needs based funding has been thrown away for political gain. Child Sexual Abuse",57
87,Ms PRICE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Will the minister update the House on what steps the government is taking to stop child sex offenders from travelling overseas? Ms JULIE BISHOP (Curtin-Minister for Foreign Affairs) (14:47): I thank the member for Durack for her question, which reflects the growing community concern across Australia about this very serious issue. Today the Minister for Justice and I announced that the Turnbull government will introduce legislation to prevent registered child sex offenders from travelling overseas while they have reporting obligations to authorities in Australia. This new legislation represents the toughest crackdown on child sex tourism by any government anywhere as we are determined to prevent the sexual exploitation of vulnerable young children overseas. On the request of a competent relevant authority-and that will include state and territory law enforcement agencies-I will have the power to cancel, to refuse to issue or to order the surrender of a passport of a person who is on the registered child sex offence list. It is called the Australian National Child Offender Register, otherwise known as the national paedophile  register. This legislation will also create a new offence for a registered child sex offender, who will not be able to travel overseas without the permission of a relevant competent authority. In 2016 alone, almost 800 Australian registered child sex offenders travelled overseas. About 50 per cent of them went to South-East Asia, where child sex tourism is rife and sexual exploitation of children is far too commonplace. About 50 per cent of them were already recorded by police as representing a medium, high or very high risk of re-offending. Many of them had been convicted for sex offences against children under the age of 13. Many of them had travelled overseas in direct breach of their reporting obligations to relevant state and territory authorities. These measures will apply to Australians registered on the national paedophile list while ever their name remains on that list and while ever they have reporting obligations to Australian authorities. About 3,200 Australians are on that register for life because of the heinous nature of their crimes and, therefore, the passport ban will apply for life. The Turnbull government are determined to protect vulnerable young children overseas and do all we can to work with state and territory authorities to ensure that Australian children are also safe from sexual exploitation and child predators. I urge the parliament to support this legislation.",57
88,Mr SHORTEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Mr Speaker, on indulgence: the opposition want to make very clear that we are very supportive of what the foreign minister has said.

95,Mr DUTTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is fair point, Mr Speaker. Mr Speaker, the Turnbull government, as you know and as every member in this place knows, is taking significant action to strengthen our citizenship laws, because, like any other country in the developed world, we want to make sure that people whom we welcome as Australian citizens are the best people that can become Australian citizens. The fact is that Australian citizenship is an absolutely extraordinary privilege. Obtaining citizenship should be more than just passing an administrative process or a test at a point in time. Aspiring Australians should demonstrate their commitment to Australian values. It has been five weeks since the government made this announcement, yet we have still not heard from the Leader of the Opposition as to what his position would be in relation to this fundamental change in government policy. Mr Speaker, what has become evident over the course of the last five weeks is that, on a fundamental issue, you would have thought the Labor Party could unite, but they have not. What is evident is that, just like their boat policy, we can see on this policy that the Left and the Right of the Labor Party are completely divided.

96,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member Gellibrand is warned!,59
97,Mr DUTTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"might have a very different opinion from the member for Maribyrnong when it comes to these very important issues. It is very telling that the Leader of the Opposition does not have the guts or the ability to bring his members into line. But if people are saying to themselves, 'I don't understand what this Leader of the Opposition stands for; I don't understand whether he believes in A or B,' you only have to look at his history; you only have to have a look at his background to know that, when he was a union leader, he said one thing to workers and something very different-in fact, the complete opposite-to bosses. He was involved in deals which ripped workers off and, at the same time, he was telling workers that he was doing the right thing for them. When he was a minister in the Gillard government, what did he do as employment minister? He went on national TV and radio and said he was fighting for Australian workers. What happened? He was bringing in 457 workers, foreign workers, to fill those Australian jobs, and in record numbers! That is what this Leader of the Opposition did. He has ripped off and betrayed every person in his public adult life, and this is the latest demonstration of a core sign of this Leader of the Opposition's character. He needs to state his position. Is he in favour of the citizenship changes or is he not? (Time expired)",59

100,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat. The Leader of the Opposition has the call. Medicare,60
101,Mr SHORTEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. This health department indexation schedule reveals that his Medicare freeze stays until 2020 for Medicare item No. 160. Prime Minister, item No. 160 covers prolonged consultations for patients, especially in remote areas far away from hospitals, who are-and I quote from the Medicare Benefits Schedule-'in imminent danger of death'. Is the Prime Minister seriously keeping his freeze on the Medicare rebate for patients who are in imminent danger of death to 2020? Please reconsider! (Time expired)",60
102,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," The Medicare freeze to which the Leader of the Opposition refers is his Medicare freeze. It is Labor's Medicare freeze. Labor imposed the Medicare freeze, and they know it. We are lifting it. We are lifting it progressively, as we said in the budget. We are managing the healthcare programs of the government with a responsibility, a compassion and a commitment that sees more funding, more taxpayers' dollars being spent on Medicare, on the PBS and on hospitals every single year. And one of the things we are spending more on and doing more on is listing more lifesaving drugs on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. During the course of this government, we have listed 1,400 new drugs. In the last three years of the Labor government, they listed 330. That was the difference. They rationed the PBS. They did not list life-saving drugs, when they could have and they should have; we do-big difference. This makes a huge difference to the lives of thousands of Australians. Let me tell the House about one of them.",60
103,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister will resume his seat. The Leader of the Opposition on a point of order.,60
104,Mr Shorten,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Direct relevance, Mr Speaker: I asked a very specific question about Medicare item No. 160. I asked specifically, 'Why are you freezing it to 2020 when it affects patients who are in imminent danger of death?' And I specifically asked him to reconsider this cruel decision.",60
105,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. The Prime Minister has the call. I am listening to the Prime Minister carefully.,60
106,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I am talking about the commitment to managing the finances of our health system so that we can list drugs on the PBS. One of the patients who have benefited from this is Alexandra from Townsville. At 31 years of age, she was diagnosed with non-small-cell lung cancer. At the time, the best treatment available was chemo and radiotherapy, and she had to fly to Melbourne for the treatment. As the mother of a two-year-old son, this had a huge impact on her life. When her cancer recurred, a new treatment option was available: Crizotinib, a new drug listed on the PBS on 1 July 2015. Alexandra started on it in October 2015. Her scans have been clear since. This is what she says",60
107,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,61
108,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition and I think the member for Isaacs are interjecting following the point of order that was made on relevance. I am listening to the Prime Minister very closely. I should not have to repeat after every point of order that if the minister or the Prime Minister is on the policy topic they are being relevant to the question. They may not be answering the question in the way members would like, and I can understand members' frustration, but I am not going to endure an appeal mechanism through interjections on points of order.",61
109,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Alexandra says: 'I'm living a normal life like I don't have cancer. I'm an active mum to my seven-year-old son. I'm working and riding my horses. I don't have to travel to Melbourne for treatment. I'm taking one tablet, morning and night, with basically no side-effects. This is not a cure, but what is important is my quality of life which I have now and that I do not have to worry about finding $8,000 a month for treatment now it has been listed on the PBS.' I am proud that my government is making a difference for Alexandra and thousands of other Australians. (Time expired) Defence Industry",61
110,Ms HENDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Defence Industry. Will the minister outline to the House how the government's investment in defence industry will generate thousands of jobs for hard working Australians, create a stronger economy and ensure our national security? How will Victoria benefit from the largest military build-up in our peacetime history?  thank the member for Corangamite for her question. I can tell her that Victoria is one of the most significant states in the nation in terms of defence industry. It has one of the largest slices of defence business in the country-300 businesses employing 7,000 Australians. Of course the government's $200 billion expansion of our military capability over the next 10 years will add to the investments that those business make, creating jobs for Victorians, and increase infrastructure spending in Victoria, so driving the Victorian economy. There are businesses like Chemring in the member for Corangamite's electorate, down at Lara, which makes flares for the Hornet and for the Super Hornet, and it has just won a contract to provide flares for the Joint Strike Fighter-a $250 million contract leading to the employment of 55 Victorians. Ninety per cent of those flares will be exported. There is Marand Precision Engineering in the south-east of Melbourne, not far from the member for Chisholm's electorate. They recently estimated that their value from the Joint Strike Fighter program will be a billion dollars-a billion dollars to that business, supporting 150 jobs. These decisions are being made because of the investments of this government in defence and defence industry. Thales Australia, in Bendigo-a business I visited not long ago-is building 1,100 Hawkei protected vehicles under a contract worth $1.3 billion, providing 170 jobs. The Turnbull government, in the Defence white paper, committed to $3.1 billion in the defence estate in Victoria alone. We will be upgrading the bases in Victoria-bases like the one at East Sale, in the electorate of the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, the member for Gippsland. All of this investment is driving capability, creating jobs that are high-value, hightechnology manufacturing jobs. The Turnbull government is delivering on that part of our  economy-a part of the economy that Labor utterly abandoned. Under Labor the level of spending on defence as a percentage of GDP was the lowest since 1938-1.56 per cent-and yet they have the hide to try to interject on me. They reduced spending on defence; they saw it as a cash cow they could rip money off and put it into other parts of the budget. This government has committed to defence and defence industry. I see my friends from Western Australia here. Western Australia is another big winner from the government's massive increase in capability, whether it is the offshore patrol vessels, the Pacific patrol boats, or the HMAS Stirling upgrade. The list is endless-all because this government is in power. (Time expired) Banking and Financial Services",61
111,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Treasurer. The leaking of the bank tax on budget day saw billions of dollars wiped off the stock market. Is the Treasurer aware that the secretary of the Treasury told Senate estimates about the leak, saying: 'I have seen nothing in the time. I have been secretary to make me think it came from the Treasury.'? The secretary of the Treasury is satisfied the leak did not come from the just five Treasury officials who knew about the bank tax. Can the Treasurer categorically rule out that the leak came from him or his office?",62
112,Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Of course it did not, and I resent the implication from the shadow Treasurer, who comes into this place every single day and, on the one opportunity he has to ask a question, once again, he is raising his objections to the bank tax-so offended is he that this government has actually decided to do something about the banking system in this country. First of all, we put in place the Financial Systems Inquiry-something that he opposed when he was the Treasurer. Then we moved beyond that and we have introduced a new Banking Executive Accountability Regime. We are dealing with the challenges in our banking system of ensuring that the consumers of banks can actually get their cases heard, with the establishment of a new one-stop shop when it comes to our banking system where customers of banks who have issues with banks can actually get their cases heard and they can have binding resolutions to them. But do we get questions from the shadow Treasurer on consumers' interests in banks, or do we just get the banker's parrot coming in here and making a galah of himself? Infrastructure Mr TIM WILSON (Goldstein) (15:06): My question is to the Minister for Urban Infrastructure. Will the minister update the House on the government's $75 billion infrastructure investment that was announced in the budget? How will this investment program deliver major projects around the country, including in my home, the great state of Victoria, and are there any alternative approaches?",62
113,Mr FLETCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Goldstein, who is a very fierce champion for infrastructure, for his electorate and for his great state of Victoria, because he knows about the economic benefits that infrastructure delivers. He knows about the benefits of a commitment of over $1 billion of infrastructure for Victoria, including $500 million for regional rail, $100 million for the Geelong rail line and $100 million for the North East rail line. The member for Goldstein knows full well that Melbourne presently does not have a direct rail link from the city to the airport, unlike Sydney, which has a direct rail link from the city to the airport; Brisbane,  which has a direct rail link from the city to the airport; and Perth, where a direct rail link from the city to the airport is under construction. That is why the member for Goldstein supports the Turnbull government's commitment of $30 million of funding for a business case for this vitally needed link. And, of course, the member for Goldstein supports the other important elements of the Turnbull government infrastructure commitments: more than $500 million for the Western Highway, $200 million for the Tullamarine Freeway widening, and, of course, the $3 billion Victorian infrastructure package, funded fifty-fifty by the Commonwealth and Victorian governments, which was agreed in November last year and which includes a $1 billion upgrade for the Monash Freeway to benefit the people of south-eastern Melbourne. I am asked if there are alternative approaches. Indeed, there are alternative approaches. There used to be a land called Conrovia, a land in which economic reality did not apply. But, Mr Speaker, I must tell you, there are many such lands on the other side of the chamber. There is a land called Albonia where ordinary rules of economic reality do not apply, where you can stand up and claim that $400 million is sufficient to build a rail link from Leppington to Western Sydney Airport, when the transport minister in New South Wales in 2015, the first time this was announced, said, 'No, no-much more likely to be $4 billion.' Albonia is a land where every major piece of infrastructure-the Three Gorges Dam, the Hoover Dam, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, the Eiffel Tower, the pyramids, Mount Rushmore, the Channel Tunnel-is the personal responsibility of the member for Grayndler. Why is he not getting the credit that he deserves? Albonia is a special land a land where economic reality does not apply. But on this side, I can tell you, economic reality does apply. We are delivering infrastructure for the people of Australia.",62
114,Mr Turnbull,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.,63
115,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Manager of Opposition Business?,63
116,Mr Burke,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I want to apologise to the member for Chisholm, who I referred to when I was trying to table a document-in error, and no wonder the Leader of the House said no to tabling. Could I have a go at tabling the transcript of what was said about Adani by the member for Corangamite? Leave not granted. NA Commonwealth Ombudsman Presentation The SPEAKER (15:10): I present the Commonwealth Ombudsman's report for 2015-16 on the Commonwealth Ombudsman's activities under part 5 of the Australian Federal Police Act 1979. Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.  NA Speaker's Panel The SPEAKER (15:11): Pursuant to standing order 17(a), I lay on the table my warrant revoking the nomination of the honourable member for MCMillan to be a member of the Speaker's panel. NA Infrastructure The SPEAKER (15:11): I have received a letter from the honourable member for Grayndler proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The Government's failure to plan for the future by investing in nation building infrastructure. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",63
117,Mr ALBANESE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," I will give the member for Bradfield credit for one thing: chutzpah! Coming in here, when Victoria is getting 8c in every dollar of the national infrastructure budget, when it got zero dollars this year, zero next year, zero the year after, zero the year after that and zero the year after that, right through to 2021, in this budget, he comes in here and speaks about Victorian infrastructure. Of course this is a budget which cuts $1.6 billion from infrastructure investment this year. In last year's budget they said it would be $9.2 billion; instead it is $7.6 billion, but after that it falls off the cliff: It is cut of $7.4 billion in actual infrastructure investment over the forward estimates, down to $4.2 billion. This is what the peak industry body, Infrastructure Partnerships Australia, say: 'The budget confirms the cuts to the real budget for capital funding to its lowest level in more than a decade, using a mix of underspend, reprofiling and narrative to cover this substantial drop in real capital expenditure.' There is no new money in the budget-just cuts: cuts to road funding, cuts to the Black Spots Program, cuts to the Bridges Renewal Program, cuts to the Bruce Highway, cuts to the Pacific Highway. The fact is that this budget is a con. One of the biggest cons is their so called national rail fund. This is a budget where they have tried to get the areas where they were behind Labor off the agenda, but when you look at the actual substance, it is not there. They know they have a problem on public transport-the fact that they cut public transport funding from every project that was not under construction. So what they said was, 'We'll create this $10 billion national rail fund.' It sounds great, except when you look at the detail. Zero dollars this year; zero dollars next year; zero dollars the year after that; and $200 million the year after that. Not a single dollar between now and the next election. Two years ago they created the NAIF. Zero dollars has gone out of the NAIF. It has just paid for the members of the board to float around and have meetings. In this budget they created another NAIF-the No Actual Infrastructure Fund. That is what they created in this budget, because there is only one new project in this entire budget over the forward estimates: the Far North Collector Road near Nowra-$13.8 million.  The local paper, the South Coast Register, said in their editorial that they had not even heard of this road. The government failed to fund the Nowra bridge-not a dollar. Have a look at the Cross River Rail project. It was approved by Infrastructure Australia in 2012 and funded in 2013. Last night I did an interview on a television program with a fellow called Campbell Newman-he used to be the Premier of Queensland. I said last night, 'We were ready to go.' Campbell Newman said: 'Well, we were actually. I think the history of it is pretty accurate.' It was ready to go way back when it was approved in 2012. It was funded in 2013 and it was cut in 2014. Now, all these years afterwards, those opposite say, 'We still need more information.' Well, here it is-a letter from Scott Emerson, Minister for Transport and Main Roads, signed on 30 April 2013. He was a minister in the Campbell Newman government. He said that he was writing to seek confirmation of the funding principles and that the project would be delivered through an 'availability payment Public Private Partnership'. The letter states: … construction period (2013/14 to 2019/20) … The contribution is estimated to be in the order of $715M each; - the Australian and Queensland Governments will fund the availability payment stream for the PPP component of the project on a 50:50 basis … - the Queensland Government will fund rail operating expenses for the Project; and - the project will be delivered through a PPP commercial vehicle and financed by private sector equity and debt. It was ready to go. I seek leave to table that letter from Minister Emerson. Leave not granted.",64
118,Mr ALBANESE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"They do not want to see the details of where it was ready to go. No wonder they are embarrassed by the fact that projects that were ready to go were stopped by the government. Years later, they are still prevaricating. Let us have a look at Inland Rail. They had a little committee, chaired by John Anderson, which said this: Hence a substantial public funding contribution is required to deliver Inland Rail. So how is it that they are contributing to this project $8.3 billion of equity? You can only deliver equity injections rather than actual cash funding if a project is going to produce a return. Their own documents say it will not produce a return to capital in more than 50 years. So this is a fix by those opposite that is just embarrassing, because it does not stack up. When we asked about this in Senate estimates last week, the secretary of the department indicated that the rate of returns on equity were for the ARTC, the Australian Rail Track Corporation, as a whole rather than for the Inland Rail project. So they are going to take the fact that the coal lines in particular in the Hunter Valley produce a return for the ARTC and roll that in and pretend the Inland Rail can be funded without a dollar contribution, because there is no cash contribution from those opposite. Then they reduce the costs by having an inland rail line that does not go anywhere, because it stops 38 kilometres short of the port. You are going to have these double-decker trains with two lots of containers stacked on them that are then going to be put on trucks to go through the most congested areas of the suburbs of Brisbane-just like the Perth Freight Link stopped three kilometres short of Fremantle port  and the WestConnex project goes nowhere near the Port of Botany, which was the original idea of Infrastructure New South Wales under Nick Greiner. The fact is that the government simply cannot get any infrastructure projects right. They have done all this with the idea of good debt, bad debt. The rhetoric in the lead-up to the budget was designed to create a smokescreen for the fact that they were actually going to cut funding. That is why they have established this so-called infrastructure financing unit in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. This is what the peak industry body have to say about that: We cannot identify any currently proposed infrastructure projects which are commercially viable and not already attracting finance; therefore we cannot see how the IFU will increase the pace of infrastructure project delivery; … Indeed, this is a solution looking for a problem, because there is not a lack of capital available in this country. We have almost $2 trillion in superannuation funds. We have private capital, from here and overseas, that is interested in investing in nation-building infrastructure. If you actually fund Infrastructure Australia properly-and get the projects right and establish the pipeline of projects-capital is available. But what this government has done is gut Infrastructure Australia and side-line it, establishing its own little unit in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. It is not nation building; this is empire building by those opposite-and by the Prime Minister in particular. If you look at the details of the budget, you will see that there is no new money for cities, no new money for public transport, no new money for major road projects-no vision whatsoever from those opposite. The fact that you had Campbell Newman there last night conceding the fact that the reason the Cross River Rail Project is not now almost completed is because of the attitude of the former Prime Minister that is being carried on by the current Prime Minister. It is all rhetoric and no substance. (Time expired)",65
119,Mr FLETCHER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," The shadow minister began by accusing me of having 'chutzpah', that fine Yiddish word. That really is a remarkable example of the pot calling the kettle black, if I may say so. He had the temerity to lecture the government about the consistency of our treatment of the WestConnex project, and this is the man who in 2014 was proudly beating his chest and claiming credit for having funded WestConnex with $1.8 billion. Let's remind ourselves what he said to Ellen Fanning on the ABC. He said: Well that's not right Ellen. Take WestConnex for example, we funded the work in terms of planning. $25 million was already spent from us and $1.8 billion was included in last year's budget for the WestConnex project. So in 2014 the shadow minister proudly claimed credit for WestConnex. But by 2016 he could not run away from it fast enough. In 2016 Fran Kelly asked him: 'Did you provide that money?'-that is, money to fund WestConnex. His answer was: We provided $25 million for planning, Fran, that's the whole point. They say they support planning, we provided $25 million, not for construction, not a dollar, did we provide for construction. If that is not a world-class, olympic-grade backflip, you will never see one in this House-and you do see them from time to time. That is a remarkable backflip from the man who has just presumed to lecture the government about consistency when it comes to infrastructure.  Let's look at the facts. The proposition before the House this afternoon is that the government, in the words of the shadow minister, 'has allegedly failed to plan for the future by investing in nation-building infrastructure'. Let's just have a look at what was in the budget that has just been brought down: $8.4 billion for the inland rail project, a transformational freight rail project that will bring together our three eastern seaboard states, Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland. It will equip exporters in each of those states to better address export markets. There could be no better definition of a nation-building project. This is a project that by definition no one state government can ever carry forward. If there was ever a project that required the leadership, the commitment and the direction of a national government, it is inland rail. This is an $8.4 billion commitment designed to increase, markedly, the share of the freight market taken by the rail mode on the north-south corridor. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you know, on the east-west corridor-Perth to Melbourne and Perth to Sydney-rail takes the lion's share of freight. On the north-south corridor rail has the capacity to do the same, but you need to have a reliable, 24-hour end-to-end journey time. Inland Rail will deliver it and will transform the way freight is moved up and down the eastern seaboard between those two critical markets of Brisbane and Melbourne. This is nation-building infrastructure. The deeply misguided premise of the matter before House this afternoon is that in some way there has been a failure to address nation-building infrastructure. Let me take another example: $5.3 billion in equity investment for Western Sydney Airport. For 40 years governments have failed to take a decision which has been crying out to be taken. It took a coalition government to make the decision to commit to proceed with a second Sydney airport at Badgerys Creek. Let's remember that Sydney is Australia's international aviation gateway; 40 per cent of international traffic comes into Sydney. Let's also remember that the joint study into the aviation needs of Sydney which reported in 2012, commissioned under the previous government-I want acknowledge the work of the shadow minister, who was then the minister, in commissioning that study-found that Kingsford Smith Airport would run out of slots by 2027 and that by the mid-to-late 2030s there would be no additional capacity, even with so-called upguaging by replacing smaller aircraft with larger aircraft in existing slots. So it is critical for the aviation capacity of Sydney and of the nation that we build this piece of vital nation-building infrastructure. It will deliver better service for people in Western Sydney. Some two million people will be closer to Western Sydney Airport than to Kingsford Smith. It will deliver some 20,000 direct and indirect jobs by the early 2030s. Deputy Speaker, you could not find an example of nationbuilding infrastructure more clear than Inland Rail and Western Sydney Airport. What about the package we have committed to in Western Australia? There is some $2.3 billion jointly between the Commonwealth and the MCGowan government. There is a $792 million commitment to rail for projects like the extension of the rail to Yanchep and the Thornlie to Cockburn line, subject to satisfactory business cases being assessed by Infrastructure Australia. There is major funding for road projects. In Victoria there is over $1 billion, including $500 million for regional rail and $30 million for a business case for a rail link between Melbourne and the Tullamarine airport. There is rail from Sydney to Sydney Airport, there is rail from Brisbane to Brisbane Airport and there is rail being built from Perth to Perth Airport. Yet Melbourne, this enormous, critical city does  not have a rail link between the city and the airport. We want to fix that and that is why we have committed $30 million for a business case for planning on this. We want to work to deliver. We want to work with all of the stakeholders to take this critical issue forward. Around Australia a wide range of infrastructure projects is underway. A $3 billion package was announced in November last year of fifty-fifty funding from the Commonwealth and the Victorian government for infrastructure in Victoria, including a $1 billion package to upgrade the Monash. In South Australia there is a $1.6 billion investment in the north-south corridor. There is the $3.6 billion Western Sydney Infrastructure Plan. The new M12 will connect Western Sydney Airport to the M7 and to the Sydney motorway network. The Northern Road is being upgraded to four lanes all the way. This is vital infrastructure to support and to leverage Western Sydney Airport. Mr Deputy Speaker, you cannot help noticing that there is a strong focus on rail in this budget. There is new funding for rail projects. I have talked about the $792 million for the Yanchep extension and the Thornlie to Cockburn line in Perth, subject to satisfactory business cases being assessed by Infrastructure Australia. I have talked about $500 million for regional rail in Victoria. Of course, that builds on an impressive track record of rail projects already funded by the Turnbull government. There is $490 million for the Perth to Forrestfield Airport rail link. There is the Flinders Link project in South Australia, for $43 million. The Sydney Metro City and South-west, this transformational metro rail project, is $1.7 billion. That will be a 'turn up and go' service every five minutes with driverless trains-a transformational approach to rail. In Queensland, we have committed $10 million for business planning for the Cross River Rail project. In this budget, we have included the $10 billion National Rail Program, with funding to flow from 2019-20. This is designed to support the major city-shaping rail projects around the country which are at various stages of development. We heard the various speaking points-the standard talking points-from the shadow minister. He made a series of disappointingly false and inaccurate claims about infrastructure spending. The facts are very straightforward. Over the period of the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government, Commonwealth spending on infrastructure averaged just over $6 billion per year. Between 2013-14 and 2020-21, the average is $8.1 billion. Compare and contrast: under Rudd-Gillard-Rudd, just over $6 billion; under the coalition, $8.1 billion. You are seeing from the coalition, from the Turnbull government, a strong commitment to infrastructure, infrastructure planning, infrastructure investment and nation-building transformational projects like Inland Rail and Western Sydney Airport. We are proud of these commitments. These are significant. These are major commitments about delivering infrastructure that the people of Australia need.",66
120,Mr CONROY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE, What a pathetic performance from the junior minister for infrastructure. It is clear that they have hidden the senior minister. He cannot even get a question up most days in question time. Opposition members: Who is it?,68
121,Mr CONROY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Who is it? I think he has gone back to Gippsland. But I would suggest that after that performance they need to hide the junior minister, as well. He questioned our facts. Well, let us quote from Infrastructure Partnerships Australia. They are no friend of Labor;  they claim to be balanced. This is what they said about this budget. 'Foremost, the budget confirms the cut to real budgeted capital funding to its lowest level in more than a decade, using a mix of underspend, reprofiling and a narrative to cover the substantial drop in real capital expenditure.' There you have it. It is not from a Labor mouthpiece. It is from Infrastructure Partnerships Australia, saying this budget cuts infrastructure funding to well below the decade average. That is a real pity because infrastructure is critical to our economic future and our quality of life. It is critical to our economic productivity and growing this economy. Unfortunately, this budget is all smoke and mirrors. It is the equivalent of the Prime Minister-it is all talk and no action, massive expectations and zero delivery. In fact, in the current financial year they have cut funding by $1.6 billion. In the last budget, they were supposed to spend $9.2 billion. They have only been able to spend $7.6 billion. What is worse is that it falls to $4.2 billion in 2021. That is a great disgrace. In fact, the only new on-budget infrastructure investment is $14 million for a project that not even the locals have heard of, as the shadow minister alluded to. Not even the locals knew of the project which is the single new on-budget expenditure from the government. There is no new money for urban rail. The government's $10 billion National Rail Program delivers nothing before the next election, when this mob will be turfed out. They have again dudded Victoria and they have dudded the Hunter Valley, which I will get to in a minute. They have sidelined Infrastructure Australia and created an infrastructure financing unit, which not even Infrastructure Partnerships Australia can see the point to. To fund it, they have cut $17 million out of real road and rail budgets. They have cut funding to announce a new bureaucratic unit in the Prime Minister's department. Clearly, it is their version of The Hollowmen. The truth is: this mob just loves announcements-so much so that the previous infrastructure minister spent $3,000 on props and $2,000 on high-vis vests and hard hats. So God knows what the senior minister does when he comes out of hiding.",68
122,Unknown,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Honourable members interjecting,69
123,Mr CONROY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Maybe he will invest in some Nescafe as! The truth is: this budget is all smoke and mirrors on infrastructure, just like the Prime Minister.",69
124,Mr Watts,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,It's Nespresso!,69
125,Mr CONROY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am reminded it is Nespresso. I am too down market for the senior infrastructure minister. This budget is all smoke and mirrors, just like the Prime Minister-a Prime Minister who, when he knifed the member for Warringah in the back and became Prime Minister, announced that he wanted to be the infrastructure Prime Minister. It was his big claim. He wanted to be the infrastructure Prime Minister. Guess how many times he has mentioned 'infrastructure' in the House since he became the infrastructure Prime Minister? How many times? A hundred? Ms Macklin: No.",69
126,Mr CONROY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Fifty?,69
127,Mr Albanese,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,No. Mr Brian Mitchell: Two. ,69
128,Mr CONROY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Two! We have a win over there. The member for Lyons is right. He has mentioned it twice since he has become the infrastructure Prime Minister.,70
129,Mr Albanese,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,His attack on me doesn't count!,70
130,Mr CONROY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Exactly. What else has he mentioned twice in this parliament? He has mentioned Cristal champagne twice. He has mentioned 'luxury' twice and he has mentioned 'wine', 'rugby' and 'cafes' three times. This is the quality of the contribution of the infrastructure Prime Minister. We have an infrastructure Prime Minister who does not talk about infrastructure. We have an infrastructure cabinet minister who does not even turn up to question time anymore. We have a junior infrastructure minister who folds his dixer answers into tiny pieces of paper in his exercise of origami. They deliver freight announcements like Freight Link, Inland Rail and WestConnex that do not even connect the ports. They have devoted money to the East West Link, which, for every dollar of public investment, delivered an 80c return",70
131,Mr Albanese,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Forty-five.,70
132,Mr CONROY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is 45c. I am corrected by the shadow minister. This is the quality of this government. All smoke and mirrors-zero delivery. It has a budget that cuts $7.6 billion compared to the forward estimates average for infrastructure investment. The great pity is that infrastructure is critical to our economic future, it is critical to our quality of life, but this mob just want announcements where they can turn up in their high visibility vests and get a headline. (Time expired)",70
133,Mr DRUM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," It is always great to get a lecture from the Labor Party on infrastructure. Where I come from in Victoria we had to put up with a Labor premier there, who stood on the corner of one of the main streets and just threw away $100 bills until he had run out of $1.2 billion. He decided not to build a road and it cost him $1.2 billion. The Labor Party in this great Australian parliament are fully supportive of this Premier's decision to spend $1.2 billion of taxpayers' money not to build a road. Then he put that project over to Infrastructure Victoria, and they threw it straight back at him and said, 'It's one of the three most important projects that we need to build, and we have thrown that project away.' Every time you get stuck in the traffic in Melbourne, you can thank Daniel Andrews and the Labor Party people here who refuse to take up the challenge to him for that deplorable act, that deplorable effort, on infrastructure in the great state of Victoria. When those opposite say that this budget is all smoke and mirrors on infrastructure, I do not know what planet they have come from. We are going to get the Inland Rail project started. It is going to connect Melbourne through to Brisbane, with an offshoot at Parkes to connect Sydney. It is going to be built; it is going to get started this year. I do not know where the problem is in relation to understanding that this government is getting on with the job. If you are still not convinced, you can come to my electorate and I will take you over to the City of Echuca and show you the bridge that is being built. It was a National Party in the Victorian government that put $95 million on the table. The Labor Party have been in government-and they are back in government now-and they did not want to know about this bridge. The community have been fighting for it for 50 years. There was the $95 million that went to Victoria, and when we had the opportunity with Darren Chester, as the National Party minister, we put $97 million on the table from the federal government, and then we got the National Party in New South Wales to commit their $90-odd million. It is a $280 million  bridge. The drilling rigs are there now and the bore samples are being taken. The bulldozers are moving round the roundabouts. We are building the bridge that has taken 50 years of the Labor Party doing absolutely nothing. The bridge is getting built. When you get the Inland Rail",70
134,Mr Albanese,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Daniel Andrews is the Premier, you fool!",71
135,Mr DRUM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You can support him all you like; I am just saying to you that I think you all have to question yourselves if you think that it is good economics to spend $1.2 billion to do nothing on a project that has now been put forward. The Inland Rail will not only connect these great cities with each other by a freight lane but also take all of these trucks off the main roads of Australia. The area around the Goulburn Valley, which I represent, is one of the biggest food producing regions in Australia and, with that, comes an incredibly large fleet of trucks. The biggest number of truck registrations outside of Melbourne and Sydney exists in the city of Shepparton. We will now see many of those trucks being able to do their work locally and regionally and they will not have to go interstate in the way that they used to. Apart from the road safety component, this will drive down the cost of getting your product from the farms to the market and from the processors to the market. In relation to infrastructure around the seat of Murray, this budget provides for $100 million to be committed to the North East line. Under the Labor Party in Victoria, the North East line, along with the Shepparton line and the Gippsland rail line, have been left to deteriorate where we have a situation where the services are inconsistent. The services are always late. They are slower than they were 40 years ago. The $100 million is going to be spent to fix the North East line. There will also be $10 million to be used to ensure that we do a comprehensive plan for transport right throughout the Goulburn Valley. It will take on board freight needs, passenger rail, road transport and what we need to do to have a decent airport-similar to the way that Wagners have got their airport up and running in southern Queensland. Ms O'TOOLE (Herbert) (15:41): On the eve of the biggest clash, it appears that in this place we will have our own state of origin showdown as well, because that is exactly what the Turnbull government have created. The Turnbull government have delivered absolutely nothing in the budget for North Queensland but have instead made massive cuts across the state for roads and infrastructure. Meanwhile, although a dismal amount, the only new funding the government have announced is for none other than New South Wales. It is abundantly clear that the Turnbull government are not supporters of Queensland. They have made this into an origin showdown-and, as a proud Queenslander, I say, 'Bring it on'. Just like the State of Origin tomorrow night, where the mighty Queensland Maroons will fight and win, I too will fight this out-of-touch Blues Turnbull government for Queensland, and I am determined to win. We will win. In the current financial year alone the government have cut infrastructure funding by $1.6 billion. Then funding continues to drop off over the cliff for another four years and, by 2021, infrastructure spend will have dropped to $3.4 billion. And guess which state bears the brunt of most of the Turnbull government cuts? It is none other than cane toad country Queensland. Almost a quarter, 21 per cent, of the infrastructure cuts in 2016-17 are to Queensland. Of the  $1.6 billion of cuts to national infrastructure, more than $345 million of those cuts are to Queensland. At budget time last year Queenslanders were promised $2.2 billion in infrastructure funding. However, the 2017 budget revealed that the state will actually only receive $1.8 billion. The government have absolutely let Queensland down. They have cut funding for fixing dangerous blackspots on local roads by $17.3 million. They have cut funding for major road upgrades by $276.5 million. They have cut funding for upgrading the roads the cattle industry rely on by $20.2 million. And they have cut funding for upgrading roads that connect communities and regional towns across northern Queensland by $50.7 million. And then we have the poor old Bruce Highway. The Turnbull government have not invested one extra dollar. In fact, the government will spend $6.1 million less on the Bruce Highway next year than this year. Funding for Queensland will continue to fall over the next four years, dropping by almost a quarter. These numbers clearly speak for themselves, and they tell a story-a story of how the Turnbull government do not care about Queenslanders and especially do not care about North Queensland. When North Queensland has been screaming and yelling for action on our water and energy issues, there can be no other reason for the Turnbull government blatantly ignoring us. In fact, they have only proven just how out of touch they really are. There is no other reason why this government has not matched Labor's $300 million commitment to deliver vital water and energy infrastructure. There is nothing, absolutely nothing, in this budget to address North Queensland's water and energy crisis. Whilst companies like Sun Metals and, as we have seen today, Glencore are threatening to leave the north due to skyrocketing electricity prices, the Turnbull government have not committed one cent to a hydropower station on the Burdekin Falls Dam. Sun Metals, to their credit, have taken matters into their own hands. What have this out-of-touch-with-the-north government done instead? They have committed to none other than a hydro project for the south of Australia. It is only Labor and it will only ever be Labor that will stand up for vital infrastructure in North Queensland. That is why Labor committed $200 million towards the construction of a hydropower station on the Burdekin Falls Dam and $100 million towards water security infrastructure. This will create hundreds of jobs, alleviate skyrocketing electricity costs and get Townsville off level 3 water restrictions. That is how you invest in North Queensland. That is what the Turnbull government should be doing, but instead they are doing nothing. Then we have the City Deals process, which does not do anything-it does not deliver any new money and does not do anything other than match Labor's $100 million commitment for a stadium. The City Deals plan mentions water and energy infrastructure; meanwhile, there is no funding allocated for any water or energy infrastructure. It mentions a defence hub; meanwhile, there is no money for any defence hub. The list of wishes and the list of items with no funding or action by this government continues. With an 11.3 per cent unemployment rate in Townsville, North Queensland cannot afford the Turnbull government's cuts to infrastructure. Infrastructure will create jobs and revitalise our local economy. So, to the Turnbull government, if you want a state of origin showdown then you've got one. I will continue to fight for cane-toad country until our community sees some real funding  and real action by this out-of-touch Blues Turnbull government. The people of Townsville and the north deserve so much better. (Time expired)",71
136,Dr MCVEIGH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," I stand as a proud Queenslander from our side of politics. We represent the bulk of our state in this House. I am astounded that the member for Grayndler would even raise infrastructure as a matter of public importance given the undoubted embarrassment that those opposite have in relation to their record of failure in securing decent infrastructure for Australia. Contrast that with the proven and magnificent efforts of the Turnbull government in relation to nation-building infrastructure. This discussion provides the ideal opportunity to shine a light on those nation-building efforts of our government. We need only refer to the unprecedented commitments in the 2017-18 federal budget just handed down-$10 billion over the next decade for the National Rail Program for passenger projects, important for our cities, suburbs and regional centres, among many other urban and regional initiatives being played out throughout our country. In Queensland the Bruce Highway, Warrego Highway and Pacific Motorway upgrades are the result of continuing increases under the coalition government, together with significant regional commitments. In our electorate of Groom the coalition government initiated and is funding the vast majority of the Toowoomba Second Range Crossing. It is a project worthy of particular note-it is the largest inland project in Australia being delivered by the Turnbull government. It is a project, importantly, that will provide benefits not only to Toowoomba and the Darling Downs but to our entire nation given its linking of the busy freight routes of the Warrego, New England and Gore highways, providing above all else safety to road users in our region and efficiency for freight networks across the country. It is a project that had to fight its way through the hurdles of bumbling and indecisive state and federal Labor governments that simply had no vision and certainly no regard for regional Australia and the catalytic role that significant infrastructure development projects can play. It took the alignment of forwardthinking coalition governments in Queensland and in Canberra, together with local government, to finally get it off the ground. We will see it completed late next year, and it will involve 1,800 jobs. In this budget the Australian government allocated an additional $8.4 billion in equity to the Australian Rail Track Corporation to construct Inland Rail in partnership with the private sector. This is in addition, of course, to the almost $900 million previously allocated for preconstruction works. This project will support up to 16,000 jobs during construction, and an average of 800 new jobs per year. When operational, Inland Rail will create an average of 600 jobs per year through its lifetime. We are getting on with it, whereas Labor was prevaricating and ignoring its features and benefits, such as the following. It will be 1,700 kilometres long, with over 500 kilometres of new track. It will create, as I said, 1,600 construction jobs. It will be a $16 billion economic boost-and they were dragging the chain! Two hundred and fifty thousand tonnes of CO2 will be taken out of the atmosphere. It will save lives. It will reduce congestion, with thousands of trucks off the road. It must be noted that Labor made no allowance for extension in 2010 to the Port of Brisbane. We have capacity on that line for 10 to 15 years. So we are working with Queensland on future options for port connections.  Moreover, industry representatives that I speak to understand and support this approach. Third-party endorsements of the Turnbull government's commitment to regional infrastructure in particular abound, and they abound in relation to the approach that we are taking to nationbuilding infrastructure-for example, from Australian railway, automobile and trucking associations; the Australian Logistics Council; and Pacific National, who said: Inland Rail is a true game-changer and we commend the Government for its commitment to such an important nation-building project. So the coalition government is justifiably proud to be the nation-building government that the budget proves it is and that our country knows it is.",73
137,Mr FEENEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Those of us who served in the last parliament will remember how the member for Warringah, when he was the Prime Minister, used to enjoy the ludicrous custom of describing himself as the infrastructure Prime Minister, and we used to watch the obsequious ministers of the time slither to their feet and refer to the Prime Minister in their questions as their 'infrastructure Prime Minister'. Sadly, this Orwellian distortion continued after the honourable member who is presently Prime Minister seized the throne, because we have learnt through bitter experience that, when this government starts talking about an issue, we can all be certain that that issue is set for neglect, for underinvestment and for mismanagement. That has been our experience with respect to schools. That has been our experience with respect to universities. That has been our experience with respect to a government that used to talk about debt and deficit-and yet, today, the deficit is 10 times greater than what they predicted it would be in 2014. So, too, it is with infrastructure, because they would be better to describe themselves as 'no infrastructure prime ministers' than as 'infrastructure prime ministers', given the sad record they offer the people of Australia. The most recent budget cut $1.6 billion in this financial year alone. But it gets worse, because funding then drops off over the next four years, falling to $4.2 billion in 2020-21. This will be the lowest level of infrastructure funding for more than 10 years, according to Infrastructure Partnerships Australia. Over the forward estimates, funding will collapse from something like $8 billion to a mere $4 billion. The only new onbudget investment is a measly $13 million for a little road near Nowra-a little bit of porkbarrelling for the marginal seat of Gilmore. And how typical of this lot that the only thing they offer at the end of producing this vast bureaucracy is a little boondoggle for their mate in Gilmore. The government's infrastructure funding announcement is a hoax. It delivers less over a longer period, and it demonstrates this government's unwillingness and inability to invest in real nation-building. As a Victorian, the allegation that we have a Sydney-centric Prime Minister is made out absolutely when one looks at infrastructure spending, because Victoria is once again dudded by this government. Despite the dishonest claim in his budget speech that the government is delivering an extra billion dollars in funding for the regional rail and infrastructure in Victoria, Senate estimates has revealed that the 2017 budget does not include a single extra dollar of funding for my state. Victoria's share of federal infrastructure funding remains well below 10 per cent, some 8c in the dollar. We are 25 per cent of the nation's economy. We are 25 per cent of the nation's population. Yet we attract only eight per cent of infrastructure funding. How could it be so?  It has often been said that this budget was the government inoculating itself against its greatest weaknesses. We have seen them fain compassion in the field of education; we have seen them try it on in Medicare. How can it be that a budget of inoculation offers nothing for my state of Victoria? Sadly, the answer is: because this government has given up on the state of Victoria. As far as they are concerned the state of Victoria is to be punished for committing the sin of not voting for them. The state of Victoria is being punished for not voting for this government. Our Victorian members in this House-even those Victorian members who are in the government-say nothing about it. It is a disgrace. They are cutting funding for major roads and rail projects. They are cutting funding for fixing dangerous black spots on local roads. They are cutting funding for building new roadside facilities, such as rest stops for truck drivers. But, of course, why would they care? These things do not only endanger Australian business and economic life; they endanger the actual lives of drivers. We know that fatalities among articulated truck drivers rose by 7.2 per cent last year. But this government does not care. All up, federal infrastructure spending per Victorian has more than halved; from some $201 under the former Labor government to a mere $92 under the Turnbull government. They have even refused the Victorian government's request for regional rail funding from the Asset Recycling Fund. This is an outrage. This federal government signed up to providing the Victorian government with monies under its asset recycling program, an obligation that it has walked away from. This is proof that this government regards COAG processes-and its own word when given to a premier-as nothing compared to its own political interest. Treasurer Tim Pallas has said the only reason they would not support this project would be in circumstances where they just want to find another excuse- (Time expired)",74
138,Mr HOGAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," I wish I had more than five minutes because I was just making a note to myself of all the infrastructure projects that I could list, not only across the nation-I could spend more than five minutes on just the infrastructure projects that we have begun, that we are building and that we are delivering just in my electorate of Page. But I will have to contain myself to the five minutes that I have. Let me start with one of the biggest infrastructure projects in this country, the Pacific Highway upgrade.",75
139,Mr Albanese,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"And who did that, you clown?",75
140,Mr HOGAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for Grayndler interrupts. I remind the member for Grayndler that before the 2013 election he publicly said that his federal government was going to stop funding the Pacific Highway at 80 per cent and put it back to 50 per cent. You are on the public record saying that. But what did we do? We maintained the funding of the Pacific Highway at 80 per cent, and that is what we did. So we are delivering the Pacific Highway at 80 per cent funding. Direct jobs are involved in this. And obviously, with indirect jobs, you are probably talking about 7,000 to 8,000 jobs in my community, because we continued. We delivered at 80 per cent not at the 50 per cent funding that the member for Grayndler wanted. We do this for a number of reasons. Firstly, it reduces and has reduced fatalities on the highway and that is very important. Obviously it is a job boost in the building, but there is also the tourism activity and the better transport facilities. We will deliver this by 2020. It was in stark contrast with what the Labor Party wanted to do with it.  Some of my fellow colleagues have very articulately spoken about the inland rail and the billions we are spending on that. That will take traffic off coastal roads like mine. There is the Western Sydney airport, which Labor could just never get its head around and deliver, but we are. And there is obviously Snowy hydro-not only important in infrastructure, but we are obviously also focused on delivering, not intermittent",75
141,Mr Conroy,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Snowy hydro has doubled in cost!,76
142,Mr HOGAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am glad the member for Shortland interjected. I understand why the member for Grayndler has deserted labourers, because he represents inner-city latte drinkers, but the member for Shortland actually still represents labourers and he has deserted them with his attitudes, and that is a disgrace. But on Snowy Hydro: obviously, that is going to deliver not only a great infrastructure project but it is also going to give us a renewable energy source that is not intermittent. That is very important. I could go on about nation-building projects, but I just want to cover a few in my own electorate. Locally we have a program that of course was begun under us-and I know you would know the program well, Mr Deputy Speaker Coulton. Labor would never introduce a program like the Bridges Renewal Program. We understand that the first mile bridges are very important for regional communities. Regions like mine are very productive. We produce a lot for this country, especially in agriculture. It has been a great pleasure of mine to work with some of my local councils to deliver bridges under this program. One of the more significant is the Kyogle Council. They do not have many ratepayers as their base-they are not a large council-but they have nearly 300 wooden bridges. It is a very productive area; they have a lot of produce, whether that is blueberries, cattle or many other things. Helping them to maintain the infrastructure through this program is very important. We have done 14 of these bridges already, and I am sure there will be more to come. We also have what was previously called the Stronger Regions Fund. It is now changing its name to the Building Better Regions Fund. I am very proud of some of the infrastructure that we have under that. This is all job producing and all helping local industry. There are things like the Casino saleyards, a very important part of our local economy; the Lismore Quadrangle project; and the Harwood sugar mill, down on the Lower Clarence-that is an important project. We are also delivering the Ballina Marine Rescue tower and the KyogleToonumbar Dam road-that is also an important tourist road in our area. Another thing we have done which, again, the other side did nothing about for the six years they were in, is to help to build mobile phone towers in regional areas. I think that Paul Keating is famous for saying that if you do not live in Sydney you are camping out! He probably used to think that was funny or witty, but underneath that there is a subconscious belief by the other side that they neglect. They do not believe in it. I am proud to say that we are building 22 of these stations-22!-in my region, which are going to cover more than 100 black spots. I knew I would run out of time, Mr Deputy Speaker! I could keep going-I have pages of infrastructure spending to go here! (Time expired)",76
143,Dr FREELANDER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," This is a government keen to remake its image after four years of vacillation, policy cul-de-sacs and less-than-masterful inactivity. In the  lead-up to this year's 'Lazarus rises' attempt at a budget, the government did what many had been calling for over many years: it sought to distinguish between good and bad debt. It finally accepted that borrowing for infrastructure that would last for many decades and be enjoyed by multiple generations was not the same as borrowing to pay for recurrent costs. Many hoped-and I was one of them-that that would mean the government would drop its deficit fetishism and start investing again in the public goods and services that our regions and cities desperately need. A government member interjecting",76
144,Dr FREELANDER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yes, the government would, particularly in respect of rail and public transport-it would be playing catch up. But at last we will be moving beyond the realms of endless announcements and re-announcements about the next study, or the next scoping study or indicative planning. The hope was that we would finally be seeing some action. Such action was not only overdue but desperately needed to boost economic activity and to deal with what for too long has been euphemistically described as 'spare' or 'excess' capacity in our economy. For 'spare or excess capacity' read 'entrenched and unacceptably high levels of unemployment and underemployment'. Whilst the Australian economy has continued to grow, notwithstanding the end of the mining boom, unemployment and underemployment rates have remained above those recorded during even the GFC. It is now widely agreed that Australia will soon need another economic stimulus as post-GFC investment in the property sector winds down. We are already seeing a slide in both retail sales and building commencements. The time to act is now, not when the rot has well and truly set in. Much could be done by simply ramping up existing projects and giving them a kick along, such as some in my electorate of Macarthur. We already have proposals such as the rebuilding of Appin Road and the rail line to the Badgerys Creek airport that could be fast tracked, as well as the north to South West Sydney rail line. At the last election, both the Labor Party and the Liberal Party committed $50 million to begin the upgrade of Appin Road. Labor had a proper funding proposal with proper plans for this very vital piece of infrastructure-almost 30 people have died on that road in the last 15 years. While Labor's funding specified the building of a dual carriageway, the government's funding was very vague and came with no specifications. In the budget this year the $50 million has shrunk to $5 million-what for, we do not know-which will not even get the project started. And then we have the rail line to Badgery's Creek airport. The minister, Mr Fletcher, talks about Western Sydney Airport. Every transport expert that I speak to says it must open with a rail line there when the first plane lands. We want a train to meet our plane. But nothing from this government. It really beggars belief that they would even consider having the Western Sydney Airport without proper transport infrastructure. It remains unclear to me why the government refuses to have a train line built in. But that is this government: it talks but it does not act. In addition, not only would the north-south rail line take people from western and southwestern Sydney to and from the airport; it would be totally life-changing for the more than two million people who live in Western Sydney. It would provide jobs, it would stimulate business and it would truly be an act of nation-building.  There is scope for some modest projects. The southern rail corridor from Sydney, through Campbelltown and Goulburn, to Canberra could be improved dramatically at very little expense. The member for Fenner and the ACT Chief Minister have highlighted an option for enhancing rail services that would almost have the travel time. The Spanish company involved in that project has offered to bring some of its rail infrastructure over here free of charge and show us how it could be done. The government does not talk much about unemployment, and you need look no further than the budget papers to see why. Despite talking a lot about mutual obligation this government has put in place precious little infrastructure in social security. They talk about a 'pee for the dole' program-an attempt at blaming people without putting anything in place to help them. This government has no vision. It is interested in pork-barrelling projects and has been very destructive of social infrastructure-such as the Australian veterinary medicines laboratory, which is being destroyed. Our medical infrastructure is also deteriorating, with increasing hospital waiting times. (Time expired)",77
145,Mr WALLACE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE, When I saw the member for Grayndler's motion I thought it was a joke. I thought he surely could not be serious given his own performance and the performance of this government. Mr Albanese interjecting,78
146,Mr WALLACE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I know the member for Grayndler is doing it tough; I know he is not getting much airtime on that side of the fence; I know that is pretty hard for him. But he is actually not a bad bloke; he is just somewhat mistaken on many things! The Turnbull government is desperately planning for some terrific infrastructure projects-projects that the member for Grayndler did not deliver for the Sunshine Coast. The Turnbull government in September last year very proudly announced a $929 million upgrade for the Bruce Highway between Caloundra Road and Sunshine Motorway. On the Sunshine Coast, when I was driving to the airport on Sunday on my way here-I hope the member for Grayndler does not leave, because this is very important for him to hearMr Albanese interjecting",78
147,Mr WALLACE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Please don't go, member for Grayndler; please stay! On my way to the airport, on a 110-kilometre-an-hour stretch of road, we ground to a measly speed of around 20 to 30 kilometres an hour. When the member for Grayndler was the infrastructure minister, what did he do for the Bruce Highway on the Sunshine Coast? Zip, nothing. Since the Turnbull government came to power, it has put $743 million into a $929 million program to increase the highway from four lanes to six lanes between Caloundra Road and Sunshine Motorway and provide brand-new interchanges at Caloundra Road and Sunshine Motorway. The Queensland Department of Transport and Main Roads tells me that, all up, 100 kilometres of road will be set up in that new section. These are very expensive works to be done, but they will be fantastic for the Sunshine Coast. On top of that, the Treasurer announced in the budget another $650 million for upgrades to the Bruce Highway, south of Caloundra. All those opposite have gone very quiet all of a sudden. I understand why: they are embarrassed by the fact that this government is getting on with infrastructure, particularly in my home patch on the Sunshine Coast. I want to thank particularly the Minister for Urban Infrastructure, who is sitting in front of me here, and the  Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, because these two gentlemen have the led the way. They have been terrific leaders and proponents for infrastructure in the great state of Queensland. But we have not stopped there. On top of the $743 million that the government is putting in for the Bruce Highway upgrade-Caloundra Road to Sunshine Motorway-and on top of the $650 million upgrade for the Caloundra Road to Pine River Bruce Highway upgrade, we also have $182.6 million for critical safety upgrades and $180 million for the Nambour roundabout. That is $1.6 billion worth of critical infrastructure for my home patch on the Sunshine Coast. But we understand that upgrading the Bruce Highway is not going to be the panacea for the people of the Sunshine Coast. That is why the government has provided a $10 billion national rail program-so the Queensland state government can bid for the North Coast rail duplication between Beerburrum and Nambour. It is very sad to see those opposite leaving as they hear these great stories about infrastructure. It is very upsetting to me and it will be upsetting to Sunshine Coast residents to see that the man who put this motion forward has departed the scene, because he knows that this government is absolutely rock-solid committed to providing infrastructure for the great state of Queensland, for this country and, in particular, for my home patch on the Sunshine Coast.",78
148,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE, The discussion has concluded. NA Social Services Legislation Amendment (Energy Assistance Payment and Pensioner Concession Card) Bill 2017 Second Reading Consideration resumed of the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.,79
149,Ms MACKLIN,BILLS," I move: That all the words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House: 1. condemns the Government's cuts to Australian pensioners; 2. notes that the Government is giving a one-off payment of $75 to single pensioners with one hand, while removing the permanent Energy Supplement of $365 per year from all new pensioners; 3. calls on the Government to drop its unfair cuts to pensioners and vulnerable Australians; and 4. calls on the Government to drop its plan to increase the pension age to 70, the oldest pension age in the world. This afternoon I am speaking on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Energy Assistance Payment and Pensioner Concession Card) Bill 2017. Labor will support this bill. Of course we will not deny pensioners the very modest one-off payment that is outlined in this bill. However, no-one would be surprised to know that Labor will not be letting this government of the hook. We will not let the government get away with their terrible record of cuts to our pensioners, because the Abbott-Turnbull government's record on pensions is nothing short of a disgrace. Today the Liberals will no doubt carry on like they are the best friends that pensioners have ever had, but pensioners will not be fooled; they know the truth. In every single budget the Liberals have handed down since Mr Abbott, the member for  Warringah, was elected as Prime Minister, they have proposed cuts to the pension. In four budgets in a row they proposed cuts to pensions. In four budgets in a row we have seen this Liberal and National Party government try to cut the pension. This government has absolutely no shame when it comes to cutting pensions. Let us be clear: the energy assistance payment in this bill is merely an attempt to distract Australian pensioners from the fact-and this is a fact-that this Liberal government still intends to try to abolish the energy supplement. The government is offering a one-off energy assistance payment of $75. So, $75 will be paid, once, to single pensioners. That is less than $1.50 a week. At the same time, they are going to try to take $365 each and every year from single pensioners by removing the energy supplement to new pensioners. A one-off payment of $75, or $1.50 a week, is nothing like $365 in assistance every single year to help pensioners keep up with increasing energy costs. This is something that pensioners are very familiar with with this Prime Minister, a Prime Minister who is giving with one hand a tiny little bit and taking an awful lot more with the other. Pensioners know that $75 does not equal a cut of $365. Pensioners know this comes from what can only be described as a very twofaced Prime Minister, who wants to claim credit for giving money to pensioners on the one hand but is ripping away far more with the other hand. We all should remember the origins of this one-off payment. It did not come about as a result of any reform process or policy review; it suddenly appeared on the day that this Liberal-National Party government did a deal with the Senate crossbench to get its company tax cuts through the Senate. That is actually how this came to pass. Let us be very clear about this: this government is not making this one-off payment by choice, and they are certainly not doing it because they care about pensioners. They have done it to get their company tax cut through the Senate. It really tells you all you need to know about this Liberal-National Party government. The only time they are actually motivated to do anything good for pensioners is when they are horse trading to get their company tax cuts through the Senate. Let us look in detail at the trade-off. Pensioners are going to get a one-off-only one-payment of $75. That is on the one hand, while on the other hand billions of dollars in company tax cuts will be delivered to businesses in this country. How on earth could that be fair? Pensioners get $75, or $1.50 a week, once, and businesses get billions of dollars in company tax cuts. This really tells you absolutely everything you need to know about this Liberal-National Party government's priorities. By contrast, Labor understands the needs of pensioners. It was in the last Labor government that we saw an increase to the pension of $30 a week in 2009, the largest ever increase to the pension. That $30 a week was each and every week, not once. We actually increased the pension. All this government does-the Liberal Party and the National Partyis, each and every year, come up with a new way to cut the pension. On this side of the parliament, we understand that pensioners deserve to be treated with respect in their retirement. We understand that they have worked very hard all of their lives and have contributed enormously to our country. They just want access to a modest pension to be able to enjoy a decent standard of living in retirement. Of course, we will not deny pensioners this very modest one-off payment, but we will oppose, when it comes back into the parliament, the government's attempt to remove the energy supplement from the most vulnerable Australians, and we expect to see that cut re-emerge very soon.  The 2017 budget actually confirms that the Liberals and Nationals still want to abolish this energy supplement. If the Prime Minister really cared about the living expenses of vulnerable Australians, he would not be trying to take this energy supplement off 1.7 million Australians. I just wonder whether all of those opposite actually know that that is what is going to happen when they vote on the abolition of the energy supplement-that 1.7 million Australians, including aged pensioners, disability pensioners, people on the carer payment and people on Newstart are all going to lose the energy supplement. For single pensioners, that will mean a cut of $14.10 a fortnight, or $365 a year. Couple pensioners will be worse off by $21.20 a fortnight, or around $550 a year worse off. The government should stop actually insulting aged and disability support pensioners by trying to give a little bit with one hand and take a lot with the other. I also want to draw the House's attention to the fact that Newstart recipients will not get one cent of this one-off $75 payment. Australians who are struggling on Newstart will not get anything out of the money in this bill. However, Australians on Newstart do face a cut as a result of the abolition of the energy supplement. A single person on Newstart will lose $8.80 a fortnight, or around $220 a year. Let's also not forget that when the government came to office in 2013 they promised all Australians lower energy prices. What has actually happened? They promised all Australians, including pensioners, that their energy bills would fall. What actually happened is that wholesale prices have doubled since this government came into office in 2013. Another broken promise, as energy prices have gone through the roof under the Liberals and the Nationals. The other measure in this bill is the restoration of the pension concession card to around 90,000 pensioners who lost their pension on 1 January this year as a direct result of this government's cut to the pension assets test. Let's not forget why this measure is in this bill. This is actually a very embarrassing backflip for the government. Labor has forced the coalition into this backflip. For two years we have actually highlighted this issue. It has been a double blow for pensioners to both lose their pension or part pension as well as their pensioner card and all of the concessions and discounts that come with it. Just a few months ago, the Minister for Human Services, Mr Tudge, said on the issue of pensioner concessions that it was a matter for the state, territory and local governments. He was on the radio. The interviewer said, 'But do they lose their pensioner concession card because that gets them discounts on things like rego and council rates, utility bills as well?' Mr Tudge said: 'That's up to each local council and each state and territory government as to how they're going to deal with that. I mean we deal with what the federal policy is…' That is what the Minister for Human Services said back in December last year. The presenter went on to say, 'But you can't give them any guarantee that on the other stuff.' The minister said, 'Well it's up to each state and territory government what their policy decisions are.' All of a sudden it seems the Minister for Human Services and all the other people on the government benches have realised the federal government can restore pensioner concessions to these seniors. What pensioners do know is that they certainly cannot trust the coalition. I will just remind those opposite how this actually came to pass. In the 2015 budget speech the then Treasurer, Joe Hockey, said:  Importantly anyone who currently has a Pensioner Concession Card will continue to receive a concession card that provides the same benefits, such as subsidised utilities and transport … That is what the government promised in the 2015 budget. But it turned out-pensioners were not surprised about this, of course-that Mr Hockey and everyone on the government benches misled pensioners. Now, we have, in this bill, the Liberals and the National Party scrambling to try to fix the problem. They all said, 'This will all be fine; we'll give them a Commonwealth seniors health card, and that will entitle them to the same concessions.' Well, they were wrong. They were absolutely wrong. They actually knew that many state government and local council concessions were available to pensioner concession cardholders but not to Commonwealth seniors cardholders. They failed to negotiate concessions with the states and territories to make sure that these former pensioners would not be worse off. The Minister for Social Services and the Minister for Human Services travelled around the country repeating this mistruth. They carried on with the fiction that it was somehow the fault of the states and local councils. That was just untrue. I have been around the country attending many seniors forums. I can tell you that seniors know exactly who created this mess. They blame the Liberal National government. Labor, of course, welcomes this backflip. It is a good thing that the government have finally come to their senses on this issue. But no-one should think-and, certainly, pensioners do not think this-that the Liberals or the Nationals have done this out of the goodness of their hearts. They have only done it because they have been caught out. They have done it for political reasons. They have only done it because Labor and pensioner groups have pressured them into it. If there is one thing that we on this side of the House will not let the Liberal government forget, it is the promise that they made before the 2013 election. They promised-in fact, the member for Warringah did it the night before the election-that there would be 'no cuts to pensions'. That is what the Liberal Party signed up to; that is what the National Party signed up to. Then, in every single budget, the Liberals and the Nationals have handed down budgets that contain cuts to the pension. In the 2014 budget-that horror budget-they tried to cut pension indexation. It was a cut that would have seen pensioners forced to live on $80 a week less over a 10-year period. In 2014, they also tried to reset the deeming rate thresholdschanges that would have hurt half a million part pensioners. Fortunately, we defeated those measures in the parliament. Labor stood firm with pensioners and stopped those horrific cuts going through the parliament. In 2015, the Liberals did a deal with the Greens to cut the pension to around $330,000 pensioners by changing the pension assets tests. We know-and Senator Cormann has just confirmed again in Senate estimates-that it is still government policy for these people opposite, the Liberals and the Nationals, to increase the pension age to 70. This would give Australia the oldest pension age in the developed world. They cannot deny it. They cannot deny that it is still government policy to make farmers, builders, nurses-all of these people with very tough jobs-continue to work until they are 70. Then we see, in this year's budget, confirmed again, the next cut to pensioners-the axing of the energy supplement. Labor will not oppose this bill today, but we will continue to do all that we can to protect pensioners from the horror cuts from the Liberal and National parties. ",79
150,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, Is the amendment seconded?,83
151,Mr Dreyfus,BILLS,I second the amendment.,83
152,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,"I thank the honourable member for Isaacs. The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Jagajaga has moved as an amendment that all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. If it suits the House, I will state the question in the form that the amendment be agreed to. The question now is that the amendment be agreed to. Mr TED O'BRIEN (Fairfax) (16:29): The Social Services Legislation Amendment (Energy Assistance Payment and Pensioner Concession Card) Bill 2017 that we are now debating has two principal intents. One is in relation to providing a one-off subsidy to almost four million Australians to help meet energy costs. The second relates to the extension of the pensioner concession card. Right around Australia the number one concern for most Australians, particularly among older and disadvantaged Australians, is the rapid rise in the cost of living. With minimal real wage growth over the past decade the cost of living, especially for energy and services, has reached breaking point. While very much focused on continued fiscal responsibility and budget repair, the Turnbull government is acutely aware of the need to do all we reasonably can to help older and disadvantaged Australian meet higher costs, and outrageously higher energy costs in particular. This bill will reinstate the pensioner concession card to over 92,000 people who are no longer eligible for the pension from 1 January 2017 due to a rebalancing of the pension assets test. While the replacement health care card and seniors health card do provide discounts for Medicare and the PBS, they do not deliver free hearing services or other state based concessions that were a feature of the pensioner concession card. This bill now seeks to restore eligibility for the pensioner concession card to this group, subject to established conditions such as extended overseas travel or imprisonment. While the government's proposed reinstatement of the pensioner concession card merits our support, it is the one-off energy assistance payment to welfare recipients that I particularly want to concentrate on, because it is so indicative of where we are now as a country. We should not need to be easing the cost of power in Australia, because we are an energy superpower. We are the largest single supplier of coal on the planet, responsible for about 30 per cent of global seaborne trade. We have the fourth largest reserves in the world. Our exports are a massive contributor to national wealth-$34 billion last year. The coal industry directly employs 44,000 people, and last year paid almost $6 billion in wages and salaries. Our coal is also a creator of wealth wherever it goes, and it goes principally to Japan, India, Korea and China. In terms of gas, we are the second largest exporter of LNG on the planet, and we are on track to be the biggest by 2020. Last year we exported 37 million tonnes, almost half as much again as the year before. Australian gas now goes to Japan, China, South Korea, Taiwan, India, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand in that order. We are exporting prosperity to those countries and many others, including the Philippines. We are also a uranium superpower, with the largest reserves on the planet, fully a third of all known deposits. With energy resources like these, we should have some of the cheapest power in the world, power that ought to be affordable even for those in the safety net. Cheap energy ought to be  driving investment, industry, international competitiveness, jobs and the sort of income growth that has sadly stagnated to the point where this sort of measure has now become necessary. Just a few years ago we had some of the lowest prices for electricity in the world. Those low prices by global standards did all those things: they helped drive investment, they helped our international competitiveness and they drove economic growth so that jobs were created, wages were growing, the pie was getting bigger and with it the chance for everybody to get a bigger slice, even those less fortunate and those in retirement. Energy prices are a crucial ingredient in that whole equation, yet, here we are now with some of the highest power prices in the world, requiring a bill such as the one we are debating today. Within about a decade, we have gone from having secure and reliable energy that was among the cheapest in the world to now lacking security and reliability and having one of the most expensive power prices in the world, even though we are-unlike a lot of those countries that have cheaper power-an energy superpower. The situation is ludicrous. Why do we now need, via this bill, to provide an energy assistance payment to welfare recipients of $75 for singles and $62.50 for each member of a couple? Why do we need this one-off payment for 2½ million age pensioners, for 770,000 disability support pensioners, for 260,000 parenting payment single recipients and for 235,000 people on veteran payments-for 3.8 million Australians? Why do we need this when we are an energy superpower and when we should, for a host of reasons, have some of the most affordable power in the world? How did it come to this? The answer, in a word, is ideology-the ideology of the members opposite, the ideology of the Labor Party and the ideology of Labor's former left wing, the Greens. First, let us look at call. Coal is still, by far, the cheapest way available in this country to produce electricity. It has been the mainstay of baseload power generating systems in this country for well over a century, and it still is. Its abundance has been the basis of affordable electricity for domestic and industrial users for generations. The problem in relation to coal is that its combustion releases carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, and, according to members opposite, we therefore have to stop using it to generate power. And by the way, they do not like gas either. Gas has a significant emissions advantage over coal, but it is still, in the end, a fossil fuel, and so the members opposite do not really approve of it either. What members opposite want is to have 50 per cent of power generation in Australia come from renewable energy sources by 2030 and 100 per cent by 2050, which means shutting down coal-fired power generators and severely restricting the use of gas as its replacement. You may be inclined to ask, Mr Deputy Speaker Vasta, how would members opposite provide that? How would they meet the target of 50 per cent renewable energies and then 100 per cent by 2050? You can ask the question, but you will not get an answer, because they themselves cannot work it out. Instead, they are happy to go on and ideological frolic, embark on their own great leap forward, if you like, without having the faintest idea on how to deliver. The problem is that their vision of 50 per cent and then 100 per cent renewables is not based on engineering or economics, but on ideology, on a religious zealotry, if you like-one that applies as a black and white article of faith, prophesising that coal is bad, coal is evil and renewables are good, renewables are the answer. But one must be very aware of false gods. Instead of ideology, what we need is engineering and economics. Instead of a religious approach, what we need is an agnostic one. It is the religious ideological approach that has led to baseload power being compromised and entire systems, such as that which we have seen in South Australia, being crippled. It has led to the economics of coal-fired power stations being  undermined, to station closures and to tightening supply, which has in turn increased electricity prices. And, of course, let's not forget the cumulative effect of moratoriums on gas, among other things. There is nothing wrong with renewables. There is nothing wrong with renewables-there is a role for them, an important role. But they are not the answer to baseload power. Who knows? Maybe battery storage will one day change that equation, but we need to make decisions in and for the real world, and that requires pragmatism so that we can have a secure, reliable and affordable system. While the government has introduced several measures to address these issues, and there is still much to be done, we cannot stand by in the interim and watch older and disadvantaged people bear the brunt of higher utility costs without trying to assist. Thus here, contained in this bill, we seek to provide a one-off energy assistance payment while also reinstating the pensioner concession card. I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, as the member for Fairfax on Queensland's Sunshine Coast, that this will have a real impact on the ground. Around 54,000 people on the Sunshine Coast will receive this one-off payment, and over 1,500 people on the Sunshine Coast will see their pensioner concession card reinstated. For these people, this is much-welcomed news, and I am proud to be part of a government that will deliver it. However, for the reasons I have outlined, it is with mixed feelings that I support this one-off payment component of the bill. While I support the bill wholeheartedly, and I am delighted to see this government provide much-needed assistance, I remain incensed by the ideological religious zealotry of the members opposite. It is for that reason that we have got to the place where we are today, where bills such as this are necessary. I cannot believe that the Labor Party here at the federal level and in other jurisdictions are happy to make the problem that has created the need for this bill even worse. Labor, together with the Greens and, indeed, cashed-up left-wing political activists have helped to undermine the energy market, something that used to be a core strength of this country. They made it into a market that suffers from insecurity, unreliability and unaffordability, thereby making life harder for every business and every household across the country. Thankfully, that unholy left-wing alliance is not running the government! And so we, the coalition, will do what seems to be our lot in life, and that is to fix Labor's mess. And in doing so, we will also provide assistance to those who have been so adversely affected by them. It is for that reason that I commend the bill to the House.",83
153,Ms KEAY,BILLS," That previous contribution was quite extraordinary, celebrating a measure which is now being reinstated when it was something that they took away in the first place. I am quite flabbergasted! And that was coming from a government that has no national energy policy. I am a little lost for words! But I will go to my speech, because I have a lot to say on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Energy Assistance Payment and Pensioner Concession Card) Bill 2017. This is a bill that this side of the House will support, not because this government has suddenly had a policy masterstroke but because Labor cares about pensioners. This is a government that is planning to take away the energy supplement of $365 a year and instead offering a one-off payment of $75 for a single and $62.50 each for those who are in a couple.  In Tasmania, where we have clean, green renewable energy created with our own baseload in hydro dams and supplemented by wind power, a $75 one-off payment for, say, a single mum with a couple of kids will not cover the electricity that that mum has used for a week. It would not make much difference at all. It is also quite astounding that this bill does not provide any support for people on Newstart, some of the most vulnerable people in our community, who do not live at home where they can be supplemented by their parents and are out there trying every day hopefully to find a job. They are doing what they can to make ends meet, and there is no support for them. Why is this assistance so important for Tasmanian pensioners? The Australian Energy Regulator report found that, of any state in the national electricity market, low-income Tasmanians pay the highest proportion of their income for electricity. A low-income family in Tasmania without any concession will typically pay about $2,000 a year or 8.5 per cent of their disposable income to Aurora Energy for 6,600 kilowatt hours of electricity. Middleincome households pay about 4.3 per cent of their annual income, and high-income households pay just 1.75 per cent. In order to reduce one's bill, you have to reduce your consumption-that is quite clear; I think people get that-as Tasmania's average unit cost of electricity is sensitive to consumption levels. So, clearly, in Tasmania a way that you can reduce your electricity bill is by reducing your consumption. So you can imagine that pensioners will reduce their consumption in order to reduce their bills, because the government is planning to take away their supplement. But at what point does this mean pensioners are going to live through winter with no heating at all? Sadly, this is something that I hear all the time, even with the energy supplement in place. Sonia, from Ulverstone, in my electorate, who is in her seventies, recently wrote to me. She said: I am an aged pensioner and currently renting the premises in which I am residing. The cost of power has risen significantly. And she was actually quoting about over 25 years. That is how much she takes notice of her electricity bill. The cost of heating is a major portion of that cost. I am sure that many pensioners, even those that own their own homes, are going without adequate heating rather than facing a bill for power that takes up a fortnights income, leaving them with little to cover essentials such as groceries and or medication. I am one of them. There are thousands of Sonias in my electorate. My electorate has a higher proportion of the population on the aged and disability support pensions compared to the state average and obviously a higher proportion than the national average. I have heard of many pensioners living without heating over winter, who sit there pretty much freezing. In some cases in Tasmania it is just as cold as a Canberra winter. So you can imagine what it would be like, in a room putting on as many layers as you can and not even being able to afford to turn on a little heater-not even a heat pump, which is probably the most efficient way of heating a home. You would not even be able to afford to turn that on-and this is with the energy supplement that the government is now planning to  take away and replace it with a little one-off payment that would not pay the energy bill for a week. For those pensioners on a pensioner concession card-which they are reinstating for some and took away from some-the state government provides $56 per year and an annual electricity concession of 132.557c per day for those with a pensioner concession card or a healthcare card. Even with all that support for Tasmanian pensioners, they are still finding it hard to be able to afford to turn on their heaters in a Tasmanian winter. And this government is planning to whack them again by taking away the energy supplement and giving them a little sweetener. That is a diversion if ever I have heard one, and they should be sitting there bowing their heads in shame. With less support to pay for their bills, I know that this will only get worse. We can see this in disconnections for non-payment. This is a marker of those in our community who are finding it hard to pay their electricity bills. In 2015-16 there was a 12 per cent increase in disconnections for non-payment, from 1,046 to 1,172. Sadly, you have to say that this can only get worse. The average electricity debt was $739. One in five customers of Aurora, the only energy retailer in the state, entered a partnership program and had a debt of more than $2,500. That is extraordinary. And what does this government do? Take away the supplement. Now, with the closure of Hazelwood, the average additional amount Tasmanians will pay for electricity in 2018 and 2019 will be an extra $204-the highest of any state. That is because Tasmania's consumption level is twice that of Victoria and the highest in the country. The government clearly does not care about that. The government has clearly misled the Australian people when it said in 2013 'no cuts to pensions'. But in every budget since being elected the government has wanted to cut pensions and hurt pensioners. Let's not forget the 2014 budget. How could you forget that? I think every pensioner in the country remembers that one quite clearly. The former member for North Sydney, with his legendary age-of-entitlement-is-over budget, set the scene for the government's attacks on pensioners. They have attempted. Some things they have succeeded at and some they have failed at in their attacks. They tried to cut pension indexation; planned to freeze assets and income tests for three years from this year-that is achieved; planned to increase the deeming thresholds for the income test to $30,000 for single pensioners and $50,000 for pensioner couples combined; abolished the seniors supplement from 1 July 2014; make the seniors health care card harder to qualify for; cut $1.3 billion in support to state and territory based seniors concessions, which goes then to the energy concessions that some of the states put in place, like in Tasmania; abolished the dependent spouse rebate for people aged 60 or older; abolished the mature age worker tax offset; abolished the pensioner education supplement. What a litany of attacks the 2014 was to pensioners. Let's also not forget the then Treasurer's comments that not one pensioner would lose their pensioner concession card. Now they are restoring it. They got rid of it for some pensioners; now they are bringing it back and now they are celebrating it. It is quite funny-I heard a comment from the member for Gilmore, who said-I think it was yesterday-that she celebrated the return of the pensioner concession card. Woohoo! Great! Where was she when it was removed? Where were those members on the other side when that was removed from those pensioners? In 2015 they stood there, when they did a dirty deal with the Greens party to cut the pension from around  330,000 people in our country by changing the pension assets test. People ask me about that all the time in my electorate: 'Why did you change that?' I am very proud to say, 'It wasn't us!' It was not Labor-it was the government. It was the Liberal coalition government doing a deal with the Greens. Pensioners have long memories, and this is one change they will never forget. They still want to increase the pension age to 70. Australia will have the oldest pension age in the world. Due to the nature of work for the people in my electorate, many people will be physically unable to work to that age. I am reminded by the words of pensioners Ray and Trudi from Turners Beach in my electorate, who I have previously spoken about in this place. It is worth reminding the House of these comments: It comes as no surprise to see what the present government is trying to do to people of our age, after telling us for years to save and sacrifice towards retirement, they try and change the game and change the rules. The one thing that gets under our skin is the changing of the retirement age. We think it is disgusting that people who have to work hard all of their lives may now be expected to work until they are 70 years of age. We may have voted them in last time, but it was a first and last time. They have made blunder after blunder, and if what people at that time know, if that's what they are going on, it will be the last time we see this coalition government in. Despite all the dishonesty, the attacks and the dirty deals, the government is still going ahead with the cuts to the clean energy supplement, and Braddon pensioners are paying the most, as I clearly state, with the amount that they pay out of their income towards electricity. This cut will see them lose $14.10 for a single pensioner a fortnight, or $365 a year. Couples will be worse off by $21.20 a fortnight. The Prime Minister wants to paint himself as the pensioners' friend-almost like Robin Hood, taking from the rich and giving to the poor. But he is more like the Sheriff of Nottingham, taking from the poor and giving to the rich. This legislation is not before the House because the Prime Minister wants to help pensioners; it is here as a result of a deal the Prime Minister did so he could get part of his company tax plans through the Senate. If the Prime Minister could really be trusted as the pensioners' friend, we would have heard from him and other members on the other side in 2014, 2015, 2016 and the first part of 2017-he would have been there, to be the friend of pensioners. But there was not a word-except, of course, to vote in this place to cut pensions. Let us look no further at their record. Labor will support this bill. But I can tell you: we will continue to fight for pensioners in Australia, in my electorate, and oppose the abolition of the clean energy supplement. And it will give me great pleasure to stand here in this place and go through all of this again, for every member on the other side, to remind them of why, in Tasmania, this will be a bad, bad thing. This will mean that pensioners in my electorate and my home state will suffer over the cold winters. They will have their power disconnected at higher levels than we have seen. And those on the other side are sitting there and obviously taking no notice of what I am saying, which is just terrible. You also have to ask yourself: what are the Liberal Tasmanian Senate members saying on this? Nothing! Where are they? If they are there for the people of Tasmania, which has such a disproportionately high number of people on government payments, what are they saying? Nothing!  You just have to look at the budget. It was absolutely deplorable for the state of Tasmania. It was the forgotten state. I have just been in the Federation Chamber and I will make here the same comment as I made there: I need to give every member of the coalition a map of Tassie! It hasn't seceded to Antarctica yet! But let us look at what they are doing, those Liberal senators: absolutely nothing. Pensioners should not be forced to freeze over the winter months just because this Prime Minister has warped priorities.  to make a brief contribution. I am very pleased to be speaking in support of the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Energy Assistance Payment and Pensioner Concession Card) Bill 2017, which will help the people in my electorate of Hinkler with the ever increasing cost of electricity. We should look at just how serious this rise in electricity prices is and what it is doing to a number of businesses, and of course to the residents in my electorate. Year after year, the cost of electricity has risen. It has become a massive problem in the region, not just for residents but also for businesses and, in particular, for those in our agricultural sector such as canegrowers. Third-generation Bundaberg canefarmer Dean Cayley says that his electricity prices have increased by 126 per cent since 2008-126 per cent. He is not sure there will be a fourth generation of cane farmers in his family, due to the continued pressure of electricity prices. He says that it is out of control, and it is not just for farmers; it is across all rural production. Mr Cayley's electricity bill for the 90-day period 7 October 2016 to 5 January 2017 was $20,307. He estimates he was only irrigating for around half of that time. Electricity pricing in Queensland, as I am sure you know, Mr Deputy Speaker Vasta, is controlled by the Queensland state Labor government. And we ask: what are they doing about it? The answer is: absolutely nothing. When it comes to rising electricity costs, they have been absolutely asleep at the wheel. A Queensland Competition Authority increase of 2.8 per cent for customers on tariff 11 was implemented for bills between 2016 and 2017. The draft determination by the QCA says that energy costs are expected to increase for all customers in 2017-18, primarily driven by increases in wholesale energy costs and the large-scale renewable energy target costs. Based on draft estimates, a typical household on the main residential tariff, tariff 11, is projected to pay $1,515 on its 2017-18 annual bill. This represents a 1.7 per cent increase from the 201617 bill of $1,490. For a typical customer, on a combination of tariff 11 and controlled load tariffs 31 and 33, the expected increase will be 2.3 per cent and 1.6 per cent respectively. Large business customers can expect increases in their annual notified price bills of between 1½ per cent and three per cent as a result of the draft change in notified prices between 2016-17 and 2017-18. The annual notified price bill for a typical customer on the main small business tariff, tariff 20, is expected to increase by $37 or 1½ per cent as a result of the draft change in notified prices between 2016-17 and 2017-18. For a typical customer on the seasonal time-of-use tariff, tariff 22A, the expected increase will be slightly lower, at one per cent. So it is hardly surprising that people, businesses and organisations are looking for a  cheaper source of energy due to the Queensland state Labor government's inability to reign in this ever-increasing cost of living. A local hospital in Bundaberg is looking to install a solar energy system which will save $84,000 per year in hot water bills. What prompted the hospital to take this step? It recently received news of a 30 per cent increase to its $80,000 per month electricity bill, so it had no choice but to start looking for other options. On 1 July 2017 the Queensland state Labor government is set to slug motorists with a 3.25 percent increase on car registration. The residents of Queensland are being treated as a cash cow by the state Labor government-it has to stop. The coalition government is helping out people with these rising costs of living by providing a one-off energy assistance payment. The payment is for recipients of the age pension, the disability support pension and parenting payment single, as well as for veterans and their partners paid the service pension, the income support supplement and relevant compensation payments who are eligible for payment and are residing in Australia on 20 June 2017-the test date-to assist them with their energy costs. The energy assistance payment will be $75 for singles and $62.50 for each member of a couple, providing additional assistance to around 3.8 million Australians, including 2.5 million age pension recipients, 770,000 disability support pension recipients, 260,000 parenting payment single recipients, and 235,000 recipients of veterans payments. The payment will not be taxed and will not reduce their rate of income support. The coalition government is also looking at ways to deliver practical actions to help Australians through the next few summers while laying the foundations for long-term reforms to ensure the energy market is better equipped to handle future challenges. This is a challenge that I think both sides of parliament need to address. This should be a bipartisan issue. It affects all people and all businesses in this country, and we need to get on with it. The government will provide $7.9 million in 2017-18 to the ACCC to review retail power prices. The ACCC will produce a paper within six months on its preliminary insights into the strategies and pricing behaviours of key electricity retailers. The ACCC's inquiry will identify and report on the key cost components of electricity retail pricing and how they affect the retail offers made to customers. The inquiry will examine whether electricity retailers' margins and profitability are in line with their costs and risks. The inquiry will consider any obstructions to consumer choice, such as the transparency and clarity of contracts that energy companies offer to consumers. This is something which has been raised with me on a number of occasions. We have a local baker who is with particular supplier and who had a no-exit or no-return component in their contract. The expectation for the next 12 months for this baker was an increase from some $45,000 a quarter to $120,000 a quarter. They simply did not have that on their bottom line. This has to be addressed. In this instance it was sorted out through an arrangement between other providers. However, this simply cannot continue. The inquiry will also consider the competitiveness of offers available to larger business customers and will take into account wholesale electricity market conduct, price and cost issues where relevant. The terms of reference provided to the ACCC will direct them to consider the key cost drivers of retail electricity pricing, the existence and extent of any entry barriers in retail markets, the impact of vertical integration, whether there is any behaviour preventing or limiting competition or consumer choice, the profitability of electricity retailers  and whether these profits are commensurate with the risk retailers face, and all wholesalemarket price, cost and conduct issues relevant to the inquiry. The Hinkler electorate has one of the highest numbers of retirees in the nation, but I want to make it very clear to those listening, to members in the House and of course to my constituents: seniors are a valued part of our community. The seniors in our community are the people volunteering and making sure sporting and recreational clubs continue to operate and attract new members. These include clubs like the Bundaberg Bowls Club, which I visited recently to see the upgrade to their shade structures. That upgrade was funded through the very successful Stronger Communities Program, which I am pleased has been extended for a third round. Those new shade structures are a huge benefit to the club for both player comfort and SunWise health outcomes. Not only does the bowls club have its own competitions; the club is used by a number of other groups. The Endeavour Foundation, with 12 to 15 players, uses it twice monthly. Students from North Bundaberg High School-about 80 students a week-use it, as lawn bowls is included as a component of their school sport curriculum. A varying number of NAIDOC children, of mixed ages, use it. They both learn and participate in the game, with the club providing junior bowls sets and rubberised bowls sets for their smaller participants. A group of mature-aged ladies, in varying numbers, takes advantage of the playing facilities and equipment every Wednesday. And periodically there are barefoot social bowling events held by various social groups. And I am sure that my colleague the assistant minister has been to many barefoot bowling events in his time in his local electorate! With an ageing population, the coalition government is committed to providing a sustainable aged-care system that meets the needs of our older Australians. Just last week, the successful applicants in the 2016-17 Aged Care Approvals Round were announced. More senior residents in Hinkler will benefit from an additional $11.4 million for 174 new places in Bundaberg in the north of my electorate-144 residential care places at The Lakes Aged Care and 30 additional residential care places at Kalkie Residential Care Service. This funding will provide new aged care services or enable them to expand their current facilities. This is in addition to funding announced last year for new services in the southern end of the electorate, which are under construction and nearing completion-and can I say they look magnificent. The new residential aged care places followed the announcement of 475 short-term restorative care places, which help older people remain in their homes longer after an injury or illness. It aims to slow functional decline in older people and improve their health and well-being so they can remain independent for as long as possible and avoid prematurely entering permanent residential aged care. Older Australians want and need flexible services that will help them when they need it and encourage independence for as long as possible. These places will help people age well and access care as needed. Under this bill, the pensioner concession card will be reinstated for around 92,300 former pension recipients. Of course, this has been well received by those people in my electorate. Former pensioners who lost entitlement to the pensioner concession card when they ceased being eligible for the pension on 1 January 2017 due to the rebalancing of the pension asset test will once again be eligible for this card. The pension changes were designed to ensure the pension remains sustainable into the future by making it fairer and better targeted. Australians are healthier and living longer than ever before. By 2054-55, one Australian in five will be aged over 65. I think that is something we as a nation should celebrate. By 2054-55, there will  be 2.7 people of working age for every person aged over 65. That means fewer people of working age will be paying tax to support those in retirement. The changes only impact people with significant assets outside of their home who have greater capacity to support themselves. From 1 January 2017 these people were all issued with a health care card and those over age pension qualification age were also issued with a Commonwealth seniors health card. These cards provided the same benefits to the card holder in terms of access to cheaper medicines through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and lower extended Medicare safety net. These cards did not, however, provide access to free hearing services provided by the Department of Health for a range of concessions and benefits provided by states and territories and/or private providers which are available to pensioner concession card holders. The coalition government has decided to reinstate the pensioner concession card for those individuals to maximise concessions to this cohort. Reassuring the pensioner concession card will help overcome this anomaly and help facilitate people to again access these discounts and concessions. Consistent with the health care card and Commonwealth seniors health card they have now, the pensioner concession card will be automatically reissued from 9 October 2017 with an ongoing income and asset test exemption. This amendment will help out those who need assistance with climbing electricity bills. It will go a long way to assist pensioners in managing their daily budgets. I commend the bill to the House. Mr BRIAN MITCHELL (Lyons) (17:09): I rise to speak on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Energy Assistance Payment and Pensioner Concession Card) Bill 2017. This government's record when it comes to Australian pensioners is a national disgrace. Australian pensioners helped build this country. Their reward under this government has been an all-out assault on their living standards. For four years, this government has tried to cut the incomes of Australian pensioners. Every step of the way, Labor has been there standing guard to shield Australian pensioners from this government's assaults on their cost of living. Labor opposed this government's attempt to change indexation that would have seen pensioners lose $80 in income over 10 years. Labor opposed this government's attempt to reset the deeming rate thresholds that would have seen 500,000 pensioners worse off. Labor opposed this government's reduction in assets tests that cut the pension for 330,000 pensioners today and will cut pensions for a million retirees within a decade. Labor opposed and opposes this government's attempt to increase the pension age to 70. And Labor opposes this government's continuing attempt to abolish the annual $365 energy supplement for single pensioners-a supplement introduced by a Labor government. Every time this government has assaulted the incomes and conditions of Australian pensioners, Labor has been there to defend them. Labor is not opposing the bill before the House today. We will not deny pensioners this very modest one-off payment that they will receive as a result of the passage of this bill through the parliament. This one-off Energy Assistance Payment is supposed to assist pensioners with the rapidly and steeply rising cost of electricity across Australia. But let's put it in perspective. It is a $75 one-off payment. That equates to $1.44 a week or 20c a day. The pensioners of Australia who are battling crippling increases in power prices and other costs of living will no doubt be delirious with gratitude. Compare that one-off payment to the $30-a week increase in the pension that occurred under the last Labor government: a one-off $75  payment under the Liberals, a $1,560 pension increase under Labor; 20c a day under the Liberals, $4.27 a day under Labor. But let's go further. The government expects Australian pensioners to be grateful for this $75 one-off payment when, in July, millionaires will be getting a $16,000 a year tax cut. That is 20c a day for pensioners and $44 a day for millionaires. What about those other battlersthe corporations and the banks? This government wants to give them $65 billion in tax cuts over the next 10 years-20c a day for pensioners, $44 a day for millionaires and $18 million a day for corporations and banks. What a stark illustration of this government's priorities when it comes to the public purse: spend less on pensioners, less on school children, less on apprentices, less on university students but more on millionaires and multinationals. What is worse is that the government had to have its arm twisted into making even this modest payment. This $75 payment is not a Liberal idea and not a Nationals idea for that matter either. It is part of a deal that the government did with the crossbenchers to get their company tax handout through the Senate. This government's preference would have been to see corporations and banks get a $65 billion tax cut and pensioners get a big fat zero. And a big fat zero is what awaits the more than half a million Australians surviving on Newstart. For some reason that escapes me, they do not receive even this modest $75 one-off payment. Excuse me, but do people looking for work not struggle with power bills? What reason beyond meanness or political expediency can there be to deny people on Newstart this payment? The meanness, the miserliness of this government when it comes to the poor in this nation knows no bounds. Similarly, the largesse knows no bounds when it comes to rewarding the wealthy and the powerful.",85
154,Mr Broad,BILLS,"It doesn't grow on trees. Mr BRIAN MITCHELL: I will take the interjection from the member. Money does not grow on trees. Apparently $65 billion grows on trees. You are happy to hand that back to the banks and the corporations. We need to address a fundamental mistruth that this government peddles-that terrible lie of lifters and leaners from this government, that awful labelling of pensioners as a 'burden' on society. Pensioners are not a burden on society. They have helped build our society. Whether in a lifetime of paid work or looking after a home or volunteering for a charity or a school, pensioners are valuable members of our society and they deserve to be treated with respect, and they deserve society's support when times get tough. No-one in Australia should have to choose between affording food and affording electricity, between affording a pet and affording a car, between affording a gift for a grandchild and affording a day out with friends. We are an extraordinarily wealthy countrya wealth that our pensioners helped create. And we can-and we should and we must-do better. Pensioners are hardly living the high life. The current rate of a full age pension, including pension supplements and the energy supplement, is $888.30 per fortnight for singles and $669.60 for each eligible member of a couple-for singles, $444 a week for rent, petrol, bills, food and everything else. And all of us in this chamber receive close to $300 a night for staying here. So, $444 a week for pensioners to meet every expense they have, when we get $300 a night to cover our motel and a bit of transport maybe-well, no; the Comcars are free-when you talk about money not growing on trees",93
155,Mr Broad,BILLS,"Are you going to give it away?  Mr BRIAN MITCHELL: Well, you put forward the bill and we will have a look at it. According to a 2016 report by ACOSS, Poverty in Australia, 36.1 per cent of people receiving social security payments were living below the poverty lineMr Broad interjecting",93
156,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," Order! The member for Lyons has the call and will be heard in silence. Mr BRIAN MITCHELL: including 55 per cent of those receiving Newstart allowance, 51.5 per cent of those receiving parenting payment, 36.2 per cent of those receiving disability support pension, 24.3 per cent of those receiving carer payment and 13.9 per cent of those on the age pension. People are doing it tough when they have to depend on social security. In my electorate, pensioners Kaye and Barry Smith live in Buckland, and they told the local newspaper that even a 15 per cent hike in power bills-and they are going up more than that, generally, across the nation-will costMr Taylor interjecting Mr BRIAN MITCHELL: Well, you talk to some of the people who came to my office today: 250 per cent gas bill increases under your government's mismanagement. A 15 per cent hike in their power bill will cost Barry and Kaye Smith an extra $300 a year, an extra cost that they say they cannot afford. In their words: We would be struggling to have to take a huge increase in power at this time of our lives … We have to put away nearly 300 [dollars] a fortnight and that's to cover our gas, our power, our water and our rates and that doesn't cover our private health fund or ordinary living expenses. … We own our own home, we don't have huge debts but even so we can't take huge power increase considering the pension has only gone up $5 a fortnight each. There is a $16,000 tax cut coming for millionaires, and five bucks for pensioners. Woo-hoo; you blokes are great! Mr Smith said that the couple already had to stick to a tight budget, and: If you're careful with your money you can survive but … you can't afford to waste it … Is that really the best we can do for our pensioners-to give them enough to scrape by on, to pay them just enough to keep them from going hungry? I think we can do better. But what is this bill all about? It is broken into two parts, a once-off Energy Assistance Payment to 1.7 million age pensioners and people on the disability support pension, parenting payment single and veterans payments-notably, not Newstart recipients-and the reinstatement of pensioner concession cards to more than 92,000 pensioners. First the EAPwell, let's be clear: this bill is a shallow attempt to distract Australians from the fact that this government still wants to axe Labor's $365-a-year energy supplement to new pensioners. We are not going to stop payments to people who need them, and we all know that energy costs are skyrocketing and that this government is simply failing to act. In Tasmania, residential energy pricing rose by 46.5 per cent from the end of 2007 to July 2016, far outpacing other household economic indicators, like wage growth. Even the Tasmanian Liberal government-not well known for its insight-has listened to the state Labor opposition on skyrocketing power prices that are crippling families and small businesses. Unfortunately, the state liberal government solution is not a long-term policy but, like this $75 one-off payment, it is a politically motivated 12-month freeze on power prices.  Tasmanian Labor leader, Rebecca White, says that long-term certainty is needed and I agree wholeheartedly with her. These one-off short-term proposals are not the future solution that we need. Rebecca White could be talking about this government-cynical, short-term decision making on the run that is designed to get passed an election. Labor will vote for this bill because at the least-and it is the very least-it will put $75 into the hands of pensioners. But if anyone here seriously thinks it is going to be regarded as manna from heaven, they are sorely mistaken. Power prices are doubling and tripling and this payment will barely scratch the surface. It is $1.44 a week, or 20c a day-it is better than nothing, but only just. The real story of this bill is the government's determination to try to axe Labor's $365 energy supplement to new pensioners. The government will no doubt point to this one-off payment to say, 'See! It's not needed. We're doing something-we're looking after pensioners.' But axing the energy supplement to new pensioners will both create a red-tape nightmare and, worse, entrench inequality. ACOSS notes in its submission to the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Omnibus Savings and Child Care Reform) Bill 2017 inquiry, where the $365 cut was first touted: … rather than applying only to new income support claimants, it would apply to anyone who started receiving a payment from 20 September 2016. These people would therefore experience a loss in income. Cessation of the supplement would also create two levels of payment because most existing recipients would continue to receive the supplement. This would create inequity as two people in the same circumstances would receive different rates of payment and would add further complexity to an already complicated income support system. It is a one-off payment that will not help with the ongoing rises in energy pricing for our communities' most vulnerable. As for the pensioner concession card, I am very happy to see it come back. It should never have gone out in the first place! On 1 January this year more than 92,300 former pension recipients and 3,600 veterans who received payments lost their pensioner concession cards and their eligibility for payments. In my electorate of Lyons, 1,460 pensioners were made worse off by these cuts, and for two years Labor has highlighted this issue. This government has come late to the party. It is Labor, boosted by the hard work of Australian pensioners and their advocates, that has forced the coalition into this backflip. So it is a victory, and we welcome it. But it is another embarrassing backflip for this government. The 1 January date was not just about pensioners and veterans losing some or all of their payments, the biggest impact was the loss of the pension card. Without the pension card you cannot access discounted medicines, discounted dental treatment, discounted council rates, discounted water bills, discounted electricity bills, discounted registration, discounted public transport, reduced driver's license fees or a $52 a year subsidy to assist with heating costs. Those all went out the window for people on low incomes because of this government's abject stupidity and meanness. In some cases-in many cases-those changes whacked a couple of thousand dollars in bills onto people who were already on very tight and stretched budgets. In the 2015 budget speech, then Treasurer Joe Hockey said that anyone who currently had a pensioner concession card would continue to receive a concession card that provides the same benefits, such as subsidised utilities and transport. He said that in his 2015 budget speech. But  it turns out that Mr Hockey misled pensioners, and now the government has had to scramble to fix the problem. We should not be surprised; this is the same government born from the lie that said no cuts to pensions, no cuts to health and no cuts to schools. And yet here we are, four years later, with this disgrace of a government. We are backing this bill-we will welcome any increase in payments to pensioners-but it really is nothing to be proud of.",94
157,Mr HOGAN,BILLS," I came in here early, because I thought I had better come here for the previous member's speech, to see if they finished early, so I could stand up. All I can say is, that is 15 minutes I am never going to get back. Before I come to the point, I will say: that ideological diatribe-where are we at? Very sadly, where is the Australian Labor Party at? I mean, the diatribe that comes out of their mouths-I think Bob Hawke and Paul Keating would be asking, 'Where are these guys coming from?' The Bob Hawkes and the Paul Keatings were the people who started company tax cuts. Do you know why they did that? They started company tax cuts because they understood",96
158,Unknown,BILLS,Honourable members interjecting,96
159,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, Order! The member for Page has the call.,96
160,Mr HOGAN,BILLS,"They understood that when you cut company tax rates, as has been well proven-I will send the data to you on what they did-it increases the private sector's pie. We used to collect more company tax. When Keating started slashing company tax ratesslashing; he did not cut it-within two or three years we were collecting more money in company tax than we were before. And not only were we collecting more money but it was a bigger contribution to the economy, because you cannot tax your way to prosperity. I am sorry, but some people have to do well in a community. Some companies have to make a lot of money, and some people have to make a lot of money, for a community to do well. Shock, horror, gasp, God forgive us all! Do you know what else happens? Do you know who funds every pension? Do you know who funds every welfare recipient? Do you know who funds every school? Do know who funds every hospital? Do you know who funds every defence dollar we spend? Do you know who funds all that? It is the companies and the private individuals that do well. I will draw a distinction for you here, too-and it might be a shock. It is the people in the private sector, the workers in the private sector-not the ones in the public sector; they take money from the people in the private sector. And do you know what? We need the private sector to do well. Let me give you some examples. I did not know how I was going to get to 15 minutes on this, but I think I am going to be fine now. Let me give you a few history lessons, too. About 100-odd years ago-I cannot remember exactly-Marx came up with this idea: let's have everyone be equal. It is not okay that the rich, bourgeois set have more than the others. So, they tried that. They tried it for a few decades in a few places. The Chinese thought that maybe it was not a very good idea. The Russians decided as well that it was not working too well, because when you go to work and the guy who sits next to you does nothing and you do a lot and you both get the same-it did not seem to work. I actually asked a friend of mine the other day to give me a good example, because I think that friend thinks a lot like those opposite-but I like the person anyway! I said, give me a good example on the globe right now of what you think works well. This person is also a  university professor-which makes me worry about our education system! Do you know what example they gave? Cuba. They said that Cuba is a good example of this; that is our shining light. God help us! God help us, with the corruption in Cuba. I said, it is funny, because I do not see people trying to get to Cuba. I see a lot of people trying to get out of the joint, but not a lot trying to get into the joint. Anyway, that is 15 minutes that I will not get back, but the politics of envy is working well for you, and I encourage you if you believe that. So be it, but it is not a great contribution to the growth of our country. Let me get back to the bill. I have spoken for five minutes, and that is good, because I was not sure I was going to get to 15. The Energy Assistance Payment is important, as has previously been said. And I do want to talk a bit later about the energy market and the national grid, because we face great challenges with our energy market. Some of the state RET targets are really distorting our grid. It is interesting: whenever I talk to some members of the Greens, the answer to every question-'How did you get to work today?'-is 'renewable energy'. What time is it? Renewable energy. Renewable energy is a good and admirable thing that we need to encourage. We certainly need to grow that industry, because it is a transition. We are in a transition from fossil fuels, coal and other sources like nuclear and renewable energy. We are in a transition from fossil fuels, coal and other sources like nuclear to renewable energy. I think one day, when we have the battery storage technologythe world is obviously trying to solve this issue of battery storage capabilities with renewable energy-that will then transform it. The danger we have at the moment is we are placing ourselves in a very delicate situation where we are mandating targets of an energy source that is intermittent, and that is causing distortions. I think the greatest distortion we have seen examples of is in South Australia, because they have a pretty gung-ho approach with this. They now have nearly 50 per cent of their energy sources coming from renewables. That seemed very admirable. They thought that was a lovely thing to do because of other reasons. But, as we saw a number of times in the last summer, when we rely so much on an intermittent energy source-that is the problem; it is an intermittent energy source because we do not have the technology yet to store energy from these intermittent sources like wind and solar-we are placing ourselves in great vulnerability. We have seen a couple of times lately the consequences in South Australia. It has also obviously meant that the cost of energy in certain places has gone up. Let me go back to the assistance payment. This is going to be available to recipients of the aged pension, the disability support pension and the parenting payment single, and to veterans and their partners paid the service pension, the income support supplement and relevant compensation payments who are eligible for payment residing in Australia on 20 June 2017, the test date, to assist them with their energy costs. We are very conscious that we need to assist people who do have tight budgets to cover rising energy costs. The assistance will be paid at $75 for singles and $62.50 for each member of a couple, providing additional assistance to around 3.8 million Australians, including 2½ million aged pension recipients, 770,000 disability support pension recipients, 260,000 parenting payment single recipients and 235,000 recipients of veterans' payments. To be eligible, one has to be a recipient of one of the qualifying payments and residing in Australia on the test date of 20 June. Those qualified will automatically receive a payment through Centrelink or the Department of Veterans' Affairs and they will not need to take any  action; no claim is necessary. The payment will not be taxed and will not reduce their rate of income support. For those people who have made a claim for payment on or before the test date and have subsequently had that claim granted, it will also be paid as the one-off payment. Legislation ensures that a person cannot receive more than one entitlement. People who are not in receipt of a payment because they are suspended on the test date will not be eligible. Qualifying veterans will include those receiving disability pension; the war widower's pension under the Veterans' Entitlements Act; the permanent impairment compensation, the special rate disability pension or highly dependent partner payments under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act; or permanent impairment compensation under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act on the test date. The second schedule of this bill is the pensioner concession card. This bill is going to reinstate the card to around 92,300 former pension recipients who ceased being eligible for the pension on 1 January 2017 due to the rebalancing of the pension assets test. They will once again be eligible for this card. This consists of 88,000 former pensioners paid by the Department of Social Services and 3,600 former pensioners paid by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. From 1 January these people were all issued with a health care card. Those over the aged pension qualification age were also issued the Commonwealth seniors health card. From the Commonwealth perspective, these cards provide the same benefits to the cardholder in terms of access to cheaper medicines through the PBS scheme and the lower extent of the Medicare safety net. These cards do not, however, provide access to free hearing services provided by the Department of Health or a range of concessions and benefits provided by states, territories and private providers which are available to pension concession card holders. The government has decided to reinstate the pension concession cards to maximise concessions to these people. Whilst eligibility criteria for concession cards are set by the Commonwealth government, the decision to use certain Commonwealth government concession cards as the trigger or as a vehicle for targeting state and territory concessions is a choice made by the state and territory governments and other private providers. State concessions on rates, utilities, motor vehicle registrations and public transport are all determined by the type of card you hold. Due to the decisions of the state and territory governments and/or the private providers, some concessions available to pensioner concession card holders are not available to holders of other types of concession cards, including a health care card and Commonwealth seniors card. Re-issuing the pensioner concession card will help overcome this anomaly and help facilitate people gaining access to these discounts and concessions. This is going to cost $3.1 million over two years to reinstate the pensioner concession cards to these people, former pension recipients whose pension is cancelled. This is an expense that obviously we as government think we should make, to go a long way to assist them in managing their budgets. Consistent with the health care card and Commonwealth seniors card they have now, the pensioner concession card will be automatically reissued from 9 October 2017, with an ongoing income and assets test exemption. To maintain their current Commonwealth benefits, those former pensioners issued with a Commonwealth seniors health card will also retain that card. As the pensioner concession card provides all the benefits the health care card, the health care card will become redundant and will be deactivated for those former pensioners issued with a health care card on 1  January 2017. The eligibility requirements will ensure that these former pensioners will maintain ongoing eligibility to the standalone pensioner concession card, but still have to meet some of the conditions in place for usual pensioner concession card holders. The conditions include portability requirements, where cardholders would have their card suspended after being overseas for six weeks. The card will be reactivated on return to Australia. The pensioner concession card will also be cancelled if the cardholder is in jail. I commend the bill to the House.",96
161,Mr NEUMANN,BILLS," I rise to speak in relation to the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Energy Assistance Payment and Pensioner Concession Card) Bill 2017. In doing so, I say that we support the second reading amendment and we condemn those opposite for a history of neglect and indifference towards pensioners. While so many people have been doing it tough and feeling the pressure, it is hard to argue that anyone in Australian society has been feeling it more than pensioners. I have spoken to many pensioners in the mobile offices I have been doing as I do the country show runs-the Ipswich show, Kilcoy show, Esk show, Marburg show; and I have Toogooloowah, Lowood and Rosewood to go. I have spoken to hundreds of people during those times. Pensioners tell me how hard they are doing it. They are anxious and concerned. Energy prices have gone up, inflation exceeds wage growth and they are doing it harder. It is hard to argue that we have not gone backwards in the last four or five years under this government, both nationally and in the household budgets of the country. There are people who are being disappointed and let down by this government. I think pensioners are among those who have been let down by this government. A segment of our society who need to be venerated and thanked for the contribution they have made to our economy and society has been let down badly by a government which seems afflicted by a desire to inflict cuts on pensioners' household incomes. We will support the measures in this bill. Why wouldn't we? It helps disability support pensioners; it helps aged pensioners; it helps those on parenting payment single, and veterans as well. Labor always wants to look after pensioners, so we will not for a minute let those opposite forget and let pensioners forget what the member for Warringah and the member for Wentworth have done under their governments in the last four years in relation to pensioners. We will not forget their repeated attempts to cut the pension by any means possible, whether it is a change in indexation, a change in the assets test or freezing payments for pensioners wanting to travel overseas. We will not forget that they are as eager as ever to ditch the energy supplement for some of the neediest Australians. We will not forget that they still, to this day, believe that Australians should be made to work until they are 70-longer than in any other country in the developed world. This government has time and time again shown that they are more than willing to make pensioners the very first to lose out whenever they need to save a few dollars; all at a time when they feel they can afford to give away $65.3 billion in taxpayers' money that was expected to be paid in years to come by big corporates in this country. So they can afford to give away that sort of income when they could have been funding schools and pensions better, could have been funding hospitals and infrastructure better. This government's priorities seem very much out of kilter with Australia's expectations and certainly the expectations of Australian pensioners. Australian pensioners know that this  government and this Prime Minister cannot be trusted. I think their knowing that is afflicting this government, and you can tell by their tone and by the opinion polls. If anyone at all still needs an example of how detached the government's claims of fairness are, that example is what they have delivered and what they have done with the energy assistance payment. It is proof to all of what they are doing. We will not oppose a one-off $75 payment to pensioners, or $62.50 to each individual of a couple. We will not object to thatevery little bit helps those who are trying to put food on the table, pay for their electricity, and meet their car registration and utility payments. We will not begrudge them that, but that is not nearly enough to compensate for the $365 a year-not just a one-off payment; a year-cut this government wants to perpetrate and inflict upon Australian pensioners by getting ready rid of the energy supplement. Never forget that under the Howard government pensioners might have got a small supplement at budget time, but the age pension really was far too low-and not just the age pension; payments for those on disability support, the carers payment, veterans' service pensions and other pensions were far too low, and that is what the Harmer review said. It came to pass that when we were in government, back on 20 September 2009, a government decided for the first time in many years to assist single pensioners and pensioner couples. Labor decided to assist pensioner couples, and singles, with a $32.49 a week single pension increase and a $10.14 a week increase for pensioner couples combined who were on the full rate. We did that because the Harmer review recommended that that was what should happen. Those opposite seem determined to cut pensions. We know they still want to cut the energy supplement for over 1.7 million Australians, pensioners included. Why do we know that? Because it is written in the budget. Those opposite seem during question time and on other occasions oblivious to what is actually written in the budget. For example, they seem to deny the $22 billion in the education cuts for primary and high schools in this country which are clearly stated in the government's own documentation. We know it is in the budget. Just last week the independent Parliamentary Budget Office confirmed during Senate estimates that getting rid of the energy supplement is still one of the government's yet to be legislated zombie cuts. It is clear that the Prime Minister is giving with one warm hand but taking away, coldly, with the other. The energy supplement is relied upon by some of the most vulnerable Australians to cope with the sadly and tragically increasing energy costs we are seeing around the country. Getting rid of it represents over $1 billion in cuts to pensioners, Newstart recipients and other vulnerable Australians. Single pensioners will lose $365 a year, or $14.10 a fortnight. Couples will lose $550 a year, or $21.20 a fortnight. These are cuts locked into the budget-it is in black and white for all to see-which the government will push through as soon as it gets the chance. Labor will oppose these cuts. This might not sound like much to those opposite, who feel they can afford to give away $65.3 billion in corporate tax cuts, but for pensioners living in Ipswich and the Somerset region, struggling to get through the week, it will be a hard-felt hit to their financial capacity to meet their household needs. The government seems to be trying to rob the pensioners of this payment at the same time as many advocacy services, including ACOSS, have written to the Prime Minister about the matter. ACOSS said in their letter:  A clear message from the reaction to the 2014 Budget and the 2016 Election was that the community expects budget measures to be fair and equitable. People are deeply concerned about growing inequality in Australia. It is therefore alarming that the Government is cutting social security payments to those on the lowest incomes by removing the Energy Supplement, including people struggling on Newstart, and at the same time proposing to cut taxes for those on higher incomes. That includes giving millionaires a $16,400-a-year benefit by the removal of the deficit levy from 1 July. They are doing that at a time when the gross debt in this country is $493 billion. The deficit-which they promised in their first year and every year thereafter to eliminate with a surplus-is about 10 times bigger than they projected it would be this year. That is an abject failure of economic management and responsibility for those opposite. Despite the hurt that getting rid of the energy supplement will do, the Prime Minister still has the arrogance to claim that what he is delivering is fair for all Australians and particularly for seniors. Fairness seems to be a word that has penetrated somehow the lexicon and nomenclature of those opposite in their speeches and everything they do, including their press releases. I think it is a desperate attempt by the government to try and distract pensioners from the government's consistent and repeated attacks on their income. But, if the Prime Minister thinks people will not notice the difference between this one-off payment and the ongoing, yearly substantial assistance that the energy supplement he proposes to cut will impact, he is kidding himself. The fact that he thinks he can get away with such a significant cut straight out of the pockets of seniors shows just how out of touch the Prime Minister and this government is. Schedule 2 of the bill, which restores the pensioner concession card, is a much overdue backflip by the government. I smile because I find it extraordinary. Many of us were here when the member for North Sydney said this would not happen: 'Those on the pension concession card will continue to receive the concession card, the same benefits, such as subsidised utilities and transport'. We knew it was not true. It was not true for about 92,000 Australians, who attended our electorate offices and I dare say those opposite. They instead lost their usual benefits-concessions in terms of registration, utilities and a whole range of other concessions. They were stuck on the low-income healthcare card or the Commonwealth seniors health card. As a result they lost so many essential government funded hearing tests as well as other vital concessions. It varied from state to state, but I dare say pensioners contacted electorate offices all around the country. It was a shamble of a reform. The government got it wrong, and as a result of this they are backflipping in this budget. As recently as last December, the Minister for Human Services was still trying to avoid taking any action; he was looking to shift the burden of fixing this government's mistakes back to the states, territories and local governments. But they saw the light, and a sort of Damascus-road-conversion experience was had in May 2017, and all of a sudden they decided to change it. I commend groups like National Seniors and others who have been keeping up the fight for years in relation to senseless change. Thanks to them-and those opposite can even thank us, because we have been campaigning on this issue for a while-thousands and thousands of pensioners, and many who have come into my electorate offices, are sick of being treated as second-class citizens. I am pleased the government has undertaken this change. It is about time and long overdue.  But this is not the first time the government tried something like this. Who can ever forget what this government did to 330,000 age pensioners who had their age pension entitlements cut-and about 100,000 of those lost their entitlements entirely? It was a $2.43 billion cut in income support for pensioners. This was as a result of a deal that the government did with those opposite in the corner over there-there is one of them, the member for Melbourne. The government attacked the Greens relentlessly and yet were quite happy to do deals in relation to a whole range of issues: the Malaysian solution, cutting incomes for pensioners, raising the debt ceiling. I could go on and on. There are so many other deals they were prepared to cut with the Greens, yet they criticised them mightily in relation to issues. Again, pensioners lost out entirely as a result of that. We opposed those cuts to pensions. And that was part of the 92,000 people who lost the pension concession card as well. This is a government that does all kinds of things in relation to pensioners. The age pension change saw 236,000 people worse off by an average of $130 per fortnight or $3,380 per year-an extraordinary thing. There was $2.43 billion in income support ripped away from pensioners. In that context I really do not understand why the former Prime Minister, the member for Warringah, had the gall to get up before the 2013 election and promise no changes to pensions. That act of deception is something that pensioners will not forgive or forget in a hurry. Who could ever forget the 2014 budget, when they tried to change the indexation of the pension to bring it back down to CPI? We opposed that and managed to block it. Instead of the pension being indexed by the higher rate of PBLCI or a percentage of male total average weekly earnings, the government decided to use the CPI as the only means by which pensions could increase, which would have resulted in pensioners being $80 a week worse off within a decade. We fought and opposed that. The government seem to be lacking in focus and lacking in their understanding of fairness to pensioners. They do not understand how they attempted to hurt pensioners through their absurd zombie cuts. I think the most stupid thing they have tried to do is to raise the retirement age, expecting labourers in the construction industry, nurses and police officers-a whole range of professions-to work to 70 years of age. I cannot believe this government wants to raise the pension age to 70. We will never stand between low-income pensioners and extra assistance. That is why we will support this legislation. It is about time the government looked at their attitude to pensioners in this country. Mr CRAIG KELLY (Hughes) (17:51): Listening to the member for Blair's contribution reminds me of the parallel universe that members of the Labor Party live in. They seem to think that money just grows on trees or that the government has a big printing press and that we can just keep borrowing money. They fail to realise that the gross incompetence of the glory years of the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd governments left the incoming government with an interest bill of over $1 billion every month. We are trying to pay it down. The bill that those opposite left us means that we have to find $1 billion every month. The Labor Party do not have the foggiest clue about this. They think you can just spend, spend, spend and that the coalition government will come in and clean up their mess. We cannot continue to borrow and spend in the way that the Labor Party want to. Time after time we have heard the member for Blair perpetuating the myth about the cuts to education. I call on all Labor members of good conscience not to do what the member for  Blair has just done in this debate and spread the myth that funding to schools is being cut. If the Labor Party want to borrow more money to give more money to schools, thereby increasing the debt, that is a fair enough argument. But do not go around to schools in your electorate and tell them the untruth that their funding is being cut. You are scaring children and their parents by telling complete untruths. Tell them the truth: the funds they are getting are going up. The coalition is increasing the money that they get. If you want to, say that you will borrow money and spend more, but for goodness sake do not tell them the untruth that their funding is being cut. I turn to the specifics of the bill. It will provide a one-off energy assistance payment to recipients of the age pension, disability support pension and parenting payment single, together with recipients of various veterans' payments, who are payable and residing in Australia on 20 June 2017. Approximately 3.8 million people will receive a one-off energy assistance payment, including approximately 2.5 million age pensioners, 770,000 disability support pensioners, 260,000 parenting payment single recipients and 235,000 Veterans' Affairs clients. The total cost is $269 million. The rate of payments will be $75 for singles and $62.50 for a member of a couple. It is anticipated that most of those 3.8 million people will receive the payments by 30 June 2017. Why is this necessary? Let us have a look at the increasing cost of electricity and where that has come from over recent years. We are having a transformation in our electricity sector. It is a transformation from one of the lowest cost and most reliable electricity sectors in the world to one of the highest cost and most unreliable energy sectors in the world-especially in South Australia. Let us have a look at what has happened over the last 20 years, and why this is necessary. Firstly, the data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics-the catalogue number is 6401.05-tells us that in the Howard government period, almost 12 years from March 1996 to December 2007, we had an increase of 34 per cent in electricity prices. That is less than three per cent a year. Then we come to those glory years of the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd governments. What happened to electricity prices during those six sorry years? From December 2007 to September 2013 the increase was 118 per cent. How does any government, no matter how incompetent they are, allow electricity prices to increase by 118 per cent over a period of six years? This must be some type of record. If we look at the trophy cabinet of the Rudd-GillardRudd governments, one of their greatest achievements must have been to increase electricity prices by 118 per cent over that period. That is some mean feat. The member for Blair talked about sad and tragic increases in electricity prices. It all happened under the government that he was part of. What has happened since then? Again, from the official Australian Bureau of Statistics figures we see that from September 2013 to the latest figures of March 2017, in that four years there has been a 2.6 per cent increase. The coalition has been here for four years, and we have had a 2.6 per cent increase. The Labor Party, in the six years before that, had a 118 per cent increase. And Labor members come in here and whinge about increasing electricity prices. We had the largest increase in electricity prices in the nation's history under their watch, and possibly, I would say that you would be hard pressed to find any other country, during any other period of time in history, when electricity prices have increased as much as that.  Where are we going from here? I would like to think that we have capped electricity prices and we have been able to stop these terrible increases that we saw under the previous Labor government. But the sad reality is that, although we have succeeded for the last four years, there are very large and substantial electricity price increases coming down the track. Delta Energy has highlighted them. They estimate over the next 12 months increases in costs for consumers in South Australia of $1 billion; in Victoria $2.8 billion additional costs for electricity; in New South Wales they will be paying $4 billion.",99
162,Mr Husic,BILLS,"Why did Mike Baird resist the drop in prices? The Australian Energy Regulator wanted to drop energy prices. Mr CRAIG KELLY: The member for Chifley interjects. In the state that I the member for Chifley come from people will be paying $4 billion in additional electricity costs. In Queensland it is an extra $2 billion in extra electricity costs. These are the costs estimated to come through in the next couple of months. Mr Taylor interjecting Mr CRAIG KELLY: The member for Hume asks why this is happening. Well, I will tell him. It is because of the renewable energy target. It increases costs in three ways. I will go through the three ways in which it increase costs. Firstly, there are the direct subsidies. The direct subsidies under the renewable energy target are $3 billion a year. And what about the subsidies to solar? The Grattan Institute report from May 2015 says: … lavish government subsidies plus the structure of electricity network tariffs means that the cost of solar PV take-up has outweighed the benefits by almost $10 billion. Not $10 million but $10 billion. It continues: … purchasing, installing and maintaining the solar PV systemsmost of which are imported from Chinauntil 2030 will cost $18.7 billion, outweighing the benefits by more than double. The subsidies are particularly unfair when many renters, apartment dwellers and low-income households are unable to gain the benefits of solar PV. That is the cost. This has to be paid. We have this fantasy belief that anything seen as renewable energy is somehow wonderful. We have this renewable energy target, but what we really need is an affordable energy target. We in this nation need to say what is an affordable price for Australian consumers to pay for their electricity. That should be the thing we look at first and foremost before we build another wind turbine-which often are completely and utterly useless.",104
163,Mr Katter,BILLS,"Bird killers! Bird catchers! Mr CRAIG KELLY: The member for Kennedy is exactly right; they are bird choppers. Several times this month the total electricity being generated by the 1,000 wind turbines that we have around this country, spread from South Australia. I see the member for Port Adelaide is here-to Tasmania, Victoria and New South Wales was zero. That is not enough to run one 20-watt light bulb, yet we have spent billions and billions of dollars in subsidies. This is why we must have enough base-load generating capacity in this country. This is why the renewable energy target costs us so much. It undermines base-load generators and they leave the market. That creates uncertainty, along with the policies of the Greens and the Labor  Party, so no-one will invest in base-load electricity generation capacity in this nation. That pushes wholesale prices up, and that is what we are about to see in this nation. We also need a competitive energy target. If we are going to afford all the things that we continually hear being whinged about by the Labor Party, if we want to afford more money for pensions and social security, more money for people who need help, you have to have an economic base that creates the wealth. But what we have done by privatising useless wind turbines and the renewable energy target is make electricity generation in this nation internationally uncompetitive. If we do that, we simply cannot afford all the things that we need. This morning we had another warning, from Glencore, in The Australian Financial Review: Given the current electricity prices and uncertainty around future supply, we need to consider options for shutting our smelter and refinery [and] ship copper anodes direct to market and/or refine at one of our other plants offshore. Offshore means outside of Australia. They said: … the investment environment in Australia has materially changed. The current uncertainty and escalating costs do not support further investment in these assets at this time. Mr Keogh interjecting Mr CRAIG KELLY: And the member over there laughs. You, sir, are a joke! You do not know the damage that you are causing to your nation. You do not understand the damage that you are causing to your constituents. You are an absolute embarrassment to this parliament; you are an embarrassment to this nation. We have people this winter that will not be able to afford turning their heaters on because of the policies of you and the Labor Party. You come into this parliament and you laugh and joke about it. You are an absolute disgrace. I am sick to death of people in the Labor Party coming in here with this whingeing and this whining, and being happy to see electricity prices increase in this nation. It is about time we say how important electricity prices are rather than sit in here and make these smart comments. It is an absolute disgrace. If we going to get this economy firing, if we are going to provide jobs for the young people of this country, if we are going to create the prosperity and wealth that we need, we must have affordable and low-cost energy prices. And that means we must have affordable coal and gas baseload power. We can build as many wind turbines as we like to feel good about ourselves and we can get all warm and fuzzy about it, but unless we have the baseload capacity in this nation our nation is going to go backwards and we are going to be unable to afford all of the things that we want to pay for in this nation. I call on all members of good conscience in this parliament to put aside their ideological biases, to put aside their almost religious belief in wind turbines and to think about the constituents in their electorate that will struggle this winter to afford their electricity bills. Under the previous Labor government, we saw a 100 per cent increase. We have to take strong measures to get electricity prices under control. And if you want to see what happens with the policies of a 50 per cent renewable energy target that the Labor side are promoting, just go and have a look at the disaster that is in South Australia. That gives us a window into the future, and that is not what I want to see from my country. With that, I commend this bill to the House. ",104
164,Mr HILL,BILLS," I would remind the honourable member who we have just listened to that he is, in fact, in the government. He has been in the government for the last four years, so perhaps he has more opportunity than us to do something about the issues that he is raising. Anyway, for those of us who listen to his speeches day in and day out, it is, in fact, the same speech, but perhaps with a different lens. I was sitting here chatting to the whip's office outside thinking there is a cruel form of karma in that every time. I have been on chamber duty the last few weeks and for just about every piece of legislation that I have spoken on the member for Hughes has preceded me. If I was someone who had found a way to believe inMr Craig Kelly: You should think yourself very lucky. I hope you learn something.",106
165,Mr HILL,BILLS,"thank you-a directive form of God then I think that I would need to reflect on what I had done wrong with my life. But I will take it as an unfortunate accident of scheduling. One of the things that all of us have the privilege to do when we are in this place as new members-this is a funny way to start, but I was reflecting on it today-is select a few pieces from the parliamentary art collection for our offices. Being a junior backbencher at the end of the corridor, the books came to me quite near the end when, what some may say, the more famous pieces had already been nabbed by ministers and senior officers. The upside of that was they were quite generous in allowing me to pick three small pieces and count them as one to hang in my foyer. I gave some thought to those three pieces and determined that I would choose three pieces that reminded me of particular groups in my electorate for whom, above all else, I must do my utmost to remember in my service here. Of the three pictures I chose, one was of a young person-you might say somewhere between 16 and 20-entering adulthood, drifting into the prime of life with everything before them, embodying the hopes of their families. Another, given my electorate, was a very famous photograph of migrants arriving in Sydney, because my electorate has the highest proportion of migrants of any in this parliament. The third one I chose was a beautiful, evocative picture of an older couple. It reminded me of my grandma and grandpa sitting in the corner of their lounge room in front of the piano with all the kind of knick-knacks of a life, as they were in their twilight years. The expressions on their faces are somewhat inscrutable but betray, I think, a degree of pride and resilience at whatever they have done with their lives. They look like working-class people-humble people. So the need to look after pensioners and older Australians has always been something in the short time that I have been here that I have been determined to remember. Pensioners are amongst the most aggrieved of any group of people who come into my office or who I see in the community-and they do have strong competition. We could talk about the young, we could talk about those who are about to lose penalty rates or we could talk about any Victorian who is looking for a fair share of infrastructure. Certainly pensioners in this country have voiced to me the fact that they feel disrespected and that they feel blatantly lied to. I think former Prime Minister Abbott was elected on a promise of 'no cuts to pensions at all'. There is also a profound lack of recognition of the circumstances and understanding of the sacrifices that pensioners have made. This government's record with pensioners is truly appalling.  The 2014 budget was profoundly unfair. People who have lived a few years are smart. They spot scams when they see them. They understand and have seen before attacks on the vulnerable and what it means to give tax breaks to the top end when they are being asked to bear more burden. But the 2013 promise of no cuts to pensions has been well and truly broken in every single budget that those opposite have handed down. In 2014 they tried to cut indexation, which would have meant that, over 10 years, pensioners would have $80 per week less to live on. That is a cut. In 2014 those opposite also tried to change the deeming rates, which would have hurt 500,000 part-pensioners. They tried to cut $1 billion out of the pensioner concessions. In 2015, there was the shameful deal that the government, the Liberals, did with the Greens political party to hit 330,000 pensioners by changing the assets test-again, breaking a very clear promise not to do these things. That has generated an enormous number of complaints-bitter complaints. People still feel betrayed. Whenever I do a street stall, whenever I am at a railway station or whenever I am out in the community, I can be absolutely sure that not a time will go by without someone coming up to me to explain the impact that these part-pension changes have had on them and how they feel. There are things worse than that-worse often than the dollars. I have had people say to me, 'It's tough but I can do without the $5, $10, $20 or $30, whatever I have lost that week, but please don't take the pensioner concession card off me.' This card provides discounts on a range of things, including, importantly in Victoria, discounts on local council rates and the cost to anyone needing to access Commonwealth hearing services. The discounts will vary from state to state. That was the biggest lie of all, because the government cannot even claim that it was one of those core and non-core promises: 'Oh well, we said a whole lot of stuff before the election, didn't we, Mr Abbott? Some of it we meant, because that was a core promise; but some of it we didn't really mean. We just kind of shot our mouth off. Or it was a case of nudge-nudge, wink-wink, so you can't really believe that.' I do not know how you are ever supposed to tell the difference. But this was not one of those promises. This was a promise made by the Treasurer when those opposite were in government. It was a very clear statement. You would think after all the heat of an election campaign-even if you take the core and non-core promise thesis-and you are in government that you could rely on the word of the Commonwealth Treasurer. Then Treasurer Joe Hockey said: … anyone who currently has a Pensioner Concession Card will continue to receive a concession card that provides the same benefits … But that was not true. People got a Commonwealth seniors health card, but there was no discussion about it with the states and territories whatsoever. Was this sloppy or deliberate? In the great game, we always have to guess: is it conspiracy theory or stuff-up? I usually back stuff-up. But with this, who knows? The anger has got through to the government. They have heard through their backbench, no doubt, about the profound anger of pensioners when, on 1 January, they had to front up and pay their rates and pay more for getting hearing services and so on. So the government slunk back in here and, in the budget, finally fixed their damage and patched it up. However, it does not help the people who, in the last six months, have not had the card and who have had to pay more. There is no recompense for them. Nevertheless, it is a welcome though belated move, and we will vote for it to help the government fix its stuff-up. As a result of the changes to the asset measures, more people in the coming months and years, as revaluations  and so on kick in, will lose the pensioner concession card. They are not going to be helped by this measure, and so the anger will continue. In relation to the one-off payment, the member for Hughes had a little rift going through some of his remarks-why is this necessary?-until we tuned out. The fundamental reason it is necessary is that it was a deal dreamed up to get the company tax cuts through the Senate. It does not really have anything to do with energy, despite the rant. We have heard that rant before. If you could plagiarise against yourself and be accused of it, I am sure we could compare the Hansard of today to the Hansard with most of the other speeches and find very similar sentences. This $75 is a one-off payment. So you get one $75 cheque in the mail-I do not know what that is going to do for many people-but what you lose every year if the government gets its way is $365 as the energy supplement disappears. The member for Lalor was the principal of a school. I do not know whether maths was your discipline. I would be pretty sure that she would attest to the fact that $75 does not equal $365. Opposition members: No?",106
166,Mr HILL,BILLS,"No, it does not. Seventy-five dollars does not equal $365. So we have this pathetic little pea and thimble trick. I would love to go and negotiate or play poker with Senator Xenophon. I was in the parliament for his very first speech many years ago, because my friend Senator Pratt was speaking after him. I have watched him over the years and he seems like quite an amiable and reasonable kind of chap. Sometimes he even makes a bit of sense-rarely, but he does. But you would love to negotiate with him, wouldn't you? There are $25 billion of company tax cuts through-the first tranche of a $65 billion company tax cut plan-and, in return, $75. If the government gets its way, that $75 will go no way to making up for $365 every single year. The government must think people are stupid. Seventyfive dollars, when you give companies a tax cut of $65 billion-with $25 billion being the first down payment-is insulting. I bet they hope that the pensioners will forget the last four years of attacks, cuts and lies. At this point, I really think that the government should thank Labor for saving them from themselves in the Senate in the last few years, because just imagine how angry people would be now if they had passed their legislation and had actually got their way. If they had had their hopes and dreams and their groundhog day and the full bore of the attacks which they had made on pensioners had actually got through this parliament, people would be well on the way to being $80 a week poorer in real terms. That is what the change in indexation means. Of course, it was Labor when in government that finally changed that indexation rate and did the right thing, but the government tried to take it away. Ms Ryan interjecting",108
167,Mr HILL,BILLS,"You are right: Labor did give a pay rise to pensioners. On the deeming rates, 500,000 part-pensioners would be worse off if the government had its way. We are on trackthis is one of the zombie measures that will not go away-to raising the pension age to the age of 70, which would be the world's oldest. This would of course particularly hurt bluecollar labourers, those who toiled all their lives in hard industries and whose bodies may simply not be able to work until 70. It is those people, who we represent, who would be most hurt if the government got its way with these changes.  Retirees going overseas for six weeks would not be very happy, because, if they went away for more than six weeks, their payments would be impacted. But, particularly for my electorate, it would be migrants who would be most picked on. But I think that proposal was one of the zombies that they finally found a way to kill in the budget. I do not think we will have to talk about that again-or at least until comes back at another time. But it would be the migrants who would be most picked on if the changes that the government wanted got through the parliament, because their payments would be impacted for the simple sin of spending time overseas with their families. Imagine being an older person and wanting to spend time with your family in your twilight years, after having worked in the country and contributed. Or imagine caring for a dying relative who might be so rude as not to die within six weeks but actually linger around for three months or six months and you might want to spend those last days with them. Well, if the government had its way, they would be docked on their pension. Fortunately, we have saved the government from themselves on this by convincing enough of the crossbench to do the right thing, hold the line and not let these cuts go through. But the biggest irony of all, from my experience of spending time in the community and talking with pensioners and people affected by all this, is that, overwhelmingly, these are good people. This is a generation that worked hard, whether they were born in Australia or whether they perhaps came here in the post-World War II migration-particularly the Greeks, Italians and Eastern Europeans, who worked every day, who worked multiple jobs, who sacrificed everything for their kids, who saved a bit, who might have bought an extra house, as many of them saved and scrimped, so their kids would have a house as well and they would have something else to pass on. They made sure that their kids got an education and a better life while they went without. These are people who understand the importance of saving. They understand, more than any generation, I would venture-particularly the current lucky generation who have been born in an Australia that has never known a recession, with 25 or 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth. But this generation that the government is so determined to pick on with these changes is the generation that really understands the importance of saving. Many people have said to me, 'You know, I'd be prepared to do my bit.' It is not easy. We have heard what the member for Hughes said about electricity bills. We understand the pressures of rising health costs. We understand, for people who do not own their own home, the difficulties in the rental market and in simply staying in the community where your family is or where you know people, as rents rise. We understand those difficulties. But, they say, 'I would be prepared to sacrifice a few dollars in the national interest. I understand the need for budget repair, post the global financial crisis.' People might even be smart enough to thank the member for Lilley for helping shepherd Australia through in fine shape, using the strength of our balance sheet. So they might be prepared to sacrifice a few dollars-but only if they felt they were treated fairly; if they were not lied to by the government; if the government did not say one thing then do another; if only they felt that the top end of town were also asked to kick in; if they did not see this government, day after day, month after month, year after year, determined to fight to the death to protect the tax breaks for the top end. Remember superannuation? We were evil socialists, picking on people who had saved for their own retirement-I mean, they only had $10 million in the bank; how outrageous it was  to say that they should be made to pay just a little bit of tax on their retirement savings because they had $10 million! Meanwhile, the government's priority was to pick on pensioners. Maybe we could take the current example-because Labor broadly pushed the government there. Maybe if we were prepared to just trim or change some of the negative gearing loopholes that overwhelmingly go to the top end of society, or maybe if we could change capital gains tax, where 70 per cent of the benefit goes to the top 10 per cent of society, then maybe we would believe that the government, the Liberal Party, was not still fulfilling its traditional, historical purpose of protecting those who have wealth, at all costs. But, unfortunately for the government, pensioners see through this. They understand that they are first in line to have a few bucks ripped off them, while the government continues on its way, giving money away to those who need it least and protecting those who have wealth. Nevertheless, we will vote for this, because it is the right thing to do. Mr VAN MANEN (Forde-Government Whip) (18:22): Wow! Another 15 minutes of the culture of complaint from those opposite, who had nothing constructive to add to the debate but were just complaining, whingeing and whining. While the member for Bruce is carrying on about supporting those at the top end of town, he might want to explain to his constituents why he is so against the 0.06 per cent levy on the big banks. Why are they spending so much time in this chamber defending the big banks?",108
168,Mr Leeser,BILLS,"The big end of town! Mr VAN MANEN: Why are they defending the big end of town, as my good colleague to my right has suggested? So he might want to explain that. He might also want to explain why, when 10 per cent of taxpayers pay approximately 60 per cent of all income taxes, they are not carrying their fair share of the burden. So, once again, we have listened to 15 minutes of those opposite, with nothing constructive to say, whingeing, whining and complaining. It is my pleasure to rise in the chamber today to support the coalition government's plan to reinstate the much-needed assistance to pensioners and low-income earners through the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Energy Assistance Payment and Pensioner Concession Card) Bill 2017. This move is testament to the government's commitment to helping those in the Australian community who most need it and are incredibly deserving of all the support we can potentially give them. That is what is so important about what we are trying to do as a government in repairing the budget. We are seeking to ensure that we have the resources and the finances to help those most in need. It might be instructive to remind the member for Bruce, before he leaves the chamber, that it was those opposite who voted against the multinational tax avoidance bills that this government put through this parliament 18 months or so ago. Some $2-billion-odd of additional revenue is being generated so far, and another $4-billion-odd is in the budget that we have just handed down. So those opposite can wax lyrical all they like about support for the big end of town, but they are the ones actually defending the big end of town. They are the ones that have done the deals with unions that have ripped wages and conditions from low-paid workers around the country, whether it is Cleanevent, whether it is Coles or Woolies employees, where they have  traded off their penalty rates and conditions and got paid by the union for the privilege. There is KC and many other workers around this country. Those opposite on many, many occasions have demonstrated very clearly that what they say and what they do are two completely different things. They say they support the workers, but in the end they stab them in the back and allow their wages and conditions to be traded away. This government, through this bill and many other things that we are doing, is looking to ensure that it supports Australians right across the country. This bill will support some 24,000 people in my electorate who have the ability to earn additional income and will become eligible through these changes. They are made up of some 15,000 people on the age pension, some 6,000 people on the disability support pension and a number of others. These payments are not huge, I acknowledge that. But they are a contribution towards the cost of living for people in circumstances who are finding it difficult to make ends meet-in particular, because of the cost of electricity. As the member for Hughes rightly pointed out in his contribution, under those opposite, in their six years of government, we saw electricity prices rise by some 118 per cent, in large part due to the carbon tax that they introduced. We know that their policy is to introduce a 50 per cent renewable energy target, which is only going to do one thing: push electricity prices up further. They say that they increased pensions and other things during the time when they introduced the carbon tax. Well, they did, but that was compensation for the introduction of the carbon tax. When we came into government and abolished the carbon tax, we left those increases in place, including the increase in the tax-free threshold. So again it is a demonstration on this side of the House that we have the runs on the board for supporting those who need that help and support. In abolishing the carbon tax we allowed the tax-free threshold to stay and we maintained those increases in the pension. Australians actually got a real benefit from the changes we made in abolishing the carbon tax. This bill, along with many others that we are introducing through this budget, provides that support and assistance to people across the country. It is important that we continue to work on these changes to help facilitate people accessing the discounts and concessions that were offered by the state and territory governments and private providers. Interestingly, all of these organisations could actually provide these discounts and concessions of their own free will. There was no need for them to abolish those concessions and discounts just because people lost their pension concession card. In some cases, some councils-I give due credit to Logan City Council-did maintain the pensioner discount for a period after the abolition of the pension concession card. But everybody else could still do exactly the same thing today for people who are over age 65 or whatever limit those organisations decide to make as their cutoff. But, as I have said, the purpose of this bill is to reintroduce that so we create clarity and these organisations can once again introduce those discounts and concessions and allow people to get those concessions back. Consistent with the health care card and the Commonwealth seniors health card, the pension concession card will automatically be reissued over time, with the ongoing income and asset test exemption. The reissuing of these cards will come at a cost of some $3.1 million to the budget, but overall this is a small price to pay for ensuring that these people, who need it most, have the support and assistance they need with their daily budgets to ensure they have a reasonable standard of living in retirement.  I spend a lot of time visiting and speaking with pensioners and seniors across my electorate of Forde, particularly with my regular seniors' village visits, which are a highlight across the electorate. I always enjoy getting out to meet them. We enjoy some great coffee and some scones with jam and cream. There is always an interesting, broad discussion over a wide range of topics. Our seniors are very important to our community. Many of them get out into the community and volunteer for many community organisations. I talk to many of them and many of them tell me they almost work harder in retirement than they did when they were working. It is a wonderful contribution we see from these people who have already spent so much of their lives contributing to and building our great country. They continue to make our communities what they are today. Access to financial as well as social support is a big issue for many of these citizens in our community. I am pleased to say that we as a government are seeking to find ways to continue to support these people, to provide that encouragement for them and to help minimise in some respects the impact of cost of living pressures, particularly with rising electricity prices. As we have seen in other parts of the budget, we have made it very clear that we are looking to do things in the energy space to try to put downward pressure on energy prices. Again, as the member for Hughes has outlined, in our time in government, as a comparison to the time of those opposite, the increases in electricity prices have been somewhere around 2½ per cent. I know from talking to people in my electorate that they do not necessarily feel that that is a lived reality. It is important that we provide support to them through these measures and other aspects of the budget to ensure that they feel as if they can have an enjoyable retirement. I commend this bill to the House.",110
169,Ms SWANSON,BILLS," I rise to speak on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Energy Assistance Payment and Pensioner Concession Card) Bill 2017. I speak in support of this bill because it is the very least this government can do for pensioners, given their ongoing campaign against our most vulnerable. This government continues to give with one hand and take away with the other. This is not a win for pensioners, but with this government in power pensioners must take whatever crumbs they are thrown. Schedule 1 of this bill provides a one-off energy assistance payment to recipients of the aged pension, disability support pension, single parenting payments and veterans' payments. It provides $75 for singles and $62.50 for each member of a couple. Labor will of course support the one-off energy assistance payment, but it beggars belief as to why the government would be proposing this when it still wants to cut the energy supplement. The energy supplement is worth far more to pensioners, and yet the government want to cut it. Maybe they think pensioners will not notice they are losing the energy supplement and just feel grateful that they are getting this one-off energy assistance payment. I do not believe pensioners in my electorate of Paterson believe that, and they will not be fooled. Yes, they will happily take the one-off energy assistance payment to compensate for the rising cost of energy-which, again, is this government's fault. Clearly, there is no definite energy policy to guide investment certainty, and we have seen the fallout of that again and again. Pensioners are well aware that they are likely to lose the energy supplement and they are really hopping mad about that. I had 250 pensioners at the Maitland Town Hall recently, and at the top of their list was the cost of living. They asked: 'How are we going to make ends meet? How are we expected to  live?' They said, 'They keep eating away at our pensions.' Every single person who filled in a survey in the Maitland Town Hall for me that day ticked the cost of living as a concern for them. And there's the rub: that word 'fair' has entered the government's vocabulary again, since the recent budget. Well, no-one is convinced that this government knows the meaning of the word 'fair', and no-one is convinced that this budget is fair, least of all pensioners and least of all pensioners in my electorate of Paterson. Let's be clear on this Energy Assistance Payment, because the pensioners in Paterson certainly are. This is a shallow, pathetic and not very convincing attempt to distract Australians from the fact that this government still wants to cut the energy supplement, and it does not have a cohesive energy policy-not for the manufacturers, not for consumers and not for our pensioners. Australian pensioners particularly deserve better than this. Australian pensioners are doing it tough. They tell us all, every day. Australians who receive income support are doing it particularly tough. What kind of heartless government wants to give with one hand and take with the other? It really is quite insulting, and people know it is. They know that their standard of living has slipped. This once-off Energy Assistance Payment will be worth $75 to single pensioners-that is it. Yet the government wants to take $365 a year by removing the energy supplement to new pensioners. A once-off $75 is not the same as $365 every year to keep the lights on, to keep the heater on, to keep the hot water on. Pensioners in my electorate of Paterson have already told me that they are holding off putting on the heater. They get out the knee rug, they put on an extra jumper, just trying to keep warm as the weather starts to cool, because they know it is going to take so much of the little pension that they have. What choice do they have? Sit there and be cold? What sort of country are we living in? Do we expect our pensioners to huddle in the cold instead of turning on the heater because they cannot afford to? I am disgusted. It should not be this hard for people. This is an outrageous affront to pensioners-our most vulnerable, often. This budget confirms that the government still wants to cut the energy supplement, and Labor will continue to oppose it. Our pensioners would expect nothing else, and good on them for the fight they have put up over it. Moving to schedule 2 of this bill, the reinstatement of the pension concession cards: well, what a backstep this has been for the government. Once again, the efforts of Labor and the Australian pensioners have prevailed. It is a small victory, but we will take it, and I am sure Australian pensioners will happily take it. They have to take every little bit they can. Eligibility for the pension concession card is tied to eligibility for certain income support payments, such as the age pension and the disability support pension. When the changes to the pension assets test came in on 1 January this year, a number of pensioners who ceased to be eligible for their payment also lost their pension concession card. In fact, around 92,000 pensioners lost their pensioner card overnight on 1 January-happy new year! In Paterson, my electorate, 3,410 pensioners lost their concession card and were worse off as a result of these assets test changes. Nearly a third of them-1,040 pensioners-had their pensions cancelled entirely, leaving them an average of $191 worse off-here one day, gone the next; happy new year indeed. This assets test change has really distressed pensioners in my electorate. Another 2,370 pensioners in Paterson had their pensions reduced, leaving them worse off by an average of  $135 a fortnight. These are not insignificant numbers, equating to weekly income cuts of between $62.50 and $95.50 a week. Those who lost their pension concession card as a result of the assets test changes were issued with a Low Income Health Care Card. Those who were of pension age or older were issued with a Commonwealth Seniors Health Card. But these cards did not guarantee the same concessions; they are simply not as good. When the government first announced these changes to the assets test the then Treasurer, Joe Hockey, promised that nobody-nobody-would lose their concession entitlements. That was the promise that was made. Well, surprise, surprise: the government did not keep that promise. The government did not negotiate with the states and territories to guarantee concessions to pensioners, to guarantee that pensioners and those who lost their pensions would not be worse off. So, of course, when the assets test changes came in on New Year's Day, many people-in fact, 92,000 Australians-were worse off. As I mentioned, in my electorate of Paterson, 3,410 people-not a small number-were worse off. For example, without a pensioner concession card, people who had lost their pensions were not able to access vital government-funded hearing services. From state to state, different concessions were applied. It was a great big mess and a mess of the government's doing. It is only because of pressure from Labor and from pensioner groups, who have taken the fight up to this government, that the pensioner concession card has been reinstated. It is a big backdown from the government. You can be sure it is not because they are worried about pensioners and worried that it might not be fair; it is only because there was such a backlash and they knew they had no choice but to back down. Pensioner concession cards will automatically be reissued from 9 October-and not a moment too soon. Thank goodness for that and thank goodness for the efforts of Australian pensioners and Labor. This is a victory-some would say a minor one, considering the government's campaign against our most vulnerable, but it is a victory all the same. The loss of the pensioner concession card was a cruel double blow to many people who had lost their pensions and were on very modest incomes. Certainly many pensioners in my electorate of Paterson felt the pinch. It just goes to show where the government's priorities are. They are not particularly concerned about our most vulnerable. They do not care about those on income support. They do not even really care about middle-income Australians. Earlier I heard a member say earlier that someone has to do well and that companies have to make a lot of money so that other people can make money. It is not that we do not want people to do well; we would just like it shared more fairly. We do not believe in looking after the big end of town at the cost of our most vulnerable, because that is not the way successful societies work. In everything we do, in everything we think of, we think of fairness. In everything the government do, the message that they propose is that, if we look after the big end of town, somehow miraculously everyone will do well. We propose that if we look after everyone a little better, then our whole country does much better. It is only when the government get caught out and get dragged to the table that they will negotiate for a better deal for pensioners, tossing some crumbs to those people who are seeing their modest standard of living being further eroded. This government's attack on pensioners is not new; it is not even particularly subtle, but it is sustained-it is a bit like a broken record. In 2014 the Liberals tried to cut pension  indexation, leaving pensioners poorer to the tune of $80 a week over 10 years. The Liberals tried to reset the deeming rate thresholds and changes, which would have hit hard half a million Australians. The Liberals shifted the goalposts of the assets test so that hundreds of thousands of pensioners who had carefully planned for retirement were caught out. Almost 100,000 retirees lost their pensions-this was just in 2014-and many more had their payments reduced. If pensioners do manage to scrimp and save enough for an overseas trip to see their family, for example, if the government had its way their pension would be cut after only six weeks away. If you are a pensioner who was born in another country, it would be even worse. The government say these cuts are gone for good, but we know that they cannot be trusted. The only reason these cuts are not in the budget is that the government know they will not pass the Senate. It is not because the government have suddenly realised the cuts are not fair. The Prime Minister has said so, the Treasurer has said so, the Minister for Finance has said so and the Minister for Social Services has said so. These budget cuts are not gone; they are just lying in wait. The government are waiting for the chance to resurrect them-there is no doubt about that. They have form. In 2013 the member for Warringah promised no changes to the pension. So much for that promise. The Prime Minister is holding to the member for Warringah's plan to increase the pension age to 70. Australians would have to work longer than anyone else in the world before they were eligible for a pension. The Lucky Country? Hardly. Tell that to miners, farmers, manufacturers, nurses, people working in aluminium smelters on potlines and the tradies in my electorate of Paterson. Now we hear that this government is turning its robo-debt monster on pensioners as well. It wants to claw back $1 billion. What is this government thinking? Australians know that this government has no concept of what it is really like to work at all your life, pay your taxes, do what is asked of you and then be tossed a few crumbs and be told, 'Be grateful; feel lucky. Feel that this government cares about pensioners.' They know that there is something amiss. Then they are hounded by a robo-debt monster! Labor will support this bill to provide a one-off energy payment to pensioners and to reinstate the pensioner concession card. But we are not fooled, and Australian pensioners are not fooled either. They know that this government does not really understand what our pensioners need. This government uses the word 'fair', but it does not have the will, and I believe it does not really have the wherewithal, to legislate effectively for fairness.",112
170,Mr KATTER,BILLS," The number of people on welfare in Australia is such that, to quote Minister Porter, welfare will go from 25 per cent to 50 per cent of the budget over the next 10 years. It is all very well for our friends from the ALP on the left-hand side of the House to say, 'Horrific-we can't cut back on pensions.' That is something that I would agree with them on. But it would be nice if they pointed out where we are going to get the extra money from. Is there some sort of tree that money grows on that we can grab this money from? Not only are they shrinking the budget, but the government is quite rightly pointing out that they have contributed greatly to the cost of electricity in this country. That has risen from $700 12 years ago. Let us say $700 every decade, so it would have gone from $700 to nearly $3,000, say a rise of $2,000, so in the next 10 years they will be finding $5,000 for electricity.  This is really very simple. For 25 years in Queensland, and I suspect in Australia, we had a nice gentle growth in electricity charges. It was about three per cent for the 10 years before the marker point, which was deregulation and privatisation. Both sides of this parliament agree 100 per cent-every ALP government in Australia privatised the electricity industry and-I exaggerate slightly there-every LNP government Australia privatised and corporatised. All of them deregulated the industry completely and shifted ownership over to an arms-length corporation. So what we have now is a corporatised industry, no longer a government department charging the cost of electricity to the people. We now have a privatised entity, which some governments are milking and some owners of these corporations are using as a milking cow. We knew exactly what was going to happen under privatisation and deregulation. The model is California. The central player in the Californian electricity industry was Enron. When it was privatised they kicked the charges up by some 600 to 700 per cent and did not deliver the electricity. Why? They do not have any responsibility to deliver electricity. They are just a person out there in the marketplace, saying, 'We sell electricity. We do not have to deliver a reliable service to the people. We do not have to do that.' Exactly the same has happened in Australia. Quite frankly, what the Labor Party has said in this place about the government is 100 per cent true. They really have no solution to the current situation. But it could well be said that the government is 100 per cent right in attributing 30 per cent of the increase to the imposition of the environmental charges. Let me go back. I speak with conviction, because when I handed over the electricity industry to the incoming Labor government in Queensland, we had the cheapest electricity charges in the world. That enabled us to get the aluminium industry going. We have one of the biggest aluminium industries in the world in Queensland and we got that because we had the cheapest electricity in the world. In sharp contrast to the so-called socialists in this placeI am beginning to think that the one thing that I do agree with Mr Keating on is that I am the last socialist left in this parliament! He always said that the member for Kennedy was the last socialist. Having spent most of my life using that as a term of abuse, I was rather fascinated. But if you define that as whether the people own the assets then surely the Country Party government of Queensland must have been one of the most socialist governments on the planet. We owned all the railways and all the electricity. If you said to Bjelke-Petersen, 'We should sell the electricity industry,' I think he would have had you certified and thrown into a lunatic asylum. And it would have been quite ridiculous for anyone to make that suggestion in the years that we were in office. So what was the result for the people? The people enjoyed the cheapest electricity charges in the world, and that was true for 25 years. What happened at the end of that 25 years? A thing called the National Competition Policy was introduced. Electricity charges went from $600 a year for a household to $700 over a period of about 12 years. Let us say they went up $100, from $600 to $700, in 10 years. At this point, we introduced deregulation and privatisation and, in nine years, they went from $700 to $2,400. When the government says it is the fault of the environment, it sure would be nice if they did some homework and did not come into this place and be deceitful, because it is an entirely deceitful thing to say that electricity charges went up as a result of the environment. Yes, they did, and I think the ALP can take most of the blame for that-not all of it, but most of it-and I think that is valid. But  that is 30 per cent! It is not 300 per cent. The 300 per cent is attributable to privatisation. And what did you expect? As I have said 100 times in this place, the real problem is that your mummies and daddies never had you playing Monopoly. If you had played Monopoly, you would know that when you own half the utilities you can charge four times more than if you only own one utility and, if you own all of the utilities, you can charge seven times more. So the real problem is that your mummies and daddies did not have you playing Monopoly. I did and I know that, when you privatise it, it ends up with Origin and AGL virtually owning, or at least controlling, the electricity industry of Australia. And what are they there for? Do you think they are there to be Santa Claus? Did you think Woolworths and Coles were there to be Santa Claus when you deregulated the dairy industry? How illogical and irresponsible is this parliament. When I say this parliament, I mean the parliament that I have been in for 25 years. Just how irresponsible are they? If you had said to the Queensland government that we were going to privatise it, we would have said: 'No. Eventually there will be a monopoly and they will be able to charge whatever they like.' I am not going to go into the details of the DoRCR-a dork is an idiot, an imbecile. We call people dorks. Well, it is a very appropriate name for this. Depreciation on Real Cost Replacement-that is what DoRCR stands for. It is simply advice by which they jacked up the price from $700 a year to $2,400 a year. The graph in Queensland-I have not seen every state-and the graph in Victoria are almost identical and the graph in South Australia is almost identical. You just hit that point where you privatised and you corporatised, if you like, and deregulated-it went straight through the roof. And, for anyone who follows international affairs, even a little tiny bit like I do, that was exactly what happened in California. Read the federal government reports, the congressional reports in the United States. We just followed that model. Look at a pensioner couple. They might be on $30,000 a year maybe. By the time they pay their housing-and one way or another the cost of housing even if you own your own house and have paid it off-the cost of maintenance, to be able to live in a house-in the climate in which I live, we need air conditioning; in the climate down south you need heating. So I do not think-no matter how you cut the cake-that you are going to come out of housing much under $15,000. We live in a society that requires a motor car. Public transport even in our big cities is not very good. If you well on in years, you cannot walk down to the railway stop or the tram stop in any event. So a car is really an essential item in our society. So put down $6,000 for the car and $15,000 for the housing; that is $21,000. Now, if we toss in electricity rates and insurance, we have got another $10,000. That only leaves $10,000 for food, toiletries, clothing and a little bit of other things, like travelling to see your grandkids or something of that nature. If you can provide food and toiletries for two people for $10,000 a year, I wish you well. So I simply do not understand how our pensioners are surviving. We have the people in the opposition saying: 'Oh, how dreadful that you are taking pensions away!' And we have the people on that side of the House saying: 'Your irresponsibility has resulted in a huge increase in charges for our poor pensioners!' Well, of course both of them, I am afraid, are deceiving the public. It was not the environmental  charges that put the electricity up. Yes, it did by 30 per cent; it did not put it up 300 per cent as has occurred-from $700 to $2,400 for the average household, the last time. I looked. I come to this place and I say: for heaven's sake, if you want more money for pensioners, then go out and build a railway line into the Galilee, where we will produce $30 billion or $40 billion a year of revenue for the country of Australia, from nothing, and we will give you back $15 billion of that in taxation. Go out there and build a Hells Gate dam and the Herbert River dam, on the Herbert River just north of Hells Gate. Every place has probably heard of Hells Gate. It is the only serious water development scheme that is on the drawing board for Australia, except of course for the Ord, which we gave to the Chinese. I do not see how Australia is going to get very much out of that new project; they can bring their own people into man that project; that is part of the free trade agreement we have with China. If you simply decide that, instead of sending $25 billion a year to the Middle East to buy oil, you will send it into rural Australia to buy ethanol, you can hand yourself another $7 billion a year to give to pensioners. If you got off the back of the prawn farmers and had exactly the same rules as the rest of the world has that would give you another $10 billion! You could build a little tiny canal and extended waterway up in my homeland, from northern Mount Isa up to Burketown so we could get our phosphate and fertiliser out cheaply and that would give you another $10 billion! I speak with authority, because that is exactly what we did in Queensland. We built railway lines to open up the mining. We built the infrastructure that permitted people to make the money to pay the pensioners the money that they should be getting, which in my opinion should be at least another $10,000 a year. (Time expired)",115
171,Ms TEMPLEMAN,BILLS," I might not have quite the energy that the previous speaker brought to this, but I am very pleased to be supporting the amendment to the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Energy Assistance Pavement and Pensioner Concession Card) Bill 2017. Charles Dickens wrote a recipe for happiness, as explained by Mr Micawber from David Copperfield. He wrote: Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure nineteen pounds nineteen and six, result happiness. Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure twenty pounds nought and six, result misery. That is the way that Terry Preeo, a pensioner from Blackheath described his experience of facing the government's cuts to his pension as a result of the changes to the pensions assets test. Terry came to see me at a mobile office in Blackheath one sunny Saturday morning. He had attended my community forum in Springwood a few weeks earlier, where around 40 pensioners had explained the impacts to them of the pension cut they were facing. He had thought he would be okay. But, in fact, as it turned out he says that the effect of the cut to his pension on his life was much more profound than he had imagined. And that is when the David Copperfield quote sprang to his mind. It is not easy being on some form of income support, on the lowest income level. It is not easy admitting that the work you did for probably 40-plus years did not allow you to provide comfortably for retirement, let alone then having a fragile financial structure crumble thanks to an unexpected government change from a government which had said 'no changes to  pensions'. In supporting the amendment to this bill I want to talk about the attempts this government has made to deny pensioners and part-pensioners a dignified retirement and show why this government cannot be trusted to treat people fairly. Let's talk first about schedule 1, which is a one-off payment for energy assistance to people on veterans payments, single parenting payment, disability support pension and the aged pension. The payment is $75 for singles and $62.50 each for each member of a couple. There is no doubt that this payment is needed and will help a little when people go to pay their power bill. But it is a one-off payment at the same time as the Prime Minister is taking $365 each and every year from single pensioners by removing the energy supplement for new pensioners. I know that those opposite are not necessarily great at maths, but $75 does not come anywhere close to $365; it is $75 once versus $365 annually. The 2017 budget confirms that those opposite still want to cut the energy supplement. The Prime Minister can say what he likes about fairness, but he does not have a clue. If he really cared about how pensioners made ends meet he would not be trying to abolish the energy supplement. This energy assistance payment does not go far enough. Now to pensioner concession cards. I have to say that the government's changes to the pension assets test on 1 July were difficult for many retirees in my electorate of Macquarie. In Macquarie there were 1,720 who each lost an average of $140 a fortnight, and 730 others lost their pension entirely. So in total 2,450 people faced a cut and had to find a different way to live. When those changes were first announced, then Treasurer Hockey promised that those who lost their pension as a result of the change to the assets test would be able to keep their pensioner concession card. He said that anyone who currently had a pensioner concession card would continue to receive a concession card that provided the same benefits. That was his promise in his budget announcement. In fact, he was wrong-about a lot of things, but, particularly, about that. Instead, former prisoners were issued with healthcare cards and Commonwealth seniors health cards which did not provide the same benefits. For instance, without a pensioner concession card people who had formerly been pensioners were not able to access things like Australian Hearing services. And, of course, in different states different concessions were applied. As one pensioner from Springwood wrote to me, 'Concession cards are extremely valuable, giving discounts on utilities, council rates, rego and disability parking permits, just to name a few.' But pensioners lost access to that concession card-90,000 of them, all up, and it really rubbed salt into the wound for those who had also lost a significant part of their income so unexpectedly. It is hard to know whether this was deliberate on the part of the government or simply laziness by a shocker of a Treasurer. It seems the government did not even talk to the states and territories about maintaining the concessions. Either then Treasurer Hockey did not understand the detail and the difference between the two cards, or he just forgot to include the maintenance of eligibility for those concessions. Either way, it shows how much those opposite care. The loss of the pensioner concession card was a cruel double blow to many former pensioners with modest incomes. At my forum in Springwood, people talked to me about the practicalities of losing income but also of losing concessions. Pensioners in the mountains, including Fay, were even asked to pay extra on their rates that they had paid in advance, because their status had changed. I  want to thank all the pensioners and former pensioners who have spoken to me about these issues. They are deeply personal financial issues, and it is not something that people are always comfortable discussing, but, thank goodness, they did-because it is thanks to us being able to tell their stories and to the people who were willing to speak out on their own behalf that this government has been forced to see the heartlessness of those actions. It rarely does that, so, to those who spoke out: you did well. This latest decision by the government is obviously an attempt to soften the blow of the pension shake-up- which, by the way, reduces the payments to pensioners by $2.4 billion over 2½ years-by reinstating these concession cards. The cost of reinstating them is just a smidgen of that-$3 million. It is not a lot of money, but pensioners will be grateful. It is thanks to their efforts that this has occurred, not the government's. While it helps a little, and while the one-off energy supplement helps a little, it does not undo the fact that there are many couples and individuals in my electorate whose retirement is much more difficult than they thought it might be. When that assets test changed, the same one that led to part pensioners becoming nonpensioners and losing access to concession cards, it really undermined people's confidence in their own ability to manage their finances. I think what was really telling, for me, was the way people who had previously been entitled to a pension or part pension often insisted to me that they felt they were probably better off than many others, especially if they owned their own home. Retired people know who they can suggest goes out to dinner with them at a local restaurant, and who simply cannot afford the extra $25 or $30. They know who can afford to meet them in a cafe for a cuppa, and they know who they should suggest they have a cup of tea at home with. They have a sense about how they are faring, and they all know that the big fear of a huge electricity bill, an expected mechanical problem or a health issue would throw a spanner in the works for most older people. So they would say to me, 'We know there are people doing it tougher than us, but these changes are going to make it really hard to us, too.' It might have been a cut of $220 a fortnight or $180 a fortnight. That might not be a lot to those opposite, but it is a big chunk for someone living on a lower income. People have shared with me the sacrifices they have been forced to make as a result of unexpectedly having less money each week to live on. The biggest area they have looked atin places like the Blue Mountains and Hawkesbury, where public transport between villages and suburbs is limited-is how they can reduce the costs of their car. Several people have explained the volunteer work they do often involves getting from their home to a local neighbourhood centre or a church or someone else's home. They have had to ask themselves, 'Is this what I cut?' One of my constituents from the Upper Mountains has asked herself many of those questions. She is in her 70s, a former teacher who retired in 2003 and opted for a state super pension. She thought that if she lived frugally and budgeted carefully she would be able to have a reasonable lifestyle and some degree of independence in her old age. She was also appointed legal guardian for one of her ex-students, who has special needs. In 2007, she tells me, she satisfied the income and asset tests and qualified for a partpension to supplement her super. The only income she had was her super, and her only assets were her home and a 12-year-old Magna. When she wrote to me in January this year she said that nothing has changed; the modest increase in her income, thanks to her part-pension, had allowed her to plan ahead and look to her needs and future living arrangements, to maintain  private health cover and to continue her guardianship duties. She also was able to provide support for her Sydney and Brisbane and grandchildren in school holidays, which was an expense but one she was able to budget for. But in January she went from a part-pension of $360 per fortnight to $140 per fortnight. That reduction was significant in her life and caused her to seriously consider the changes she needed to make. Would she continue her private health insurance? Would she continue her role as a legal guardian? Travelling to see him fortnightly and taking him on outings; attending regular planning meetings, which now included NDIS implementation; and being able to offer him time out at home when his carers were facing difficulties with his challenging behaviour were just part of the support that she had been able to offer. Should she tell her 88-year-old pensioner friend who lives some distance away in The Hills, for whom she has enduring guardianship, that travelling there each week and then visiting her 92-yearold husband in an aged-care facility in a different area was becoming financially difficult? These are the sorts of heart breaking questions that somebody in her 70s is asking herself. She also wondered whether she could continue to support her family in Sydney and Brisbane with the care of her grandchildren in school holidays as the cost of travel was becoming a burden. In her letter, she laughed at one suggestion. She said: 'Christian Porter condescendingly suggests that I rearrange my share portfolio to make up for my income loss! Well, I do not have a share portfolio and my assets and income have not changed since I passed that test in 2007. It seems that pensioners like me have been conveniently lumped in with the wealthy half-liers who can indeed afford to make adjustments to their income and assets'-and she goes on to say other things that are probably not parliamentary! This is what the government has done. The Liberals really must think Australia has a short memory. It was only three years ago that they tried to cut pension indexation and leave pensioners $80 a week poorer over a decade. They have attempted to penalise retirees who take an overseas trip for more than six weeks by cutting their payments, with even harsher penalties for migrant pensioners. Supposedly, these cuts are gone for good, but I find that hard to swallow. The one they will not let go of is the plan to increase the pension age to 70, making retirement age in Australia higher than anywhere else in the world. And even if they cannot push these changes through, they want to make them at the same time as they are happy to throw around $55 billion of tax cuts to big business. It makes you wonder. One thing I want to add is that, throughout all this concession card and assets tests business, the feedback I had from pensioners was that they wanted to pay tribute to all the staff at Centrelink. One pensioner wrote: 'I have nothing but praise for the Centrelink staff, who, under difficult circumstances, always did their best to help. I was under the distinct impression that they themselves were finding this process very difficult and were learning as they went along. However, they always assisted with good humour, courteousness and, I dare say, in many cases quite a degree of sympathy.' And I think we owe those Centrelink staff, who are under increasing pressure through a whole lot of moves by this government, a debt of gratitude for the work they do day in, day out. But as always with this government, even when they are trying to make things slightly better, their legislation reminds us that they really do not understand what life is like for many people. Terry Preo, from Blackheath, uses Charles Dickens to make his point: 'The difference between happiness and misery may only be a few dollars.' Sadly, pensioners made worse off  by this government but living in hope and expectation of better fortune will wait a long time for relief from the Turnbull government. The government do not realise that people do not have options to play with their income and that their choices are limited, and that people rely on knowing what the rules will be without them being changed mid-game. It might not mean much to the Prime Minister, but it is impossible to start playing a game of football-and in the spirit of State of Origin tomorrow night, let's call it League-and then halfway through find that the game has become rugby! He might not understand the difference, but that just proves how out of touch he is with the rest of Australia.",118
172,Ms RYAN,BILLS," I rise tonight as the member for Lalor very pleased to join the debate on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Energy Assistance Payment and Pensioner Concession Card) Bill 2017, with an opportunity to talk about the pensioners in the electorate of Lalor. I would assert that like most pensioners across Australia, these people have worked hard all of their lives and have made their significant contribution to our country. Many have raised families, many have gone without to ensure that their children had a better start in life than they did. Many have worked long and tireless hours. It is my opinion-and I know it is the opinion of those on this side of the House-that our pensioners deserve the deepest respect. They also deserve to have a dignified retirement. I rise tonight to mention how, critically, the hallmark of this government since it came into power in this country, and the thing that has been the most insulting they have done, has been to put aged pensioners into their bucket of what they describe as welfare recipients. In my view, and in the view of those on this side of the chamber, the aged pension is not welfare. It is a hard-earned entitlement in this country. Pensioners across this country deserve our respect. That is why this legislation is so disappointing. We all remember the 2013 promise by the then Prime Minister, the member for Warringah, saying there would be no cuts to pensions. And we know what followed that. Time and time again, this government has attacked pensioners and has tried to claw back funds to fund its largesse to the big end of town through the pockets of our pensioners. Tonight's legislation is about this government cleaning up a mess that it created itself by making a promise-former Treasurer Joe Hockey made a promise-that pensioners would not lose the pensioner concession card. Then, of course, what we found was that they actually did. Either he was too lazy or, as usual, the legislative agenda of those opposite was a complete mess, and his promise fell off the workings of the legislation that they brought into this House. We are here cleaning that mess up tonight. How long has that taken? That is the question that the pensioners in Lalor are asking. They are asking me, they are asking members opposite. How long has it taken for you to clean up this mess after you ripped away their rights to the pensioner concession card without negotiations with the states and the territories, and without even really understanding what that meant in their lives on the ground. It meant that they would not get the concessions that they had been getting in different states for different things at different values, which make the complexity of it difficult to go into the detail of. But you can bet your bottom dollar that every pensioner knows exactly what they missed out on when they lost their pensioner concession card. They know to the letter, they know to the cent and to the dollar what that cost them. Of course, they live frugally. So we are here to clean up that mess.  Also, with this piece of legislation, we are being asked to embrace a one-off energy assistant payment of $75 for a single pensioner. It is a once-in-a-lifetime offer, while, at the same time, we know that this government wants to cut the energy supplement of $365 every year for every pensioner. For the last four years, I have sat here and listened to those opposite rail about the increase in electricity prices. Their hypocrisy stands exposed before us tonight because we know their intention is to cut that energy supplement of $365 a year to pensioners. They know the cost of electricity, but they want to take away pensioners' assistance to meet those costs and pay those bills. We will support these changes, because the measures in this bill will help to relieve some of the pressure that this government has placed on elderly Australians, but it does not mean that we do not see through this government. It does not mean that we will drop our guard and believe that they suddenly believe in a fair society. It is clear that this government does not understand fairness. There is no lens through which you can see that more clearly than being here tonight and listening to this debate. We know that because, although they were here a few weeks ago crawling backwards out of the chamber as they repealed their zombie cuts, they left two. For a thousand days they argued for those, many of which were attacks on pensioners. For a thousand days they walked into this chamber and argued for these measures, and then they had to take them back. And when they did, they did not take them back because they had changed their minds. They told us themselves that they removed those measures from the legislative agenda because they could not get them through the Senate, not because they had changed what they believe, not because they suddenly saw the light and saw that pensioners needed more support. No-they did it because they could not get it through the Senate. But they have left two, and the worse of those two is the notion that people will not be eligible for the age pension until they are 70. In the electorate of Lalor the median weekly rent is $280. We only have to say that, in one of the most affordable communities in Victoria, to know that that means a single aged pensioner renting is paying 60 per cent of their pension on accommodation. You only need to look at that one statistic to understand what this means in terms of their level of being able to access things in our community. Time and time again this government has brought into this House measures that would be real cuts to pensioners. I am reminded that it was a Labor government that last gave pensioners a pay rise. It was a Labor government who saw the need and did those things, and it is a Liberal-National government that is intent on putting their hand into pensioners' pockets to take things from them. In 2014 the Liberals tried to cut the pension indexation and leave pensioners $80 a week poorer over 10 years. That should not be a surprise, when we know that they also support a $77 a week pay cut to people who will lose that through penalty rate cuts. We remember when the Liberals tried to reset the deeming rate thresholds, changes that would have negatively impacted half a million part pensioners. Who could forget when the assets test changed and the goalposts were shifted for hundreds of thousands of pensioners who had carefully planned for retirement. Almost 100,000 retirees lost their pension and many more had their payments reduced. This government comes in here tonight and asks us to support them to clean up their mess. On this side of the chamber we will do that, but we will not be foxed. We know what is coming. We know that they will bring back the clean energy supplement to have it cut and  taken away from pensioners. When electricity bills are rising, the irony is almost too much. We know that as a government they are set on reducing the cost of providing for pensioners across this country, pensioners who deserve our respect, who deserve a dignified retirement, who deserve not to be scrimping week to week in fear that there will be changes come through this parliament that will once again reduce their capacity to live at any level of acceptability. It is almost unbelievable that this government is persisting with the second of those zombie measures-raising the age pension age to 70. It is unbelievable, until you cast your mind back to this week in question time, when Minister Porter stood at that dispatch box and talked about unemployed people over 55 and the fact that he felt that they were not looking for work hard enough. In my community, I have met lots of people who have lost their jobs post 50. I see the pressure on them and the stress on them. Many of them are suffering from mental health issues, as a result of the loss of self-esteem and the loss of security from the loss of their job. This government persists in wanting to punish those who need our help the most. Tonight, it is pensioners. And it is the government trying to clean up their own mess. It is a shame, and this government should hang its head in shame.",122
173,Ms SHARKIE,BILLS," I will not take the House's time for long tonight to talk about this bill, the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Energy Assistance Payment and Pensioner Concession Card) Bill 2017. I am very pleased to support this bill. I do note, though, that Australia is facing a surging energy crisis. South Australia is on the crest of that wave. As you know, Deputy Speaker Coulton, we have had numerous blackouts in South Australia. We have had load-shedding, which means planned blackouts. We have the highest electricity prices in Australia, and we have the highest spot-price volatility in the National Electricity Market. However, the rest of the country is not far behind South Australia, and the challenge of rising electricity costs is affecting households and businesses across our country. The energy markets are failing to deliver. If Australia is to remain internationally competitive, we need to make energy affordability a top priority in our country. Without energy affordability, our economy will grind to a halt and we will continue to impoverish our families and our households through rising energy costs. I am particularly concerned about households who are on low and fixed incomes, and those for whom full-time or even part-time work is not a realistic option. These are people who are receiving the age pension, disability support pension, parenting payment single and various veterans' payments. Whilst the Nick Xenophon Team continues to negotiate with the government to enhance longer-term energy security for both households and businesses, support is needed for our most impoverished Australians. They need this relief, and it is necessary right now. Future promises will not keep the heater on during the coming winter. So it is for this reason that the Nick Xenophon Team champions the payments contained in this bill, alongside our negotiations on a range of other energy policy measures that will help to put downward pressure on energy prices.  An estimated 3.8 million Australians will obtain relief for their energy bills with a one-off payment of $75 for singles and $125 for pensioner couples. Age pensioners, disability support pensioners, recipients of the parenting payment single and recipients of veterans' payments will all benefit from this. On the surface, this may seem like an insignificant amount. However, I want to tell you one of the many stories I have heard from members of my community of Mayo. One elderly lady told me of her rising energy bills and that what that had meant to her last winter was that she could not afford to live beyond one room of her home until the middle of spring; during the coldest days, she would shut off that room and barely leave it, just to keep the heat on. Many elderly members of our community have spoken to me about how they stay in bed for most of the day because it is cheaper to put on the electric blanket than to run the heater, or of how they go to bed at 5 pm so that they do not have to turn on the heater in their living room. So I know first hand that these payments will be put to good use by those in need. They are Australians who are incredibly vulnerable because of their age and have no capacity to increase their income or find employment. We must remember, though, that it is imperative for the government to fix this. This is, for one year, one one-off payment. This is not a sustainable situation. I am also pleased, though, that the government has decided to reinstate the pensioner concession card for those who are affected by changes in the age pension test that came into effect on 1 January this year. This will be of great benefit to retired Australians because it will provide them with access to state and council based concessions such as reduced council rates and reduced car registrations that will require the possession of a pensioner card, and this will also encourage many doctors who had stopped bulk-billing these retired Australians to resume bulk-billing them again. So I am pleased with these measures. However, it is important for the government to look at the cost of living to make it easier for pensioners and our older Australians. They deserve that much from us. NA",124
174,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT," It being 7.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Human Rights Ms O'NEIL (Hotham) (19:30): We are joined today by a very eminent group of Cambodian community and religious leaders, and I begin by welcoming them. We are joined by a number of venerables, firstly, who lead the spiritual and religious life of CambodianAustralians from temples around the country: the Wat Buddharangsi, the Khmer Buddhist Centre and the Dhamaran Buddhist Temple are located in my electorate, but we also have venerables here from the Wat Monirangsi, the Wat Eysan Meanchey, the Wat Canberra and the Wat Bonyrigg in other parts of the country. We welcome you to our parliament and thank you for being here. The Cambodian community in Australia is also blessed by some incredibly driven and passionate community leaders who are engaged in political life both at home in Cambodia and here in Australia. We have leaders with us today such as Hong Lim, the state member for  Clarinda and parliamentary secretary, who is Australia's first Cambodian-born member of parliament-a fine achievement. We have Councillor Youhorn Chea in the gallery, a community hero, a City of Greater Dandenong councillor and a former mayor; and we have Councillor Meng Heang Tak, who is a current councillor, a younger leader and another former mayor who is already a respected and distinguished person. I want to acknowledge you in the gallery. I also acknowledge Mr Meng Bunglay, Mr Sarun Keo, Ms Sivorn Pung,  Thearak Boun and Mrs Darany Khiek. To all of those in the delegation who have joined us, thank you so much for being here, and sourn sva-kum-welcome to our parliament. I want to express my very deep concern about ongoing human rights abuses in Cambodia, and the delegation today have talked extensively about what they see as a very serious deterioration in the human rights situation there. I make that statement on behalf of the people I represent in Hotham, and include in that the many thousands of Cambodian-speaking and Cambodian-born people that I represent. A lot of those constituents fled the Khmer Rouge, and members of parliament may not remember this but two million people died under Pol Pot's regime-a quarter of the Cambodian population at the time. But this is a community that came to Australia, and by God they have made good Australians. They have worked hard, sent their children off to school, to university, and right around my electorate and beyond we see extraordinary achievements being made by people from the Cambodian community. But what they see when they get back to their sovereign country is a deteriorating human rights situation which is of very deep and grave concern to Australian Cambodians. Prime Minister Hun Sen seen and his ruling party have targeted Cambodia's opposition, activists, intellectuals, people working in human rights and those fighting for a free and fair democracy. The right to protest is routinely suppressed. Corruption is a cancer in Cambodia. The country now ranks 156th out of 176 countries on the corruption index. It is the single most corrupt country in South-East Asia. What chills us most is the suppression of democracy. We saw in the 2013 elections some very concerning things. Probably the worse incident was the shooting of five garment workers who were just expressing their civil rights and protesting in the streets. They were shot dead. I spoke out against the violence at that time, and since then things have deteriorated further. I want to mention Dr Kem Ley, who was a prominent Cambodian political activist and in a sense became an icon of this movement of people who are fighting for fair and free elections in Cambodia. Dr Kem Ley came to Australia last year. He returned to Cambodia, he spoke out against the Hun Sen regime and days later he was shot dead in broad daylight near Phnom Penh-he was assassinated. This is an extraordinary violation of the rights of Cambodians to exercise their rights in a fair and free democracy, and we absolutely reject that. Dr Kem Ley's widow, Madame Bou Rachana, and their five children have been granted visas to visit Thailand. They have applied for refugee status in Australia and I have written to the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection asking that he look favourably upon that application. I have sat with Cambodian leaders in the past and Cambodian leaders today, and I have felt their utter despair about what is happening in their country. Their message today to us was incredibly clear-they want us to stand up, they want us to say something and they want us to join them in this fight for a fair and free democracy. These fundamental human rights are what we should all expect as human beings. In closing, Australia trov te chhor cheamouy  bong bron Khmer yeung knoung ka proynt samrab prochea thibathey yute tor. Thank you so much for being here today.",125
175,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT," I would also like to acknowledge our guests in the gallery. I hope their visit to parliament has been successful today. Human Rights Mr TIM WILSON (Goldstein) (19:34): As a liberal democratic country whose culture is underpinned by valuing pluralism, tolerance and mutual respect for all people, it saddens me to see the human cost where these values are not observed across the world today. This is very much following on from the previous speaker's address. There have always been increasingly alarming reports out of the Russian province of Chechnya of homosexual men being captured and tortured in prison camps, and families being encouraged to kill other members to protect their honour. Independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta found that dozens of men aged between 16 and 50 have mysteriously disappeared off the streets. Among them were well-known faces on local television and religious leaders. The camps in the town of Argun have reportedly become a cesspit of inhumane abuse. Men are taken outdoors and beaten several times a day whilst also enduring electric shocks. NGOs are helping Chechens to flee the region, including 20-year-old Ilya. Even though he is now almost 2,000 kilometres from the Chechen capital, Ilya still panics each time a car drives past the secure house. In October he was taken into a field and beaten by three men in military uniform, leaving a huge scar along the side of his jaw. Chechnya's leader has mandated that women must wear the hijab in public places and has endorsed polygamy. In light of these arrests, Kadryov denies the accusations, asserting simply that homosexuals do not exist in his country as a justification for what is going on. Sadly, similar signs are now coming out of Indonesia. In recent days we have seen the public caning of two men for engaging in consensual sexual activity in the province of Aceh. The two men in their 20s have done no harm to others, and yet have become the target of their neighbours acting as vigilantes and local authorities seeking to impose barbaric law. Similarly, in the past few days there have been mass arrests of around 140 homosexual men in Jakarta. These tactics are being used as the basis for intimidation against people who have committed no crime. It follows the arrest of 14 other men in a hotel in Surabaya only last month. These tragic examples, of course, do not sit in isolation. Throughout much of Africa, homosexual acts are a crime, with the most egregious in the Middle East coupled with brutal punishments including the death penalty using degrading and painful methods reflecting the cruelty of Islamist militant groups in the region. As difficult as it is, we must always be mindful to be strategic and targeted in our advocacy to address these crimes. Being loud is not the same as being effective, particularly when it comes to protecting people from discrimination on the basis of their sexual orientation. Indonesian writer Hendri Yulius said on ABC's Radio National recently in response to a question about whether improvements in rights for homosexuals in Western liberal democracies was contributing to this crackdown:  The globalisation of LGBT rights, including the legalisation of same-sex marriage in the United States, also contributes to the rise of anti-LGBT attitudes … Most of the anti-LGBT arguments revolve around westernisation, and how we have to counter westernisation of our country. This is the number one reason behind it. As we found in Uganda in the past, public advocacy by Western governments can be used as a weapon to reinforce the justification for crackdowns and make situations worse. I am proud to be part of a government that has been unafraid to directly tackle some of these governments and work with others to stand up to this sort of barbarism. I particularly want to congratulate the work of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Julie Bishop, for her targeted, strategic and precise advocacy as the foreign minister and also for working with other countries towards a coordinated response. I do encourage the foreign minister to continue on this path and use any method or option available to her to be effective. But we must also condemn these governments. I hope that all members and senators will join with me in this expression. There is something we cannot ignore in all of these acts. There is a common thread underpinning these wicked acts: the application of extremist versions of Islamic theology to justify the deliberate and malicious targeting of homosexuals. I have previously spoken in this place and others about the same rationale being used to target, mistreat and kill women and Christians. Freedom sits in a context underpinned by our values of the dignity of all people and their liberty to pursue their life, their opportunity, their enterprise and their happiness. That is why I will never be a culture relativist; it is why I am a cultural conservative. Our liberal democratic culture underpins the freedoms that so many of us enjoy and do not lead to the abuse of the law to target particular minority groups and send them through punishment. Other cultures, unfortunately, do not value these principles in the same way that we do. History shows the price always falls hardest on minorities and those who do not neatly conform to cultural values. That is why we must condemn these acts. It is also why we must always stand up for our culture, our values and our way of life. Volunteers",127
176,Ms SHARKIE,ADJOURNMENT," I wish to publicly recognise the huge contribution that volunteers make to my Mayo community, to South Australia and indeed to Australia. Volunteers are the backbone of community organisations, from sporting clubs to Meals on Wheels, from surf lifesaving to the Red Cross and beyond. Volunteers provide hours of their valuable time and labour, and it is their contribution that my community so greatly appreciates. I also wish to recognise the great work of the peak organisation for volunteers in South Australia, Volunteering SA, and in particular CEO Evelyn O'Loughlin, who tirelessly advocates for and supports volunteers in my home state. In 2014 South Australia had the second highest volunteering rates in Australia, with almost two-fifths of South Australians having volunteered in the previous 12 months and nearly half of those volunteering for more than 10 years. According to the Australian Unity Wellbeing Index, my electorate of Mayo is the happiest electorate in Australia, and I believe much of that is because of our high rate of volunteering and our connection to our community. According to the ABS stats, people volunteer because they want to help others and because it  brings a sense of personal satisfaction. Volunteering strengthens person-to-person bonds in our communities and strengthens our individual and collective well-being. Volunteering Australia estimates that the annual contribution of volunteering to our national economic and social well-being is $290 billion. That is more than what mining, retail and agriculture put together contribute to our community. Support for volunteering does not just happen by itself. It requires active and targeted investment. Community based organisations, known as volunteering support services, find, place, train and manage volunteers to make sure that their work is effective, professional and safe. As we have seen, volunteering is not a low-value activity by any metric. Even a small but significant investment by government creates a huge multiplier effect for the Australian community. Under the budget, federal funding support for volunteering services will now only be available for people who are deemed disadvantaged or for projects specifically targeting disadvantaged people. This means that the arts, sports, recreational bodies, the environment, education, heritage groups and emergency services will no longer qualify for support to manage volunteering. In South Australia 10 out of the 12 of funded services that support volunteering are set to close. They will cease to operate. This includes services provided by Southern Volunteering, which operates in the Southern Vales, the Fleurieu and the Kangaroo Island regions. Southern Volunteering will cease to operate-and they have been receiving funding since 1984-if the federal government does not change what it has put in the budget. They only receive $120,000 a year from the federal budget, and they provide their services tremendously well. Volunteering Australia's CEO, Adrienne Picone, has expressed grave concern that this year's budget has completely overlooked the volunteering sector. It is a short-sighted decision by government. Successive federal governments have reduced volunteering grant funding. It was $21 million in 2008. In 2014 it was reduced to $10 million. Proposed changes are going to mean that dedicated support from the federal government for volunteers will be substantially less than it was before. The decrease in funding to the sector will also reduce the ability of jobseekers to meet their mutual obligation requirements through participation in volunteering activities, and that fails to acknowledge the role volunteering plays in providing potential pathways to employment. We know there is a clear link between volunteering and employment, and with the mantra of 'jobs and growth' I really expected better from this federal government. I am disappointed in the government's short sightedness and I urge the government to reinstate their funding for volunteer management. This is going to affect regional South Australia far more than metropolitan South Australiathe Riverland, Port Lincoln, the Limestone Coast. I do hope the member for Grey and the member for Barker come out and publicly condemn these decisions made by government. To the thousands of volunteers in Mayo, the ones on the gate on a Saturday morning when it is freezing cold and the ones who are there for the football, the ones who are in the canteen, the ones who are delivering meals to our elderly, the ones who are at working bees on a Sunday afternoon: I am absolutely indebted to you for your generosity. We all are. To you, I humbly say thank you. National Security",128
177,Mr WOOD,ADJOURNMENT," I rise today to speak on the importance of what is called pre-arrest legislation in, sadly, our current climate of terrorism. Recently we saw the tragic and awful events in Manchester, where 22 people were killed-mainly young girls-and 116  injured in a horrific suicide bombing. Police in the UK now say that they are holding 11 men, aged between 18 and 44, in custody and have made major progress in their investigation. They can do this mainly because I believe they will be using what is called pre-arrest detention legislation. Currently in the UK, under sections 40 and 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000 UK, a constable may arrest a person he or she reasonably suspects has committed a terrorism related offence or is or has been concerned in the commission, preparation or investigation-I repeat: the investigation-of acts of terrorism, which is so important for police. A person arrested under section 41 may be detained for an initial period of 48 hours. This may be extended by judicial authority or a senior judge one or more times up to a total of 14 days. Why is this 14 days so important? It is important because it takes a lot of work and investigation when you have a horrific event where so many people are killed or injured or there are potentially multiple attacks. Police would be seizing computers and phones, and to gather that expert data and IT from such devices takes expertise and time. Also, when you are speaking to co-offenders, it takes time to get their story and match it up with other stories, potentially to find other evidence or prevent further acts of terrorism. Back in the days when John Howard was Prime Minister, when preventative detention at a federal level was introduced, I raised my strong concern-and, to this day, I have raised it so many times in this House, the party room and in the media-that, if a person is being held in Australian preventative detention there has never been the ability to interview the person held in custody. Basically, the police would have them there and, if a person wanted to make a statement about the commission of an offence, co-offenders or the location of evidence, the police would need to release them and arrest them under part 1C of the Criminal Codewhich, to me, is a tedious way to go. I congratulate the New South Wales government, who are now leading the way in having their own pre-arrest detention legislation. It is very disturbing that, in Victoria, the state Labor government have-and I raised this over 12 months ago-still not implemented this legislation which is so vital. We need all of the states and territories-and I believe there is meeting of chief commissioners coming up soon-to agree on legislation. You need uniform legislation in case you get multiple attacks or the police or law enforcement agencies need to go interstate. In New South Wales they have the Terrorism (Police Powers) Amendment (Investigative Detention) Act 2016. New South Wales inserted new part 2AA into the Terrorism (Police Powers) Act to establish a new investigation detention regime from 16 May 2016. Under section 25B police are allowed to arrest the terrorism suspect without a warrant for the purpose of investigation detention if the terrorist act concerned occurred in the last 28 days or the police believe that there will be a further act committed in the next 14 days. Under section 25, a person is a terrorism suspect if there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that the person has committed or will commit a terrorist act; the person is or has been involved in preparing or planning a terrorist act; or the person possesses a thing that is connected with the commission of or the preparation and planning for a terrorist act-again, giving the tools to police. Terrorism suspects aged 14 years of age or older-and, sadly, we have seen a number of terrorist attacks committed by younger people-may be detained for up to 14 days. An initial period of four days applies but may be extended under a warrant from an eligible judge.  I know that some people are worried about the lengths to which questions can go in order to have a person in detention. But I say again: to have pre-arrest detention legislation right across the country is a vital tool for law enforcement. The last thing we want is to have some awful incident take place and then realise that our law enforcement agencies did not have the necessary legislation to help them investigate an horrific terrorist attack. (Time expired) Event Ticket Sales",129
178,Mr BURKE,ADJOURNMENT," I rise to refer to what is happening to concertgoers at the moment in the ticket resale market. This is not only happening with respect to live music it is also happening with respect to a number of major sporting events. If you get onto any search engine-not just Google; try Bing, try Yahoo! or try any of the major search engines-and type in the name of a band that you want to see and the word 'tickets', invariably the first entry that will come up is the viagogo website. Last week a whole lot of Australians were trying to get Ed Sheeran tickets. While they were trying to get Ed Sheeran tickets from the official Frontier Touring site and from the official seller it was already the case that the resale market had started. You could already go to viagogo, where people were purporting to sell tickets to the same show. Within a few minutes we found that the official sellers had completely sold out because there are bots being run by scammers that clean-up the official market and then the resale market kicks in. For Ed Sheeran, within a few days tickets that were worth less than $200 were being resold for about 3½ thousand dollars. And in that resale market there is no guarantee that the people who buy them will ever even get in the door. I have found when I have been to events that people who we were meant to meet never even got in the door because when they turned up they discovered they had purchased fake tickets. But we cannot blame the concertgoer for what is happening, because when they use search engines, which they put a level of trust in, the first entry continues to be the site that leads people to be scammed. Let me explain, because it was put to me that the following would happen so I went to my own office about an hour ago and typed in 'Ed Sheeran tickets' and looked to see exactly what would follow. The search engine I chose was Google. The Google ad, top of the page when I typed in 'Ed Sheeran tickets' takes you to the viagogo website. But it says a few things that are not true. It says it is the official site-it is not. If you click through it says that it has the lowest prices-it does not. It says there is an instant download-there is not, because the tickets do not actually get issued until next January. There are no tickets in existence yet. It says the tickets are selling fast and that the prices are rising. If you then click through it tells you that the tickets on viagogo are the cheapest in Melbourne, the cheapest in Sydney and the cheapest in Brisbane. It also, once again, tells you that the tickets are selling fast. I then clicked through and chose the Melbourne 9 March concert. Then it said, 'Warning: the site is experiencing heavy traffic. Secure your tickets as fast as you can,' to try to make people think that they need to engage with this quickly. Several other, 'We are busy, go quick,' messages then start to appear on the screen. You click through the number of tickets you want-I clicked on '2'-and a graphic came up showing tickets disappearing in front of my eyes, with other people and the alleged number of tickets they are wanting to buy  appearing behind me. This gives you the impression that you must buy the tickets immediately and gives you the impression that you are on the official site. The tickets are priced with a line through them, as though there is a discount. In my case, when I went through it said, 'Rear floor discount tickets.' They actually had those retailed at the official site at $103. These were claimed to have been discounted, marked down from $238 to $152. So the discount for a $103 ticket was selling for $152. That was the discount they were claiming as they defraud consumers. I then chose to buy tickets and it showed people queuing up for the same tickets to drive urgency. I then got put into a countdown box and it told me that general admission at the rear is the most popular section, which of course it is not for any concert-of course it isn't! Eventually I clicked through-and I went all the way through until it actually asked me to pay-to where it claimed that I had to pay a VAT, which is interesting in the Australian taxation environment, and a booking fee of $42 per ticket. That is an additional $84 on the order. This is a site that does not sell tickets. And the search engines cannot continue to take advertising dollars when, effectively, these sites are selling stolen goods and defrauding Australians who just want to be able to go and attend a concert. Forte, Senior Constable Brett",131
179,Mr BUCHHOLZ,ADJOURNMENT," It is with a very, very heavy heart that I rise in the chamber tonight to express condolences to the family of Senior Constable Brett Forte, a police officer, a hero, who lost his life yesterday in a gunfight in my electorate. Senior Constable Forte was tragically shot and killed when he was doing his job in the Lockyer Valley in my electorate yesterday. He is remembered as a dedicated officer, serving with the Queensland Police Service for more than 15 years, and he was part of the Toowoomba Tactical Crime Squad. My thoughts and prayers are with his family tonight, his wife, Susan, also a police officer, and their three children, and their friends and colleagues. He has been taken from you way too soon. Queensland mourns a hard working, well-respected member of the police force who was simply trying to apprehend a wanted person. He was doing his job, protecting our community, so that we can sleep under a veil of protection. He was the 12th police officer in Queensland to be shot whilst on duty since 1964. And that is the danger our police officers face every single day. It is a real and apparent danger. It reminds me of Norm Watt-it was the last police officer's funeral I went to. He was also part of the tactical response squad. He was a doggy. He was shot in crossfire at a siege outside Rockhampton. And, Susan, can I share with you that the family of the Queensland police force rallied around Norm's family. It was, without a doubt, the largest funeral I have ever been to in my existence. That same family will wrap itself around you and your children. The irony is that the other officer that tried to come to Norm Watt's aid was a police officer that I went to boarding school with, Darren Lees, who took fire and could not get to Norm in time, in virtually similar circumstances, before he died. Norm died; he was shot in the leg and bled out at the scene. The irony is that Darren Lees, who tried to save him, died a number of years later of lymphoma cancer-again, way too young.  When our police officers go to work, they know that they may never come home, but instead they run towards the danger and not away from it. You can only just fathom that, when the blood is running through our veins and we are in a time of panic, and too often we reach out to the police force, they arrive at our scene-whether it be a domestic violence scene or whether it be a traffic incident-with their blood racing through their veins, every single day. And I think we become numb to what our emergency service personnel endure through a normal eight-hour shift on any given day. They put their lives on the line every day when they go to work so that we can be safe. I want to acknowledge some of the remarkable police officers in my electorate, without naming them. I found it just unfathomable that, when I heard the news that we had had this incident in the electorate, you do this mental checklist of police officers that you know, that are your mates, that you go fishing with, that you drink beer with, and it is only the sense of relief that comes upon you once you find that it was not your friend-can you imagine the heartfelt situation that their families feel when they see the television outlets say that there is a police officer been shot, as to whether or not that is their brother or their father or their husband or their dad? Most of us will never experience what our police officers do in the line of their duty. In the time remaining to me, with the indulgence of the House, I would just like to offer my small sentiment and respect to the family, in offering some 15 seconds of silence, and then I will close, if it is all right with you.

Consideration resumed of the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.,135
186,Mr GEORGANAS,BILLS," I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2017-2018 and related bills. Since early May, we have heard nothing from this government except for the word 'fair' thrown about with lots of gusto and abandon. It is a reminder of the 2016 election campaign. Back then, all we heard from the Prime Minister of the government was 'jobs and growth'. Wherever we went, on every advertising sign, on every placard and at every press conference, you would hear those three words: jobs and growth. The government is very good at repeating these slogans-especially three-word ones, for some reason. If you go back a few years, a lot of them add up to three words. Especially with the last slogan, 'jobs and growth', they have shown that they do not have a clue about what either jobs and growth or fairness, which is the word that is being thrown about at the moment, are. If there was ever any doubt, this year's budget shows that the Liberal government under this Prime Minister is the most out of touch in history. How can the PM talk about jobs and growth while at the same time refusing to do anything to protect the nation's most vulnerable and lowest-paid workers? At the same time as we are hearing about fairness and jobs and growth, there is a pay cut to some of the most vulnerable workers, cuts to penalty rates and a $65 billion tax cut to the highest end of town. This government's refusal to support Labor's Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Take Home Pay) Bill 2017, which was in the House the other day, will seriously hurt workers, especially those low-paid workers that rely on weekends. Figures show that my electorate will be very hard hit by this government's refusal to stop the Fair Work Commission's cut to penalty rates. I have said before in this place that more than 12,586 people, or one in six workers, in the Hindmarsh electorate that I represent in Adelaide's western suburbs work in the retail, pharmacy, food and accommodation industries. These people will be hit the hardest. These people will have an average of $77 cut from their pay, while, at the same time, the government is proposing a $65 billion tax cut to Australia's wealthiest people. That is over 12½ thousand workers in my electorate who could lose up to $77 a week because of this government's cuts. Retail is the second biggest industry in my electorate, employing 7,749 workers. Food and hospitality is the eighth biggest industry, employing 4,837 workers. Hurting these workers will be bad for the economy and bad for South Australia and does nothing to assist the economy of this nation.  I go back to the three-word slogan that the government was using in the last election: jobs and growth. So much for jobs and growth when you are cutting from the lowest-paid workers in our nation. Then we come to the words 'wages growth'. 'Jobs and growth' was the slogan, but wages growth is at a record low in this nation. With this cut to penalty rates, workers will now have even less money to spend in local shops, restaurants and other businesses. If there is less money around-for example, in my electorate 12,000-odd people will be earning less than they did before the penalty rate cuts-that means that there is less money in the economy, so the economy does not benefit from it; all this is doing is cutting money from workers. The government are giving the top end of town a $65 billion tax cut, which will not get spent in the economy anyway. The top end of town have already got enough money. They are earning very high wages or have very big incomes, and that money will continue to roll as it did two months ago, three months ago and six months ago. This is where it will hurt, because there is less money going straight into the economy. I think the PM is selling out our lowest paid, most vulnerable workers in order to give billionaires a $65 billion tax break. It is unacceptable that more than 60 members in this place, including the Prime Minister, have called for penalty rates to be abolished or cut. We on this side of the House understand just how much this will hurt workers. The Leader of the Opposition has introduced a bill opposing it, because we will not stand for it. The effect this will have on families, not only in my electorate but in all the electorates around the country, will be devastating. As I said, up to 700,000 Australians will lose $77 per week. People will have to work longer for less pay. Women will be disproportionately affected, because a lot of women are part-time workers who work on weekends. Regional communities will have less money spent in their economies. But it is not only vulnerable workers who will suffer under the government's cuts. Pensioners will be hit particularly hard. There was nothing in the May budget for seniors. There was nothing but cuts. There was nothing for aged care. We still have massive shortages of aged-care packages around the nation. We are ageing at a rapid pace, yet nothing was mentioned in the budget for our most elderly and vulnerable. And, of course, there was nothing for welfare recipients. Not only does this government want to raise the pension age to 70 years, the oldest pension age in the developed world; it also wants to scrap the energy supplement for pensioners. That will leave pensioners, carers and Newstart recipients $550 a year worse off. For some of these people, that is the difference between paying a bill or ensuring they have food on the table. It could make the difference in whether or not they can pay their medical costs. For an age pensioner, $550 is a lot of money. This comes on top of other harsh cuts to pensioners as a result of this government's new assets test. How is that fair? We have heard the word 'fair' thrown about by the government constantly in the last couple of months, but I see nothing fair in this. Where are the jobs and the growth that Prime Minister Turnbull spoke about during the election campaign? He is cutting from the most vulnerable, lowest paid workers. I will go back to pensioners. I have one of the oldest electorates in the country. I have pensioners in my electorate who have worked extremely hard all their lives. Some have fought in wars, and they have paid their taxes their entire life. They have built the foundations that we today stand on to lead the lives that we do. They have contributed to our economy and  to our society, and this government is hanging them out to dry. They deserve to be treated better and not as poorly as they are by this government. We also cannot trust the government when it comes to health. Pensioners and other vulnerable Australians will be hard hit by the government's continued attacks on Medicare. In the lead-up to the last election, the government tried to bring in co-payments. They failed. They then tried to bring in co-payments through the backdoor by extending the freeze, which failed. They then decided to outsource the IT of Medicare. The government say they are committed to Medicare, but there are three examples of how they are not. The only reason those things did not come to fruition is that the opposition opposed them and people in the Senate opposed them. But, believe you me, had the government had the numbers to put those measures through, they would have put those measures through and we would be much worse off today. I have a lot of doubts and questions when I hear the government saying they are guaranteeing Medicare. We all know that they have opposed Medicare from its inaugural days in the 1970s and have continued to do so over the years. They have tried to meddle with it and do whatever they can to clip at the edges of it until there is not much left. As I have said, they have failed to drop the Medicare freeze immediately, meaning that bulk-billing rates will continue to fall and vulnerable people will have to pay more to see their doctor. It is not uncommon for me to hear people saying that they used to be bulk-billed when they went to their clinic but now they have to pay. It is a regular occurrence that constituents come to my electorate office to tell me about their medical centre and how they are now having to contribute towards their bill. How is that fair for pensioners, for whom every single cent counts? They have a budget and all of a sudden they are hit with higher medical costs. If this coalition government were seriously committed to jobs and growth, they would ensure that our schools were properly and adequately funded. We know that, without adequate funding for our schools, we will not go on to create the jobs of the future. We will not go on to have high-tech jobs created. We will not go on to have cutting-edge industries, which we are falling behind in around the world. We have to fund schools appropriately. School is where children get the education that they require and learn the things to go on and create those cutting-edge jobs. There was another slogan in the lead-up to the 2016 election. High-tech jobs were to be created in the IT sector, STEM and a whole range of things. To do that you have to educate the next generation of Australians. You have to ensure that there are adequate funds there, not cut $22.3 billion from education, as is being proposed. We see the government are not interested in ensuring that every child in Australia is adequately supported to achieve their full potential. They clearly believe it is more important to give big businesses a $65 billion tax cut than adequately fund our schools and the next generation of Australians so that they can go on and create the cutting-edge jobs of the future. I do not see how that is fair. Under the government's plan, school students, parents and teachers will miss out on $22 billion worth of funding. This is funding that was to go to students who need extra support in numeracy and literacy to bring them up to an adequate standard so that they can achieve and basically benefit from the education system. It was also there to help teachers support students with additional needs. What we are getting instead is a $22 billion cut to our education system. That means on average $2.4 million from every school in Australia over the next  decade. That would be the equivalent of sacking 22,000 teachers-teachers who make a real difference in the lives of our children. This equates to around $265 million being ripped from South Australian schools in 2018 through to 2019 and, in my electorate of Hindmarsh, a cut of over $10 million in public schools alone. That is just the public schools, let alone the Catholic schools and the other independent schools. As I said, it is not just the government school sector that is enraged. Catholic principals and educators from all over the country are warning us that parents face fee hikes of thousands of dollars and some Catholic schools may even close. The government continue to talk about fairness. We hear that word 'fairness', yet there is nothing fair in anything produced in this budget. They have demonstrated over many years that they are not interested in fairness in schools. They are not interested in needs based funding that will create a fair, level playing field for our students. What is more, the government has completely ignored South Australia in this budget. There is approximately $70 billion for roads, rail, ports and airports across the country but not a single dollar for South Australia, and we have projects ready to go, projects that will create work and assist in infrastructure. For example, this means nothing for our roads. Marion Road has been earmarked for some infrastructure works. Before the 2016 election, the Liberal candidate and the Prime Minister were out there spruiking it, saying that they would look into this, do a study and ensure that they fix this terrible mess which is the congestion between Mooringe Avenue, Marion Road and Cross Road, and there is a tram that goes through. I have yet to see a single thing on it. I was hoping I would on budget night. I sat there waiting for the words, 'Marion Road, Plympton: the intersection.' It was promised before the 2016 election, but there was not one cent for infrastructure for South Australia. We have the proposal for the AdeLINK tram extension which would go right through the middle of my electorate. That proposal is ready to go. It would create 2,000 jobs and open up transport. It would be a link between the tram service in the CBD and the coastal suburbs of Henley Beach with a spike into the Adelaide Airport, giving Adelaide Airport the infrastructure it requires for public transport. But there was not a thing on it in the budget. This is ready to go. It would create, over its life, 2,000 jobs in the infrastructure area. But, of course, we remember the goading of Holden to leave Adelaide back in 2013 by Mr Hockey(Time expired)",135
187,Ms VAMVAKINOU,BILLS," I thank the member for Hindmarsh for allowing me to steal his podium mid-sentence! I also thank the member for Cunningham for allowing me to step in ahead of her on the speakers list. I rise today to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2017-2018 and related bills before the House. In doing so, I want to address where this budget fails to deliver on fairness and to give a fair go to the people I represent in the federal seat of Calwell. My constituents are very much everyday Australians. They are workers, families, students, pensioners, young people and refugees-in fact, a large number of them are refugees, as we are receiving a huge number of the 12,000 that have come in from Syria due to the extra places. My constituents are also people with disabilities and, by and large, people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds and very diverse socio-economic backgrounds. Many of them have worked and continue to work in the low-skilled area of manufacturing, although that is now a vanishing job area. I have highly skilled people,  employed people, self-employed people and large numbers of underemployed and unemployed people. They are, by and large, resilient and very hard working Australians, and they were looking for a fair go in this budget. It is a budget that the Treasurer has termed 'a fair budget for a time when things are looking up'. So my constituents were hoping for some fair measures that might be of assistance to them in the way in which they get through their daily lives. I think 'a fair go' generally means giving everyone a real and equal opportunity and the resources to have a go and to make the best of what they can. It means paying taxes and making contributions to budgets according to each person's capacity to do so. It also means paying your fair share if you are a corporate or big business, and it certainly does not mean ordinary households and workers doing the heavy lifting of budget repair by paying higher taxes as company taxes and wages decline. I am glad to see, in recent commentary in the media over the last couple of days, that so-called top budget experts are making that point, and they are making it very loudly. The budget's across-the-board tax increase to fund Medicare, the NDIS and its $65 billion corporate tax cuts at the expense of education through a $22 billion cut to schools, hikes in university fees and cuts to TAFE and apprenticeships is hardly a vote of confidence in enabling opportunity for the ordinary people in my electorate. By choosing to deliver to big business and choosing multinationals at the expense of middleand working-class Australians, and by making the risky assumption that company taxes will translate into jobs growth and wages growth, the government is putting its eggs in one basket and, therefore, failing to secure better days for all of the people in my electorate and for ordinary Australians generally. I have had a number of my constituents call me since the budget was delivered to raise their concerns. I also had the opportunity, like many of my colleagues, to visit some of my public schools and, indeed Catholic schools in the short period between the budget and the next parliamentary sitting week. I think it is probably best to use some of their voices today here in the chamber to illustrate the frustration and disappointment of the people in my electorate with the budget. Sam Caruso is a constituent of mine. I have known him for a long time. He lives in Roxburgh Park. He recently retired after 52 years of working in very labour-intensive jobs. He has been a fitter and turner, and most of his life has been spent working on road construction. He began work at the age of 14, not an unusual story for many of the people who I represent, and now he is very much looking forward to having a rest, as he put it to me, and enjoying his retirement. He and I and many other people in this country feel that people like him have done their bit for the country. They have done their bit for the economy. They have done their bit for the budget. It is now time for them to retire to enjoy their senior years. I think we owe him and others like him that right. One of the first things Sam said to me is that the thought that the government is still harbouring the idea of raising the pension age to 70-which, as we know, would be the highest in the developed world-riles him. It does a lot of other people also, including me. The type of manual labour that Sam has been involved in for 52 years does eventually take its toll on people. It is the sort of physical work that is not found in corporate boardrooms and it is the sort of work that captains of industry would never understand and would never endure. So people like Sam after 52 years of work are hardly in a state to be physically able to  continue to do this sort of work until the age of 70. The question is: what happens to people like Sam? The zombie measure on raising the age of retirement to 70 was introduced in the 2014 budget. I remember the then Treasurer Joe Hockey said: 'What we are going to do is deliver a fairer system for the age pension. We ae going to focus on the sustainability of the system with a reasonable quality of life. The age pension expenditure today is currently more than we spend on defence.' Well, some people might argue that that is not a bad thing. The fact that our age pension spending exceeds that of our defence spending is a sign of a civilised society that is focused on and prioritises the care of its elderly and, in this case, its pensioners. As I said, the then Treasurer Joe Hockey made that quote. But I want to quote shadow minister Jenny Macklin when she said: How does Mr Turnbull expect construction workers, nurses and farmers to work until they're 70? He's completely out of touch. The government is out of touch because it does not actually understand the type of work that these Australians are involved in and it does not seem to care very much whether people are able to retire and have quality time with their families and to do the sorts of things that they did not get a chance to do while they were working and doing their bit for the country. The real issue here is that working to 70 might be okay for some in the future. I might, if I am lucky, choose to work beyond that as well. But for people like Sam in my electorate, the ones who are physically unable to work because they have endured so much physical labour, what are the alternatives for them? Unfortunately, the government is silent on this. Are workers with their working life potentially prolonged to 70 now expected to end it on unemployment benefits, just ticking boxes at the Job Network providers? What kind of indignity is that for people who have worked most of their lives? Sam cannot imagine himself being able to work on the roads until he is 70. He asked me to say that. He cannot imagine other fellow Australians doing hard yakka until the age of 70 either. It is only a government that sees its citizens as cogs in wheels that could come up with this nasty policy. Only a government that does not really understand the value and dignity of its citizens could come up with a plan to head off the availability of the age pension to its citizens while, simultaneously, thinking nothing of handing over $65 billion worth of tax cuts to big business-tax cuts that are actually coming out of the public purse, contributed to by the taxes of people like Sam. The budget is taking from the labour of middle and working class taxpayers and handing it to the corporate speculators. The idea that company tax cuts will lead to jobs growth is speculative. The truth is that most people I speak to tend to think that this is going to be an opportunity for the corporates to increase their profit margins rather than to create jobs. That is the view of the people out on the streets. It is very important to make that point here today. Returning to Sam-because Sam is very important; there are many Sams in my electorate-he will not forget that this budget has provided little help for or interest in helping the automotive supply chain manufacturers successfully transition either. My electorate, the federal seat of Calwell, is home to the now closed Ford factory plant. It was a Liberal government that ended car manufacturing in this country, and the so-called Growth Fund that was introduced, which was supposed to help the supply chain diversify, has always been  grossly underfunded. There is no joy in this budget for people in that industry, because the top-up that was introduced in the 2017 budget has for many been too little and come too late. Our manufacturing firms struggle to remain competitive, especially now, in light of skyrocketing energy prices. The budget has offered no immediate assistance for manufacturers who are under serious pressure as result of this. To this end, I want to speak about Willow Ware and their 200 employees in my electorate. Willow Ware is a manufacturer in my electorate that has experienced the disinterest this government has in helping Australian manufacturers. It is a 130-year-old company, founded by Ralph Wilson Sr, and I think we are on to the third consecutive Ralph Wilson. Willow Ware has survived the Great Depression. It has survived the credit crunch and the global financial crisis. It is a company that, during the world wars, did its bit for Australia-this iconic Australian company, by the way, makes the Esky; that is how iconic it is-but now that it needs help it is having to fight this government's war against manufacturing. Last year, Willow Ware was faced with the very real possibility of shutting its doors, ending a long family tradition of manufacturing Australian products, including the iconic Esky, and leaving 200 people in my electorate unemployed and their families out in the cold. It faced challenges from cheap overseas mass imports, with major outlets preferring the cheap plastic buckets to the quality, Australian-made product. In order to compete it needed to transform and upgrade its machinery, but it faced challenges with rising energy costs. Willow Ware is a company that also makes a car component for the Toyota motor car company-it received an award for from Toyota last year-so it is part of the automotive parts supply chain. Willow Ware reached out to the Turnbull government and its ministers. It invited the Prime Minister to visit its factory in Tullamarine, but Mr Turnbull's office told the company he was unavailable. This is a company that is very close to the Prime Minister's political party, by the way. It wrote to the then minister for innovation, Christopher Pyne, in early 2016 for some assistance. All it got back was a letter suggesting that it apply for a government grant that was already out of date. Approaches were made after the last election to the then innovation minister, Greg Hunt, and to the current minister for industry, Arthur Sinodinos, all to no avail. As the local member, I have tried to help Willow Ware. The Leader of the Opposition visited its factory, and the shadow minister for industry, Senator Kim Carr, and I have made a number of trips to the Willow Ware factory in Tullamarine. We have tried to be of assistance to Willow Ware. The truth is that they came close to closing their doors not long ago. If it had not been for the Andrews state Labor government intervening and assisting Willow to make that transition-that crucial transition and upgrading in order to be able, as I said, to compete against cheap imports-I feel that our local electorate would have copped another 200 job losses as a direct result of a situation that exists in Australian manufacturing at the moment and is dependent largely on who are in government and what their attitude towards manufacturing is. So I am pleased to say that we have been able to preserve Willow Ware, one of the last iconic Australian manufacturers, in my electorate and protect their jobs. On the issue of manufacturing and jobs growth-and I do not have much time left, unfortunately-I must say that the whole debate around penalty rates and working conditions and the incredible failure of the government to understand the needs of working men and women in the middleto lower-class sectors of the economy have left me and a lot of other  people absolutely dumbfounded. The idea that penalty rates are somehow a luxury that employers cannot afford is so ludicrous that it needs an entire 15 minutes to explain. On that note, I thank the Deputy Speaker!",138
188,Ms BIRD,BILLS," I rise to speak today on the budget bills, Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2017-2018, Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2017-2018 and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2017-2018. I have to say, like my colleague the member for Calwell, that there is a great deal of detail that needs to be addressed in terms of the issues and concerns that I have with the budget, but I will take the opportunity in various specific pieces of legislation to go through those in more detail. Already having spoken on the schools funding bill about my concerns in that area, I will do the same on a variety of other issues, including the broader education field, which includes TAFE and university, and health, in particular the changes that are in place around Medicare and the very, very, very slow winding back of the freeze and the impacts that is having on my electorate. Also I would like to take the opportunity in the future to talk in more detail about infrastructure funding. There is a very significant project in my area called the MaldonDombarton rail link. That is very critical to the development of our port and job opportunities locally and is also, at the other end of the rail link connecting into south-western Sydney, an opportunity for our two communities and economies to be well integrated and to work together more effectively. So I will canvass that as well. It is also, I think, very important to recognise that for age pensioners there are some real issues in this budget. My colleague has just spoken about extending the retirement age to 70. I also come from an area with a high percentage of people working in sectors such as manufacturing. It is a real problem for people who do physically heavy work to be required to work that much longer. And, of course, there are changes that have occurred to the energy supplement and what they will mean for pensioners. It is probably quite clear to the chamber that I have some real concerns about the inherent unfairness in the priorities that this government has decided to fund in this budget, particularly given the fact that, when you look at some of those cuts and who is paying and compare that to a decision to implement a $65 billion cut for the big end of town, it is not like the government is saying, 'Everybody's pulling their belt in.' It is actually saying to those who need it least: 'Well, you can have a bit extra. Millionaires, you can get a tax cut. Big business, you can get a tax cut.' If you balance those two decisions, the government is expecting those who are on average and low incomes to take a further cut to their income at the same time as it is increasing the capacity of those who least need it and probably will not even notice it, to be honest, to have an opportunity to get a tax cut-people like me, on an income in the top tax brackets, getting a tax cut. But I specifically want to talk today about an aspect of the budget that gives me great concern. It is something that has been worrying me for quite a while because it is consistently raised with me in my local area. That is what I see as an inherent generational unfairness that is developing in our communities, and the budget not only does not address that but will, in a significant number of ways, exacerbate it. It has been the case for a number of generations that each of us has aspired to leave our kids, the next generation, in a better position than we were. I consider my grandparents. My grandfather worked his whole life-he turned 100 recently, so I will say on the record: happy  birthday, Grandad!-and my nan, as was usual with her generation, was a stay-at-home mum her whole life. A trip to Sydney was probably the furthest they travelled in their lifetime. Neither of them finished high school education. It was pretty standard for their generation. My parents, by contrast, finished high school. My mum did not go on to post-high school education but, after finishing the early raising of children, had a very successful working life, working for a state member of parliament, actually. She was very good at her job and very well respected. My parents were able to buy their own home, not only their first home but to upgrade and to do better over the lifetime of home ownership and be in a position where they did not have a mortgage when they came to retirement age. They have had advantages that their parents did not have-for example, being able to travel overseas. Then we come to my generation. It is the case that for us finding employment was reasonably easy. I and many of my brothers and cousins were the first in our family to go to university-we were the first generation to get a university education. I will say that one of my brothers, who completed an apprenticeship, has probably ended up doing even better than the rest of us who had a university education. He is an electrician, an electrical engineer. But we all had postsecondary education, and we had the opportunity for the good jobs that that made available for us. This generation is facing a situation that we in this parliament need to start coming to terms with. The way this generation is connected to the employment market is very disjointed. Even with a post-secondary education they usually find that they have casual, part-time or contract work. They may in effect be working full-time but do not have the security of a full-time job. My sons are of an age to be in that group, and I know that many of their friends have been the same. It takes a long, long time for them to get their first permanent job. They may be bringing in an income that is equivalent to working full-time, but if they try to compete in the rental market, let alone apply for a mortgage, on an insecure income base then they are disadvantaged significantly. So the implications of that very casualised, unreliable work experience that many of our young people are having is delaying them put down the roots that will pay off when they reach retirement age. Among the big advantages of our retirement system are not only superannuation and the age pension but also the high levels of home ownership that we have in this country and the support that that gives to retirement lifestyles and income. I am very concerned that young people now are finding that that is an increasingly difficult reality to achieve. They of course have much higher HECS debts than we did. Even if they do diplomas and vocational education, often they will have a debt from that. On economic but also on equity grounds, this parliament needs to start looking at the reality of their lived experience and how we address it. That is my disappointment with this budget: it does not come to grips with those issues. In fact, some of the decisions in this budget, in particular the post-secondary school decisions, the significant funding cuts from our TAFE and vocational sector and the significant shift of cost from the government onto students for university students, are going to exacerbate those issues. There will be a triplewhammy effect: the cuts to universities, the impact of the increased percentage of the cost of a degree being borne by the student and the fact that you will have to start repaying HECS even earlier. Quite honestly, if you are living in any of our major cities-or our major regional cities, somewhere like Wollongong-and you are getting $42,000 you are going to  be really struggling to meet your ordinary cost-of-living requirements. That triple whammy is going to have a very significant effect on the young people that we are talking about. Turning to housing, I know the government has introduced a savings proposal through the superannuation scheme. I have talked to a number of young people about this. The general feeling was: 'Okay, instead of taking me 30 years it will take me 20 years to get anywhere near saving a deposit.' The real issue for them is what is happening in the market when they want to try and buy. The fact that the cost of housing has gone up so significantly and that in the last 10 years we have moved from a 10 per cent deposit being required to a 20 per cent deposit being required, means that young people feel like every time they start to get towards the goal post that makes it viable, the goal post moves again. Labor has been pointing out very accurately that the competitive forces in that market from investors, who are using multiple investment properties to increase their own wealth, are having a real impact on young people. I want to finish by reporting to the House on a survey. Because of this concern, I did a survey in my electorate of people between the ages of 18 and 25 to see what issues were concerning them. There mentioned exactly those issues I have mentioned: affordable education; health care; job opportunities; increasing costs of housing; TAFE and university course fees; and insufficient action on climate change, which was a big issue of concern for them; as well as disability issues and asylum seeker issues. That is the full range of the sorts of issues that were raised with me. Jobs, wages and penalty rates came out at 60 per cent of what those young people who responded were concerned about. I will share some of their comments with the chamber. Elise from Bulli said: Casual work - the requirements to obtain casual work is almost impossible, you have older retirement age and young adults (school leavers) in the workforce and university students, and stores are going automated. Penalty rates and stagnant wages. Miriam from Thirroul said: I think working for the dole is no good and you should bring back free education and healthcare. The youth allowance is not enough to live on. Lucy from Bellambi said: Keeping university affordable. Making jobs available to people over 18 years old. Ensuring that young people aren't paying more so baby boomers can earn more – accountability. Lachlan from Wollongong said: Plans to combat the increasingly obvious underpayment of students in the hospitality and service industries. I'm referring specifically to the Fairfax investigation published late last year, highlighting the prolific exploitation of young workers by supposedly 'great local businesses' in the Illawarra area. Blake from Bulli said: I think Mr Turnbull should realise that what he believes what will help the nation Australia will actually make it much worse for the future. I think also, if no one will reverse these damages, then we will have more hungry homeless people living in our land, which would be us all, and the only housing we would afford will be tents. And also if education will rise up more, then we will have no future for our country because no one can afford an education to lead us forward. No jobs + no money + no education = no future. Mark said:  Fair penalty rates. Fish and chip shops have to pay $35ph while maccas get away with $22. This is how our businesses die. Claire from Woonona said: Affordability of housing in the city is becoming so high that most university or TAFE students cannot hope to work, study full time and live comfortably. As a commuting student, I believe youth wages need to be reviewed. Remy from Coledale wrote: Minimum rate of pay is too low making it impossible to break into the housing market. Competition in the local housing market and fake inflation by real estate agents makes it impossible to buy your first home/apartment … Alexis from Austinmer wrote: I have recently completed a 2 year TAFE course and was unlucky enough to start in a year that it went from $1200 to $12000 a year. The way things are, I'm worried about the education of the children of the future … Callum from Woonona wrote: To put it simply Wollongong TAFE if not the whole TAFE system is a complete circus. Soon to come out of my time as an apprentice I know the future isnt that bright, with only 1 4th year apprentice last year securing a full time job out of 10. Some got casual work but how am I meant to get a house loan with a casual job, or any job? Maybe i should of just gone to uni and avoided the TAFE system, racked up a massive hex debt and never find a well paying job so all the thoughtful tax payers have to pay my debt off for me. Nathanial from Cordeaux Heights wrote: Penalty rates being slashed - pretty obvious why this is a bad thing. Rising TAFE and Uni costs - It's important to improve the accessibility and affordability of education. He also talks about higher rents and decreasing housing affordability, writing: My generation will never be able to afford a property if the market continues the way it is. Courtenay from Stanwell Park said: … we need real, immediate action on climate change. Stop putting profits before people and our environment. NSW is our worse state for renewable energy. This deeply saddens me. We could be leaders … Those are the voices of young people in my electorate, and I think it is clear why I feel that the budget fails the next generation.  Bill (No. 1) 2017-2018, which is, effectively, where the coalition government have laid out their priorities for Australia. This 2017 budget delivers a clear picture of what the Turnbull government stand for: absolutely nothing. Contrary to the rhetoric from the Treasurer on budget night, the LNP certainly do not stand for fairness. Fairness is not a quality you can fake. It is not a quality that you can rote learn and trot out in a speech. It is not a quality that you can trot out when it suits your political interests and then shove back in the political drawer, waiting for the next year. Fairness comes from the heart, not a focus group. Let us look at some of the unfair budget announcements by the Turnbull government, to confirm that they just fundamentally do not get fairness.  Let us look at higher education. The Turnbull government thinks that it is fair to hike up fees for university students and make them pay back the debt sooner, all while cutting funding for universities by $3.8 billion. Not only is this unfair; it is short sighted. Increasing student fees and lowering the repayment threshold for students to just $42,000 will no doubt deter some potential students from embarking on a tertiary education and the career that follows. We should not be deterring students from participating in tertiary education; we should be encouraging them. That is how we boost productivity. Unlocking the educational potential of young Australians is good for them and good for our economy. All Australians should have the opportunity to pursue a tertiary education, no matter where they live or how much their parents earn. Cutting funding for universities will have a detrimental effect not only on university teaching but also on the availability of university programs and university facilities. Also-scarily so-it will damage Australia's research efforts. We have a proud history of groundbreaking research endeavours. The vaccine for the human papillomavirus was developed by Professor Ian Frazer and his team at the University of Queensland, just down the road from my electorate. Professor Brian Schmidt, an astronomer at the Research School of Astronomy & Astrophysics, at ANU, here in Canberra, was awarded a Nobel prize in physics in 2011 for his part in discovering that the expansion of the universe is accelerating. Professor Barry Marshall, another Nobel laureate, showed that a bacterium, Helicobacter pylori, is the main cause of stomach and duodenal ulcers. He leads a team undertaking varied research into the bacterium at the Marshall Centre for infectious diseases, research and training, within the University of Western Australia. And that is just to name a few. There are many more Australians who have made important research discoveries in varied academic disciplines, and there are many more researchers right now in our universities currently striving to make the next big discovery or medical breakthrough. So it is short sighted to cut investment to universities, and it will have a detrimental impact on such important research endeavours. Cutting university funding to pay for a $65 billion bigbusiness tax giveaway is short sighted; it is dumb economics; and it is fundamentally unfair. Prime Minister Turnbull's 2017 budget fails on child care. It is unfair that an average Australian family with two children will face childcare fee increases of over $2,500 per year, a $2,500 fee hike at a time when wage growth is at record lows. Effectively, living standards are going backwards. One in three families is going to be worse off. Over 70,000 families on incomes under $65,000 will have to pay more. The most vulnerable and disadvantaged children will have their access to early education halved. The out-of-pocket costs for child care have risen every year under the Liberal government-and, as you know, Deputy Speaker, the coalition is about to commence its fifth year in government. The Turnbull government will also introduce a complex new activity test. This test will only make it harder for working women, especially those working part time and casually, to access affordable child care. Not only is this unfair; it is short sighted. The participation of women in the workforce in Australia is still 13 percentage points behind that of men. They are an untapped resource. Women in Australia have a lower participation rate than in New Zealand-and I can't stand it when the Kiwis beat us at anything!-in the United Kingdom and in Denmark. Affordable and accessible child care is essential to improving the participation rate of women in the workforce. Making it harder for women to access  affordable child care is unfair to Australian families, unfair to Australian women and unfair to Australian children, particularly those who are most disadvantaged. It is unfair that the Turnbull government's 2017 budget affirms that they will see an increase in the pension age to 70. The Minister for Finance confirmed last week in Senate estimates: Increasing the pension age to 70 is a measure that we remain committed to … He said it remained government policy. If so, Australia will have the oldest pension age in the developed world. Builders, tradies, nurses and farmers would have to continue what is sometimes backbreaking work until they are 70 before they would be eligible for the age pension. And people on the pension are being hoodwinked by the Turnbull government, who want accolades for a one-off payment secured by Independent senators, effectively a paltry $1.50 per week for pensioners, while at the same time they are axing the energy supplement, which will cost those same pensioners $365 a year-all to pay for a $65 billion tax giveaway for big business, and many of those big businesses are foreign. And not everyone will get the one-off payment. People struggling on Newstart will not get a cent, but they will still get a cut of $8.80 a week from the axing of the energy supplement, at the same time that power bills are going through the roof. It is unfair to force people to work until they are 70 before they can access the age pension. It is unfair to rip money off pensioners while at the same time giving a $65 billion tax giveaway to big business. It is unfair that the Turnbull government's 2017 budget totally ignores climate change. There was not one mention of climate change in the 2017 budget. Former President Barack Obama said last year: One of the most urgent challenges of our time is climate change … Why is it unfair for the Turnbull government to ignore climate change? It is unfair because Prime Minister Turnbull is leaving one of the most urgent challenges of our time to his children and to his grandchildren to solve. It is unfair because climate change is having an impact on our planet right now. It is unfair because, unless we tackle climate change now, my children may not get to enjoy the natural wonders that we enjoy in Australia, like the Great Barrier Reef, and the tourism jobs associated with it. A combination of two mass bleaching events has meant that half of the Great Barrier Reef has died over the past two years. This is on the watch of the member for Wentworth, the very same member for Wentworth who famously said: I will not lead a party that is not as committed to effective action on climate change as I am. Now, some might argue that the Prime Minister is not actually leading, but the Prime Minister and his government have shown that they are not committed to doing anything at all about climate change. We have even had bizarre suggestions that clean climate-change action might entail funding coal-fired operations. When Labor was in government, carbon pollution fell by over 10 per cent. The Turnbull government has spent $2.2 billion of taxpayers' money under their Direct Action Policy, only to see pollution increase-not decrease but increase-by almost six per cent. The central pillar of the Direct Action Policy, the Emission Reduction Fund, has actually run out of funds. This government has no plan to tackle climate change. It is unfair-cowardly, some might  say-to leave our children and our grandchildren to tackle dangerous climate change. It is unfair to fail to address one of the most urgent challenges of our time. It would be unfair to leave our children a dead Great Barrier Reef. It is unfair to announce a major transport infrastructure project and not announce any plans for funding to connect that project to the Port of Brisbane. It is unfair and incompetent to end up 35 kilometres short. On budget night the Turnbull government announced funding of $8.4 billion to build the Melbourne to Brisbane Inland Rail. In their media release they said it was the biggest rail project in 100 years. The problem is the railway line starts in Melbourne, which is okay, it heads north, which is okay, but then it ends at Acacia Ridge. Acacia Ridge is right in the middle of my electorate. The Turnbull government has announced no plan and no funding to get freight from Acacia Ridge to the Port of Brisbane. For those who may be from a little bit further south and may not know Acacia Ridge, it is near Stable Swamp Creek, which is a tributary of the Oxley Creek, which flows into the Brisbane River, which then goes down to the Port of Brisbane. I am not sure that the transport minister has ever been to this area, but you cannot take cargo ships up Stable Swamp Creek, I can assure you. It is unfair to leave the people who live in my electorate in the dark about how this essential part of the project is going to be implemented-or, in fact, whether it will be implemented at all. If there is no new railway line for the freight to get to the port, the freight will have to be transported on trucks, which will increase the traffic congestion on the already choked up roads in my electorate, and you obviously cannot have trucks double handling coal or wheat-or even cattle, for that matter. It is not efficient at all. So, if there is a new railway line to be built to finish the project, there are only really three options, you could say. The first is a tunnel from Acacia Ridge to the Port of Brisbane going right under the homes of people living in Macgregor and Sunnybank and those places in my electorate. The second option is another train line to be built alongside the Gateway Motorway, which would need to cut into the Karawatha Forest, one of the largest areas of remnant bushland within Brisbane and Logan. The third option would be perhaps to connect with the Beenleigh line around the Princess Alexandra Hospital and out onto the Cleveland line, with a spur off to the Port of Brisbane. Moreton constituents deserve to know whether the Turnbull government intends to finish this project, how they intend to complete the line and what the time frame for the project is. Or are they just going to stop at Acacia Ridge, 35 kilometres from the water? It was unfair to leave the people of Moreton worried about their homes and the amenity of the suburb they live in just so the Prime Minister could make a glib announcement on budget night. This 2017 budget is unfair because it cuts $2.2 billion out of Medicare. It is unfair that Australians will continue to pay more for their health care under the Turnbull government. Despite announcing that they were lifting the GP freeze, it has now been revealed that the freeze will not actually be lifted until 2020. The Turnbull government fundamentally does not care about Medicare. They fundamentally do not hold it dear and cannot be trusted to protect Medicare. There are 113 Medicare items that will stay frozen for another three years. These items were accessed 23 million times last financial year. Important health services like consultations for mental health plans and chronic disease assessments will stay frozen. These services are essential to keep Australians healthy and safe. We need to encourage Australians to access these services, not discourage them. It is very short-sighted.  As if continuing the freeze on Medicare were not enough, the Turnbull government has actually established a secret task force to cut our public hospitals. The reports so far reveal that the plan involves a significant cut to public hospital funding and abolishing the private health insurance rebate. The Liberal government cannot be trusted with our health care. Senate estimates have revealed that senior health bureaucrats have been actively working on options to attack our universal healthcare system for years. The task force proposal was discussed as recently as two weeks ago. We should have learned by now that the Liberal Party will attack Medicare every chance it gets. It is unfair that the universal health care that we all cherish is under attack by this government. I am particularly incensed that the 2017 budget sees the Turnbull government walking away from giving every child in every school the best opportunity for a great education. It is unfair for the Turnbull government to walk away from needs based funding for schools. They do not understand equity in education funding. The 2017 budget is unfair because the Turnbull government are giving big business a $65 billion tax giveaway at the same time as they are cutting $22.3 billion from education funding, cutting $2.2 billion out of Medicare, taking money off pensioners and making families pay more for child care. This is all while millionaires will receive $16,000 extra in their wallets from 1 July. The $65 billion big business tax giveaway that I referred to will cost the budget $15 billion a year in 10 years time and forever. This unfair tax giveaway is a long term structural drag on the budget. It is unfair and irresponsible to have ordinary Australians, pensioners and families paying for a tax giveaway for big business at this point in time. This is not the time, while the budget deficit is mushrooming, to be making this extravagant commitment to big business. The Turnbull government do not understand fair. They are committed to an educational policy that will not boost productivity. They are committed to a $65 billion tax giveaway that they hope will trickle down. Their own Treasury suggests it will at best give a small, less than one per cent, boost to the economy. The Turnbull government might say the word 'fair', but fundamentally they do not understand fair. Perhaps once upon a time this Prime Minister did, but that man is gone and only a husk remains.",142
189,Ms BURNEY,BILLS," I wish it were a pleasure to rise and speak in this debate on Appropriation Bill (No.1) 2017-18 and related bills, but it is not. We are speaking today about a budget that is not Labor light, as so many have called it. The budget is a poor imitation of what fairness and decency look like. The fact is the government may have stripped away some of its zombie measures, some of its cuts to families, some of its cuts to education and some of its health cuts, but it is still a budget that seeks to penalised lowincome earners so that they can hand out $67 billion in tax cuts to big business. At the heart of this budget is the same lifters-and-leaners approach. If you are looking for work, you are a leaner. If you need a disability support payment, you are a leaner. If you need assistance to make sure your kids get the textbooks and uniforms they need for school, according to those opposite, you are a leaner. In fact, just about the only people those opposite do not think are leaners are the big multinational companies and high-income earners. The Prime Minister says that fairness is at the centre of this budget, but let us look at the facts. If you earn over $180,000, you will get a tax cut but everyone else will pay more. Those earning $80,000 a year will pay at least $400 more tax. In fact, the government will rip $8.2  billion out of the pockets of workers. It is always the same from those opposite-lifters and leaners; bludgers and their mates in big business. If you want to see how unfair this government is, look no further than the Minister for Human Services's portfolio. Every time he runs out of things to say he announces another welfare crackdown. At this point, by my count, we are up to at least No. 9 in terms of welfare crackdowns. This government has run the Department of Human Services into the ground. We have had robo-debt and skyrocketing wait times at Centrelink, not to mention blowouts in pension claim processing. These are not problems that only affect leaners. These are issues that affect people receiving an age pension, people who have lost their job, young families who want to claim their family tax benefit or those with disabilities who need some support. That means age pensioners waiting longer in queues and on phones. It means more jobseekers waiting for hours on the phone, struggling to clarify their responsibilities. It means people with a disability trying to get assistance they need. It means new mums and dads jumping through bureaucratic hoops trying to get parental leave so that they can spend time with their children. The minister says that the average wait time for calls to Centrelink is around 12 minutes, but the truth is that for most Centrelink clients the wait times are often hours. For older Australians, the time in December last year just to get an answer before being put back on hold was 23 minutes; for youth and students the wait time was 33 minutes; and for the dissipation solutions the wait time was an unbelievable 57 minutes. I know those in the chamber are eager to hear the Turnbull government's solution to the damning service standards at Centrelink: surprise, surprise, it is more cuts! A total of 12,000 staff are to be axed from the Department of Human Services, which is already at breaking point trying to deal with the incredible mess created by the minister's bungled robo-debt system. This makes no sense. In the last two years this government has cut 2,000 jobs from the Department of Human Services-almost 5,000 in five years. There is no way that this will improve services. What it will do is put more pressure on hard working Department of Human Services staff, who are already under immense pressure. This will only make things worse for those who are already struggling. These cuts are a tragedy for those who are already struggling to find work and are being demoralised and dehumanised by a system that is broken, and they are heart breaking for those who will lose their jobs. The minister has yet to explain his justification for these cuts, other than saving money at the expense of the most vulnerable communities in Australia. He has been completely silent. After all these job cuts and falling service levels the minister owes this place and the community an explanation. The best he has offered so far is a plan to replace 2,000 job cuts in his department with 250 labour hire call centre workers. These workers will most likely be casual and will be untrained in the complexities of our social safety net. Most disappointingly, they will be unable to actually help in specific cases. They will offer general information. Last year Centrelink missed almost 29 million calls-29 million calls went unanswered. Just to fix that problem, without actually making wait times any better, those 250 privatised call centre staff will need to answer 116,000 calls each year. Working 260 days a year, excluding public holidays and weekends, they will need to answer at least 440 calls a day just to stop people getting the engaged signal when they call. That is the best those opposite have to offer and it is not going to make any difference at all.  But the disasters of Centrelink in this budget do not end there. We have all heard of the bungled robo-debt program of the Minister for Human Services. It is the one the Ombudsman said was not a fair or reasonable system. Robo-debt is a program that has seen thousands of Australians accused of defrauding the government, even though they have not done the wrong thing. It is the one that slugged thousands with debts they do not know, which were grossly inflated. This budget will expand the robo-debt system, seeking to claw $1 billion out of the pockets of age pensioners who have income streams and investments or super. If people own money or claim allowances they are not entitled to, they should pay it back, but we should be very sure before we accuse people of doing the wrong thing. We should not leave these decisions to unaccountable robots and computer programs. The minister has not acted to fix the problem of his broken system. In fact, he is still waiting for PricewaterhouseCoopers to finish their review and tell him if it is working. Policy and programs designed and implemented poorly are not just a failure of management. When it comes to social and human services they are plain cruel. Quite aside from the disastrous administration of this program, the minister's response to the public outcry summed up just how nasty those opposite can be. Rather than fix the problems with the program they chose to leak private information about a private individual to the media. Centrelink clients are currently waiting hours on the phone trying to get information. Perhaps they should be putting media requests to the minister's office. Then, it seems to happen more quickly! This budget is unfair because, at its heart, this government is unfair. But the failure does not end with the Department of Human Services. The schools in almost every electorate across the country will suffer thanks to this budget. The Liberal's faux Gonski 2.0 funding program is a con designed to hide the fact that their only plan for schools is cuts. Those opposite are selling out students, whether they are in public, independent or Catholic schools, and it is simply unacceptable. We already know that, under the government's plan, schools will get $22 billion less in funding than they would have under the real Gonski plan. Those opposite are more interested in giving $65 billion in tax cuts to the big end of town than properly funding schools. It is astounding. It is worth examining the history in this area. In the Abbott years, firstly, they told us we were on a unity ticket. Then they won and they changed their minds. They said that they did not think fair funding mattered. They continued on that argument for a while, but the community did not buy it, so now the Prime Minister has changed tack. He decided to commission a review into the Gonski review, to be led by David Gonski, to establish whether the needs-based model was a good one. That just seems to me to be astounding. But Mr Turnbull's Gonski 2.0 is a fiction. It will actually see less funding made available for schools. In the community of Barton, which I represent, there will be about $14 million less funding for schools in 2018 and 2019. There will be less money for programs tailored to the needs of students in our area, which means less one-on-one attention for students who need it and less support for students with a disability. The contact I have had with the schools I have visited clearly outlines what this is going to mean for students. That seems to be where the focus should be. It will mean students who are behind in literacy will not be able to catch up. It will mean students who are anxious and who have self-esteem issues will not ever rebuild that self-esteem. It will mean parents will be very, very worried about the programs they have supported in schools, as will the school principals and staff who have added to those schools  and, therefore, to the life choices of those children. Put simply, these funding cuts marketed as Gonski 2.0 will hurt schools in all of our electorates. This is not a fair budget. This is the kind of budget that a Liberal government struggling in the polls produces when it is out of ideas. This is not a budget about fairness. It is more of the same from a government which is entirely bereft of ideas. Those opposite keep saying that this is a budget that offers fairness, opportunity and security. They are just three words. Those three words are important words, but not in the way they are being applied in this budget. It simply cannot be. It is not fair, it does not provide opportunity and it certainly does not provide security. In fact, it does the opposite of those three fine goals. It does not offer any of those things for struggling parents, those looking for work, students or older Australians. People do not choose to be unemployed. People do not choose to grow old. People do not choose to have a disability. Those groups of people that rely on us in this place to represent them-that rely on us in this place to make their lives bearable-must be sorely disappointed. What this budget does offer is service cuts and empty rhetoric. No wonder there is such cynicism out in the community about the role of politicians. This budget does not demonstrate that there is any fairness or any opportunity. There is certainly no security. This government is trying to convince the community with empty slogans and lip-service. If it starts listening to the community, it might know what it is supposed to do and who it is elected to serve in this place. I will just finish up by focusing on that very point. We are elected by people to serve in this place. We are elected by people who expect us to carry their aspirations, their hurts, their loves, their pains and their joys into this place. They do not expect government to design budgets that will undermine the very life that they have sought to build and that will undermine the very way in which fairness is understood in this country. At the start, I said that I wished it were a joy for me to stand and give this speech about this budget. But it is not, simply because it is so very unfair.",149

191,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, I call the very patient member for Kingston.,152
192,Ms RISHWORTH,BILLS," I am glad that the government has finally turned up so that we can get this debate underway. Of course, if I were the government, I probably would be ducking and weaving from this debate, because we are debating the unfair budget that was delivered a couple of weeks ago. What this budget did is deliver a tax cut for millionaires and multinational companies, and it will make every ordinary Australian working person pay more. That is exactly what it did. It will make people who go to visit their doctor pay more. For those who go to Catholic schools, particularly in disadvantaged areas, we have been told that their parents are going to pay more. That is what this government has delivered in the budget. No matter how many times Malcolm Turnbull says that this is a fair budgethe can say it is much as he likes-it does not make it true. That is something that our Prime Minister really struggles with. He thinks that if he says it time and time again suddenly it will be true. That is not the case. For my electorate, this budget delivers very little. In fact, it delivers a $22 billion cut to our schools. That is $22 billion cut from some of the most needy schools. Last night in the House I went through some of those cuts. There is $15 million being cut from public schools in my  electorate in 2018 and 2019, schools such as Christies Beach High School, Christies Beach Primary School and Christie Downs Primary School. These schools service and provide schooling to some of the most vulnerable children-children with a disability and Indigenous children-and they are receiving massive cuts. So the Prime Minister can come into question time as often as he likes and say that it is a needs based funding model, but when you are cutting from Aldinga Primary School, cutting from Sheidow Park Primary School and cutting from Hackham West Primary School that is not needs based funding, and people in my electorate are very concerned. Catholic and independent schools in my electorate are also supporting a lot of vulnerable children, and it is disappointing that again we are seeing cuts to our schools. When I think about the future of this country and the future of the younger people in my electorate, I want them to have a better life than the generations before them. Part of that better life, no matter where you live, involves an excellent schooling. That is what sets the building blocks for navigating the future in what is going to be a complex employment market with new jobs that have not even been invented yet. The base we need for that is a decent, high-quality education system. Other countries around the world are not cutting funding from their schools; they are investing. But unfortunately this government, in this budget, has seen fit to cut from our schools. Equally, countries around the world are investing in their universities and ensuring that university education is accessible based on merit, not on someone's ability to pay. We all remember the 2014 budget, when the government tried to bring in an American style model that would hike up fees for universities. They are still trying to hike up fees for universities. In this budget the government have indicated that they want to see higher fees for students, while at the same time cutting $3.8 billion from our universities. They have also flagged that they want to see students paying back HECS faster. Taking the threshold for repaying HECS from $55,000 to $42,000 might sound good, but $42,000 is not a princely sum. That is a modest income. At the same time these students are graduating from university and getting their first job, they are trying to start a family. They might be trying to start a small business or buy a house. What the government are saying to them is: you have got to pay back faster. That is not a fair system. It is not one that supports students to get a high-quality education or supports them into jobs. Let's face it, that is what a university education is about: giving people the opportunity to be their best so that they can turn that opportunity into a highpaying job. This government, unfortunately, is dashing that dream for many students. Many students will think twice about going to university as a result of these cuts. Indeed, it is not just young Australians who will be affected. It is those who may have had one career and found themselves looking for a new career direction. I have met so many of those who are termed mature age students, who may not have got the best results in year 12 or had the money to go to university and who have decided they want to change direction in life. Unfortunately, this government is saying: 'We are going to jack up your fees. We are not going to support you to take a new direction.' That is the wrong approach when we are in a global race-not a race within our country but a global race-for educational skills. This budget cuts another $600 million from TAFE and apprenticeships. That is a significant problem when we know that getting a certificate III, a certificate IV or a diploma can increase your chances of getting a job. Instead of the government investing in this really  important area, we are now going to have 130,000 fewer apprentices and trainees. That is appalling, and it is something that many parents in my electorate talk to me about. They want to see apprenticeship opportunities for their child. In fact, a lot of young people come and talk to me about how they would love to get an apprenticeship. But we have seen this government wax and wane and not support the apprenticeship and skills sector. These are the types of investments we should actually be celebrating. Investments in education, in our universities and in skills are investments in our people. In the future our people are going to be critical to our success in this global race. Being highly skilled and highly trained is what will ensure that our country remains competitive-not how much iron ore we can dig out of the ground and not how many minerals we can export. It will be our people who will add value and ensure that our country remains globally competitive and that we continue to have a high quality of living standards. This government has shown no regard for this. It has been using every excuse to cut these in this budget. I want to move on from education because, of course, there have been many other unfair measures in this budget. For our pensioners we have seen the government reinforce its commitment to raise the pension age to 70, the highest in the developed world. When I am in my electorate speaking with those who are coming up to pension age, they are extremely scared of this. They are particularly scared if they have had a labour-intensive job and they have physical ailments as a result. Nurses, builders and other people who have had a very physical job in their life have told me directly that their bodies are not going to hold out until they are 70. They will be broken and they will have no income as a result. Raising the pension age to 70 shows the government is so out of touch with the real lives of those who have worked hard all their lives and deserve a decent retirement.",152
193,Unknown,BILLS,Government members interjecting,154
194,Ms RISHWORTH,BILLS,"I hear interjections from those on the other side. Quite frankly, I am not sure it is going to make much difference for people whose bodies are already broken at the age of 50. At the age of 50 and 55 there are people out there who have worked hard their whole lives. This is an outrageous measure that should be opposed. Equally, abolishing the energy supplement, which will leave new pensioners up to $366 a year worse off, is an appalling measure. It shows no regard for our pensioners. It is something that the government should look seriously at. Once again we know that this is not a fair budget. Unlike what the Prime Minister keeps repeating, this is an unfair budget. What hits pensioners, families and everyone is the continued freeze of the indexation of Medicare. The government would like you to believe that suddenly in this budget they have fixed the Medicare indexation freeze. That is just not true. We know that this freeze will continue for many medical services and allied health services for at least three more years. This is doing damage in my electorate. We know that the out-of-pocket costs are growing. We know that more and more people are struggling to pay to see a doctor. What is the result of that? I have said this over and over in this place. The result is that people do not go and see a doctor. They do not go and see their GP. They do not go and see a specialist. What happens then? What happens is that their condition gets worse and worse and they end up in hospital. Freezing the Medicare rebate and dissuading people from going to see their GPs and getting early intervention will place a much bigger burden on our healthcare system because it will lead people to go to hospital, and that is a much more expensive proposition. I know that the  previous Prime Minister, Prime Minister Abbott, and the current Prime Minister probably do not really care about that because they think it is the states' problem, not the Commonwealth's. But anyone who believes in a decent healthcare system should be looking at all levels of our healthcare system and working out how we can prevent people getting sick, because that is what will improve quality of life. I am running out of time and there is so much to talk about here. There are so many unfair measures in this budget. But I am going to finish on what I think is an appalling omission in this budget, and that is the fact that there is no new funding for infrastructure for South Australia. South Australia is facing difficult times. We are seeing the exit of the automotive industry after the previous Treasurer, Joe Hockey, goaded Holden into leaving this country. This is having a massive impact right around South Australia, but particularly in my electorate, because so many automotive and manufacturing components are manufactured in my electorate. With the exit of Holden, Ford and Toyota, this is a significant issue. We need real investment in our state from the Commonwealth. We need a true partner in the Commonwealth. That has not been demonstrated in this budget. We have a government that has said: 'Bad luck! We're going to give this money to the eastern states and we're not going to give you one new cent.' I have a long list-and it may not be the same as everyone else's-of major infrastructure that could be funded. Of course, we have AdeLINK. That could be funded with this money. We have the rail extension to Aldinga. That is an excellent project that could have been funded in this budget. We have the dual carriageway upgrade of South Road between Seaford and Aldinga. That could have been a project funded in this budget. There are many, many projects that could have been funded by this Commonwealth government-projects that would not only improve economic development within my state but also provide short-term jobs. But, of course, this government has completely ignored South Australia. Before we hear the government's usual protest, 'But we're going to support you to build the submarines,' let me say that one policy is not enough. The government was forced into ensuring that South Australia got any work from the submarines. Let's not forget that former Prime Minister Abbott was planning to have the submarines completely built in Japan. That was his plan. We know that. Instead, the government was embarrassed, cajoled and forced by Labor into building them in Australia. But that work does not start for some time. We are losing jobs now, and we need a government that is going to take that seriously. We need a government that actually has a plan for jobs and infrastructure, and that is something that this government does not have. There is nothing in this budget that shows the government is serious about creating jobs and investing in South Australia. I call on the government, if it is serious about South Australia and serious about the investment, to show us the money. It should show us what it is going to spend on infrastructure projects, because I have a long list and I know every other Labor member in South Australia has too. If those opposite are not sure, I can tell them. On that note, I end my contribution by condemning this unfair budget. (Time expired)",154
195,Ms KEAY,BILLS," I welcome the comments of my colleague, who is a very strong advocate for the state of South Australia. I will be putting my case in the context of my great state, the state of Tasmania, which seems to have been completely forgotten in this budget. I think I need to give every member of the coalition a map of Tassie, because it has  been completely wiped off the national map-although I cannot recall Tasmania seceding to join Antarctica or anywhere else. This budget has been a huge disappointment for my state. In fact, it was quite telling that the Treasurer's speech on budget night did not mention Tasmania once. The previous speaker, my colleague the member for Kingston, talked about the lack of infrastructure projects in her state. I can tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that there was nothing new in the budget for infrastructure for Tasmania. In fact, what was in the budget for Tasmania was an $85 million cut to Tasmanian schools, including about $65 million cut from Tasmanian public schools. The Premier of Tasmania, who was obviously watching on budget night, tweeted: 'What a great budget this is for the state of Tasmania.' What a joke! It was a cut to public schools. The Medicare freeze is to remain in place for years to come, which will have a huge impact on the health of the people in Tasmania and in my electorate of Braddon. As a mentioned, there is not one new cent for job-creating infrastructure, and there are continued attacks on our pensioners. I have a disproportionately high number of pensioners in my electorate, and they are certainly not happy. There are massive cuts to TAFE. Considering where we are with the huge reduction in the number of apprentices and trainees in my electorate, that is very disappointing. And there is a higher cost to higher education. Particularly in my electorate, where we have low educational outcomes, to try to then whack it onto higher education and say, 'Well, I'm sorry, but you're going to be paying more for this,' sends a signal to the people, potentially: 'You shouldn't be going to university.' That is detrimental to my state. And, just to rub their noses in it, Tasmania is a state with lower than average wages, lower than the rest of Australia. An increase in taxes is a huge hit. But, on the other hand, the government is giving millionaires a tax cut. The priorities are completely wrong, and they could be no further wrong than in the state of Tasmania. On jobs, health and education, this budget is a failure for Tasmania and for my electorate of Braddon. From the young to the old, this government has spared no-one. It is little wonder that not one coalition minister and not one coalition assistant minister or even parliamentary secretary has come to Tasmania since the budget. Not one visited the state. But I have to say that I can reel off, probably on two hands, the number of Labor shadow ministers that came to the state, including leader Bill Shorten. The 'Bill Bus' came to Tasmania to tell the people what this budget meant for them, and it was disappointing for them to hear the facts. Only an alternative Labor government will deliver for my state. I have to ask: why did they not come? Is it because they were too ashamed? Did they have nothing to sell the people of Tasmania? They are not really rhetorical questions, but I think that, if you were to answer those questions, your answer would be yes. This budget for Tasmania is a dud. Last week I spoke about the government's cuts to education and what they meant for Tasmanian schools. Today I want to talk about what these cuts mean in a social and economic sense for Tasmania. Economic commentators and local businesses are on the public record saying that improving our educational outcomes is a key to my region's and the state's future. Sadly, Braddon and Tasmania generally have some of the worse educational outcomes in the nation. Writing in The Australian earlier this year, respected economist and University of Tasmania Vice-Chancellor's Fellow Saul Eslake stated:  The proportion of Tasmania's population with a bachelor's degree or higher is 6.2 percentage points below the national average, while the proportion of the population with no qualification beyond Year 10 of high school is 10.4 percentage points above the national average. In December last year, Mr Eslake launched his second Tasmania report, a document that maps Tasmania's social and economic performance. The news headline from the launch of this report reads 'Boosting engagement in education is key to lifting living standards in island state'. In launching that report, Mr Eslake said the single most important thing that needed to be done in order to improve Tasmanians' living standards relative to those of other Australians was to increase the levels of educational participation and attainment. Mr Eslake went on to say: Higher levels of educational participation and attainment won't solve all of Tasmania's economic and social challenges - but they will make them less difficult to solve, not least by sustainably increasing the resources which can be used to solve them … Given the social and economic challenges facing Tasmania, can anyone in this building explain why it makes sense to cut $84.4 million from Tasmanian schools in the years 2018 and 2019? The silence is deafening. The coalition said they were on a unity ticket with Labor when it comes to educationremember that, in 2013? They said they would match Labor's education funding dollar for dollar. Clearly, they were not being truthful. Labor's plan to fully fund the original needs based funding model is already making a difference in my electorate and Tasmanian schools. In my electorate at Ulverstone High School, as I said last week, the school association have told me that their additional needs based funding has meant that they are able to provide extra support for students in literacy and numeracy and, most importantly from my perspective, provide support for disengaged students. Ulverstone High School, with the support of Labor's needs based funding, are doing just what Saul Eslake and others are suggesting. They are engaging in education the very students who may fall through the cracks, the same students who more than likely would not go on to a post year 10 qualification and most certainly would not go on to a tertiary education. It makes no economic sense to punish the students of Braddon by cutting, on average, $2.4 million from every local school. It makes no social sense not to support disengaged students as best we can. I am running out of time, and, as the previous speaker said, there is so much to talk about. Let me talk about TAFE. You would think investing in local skills should be a priority for this government but, again, in this area the budget is a dud. The budget cuts more than $600 million from TAFE and vocational education over the next four years. This comes on top of almost $3 billion in cuts to TAFE skills and training since this government came to office. As at September last year, when the National Centre for Vocational Education Research reported, Tasmania had lost 1,700 apprentices since the member for Warringah became Prime Minister back in 2013. That is not a great record. I challenge those opposite, particularly those from regional areas, to step forward and explain how cutting a further $600 million from TAFE would help young people in their communities. The triple education attack on Tasmania's future in this budget is complete with the decision by the coalition to cut university funding and increase fees. As I have already said, Tasmania has the lowest rate of participation in tertiary education of any state. The University  of Tasmania, or UTAS as it is known, are still assessing what a national cut of $3.8 billion will mean to them. On top of this, Tasmanian students are already facing significant barriers to tertiary education and are now facing increased costs and demands to repay their HECS debt at lower income levels. How on earth are they meant to get ahead in life? How on earth does it make sense for the government to invest $150 million in Labor's policy to support the expansion of UTAS in Launceston and Burnie but at the same time send a signal to potential students that they will pay more to attend. On the one hand, I do welcome the government's commitment in the budget to lift the cap on associate degrees, which is very important for the Cradle Coast campus of UTAS, but, on the other hand, students will have to pay more. It just does not make sense. I want to move to health, a very important issue for Tasmanians. We are now seeing, under a Liberal state government and coalition national government, a crisis in our health system. Braddon has an ageing population and a disproportionate number of people who are on benefits, and they rely on Medicare for support. But in Tasmania bulk-billing rates continue to drop. People are paying more to see the doctor. You only have to go around to the GP clinics in my area to see the signs in reception areas telling people they will no longer be bulk-billed. The community have to wait until 2020 for relief on the cost of going to see a doctor, if at all, and they have to wait more than two years for the freeze on specialist procedures and allied health services to be lifted. On this issue alone, the budget fails the people of Braddon. I want to move on to some last comments, because I am running out of time-although I could talk on this all day long. Let's go to infrastructure. You would think that infrastructure was a mechanism for growing a state's economy and actually creating the jobs that we need in our state. But the important job-creating projects, like the Cradle Mountain Master Plan, which is in my region and a No. 1 priority for all my local councils, did not see any additional funding under this government. That is quite strange, because the tourism minister in the previous parliament was from my electorate in the state of Tasmania, yet there is no additional money for this project. According to Deloitte Access Economics, this project will generate about 140 long-term jobs and $29 million per annum of additional economic activity in my region, which is a rural and regional community. That is massive for the people in my electorate. Despite commitments from the state government and the federal opposition, the best this government can do is a measly $1 million for a feasibility study. This project is a public-private partnership potentially worth $160 million, and this government does not send any signal to private investors that it is worth funding, worth putting their money into. I can tell you now: that is not the opinion of the opposition. But even this study has not been completed. Again, you have to wonder what the state government has been doing to secure additional Commonwealth investment-clearly nothing. To top things off, not one cent has been offered for important road upgrades on the Bass Highway at Latrobe or between Marrawah and Wynyard. Fixing the entry to and exits off the Bass Highway at Latrobe will open up that community's industrial estate for development, giving further job opportunities. I am sure my colleagues in Bass, Lyons and Franklin will also highlight the infrastructure neglect by this government in their electorates. It really demonstrates that the coalition has abandoned Tasmania. The state government's response has been weak, if not laughable. While the education minister of every other state, including the coalition state of New South Wales, criticises the  budget, Tasmania's Premier and its Minister for Education and Training have welcomed it. It just goes to show how the Hodgman government does not have the gumption to stand up to the Prime Minister like its colleagues in other states. The bungling Minister for Infrastructure at state level, Rene Hidding, also promised he would fight for a better deal with infrastructure projects-again a failure. I have to ask the question: what are our Tasmanian Liberal senators actually doing? I do not know. I do not see them. I do not hear from them. The silence from them is deafening. As I have said before in this place, Braddon has a disproportionate number of pensioners and an ageing population. How does this government want to treat them? Make people who have worked in some of the most challenging circumstances-at sea, underground, on the land or on the factory floor-work until they are 70. In many cases this will not be physically possible. To top it off, the government remains committed to axing the clean energy supplement for pensioners. The Prime Minister says this budget is about fairness. He can say the word, but the reality for pensioners in Braddon is that this budget is not fair. This budget is about choices. You can choose to look after people, or you can choose to look after big business. This government chooses to give away $65 billion to big business while cutting almost $85 million over the next two years from Tasmanian schools. It chooses to give millionaires a tax cut while a person in my electorate on the average income will face a tax hike. The government chooses to still make the sick and elderly pay more to see a doctor. Clearly none of this is fair. When I talk to people in my electorate it is clear what choices they would like to see: investment in health, in schools, in hospitals, in jobs and in infrastructure, and that is not happening.",155
196,Mr HART,BILLS," I thank the member for Braddon for her contribution on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2017-2018, Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2017-2018 and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2017-2018. The privilege of being elected to this place carries with it a responsibility in participating in the contest of ideas in this place to represent and reflect the views of the electors of northern Tasmania. Whilst there are admirable attempts to ensure that the public have access to the speeches and events which occur daily in this place, there is little hope of rising above the snippets of vision that will be broadcast from question time or a doorstop during the day. This is my attempt to explain the differences in vision between my side of politics and the present policies adopted by the government, as expressed through the budget handed down by the Treasurer. When I speak in this place, I often need to emphasise the disadvantage within my electorate. This is regrettable but necessary. Educational outcomes are poor. On multiple measures, health outcomes are amongst the worse nationally. The social determinants of health provide an explanation for poor health outcomes and point towards potential solutions, even if those solutions are long term rather than short term. Unemployment, in particular youth unemployment, is unacceptably high. There is, in common with other areas of disadvantage within the nation, intergenerational disadvantage expressed in long-term unemployment and reliance upon the social safety nets within social security and other legislation. There are nevertheless actual and/or potential advantages within Tasmania, including striking beauty, a stable population, a temperate but much maligned climate and considerable expertise in primary production, fisheries and tourism. However, the economic performance  of the state, measured in per capita gross-state-product terms, is significantly below the average per capita gross state product of other states. There are multiple potential causes of this deficit, including an older population and in particular a lack of educational attainment. Many young people feel that they are forced to leave the state to search for employment or, if they complete tertiary education within the state, they should pursue employment elsewhere. We know that this electorate relies upon aspects of the social safety net, in particular services funded or substantially funded by the state and federal governments in the form of access to public health and public education as well as social security payments and benefits; therefore, any conversation on the topic of fairness has real, not theoretical, impact in my electorate. The importance of access to public health is consistently underestimated by those opposite. Access to a GP is constrained if a person is unable to meet the gap between the Medicare schedule rebate and the charge raised by the GP. Despite the statistics relied upon by the government regarding access to bulk-billing, it is very difficult to locate or access a bulk-billing GP practice within Northern Tasmania. Indeed, I am surveying my electorate at present to collate information on what services are able to be bulk-billed in Northern Tasmania. The consequence of a lack of bulk-billing GPs is that many people who are unable to access a GP practice will attend the emergency department of a public hospital, leading to increased demand in our public hospitals. This is particularly notable at the Launceston General Hospital. That hospital has struggled with demand, both within the emergency department and within the hospital for hospital admissions. Health policy needs to address access to general practitioners as well as the proper funding and resourcing of public hospitals. The Tasmanian health system can be properly described as being in crisis. This is a fair description, given that the Australian Medical Association Tasmania indicated on 20 May 2017 that it had lost confidence in the Tasmanian Health Minister, Michael Ferguson, stating that the system was 'plagued by governance dysfunction, deteriorating patient safety indicators, worsening hospital overcrowding and a toxic bureaucratic culture'. This federal government, as successor to the Abbott Liberal government, has delivered cuts to health and education that have had a lasting impact on our health and education systems. In education the government has now adopted the mantle of a needs based system, in rebadging its education policy in the name of Gonski. What it still delivers is cuts to education, just as it previously delivered cuts to health funding. What most concerns me, therefore, is that this government is prepared to deny Tasmanian children, particularly disadvantaged Tasmanian children, the opportunity to put that disadvantage behind them through the transformative power of education. There is no doubt that the Northern Tasmanian community that I represent in Bass understands the importance of policies that address unemployment, underemployment, lowpaid work, the maintenance of penalty rates, funding for public education-and, indeed, education generally on a needs basis-and support for public health, including access to GPs and support for our public hospitals. The policies that I took to the 2016 federal election contained comprehensive responses to these issues. The university transformation project and the Launceston sewerage improvement plan provided important infrastructure funding and consequent much-needed employment. The  University of Tasmania project will see, as a consequence of the government's adoption of the UTAS proposal, $350 million invested in Northern Tasmania in relocation of the Newnham and Bernie campuses. Labor supported this project early and pressed the government every day of the 2016 election campaign to adopt it. Labor saw not just an infrastructure play but an opportunity to improve tertiary attainment within the state for the state's long-term social and economic benefit. Labor's commitment of $75 million to the Launceston sewerage improvement plan would see a vitally important infrastructure project start sooner rather than later. It is disappointing that both the state and federal governments have failed at this stage to recognise the importance of this project with respect to both environmental outcomes and in supporting employment. Whilst it is wonderful to see significant private and public investment in Launceston-in particular, Launceston City Council's North Bank project, Errol Stewart's Silo Hotel and CH Smith projects, and Josef Chromy's continuing positive influence in the city at Penny Royal and its immediate environs-these developments occur within metres of a contaminated water body, where sewerage spills and outflows should be addressed by the upgrading of the city's ageing sewerage infrastructure. Just last night, the House passed the government's Australian Education Amendment Bill 2017. This has enshrined the government's $22 billion in cuts to education over the next 10 years. Labor is committed to the full restoration of these cuts when it comes to government. Nevertheless, it is important to understand the difference between our position and the position of those opposite when it comes to fairly funding education. The 2013 federal election campaign was marked by the government's dishonest claim that there was not a dollar of difference between the Liberal opposition and the then government in funding for education. The 2014 federal budget, where $30 billion worth of cuts were delivered to education, gave the lie to that. What makes the government's position worse is that at that stage, and subsequently, it consistently argued that it was delivering increased funding and that what would deliver better education outcomes was not more money but better teaching and, remarkably, that Labor's commitment to Gonski was unfunded. Every school principal, every teacher and, indeed, every parent of a child denied funding in the 2014 budget needs to understand that the Liberals perpetuated a fraud on the Australian public by claiming that there was not a dollar's difference between the Liberals and Labor on education funding whilst claiming that years 5 and 6 of their Gonski funding plan-a plan that was incorporated into intergovernmental agreements-was unfunded. The fact of the matter is that Gonski 2.0 delivers increased funding from the low base adopted in the 2014 federal budget. This enables the present government to claim increases in funding. Put another way, what was a $30 billion cut to education is now merely a $22 billion cut. The Liberals demand credit for having introduced a less worse education package and now claim that what has been produced is needs based in accordance with the Gonski model. The original Gonski plan was needs based and sector blind. This meant that, in order to reach the schooling resource standard by 2018-19 and, in the case of Victoria, by 2020, available funding for individual schools was based upon disadvantage. Gonski 2.0 does nothing of the sort. Some schools will never reach the schooling resource standard goal set by the original Gonski plan. Despite what I have said about significant disadvantage within the Tasmanian system, the indexation proposed in the name of Gonski 2.0 is the second-lowest  level of indexation, after schools in the Northern Territory. What sort of system produces the lowest and second-lowest rate of indexation to the two most disadvantaged education systems in the nation? Schools within Tasmania will lose more than $84 million in the next two years. When it comes to supporting low-paid workers and those in receipt of penalty rates, the government is nowhere to be seen. It is content to see low-paid workers in receipt of penalty rates lose up to $77 dollars per week come 2 July, whilst handing a tax cut to high-paid individuals and businesses. It is still determined to deliver a tax cut to the big end of town; a tax cut that will cost $65 billion or more over 10 years. I understand that small business needs customers who have money in their pockets. A cut to penalty rates just for hospitality and retail workers would mean a loss of up to $12 million from the Bass economy. It is an unfair and unaffordable cut. In the time. I have served as the member for Bass, I have been able to gauge from contact to my office what are the most pressing issues within my electorate. There are two issues that I would like to speak about in the remaining time available to me. Labor introduced the National Broadband Network. The present government has done its best to destroy or hobble the NBN. We have the absurd situation that Bass has both the best and the worse to offer with respect to internet connectivity within Australia. As of 11 am today, 30 May, a local Launceston internet service provider, Launtel, is offering Australia's first commercial gigabit internet connections. Meanwhile, substantial parts of my electorate-Legana, in particulardo not enjoy broadband internet access due to difficulties with the implementation of fibre to the node or, where fibre to the node has been installed, difficulties with the copper connections used for the service. This situation arises due to a failure of policy, for which the present government, and indeed the Prime Minister, should be loudly condemned. The next area I would like to highlight is the government's absurd persecution of Centrelink recipients. The so-called 'robo-debt' program emphasises this government's incompetence and lack of respect for people who may be quite legitimately dealing with Centrelink. I have seen many occasions where the government's automated debt recovery program has produced injustice through no fault whatsoever of the Centrelink recipient. Indeed, I have become aware of circumstances where persons have received overpayments through administrative error and do not meet the supposed profile of a so-called rorter of the public purse. This person, who I will not identify, served in public life at a senior level. There could be no suggestion that this person had failed in their communication with the department, but they were overpaid. Indeed, my inquiries to the minister confirm that. What I have seen is that ordinary citizens do not receive the benefit of the doubt or reasonable assistance when it comes to receiving correspondence which has been automatically produced. Every person should have the right to receive respect in their dealings with government. The former Labor government used a data-matching program but with human oversight in order to ensure that absurd situations did not cause undue hardship for those who are in receipt of correspondence from the department seeking clarification as to eligibility to claim benefits. This government claims that, in repudiation of its previous ideology, it has embraced concepts of fairness and equity. Its actions speak otherwise. I would like to speak also about the issue of infrastructure commitment to Tasmania generally. The member for Braddon, in her address today, spoke about the fact that there was no additional funding for infrastructure within Tasmania other than that which had previously  been announced and provided for in the budget. I commend the government for its funding of the City Deals, particularly for the city of Launceston and within the electorate of Bass. That is a laudable commitment to transforming the city of Launceston through the university transformation project, but any further opportunity that the government has to invest in infrastructure in the state of Tasmania has been well and truly missed. There has been no additional commitment to road projects; there have been no commitments to providing further funding for rail; there is no additional commitment for other projects which might provide economic assistance to the state of Tasmania-a state, as I said previously, which is beset by disadvantage. This government needs to understand that we are in a federation. It is possible for the government to make strategic investments in the state of Tasmania.",159
197,Mr KEOGH,BILLS," Many in this place, and many Australians, are familiar with the beatitudes, some of which include, 'Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted,' 'Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled,' and, 'Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.' Then there is the hardly unique notion that we should treat each other as we ourselves wish to be treated. Bearing these in mind, I want to relate a reasonably famous parable. A man was trapped in his house during a flood. He began praying to God to rescue him. He had a vision in his head of God's hand reaching down from heaven and lifting him to safety. The water started to rise in his house. His neighbour urged him to leave and offered him a ride to safety. The man yelled back, ""I am waiting for God to save me."" The neighbour drove off in his pick-up truck. The man continued to pray and hold on to his vision. As the water began rising in his house, he had to climb up to the roof. A boat came by with some people heading for safe ground. They yelled at the man to grab a rope they were ready to throw and take him to safety. He told them that he was waiting for God to save him. They shook their heads and moved on. The man continued to pray, believing with all his heart that he would be saved by God. The flood waters continued to rise. A helicopter flew by and a voice came over a loudspeaker offering to lower a ladder and take him off the roof. The man waved the helicopter away, shouting back that he was waiting for God to save him. The helicopter left. The flooding water came over the roof and caught him up and swept him away. He drowned. When he reached heaven and asked, ""God, why did you not save me? I believed in you with all my heart. Why did you let me drown?"" God replied, ""I sent you a pick-up truck, a boat and a helicopter and you refused all of them. What else could I possibly do for you?"" This is where we come in, for it is my view that it is the role of us, as parliamentarians, and the role of government to provide support to those who need it, to look after our neighbour. It is in this light that I turn to a speech given by the Minister for Social Services at the National Press Club recently. In that speech he spoke about the proportion of those who are young carers, young parents and young students relying on support from our welfare system who will subsequently rely on welfare payments at some future point in their lives or, indeed, for the rest of their lives. The minister spoke about how the welfare system was a failure because it was not acting to stop these people from developing a welfare dependency. The fundamental problem with this approach is that it is confusing cause and effect. Indeed, as famously used by the great President Jed Bartlett in The West Wing, the minister has fallen into the fallacious logic of post hoc ergo procter hoc-after it, therefore because of it.  It is not the case that the welfare system is creating dependency on welfare by these and other groups but rather that there is a complete lack of investment in the social issues that these people confront, both the issues they confront when they are carers, young parents or students as well as those they may face later in life. The problem that this creates is much greater than merely the subsequent reliance on the welfare system. Chronic underinvestment in the social issues in society is costing our society in many ways. The really sad part about this is how obvious an approach it represents. We hear from those in health all the time about the idea that prevention is better than the cure, yet we continue to increase our spending, year after year, on law enforcement, policing, courts and imprisonment-the consequences of crime-not to mention the cost to the victim and society at large, but we do not come close to matching it in spending designed to prevent crime from occurring in the first place. We see the effects of this, in particular, when we look at those cohorts of Australians that face some of the greatest barriers and disadvantage, reliance on welfare and their interactions with the criminal justice system. In particular, we see it for Aboriginal Australians, who make up only three per cent of the national population and yet in 1991 made up 14 per cent of our nation's prison population, which by 2015 had increased to 27 per cent. Rates of incarceration for Indigenous Australians are 16 times higher than for non-Indigenous Australians; 48 per cent of the juvenile prison population are Aboriginal. ABS figures show that nearly three-quarters of Aboriginal prisoners had a prior adult imprisonment under sentence, compared with just under half of non-Aboriginal prisoners. The system clearly is not working. We cannot and should not sit idly by. But what are the causes of these disproportionate incarceration rates and the crime leading to them? While I am pleased to say that the government has referred an inquiry to the Australian Law Reform Commission to examine the factors leading to the overrepresentation of Indigenous Australians in prison, it is not the law that is the sole or, in many ways, even the predominant cause of crime and imprisonment, especially amongst Aboriginal Australians. The causes include stolen generations: those taken away from their families as a child at twice as likely to be arrested as their peers. They include differential treatment by law enforcement: Aboriginal people are 15 times more likely to be charged for swearing or offensive behaviour than the rest of the community. They include social and economic situation: poverty and unemployment, particularly for young Aboriginal people or in rural and remote areas, sometimes described as crimes of need, are the very things that saw the need to establish the Australian penal colonies in the first place. Then there is inadequate legal representation, a lack of language skills and foetal alcohol syndrome. The causes include health problems, which we see in life expectancy and in overall health being linked to prison and incarceration. There is family breakdown and violence. As Queensland barrister Cathy MCLennan has pointed out: You can do whatever you like … But if they're going home and getting bashed at night, if they're going home and they are starving, they're going to reoffend. That is the reality. There is lack of accommodation: the Children's Court is often being told that imprisonment is the only option because of no safe and stable accommodation being available. There is a lack of community services. According to The Medical Journal of Australia there is increasing evidence that many people in prison are there as a direct consequence of the shortfall in  appropriate community based health and social services, most notably in the areas of housing, mental health and well-being, substance use, disability and family violence. Then there is childhood trauma, where leading experts have observed how lasting and profoundly damaging the effects of trauma on children up to the age of three are, and that in some cases it will result in permanent brain damage connected to adolescent criminal offending. Not only are these issues related to causing crime but, of course, they also drive unemployment and welfare reliance. These are varied and multi-factored, complex issues. I have spoken separately this year about the issue of people requiring assistance with complex issues, and I incorporate those comments here. Essentially though, we need government agencies, state and federal, to work together across and between levels of government to ensure that people do not fall through the cracks and are given the dignity and assistance that they deserve. But the key point I wish to raise is one that is often raised in respect of the concept of making investments in preventing crime and complex social issues, crime prevention and legal assistance funding from the Commonwealth-the issues that arise from vertical fiscal imbalance. The reality is that while they keep having to fund police, courts and prisons it does not leave much else in state budgets or the capacity to fund well-directed programs targeted at social improvement and inclusion that would assist in reducing crime. But, wait! Why would the federal government spend money on social services and intervention when the savings will be realised by the states, as crime reduces, not having to spend as much on the outcomes of crime. It turns out that the Minister for Social Services might have been inadvertently onto something. Yes, if the Commonwealth properly invests in addressing the causes of crime, not only will you start to reduce the requirement of many having to rely on welfare, but they will also become employed earners paying income tax. There is even a name for this policy concept: justice reinvestment, or, as it is known by some, social reinvestment. While his logic is a bit flawed I am going to choose to believe that the minister's Try, Test and Learn Fund is essentially designed to support such a justice reinvestment approach. The irony of this, given the minister's track record as the WA state Attorney-General is notable, but I will save that for another day. The Closing the Gap strategy, introduced through COAG by the Rudd government, also goes a long way in promoting such an approach. However, despite the interrelationship between the areas addressed by that strategy, and its goals, and the over-representation of Aboriginal people in Australia's prisons there is a justice gap component to the strategy. No focus on dealing directly with the over-representation of Aboriginal Australians in our prisons, and yet not dealing with that issue prevents us from dealing with the other areas of focus for the strategy, as well. We have had the Senate inquiry, we have the evidence and we have the community support and yet all we hear from state governments are the typical law and order mantras, repeating tired slogans and policies that clearly are not working. If you want an old slogan how about this: instead of just being tough on crime, also be tough on the causes of crime, as Labor called for at the last election. I implore this government to work with all states, local governments and community organisations to bring about a true nationreaching, grass-roots-active justice reinvestment approach before we lose more people to recidivism, crime and intergenerational welfare dependency.  Mr ROB MITCHELL (MCEwen) (16:58): I rise today to try to get some answers out of this government. Why have our communities in MCEwen so clearly missed out in the Turnbull government's latest budget? MCEwen is one of the fastest-growing regions in the nation, yet the government has failed to commit a single cent to this developing region. They have ignored our health needs, they have ignored our family needs and they have ignored the housing crisis that is happening all around us. This is about as bad a budget as we have seen in the northern suburbs. The Liberal government has not delivered on roads, education, health or mobile phone blackspots. In fact, last week we learnt that Minister Nash had duped the Australian public with the round 3 of blackspots by converting it into pork-barrelling for coalition electorates. They are very good at doing a few things, like cutting much-needed money from family tax benefit part A, ripping apart school funding, half-heartedly addressing their Medicare catastrophe and desperately trying to save one job, the Prime Minister's. They are also, as we see, very good at giving tax cuts to millionaires. As I have said before, and I am not going to stop repeating it until it gets through to those opposite: there is nothing fair about making middleand working-class families pay more while multinationals and millionaires get a tax cut. While some may say that this budget was 'Labor lite', from where we sit it is nothing like a Labor budget. We do not put millionaires over pensions. We do not put multinationals over families. We actually look after people. We put people first. When we look past the shadow puppets, we are left wondering: where is the funding for the suburbs of the outer north and the towns north of Melbourne? As we know, the Liberals just will not stop attacking Medicare until they finally sink it. They are forcing Australians to pay more for visits to the GP, prescription medication, medical tests and scans, dental services and cancer treatments. What kind of government targets the well-being and health of ordinary people just to get a few dollars in the back pocket? Families throughout the electorate are left struggling to make ends meet with the government's Medicare disaster. The continued rebate freeze that the Abbott government put in place means that, while families are paying more and more for basic services, they are receiving less in return. At the beginning of the year I took the time to write to the minister for health and aged care to express my concern over the cuts and the policies that are making health care more expensive and less accessible for all of us. It is obvious that the minister did not listen, when we see the proposals for this budget leaving my constituents and all Australians wondering why our basic health services are now looking more and more like luxuries. Local families are crying out for affordable access to health care. Only last night, a constituent of mine posted on the local Facebook page: 'We need a bulk-billing centre in Mernda. This is a joke.' If it were not so serious, it would be a joke. The Liberal government fails to fully reverse the Medicare rebate freeze until 2020, which means that not only will our medical services be underfunded but the additional payments will now fall onto the patients. It is flat-out wrong. I cannot stand by and watch the government jeopardise the health of generations to come. For the average family in Mernda, it costs $65 for a standard consultation, with an out-of-pocket expense of $27.95. When you are struggling to pay the mortgage or buy the books for kids for school, 30 bucks will make you think twice about  going to the doctor. The standard consultation jumps to $75 on the weekend, so you had better hope your kids do not get crook on the weekend. Not fully lifting their Medicare rebate freeze means that services such as mental health plans and chronic disease assessments will stay frozen for the next three years. They are just a few of the services that the Liberal government refuse to reverse their freezes on. Australians accessed these services over 23 million times in the last financial year-23 million timesand the government think the answer is to just sit on their hands. Shouldn't the government be encouraging people to access these services, not just cutting $2.2 billion from Medicare? This government has zero credibility when it comes to the health budget. In my electorate, we have countless testimonies to the failure of the government's health budget. I was approached by a bulk-billing doctor in Seymour who raised concerns about the outdated and inefficient processing system for Medicare bulk-billing vouchers. Since November 2016, his practice has not had its bulk-billing vouchers processed, forcing him to redraw on his home loan to avoid financial trouble. The excuse that Medicare has given my constituent is, 'Oh, it's staff cuts.' Are we supposed to believe that staff cuts are a reasonable excuse for owing a doctor over $20,000? Whittlesea Family Medical Centre, in my home town, has been forced to start charging copayments to keep up with the rising costs. The practice manager was devastated, telling me that they try to provide a service for patients who cannot afford to go to the doctor, but now they will have fewer patients and there will be a greater strain on our local hospitals. Internationally, policies like these have led to short-term boosts to the budget line but no long-term savings, because of the much larger strain on the public hospital system, which is more expensive to run. The continued Abbott government Medicare freeze means that doctors like these will continue to pay more for their practices, their staff, their medical products and their utilities, while the amount paid for their time, for their services, remains the same. Not only is this government not helping Australians access affordable health care; it is actually not helping providers to stay afloat. That is why we need Labor, because Labor will always protect Medicare. Under a Labor government this freeze would have been removed in January this year, a policy that was welcomed with open arms by the AMA. But instead the Turnbull government has chosen to stand idly by and watch our health system follow the same grim path as that of the United States. I turn to schools. Not only can this government not guarantee health services for all Australians; its budget also tells Australians, 'If you want a good education, you've got to get yourself rich parents.' The Liberals are taking $22 billion from our classrooms over the next decade. They are hoping that maybe ruining our education system means that we will not be up to pick up on their bad maths. So I thought I would simplify it down to a level even Liberals can understand. Let's say you had 10 Cayman dollars. I found these Cayman Island dollars in the hallway. Some bloke probably dropped them. So you have them and then the government comes in and takes them all away. That is what happened in 2014 under the then prime ministership of Tony Abbott. Then they put two back",163
198,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," I remind the member for MCEwen that props are not allowed. As a deputy speaker, he should know that.  Mr ROB MITCHELL: That was when the member for Warringah was Prime Minister. Then they put two back. A bloke with a monocle and a top hat living in Point Piper singing about Cristal and truffles for everyone said, 'Look, you've got more funding than ever.' But the reality is-and I hope those opposite learn this-this bit is still missing. The government have taken money from education. They have never put any back. As a result, students and education are worse off.  Mr ROB MITCHELL: Obviously we can dumb it down, but the member for Barker has arrived and even I cannot dumb it down that far. In my electorate, each and every year Wallan secondary school is set to lose around $700,000, Gisborne secondary school is set to lose around $800,000 every year and Sunbury College will lose around $800,000 as well. Ask the principal at each of these schools what it means. It means fewer teachers, higher class numbers and less individual attention to every student. My electorate has over 53 government schools, and each and every one of them is set to be the biggest loser under the Turnbull government's budget. Apparently the government expects us to believe that the cuts are needs based and means tested. It is just not true. Last Friday I sat down with the leadership of St Patrick's in Kilmore. They, like government schools, are devastated by the impact that the government is having on Catholic schools. It is ridiculous. These schools are shaping the future doctors, lawyers, builders, nurses, farmers and even politicians. They are developing our nation's leaders through STEM. Schools such as Whittlesea Secondary College are the frontline of technical training. How do we expect students to learn and grow in an environment where teachers are not even sure if their own jobs are safe and where schools do not know which programs they will have to cut next year because there is no stability in their budget? Last week I attended an education seminar alongside dedicated teachers and principals of schools around Australia. One school in particular has stuck with me, and I hope it will help the Turnbull government realise its funding of schools is about lives, not just learning. The principal told us that for years their all-girls school has been running an integral mental health program to help students cope with anxiety, depression, eating disorders and the stress and pressures that they experience during schooling. She told us that the cuts put forward by the Liberal government mean they will no longer be able to run this program. She teared up as she told us this and explained that they have lost students in the past, and this program has helped them detect mental ill-health earlier and give students the support they need. How do those opposite to sleep at night knowing that their government is jeopardising revolutionary programs throughout Australia that are changing lives? How does the Liberal government not understand that schools are nonnegotiable? Funding cannot just come and go at the whim of the Prime Minister. All Australian students deserve access to the best education. Another thing that has been completely ignored nonstop by this government is housing affordability. What does it matter if your family misses out on a tax benefit when under the Liberal government they will probably never afford a house either, right? That is wrong. Home ownership is the lowest it has been in 60 years. The rate of home ownership for 25to 34-year-olds is collapsing. Under this government it is now below 40 per cent. It is a disgrace the government will not commit to tackling skyrocketing house prices throughout my  electorate and across the country. Since the Liberals came to government, house prices have risen 30 per cent throughout Australia, and they are still going up. They are going up alongside the rising unemployment rates, the rising debt and the rising mortgage stress. The Liberals had a chance to reform negative gearing and capital gains, and they had a chance to fix the housing problem, but they lacked moral courage. They did nothing, and now it is the rest of us who are left to pay. In my community, the mortgage belts like Mernda, Beveridge, Donnybrook, Doreen and Craigieburn are left wondering: what is this government actually about? What they have delivered is a grab bag of poorly planned measures and hasty reactions, instead of careful plans that will address key drivers of housing, like winding back negative gearing and capital gains tax discounts. Once again, the government fails the fairness test. The plan announced in this budget is not a solution. It is a false hope for people who do not have rich parents. We are not supporting this cruel hoax, but we will deliver on our plan for affordable housing by driving construction of some 55,000 new homes over three years and creating 25,000 jobs every year. While the Liberal government has been content in tearing apart services to find every last hidden cent behind every corner, on this side of the House we are fighting for what actually is fair. We are fighting for a healthcare system that does not require a platinum credit card. We are fighting for a schooling system that does not discriminate based on where you were born or who your parents were. We are fighting for a tax system that does not rob from the poor and give to the rich like some sort of reverse Robin Hood. We are fighting for affordable housing for thousands of Australians who work day in and day out to save in hopes of getting out of the exorbitant rental market. On this side of the House, we are committed to this fight. We are not going to stop the battle against this budget. This not a fair budget. This is a budget that forgets about the people of my electorate of MCEwen, just as this government has done. In three terms, we have not seen the Liberal Party or this government commit to any major infrastructure funding in the fastest growing areas of Australia-not one cent. As I said earlier, we have seen Minister Nash come out and admit that round 3 of the Mobile Black Spot Program became nothing more than a pork-barrelling exercise, and they actually washed away all of the government's own criteria. The government is desperate for one job to be hung onto, and that is the job of the member for Wentworth. He has failed and he has been a fizzer, and there is absolutely nothing in this budget that will turn that around. When a government comes into this place on budget night and announces it is going to give the Prime Minister an $8,000 tax cut while making a family on $65,000 a year $400 worse off, you have to sit there and ask, 'What's fair about that?' There is nothing fair about it. If the government was half-serious or had any credibility or moral courage, it would have left the deficit levy for high-income earners. It would not have given millionaires tax cuts at the expense of pensioners. But this is a government that is by millionaires, for millionaires and only cares about millionaires. It never has and never will care about pensioners or people who are struggling to make ends meet. It is time they got out of the way, and it is time that we got a Labor government that puts people first.",167
199,Mr GILES,BILLS," The problems this budget is attempting to solve are those of this government, not those facing Australians and, in particular, not those which are of most concern to constituents in the Scullin electorate. It presents the wrong answers because the  government has been asking the wrong questions for the wrong reasons. It is fundamentally concerned with the political survival of the Prime Minister and his hapless Treasurer, not the challenges facing our nation. This budget, like this government, is all about tactics-tactics in place of vision, a vision of a government, a vision for our nation and particularly an inclusive vision for Australia and for Australians. Indeed, what this budget demonstrates is pretty much the reverse. It is a recipe to deepen inequality and also to constrain economic growth and, with it, all of our futures. It is a very crude exercise in trickle-down economics. Indeed, it is cruder than that proposed elsewhere. Extraordinarily, the centrepiece of this budget is not housing affordability, as it was supposed to be, but a $65 billion giveaway to large corporations. It is cruder than similar trickle-down exercises elsewhere, including that proposed by President Trump, because here there is no trade-off; it is a straight giveaway, a straight transfer of wealth. This kind of exercise is not a novel experiment. As we debate this budget, as we pick apart the threadbare agenda of this government, we see the evidence of what this sort of policy agenda means. We can look to the US and the impact of their company tax cuts on American society and, indeed, on the American economy. It is a vision of the future which Australians should and will reject. We also have before us our present circumstances. On this side of the House we are deeply concerned that inequality in Australia is at a 75-year high. Today we face circumstances where company profits are at record highs but we have very low rates of investment and, of course, stagnant wages growth, the lowest on record. I asked myself, as do all my Labor colleagues: how can large company tax cuts be an answer to any of these problems? While the government's cheerleaders and boosters in the Business Council of Australia say there is no plan B, this is the only way ahead, on this side of the House we join with pretty much everyone who has thought about these questions in the international community-bodies like the IMF and research bodies like the OECD-and we do not merely reject the notion that there is no alternative way forward but we set one out. I was so proud to be in the House for the budget reply speech of the Leader of the Opposition. It was a strong reply to a weak budget, building on strong foundations-a body of policy work that we started back in 2013, founded on a very different vision for our future, a vision of inclusive growth, a real fairness agenda rather than the fakery of members opposite. The Prime Minister, as he works his way through the process of this budget, is a diminished figure. He has come a long way from the optimism of that courtyard where he launched his leadership bid and promised a sophisticated economic narrative. All of that has disappeared. Cities are an afterthought, really a way of wrapping around some local infrastructure commitments and all about marginal seats. Innovation seems to have been entirely forgotten. He is operating a one-size-fits-all antidote to Australia's problemsalthough, of course, it is an antidote not to Australia's problems but the problems that bedevil his government. I ask, as I make my contribution to this debate alongside my Labor colleagues the member for MCEwen, the member for Braddon and the member for Richmond: isn't the silence on the other side of the chamber extraordinary? The government members do not want to talk about this budget; they do not want to talk about these bills. I think there are some very good reasons why they do not. They understand, as we do, that this budget has already been rejected by the Australian people; that it offers nothing more than a recipe to  deepen inequality and no pathway to sustainable and strong economic growth that can be shared by all Australians, our children and our grandchildren. When we look at the budget we see that perhaps another challenge preventing government members from rising to their feet to debate it is its incoherence. It oddly combines ideological surrender on the surface, with the government walking away from many of the most egregious aspects of the 2014 budget. I think about question time and the way the Prime Minister clings on to those words 'needs based' when it comes to schools-and I will return to that. He does not mean it of course, but he understands he has to mouth the words because the Liberals and their coalition partners have been unable to persuade Australians that their raceto-the-bottom agenda is acceptable. They seek to cloak it, to disguise it, in the language of fairness. We heard 'fairness' a lot on budget night. I actually had a sense of deja vu because of course they tried this repositioning a couple of years ago, as the member for Richmond will well remember. How did that work out? Not terribly well, because they did not have any conviction in mouthing these words. We see this most obviously in how they really think about those measures from the 2014 horror budget. No less a figure than Senator Cormann, the Minister for Finance, has admitted that this is not a position he is committed to. It is again a tactical withdrawal, no more, in a budget that is all about strategy and tactics but absent any strategic direction for the Australian economy, much less Australian society. I think we should remember that very important elements of the 2014 budget still remain, such as keeping the pension age at 70, which, as we on this side of the House all know, is the highest in the developed world. This is alongside deep cuts to family payments. Notwithstanding some sleight of hand around the edges, there is a very cruel cut to pensioners, through the abolition of the energy supplement. As a whole these bills remain both incoherent and still deeply unfair. The most well-off in Australia, be they wealthy individuals or shareholders in major corporations, will receive significant tax relief while those on ordinary incomes are being required to pay more today whilst their prospects are being constrained-constrained in terms of the continued cuts in health, despite rhetorical positions to the contrary, and in particular in terms of this budget's vision for schooling, skills and higher education. I ask myself: what is the point of this budget and, indeed, its authors: the Prime Minister and the Treasurer? The journey to budget day is instructive in this regard, because this budget was going to be all about housing affordability. That was to be the centrepiece, but it ended up little more than an afterthought, and perhaps that is a generous description. This is extraordinary at two levels for those of us on this side of the House and for those of us who talk to young Australians who are interested in purchasing their first home, not investors looking at six, seven, eight, nine or 10. There is a plan on the table-the plan that the shadow Treasurer and the Leader of the Opposition put forward to make significant changes to capital gains tax and negative gearing-to boost the bottom line, to allow young Australian families into the housing market and to do something about this awful trend to greater wealth inequality. There is a solution there. It is free of charge to the government to take it up, yet they spurn it, despite the evidence and the soundness of the case. Beyond this it is critical to examine the budget's foundations because they are extraordinarily weak. We know wages growth is at a record low in Australia, but apparently,  if one is to have regard to the budget papers, there is a miracle cure somewhere around the corner. This budget contains the most heroic assumptions about wages growth-not out of any sense of what is going to happen in the world of work but rather to support equally heroic revenue forecasts to disguise the fundamental structural weaknesses of this budget. Today's Australian Financial Review really tells it as it is. In an article entitled 'Slugging households ""no budget fix""' it says: A budget crisis looms because the Turnbull government is asking ordinary households and workers to do the heavy lifting of budget repair by paying higher income taxes as company taxes and wages sag, top budget experts say. The 2017 budget is built on heroic assumptions about company taxes and wages growth returning to pre-global financial crisis levels, and the burden will instead fall on wage and salary earners who will have to pay higher effective income tax rates … to close the gap. It is no foundation at all. I will say very briefly on tax that of course we are not opposed to the bank levy, the centrepiece on the real revenue side, but, as the shadow Treasurer and other Labor members demonstrated in question time, this is not a policy that has been developed with any thought. It is policy making on the run. This is not the way a government should go about its business. There are many aspects of the budget that I would like to discuss in detail, but time means I will be able to only pass over them. I would like to talk very briefly about infrastructure. What we have seen in infrastructure under the member for Warringah and now the member for Wentworth is almost a strike, and that is particularly in terms of my home state of Victoria and my city of Melbourne, which contains Australia's fastest growing suburb in my electorate of Scullin. Victoria has 25 per cent of Australia's population yet has less than 10 per cent of the infrastructure spending, despite extraordinary growth and despite emerging evidence that congestion is one of the greatest drags on the Australian economy. This failure to support urban infrastructure, particularly public transport, is coming at a huge economic cost and also a huge cost to the lives of too many of my constituents. I would like to talk more about schools, my own portfolio area, but let me just say this: a $22 billion cut to school education will not lead to a nation that is agile or innovative. It will not. The rhetorical position of the government is simply extraordinary. They are wrapping themselves up in words that actually convey the opposite meaning to that which is suggested. When they talk about needs based funding and when they talk about being sector blind, they mean the reverse. At the heart of the government's schools-funding package is a retreat by the government from any national responsibility for school education. It will hit schools in Tasmania, in the Northern Territory and in South Australia the hardest. It will hit regional communities the hardest. It will hit remote communities the hardest. It is a betrayal of a vision of school education as a driver of equity and excellence in Australia. For these reasons, I am so proud to have rejected these measures in the House with all of my Labor colleagues. Similarly, in higher education, we see a cut of nearly $4 billion alongside increases in fees and-I think most shockingly of all-a decrease in the repayment threshold to a level that will discourage people from disadvantaged backgrounds from participating in higher education. Similarly, in skills, could the contrast between Labor's vision of investing in TAFE and supporting apprenticeships and the failures of this government be any more stark?  The member for MCEwen dealt very effectively with health, but let me just say this: what a cruel hoax the supposed end to the rebate freeze is. What a betrayal of all of our communities from this government! Fifty-one percent of Australians are women, but extraordinary revelations in Senate estimates this week have shown that Treasury did not model any impact of this budget on women. In Labor, through the member for Newcastle and many of my colleagues, we have focused on a women's budget for some time. It is an extraordinary omission, and one that this government stands condemned for-that it is not concerned about the impact of this government on women-particularly in the light of other evidence showing that many women under the measures here will be paying effective tax rates at quite extraordinary and punitive levels. I should touch on overseas aid. Under this government, in this budget, we see the weakest levels in Australian history: 23c out of every $100 in national income. The cruellest cuts in this budget go to those who are unable to speak to it in this place. On climate change, you have to look very hard at the budget to find a mention-in fact, it is not even there. What a cruel betrayal of future generations. It is one that must be rectified when the Finkel review is before us. In conclusion, obviously I do not oppose these appropriations. I want the business of government to continue. But I want government members to get real. I want them to account for themselves and to account to their electorates for this budget. I want them to make clear why it is, how it can be, that they can support this recipe for more unfairness, to deepen inequality, to constrain economic growth and to deny young Australians a foothold into housing, education and decent lives. Mrs ELLIOT (Richmond) (17:28): I too rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 20172018, Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2017-2018 and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2017-2018. Like those on this side of the House, I intend raising a lot of the concerns that I and my constituents have about the unfairness in many of the measures that are contained within this budget. It seems that, year after year, we have yet another unfair budget that particularly impacts people in regional and rural areas. This budget is indeed unfair because it delivers tax handouts for multinationals and millionaires whilst hurting families, especially in regional areas like mine, in the electorate of Richmond, on the North Coast of New South Wales. Budgets are all about choices, but this government's choices are all wrong. Before I list some of the details that concern me about the budget, I will talk about the fact that one of the harshest choices is the lack of funding to assist northern New South Wales recover from the devastating recent floods. Those floods were a devastating and heart breaking event felt by the people in our region and that are still very pertinent in our concerns. Make no mistake, the flooding associated with Cyclone Debbie has been far reaching, with many homes wrecked and businesses destroyed. It will be a very long road to rebuild and repair. Of course, the tragedy of lives lost due to the flooding is extremely sad. Again, I would like to express my condolences to all those families and communities that lost loved ones in the floods. The massive weather event caused by Cyclone Debbie spread south from Queensland and caused the largest flood that we have ever seen. The swiftness and strength of the rain was overwhelming for us. The record rainfall resulted in thousands of residents having to be  evacuated from flood affected areas. I again strongly commend our outstanding police and emergency service workers, our SES volunteers and our council staff for their work and commitment throughout that challenging time. I would like also to commend our community again for coming together and assisting one another. Whilst locals welcomed the very early decision to appoint a disaster recovery coordinator, we have rightly been very critical of both the New South Wales government and the federal government for their lack of substantial funding and commitment to repair and rebuild our region. In fact, our community had to protest and campaign locally to force the state government to commit to category C funding, particularly for business assistance. Many smaller villages, like Uki, are still waiting for this. In some areas, such as the Byron shire, they are still waiting for some disaster relief payments. It has certainly been a very long time since the floods and we will keep pressing the state and federal governments to ensure that funding is there as well as to obtain more needed funding. I would like particularly to thank both the federal opposition leader, Bill Shorten, and the New South Wales opposition leader, Luke Foley, for visiting Murwillumbah and Lismore and meeting first hand and listening to residents, business and council representatives and SES volunteers and community groups. Both of them, individually, held very extensive roundtables with all of those community representatives, and I thank them for that. I know that New South Wales Labor subsequently released an 11-point plan to address many of the urgent issues that were raised at these meetings. To date, the New South Wales state government has failed to lend support to the plan, let alone adopt it, despite the offer of bipartisan support from Labor. I again call on it to do that. I would like to thank the New South Wales opposition leader for returning to the North Coast the week before last. Again he met with locals in Tumbulgum, Murwillumbah and Lismore, continuing to hear their concerns. He renewed his call to the state government to waive payroll tax for flood affected businesses and to set up two separate funds: a local government infrastructure fund and a business assistance fund. Recently, Tweed Shire Council passed a resolution calling on the New South Wales Premier to waive payroll tax for the next 12 months for all flood affected businesses on the New South Wales North Coast. I would like to thank the council for its continued advocacy for our community. I particularly acknowledge the outstanding work of Tweed shire mayor, Katie Milne, and our deputy mayor, Chris Cherry. I also acknowledge all of the hard working Tweed councillors. I especially acknowledge the Tweed council general manager, Troy Green, and thank him for his leadership and resolve in such challenging times for our region. Whilst we have a very strong community, we need governments that support us. I acknowledge that both the Prime Minister and the New South Wales Premier visited Murwillumbah very briefly soon after the event, but I call on them to come back for a substantial period of time, to sit down with our community and business leaders and hear their stories first hand, hear about the action that is needed to help us recover and rebuild, and to deliver substantial funding to help us do that. I note also that the Murwillumbah District Business Chamber has recently written to the New South Wales Premier, requesting that she visit Murwillumbah for a round-table meeting with business and community representatives to update her on the continuing dire situation that we face, many weeks after the flood. The chamber has said that it is happy to meet with  the Premier at any time it suits her, but it does want the meeting to take place soon, due to the struggle that Murwillumbah as a town continues to face. Last Saturday's Tweed Daily News, one of our local papers, ran a story about the Premier being invited to meet with the chamber. The story reports that the Premier is refusing to come and meet with the chamber but is, instead, sending a representative. That is insulting to our community, to the business chamber and to the rest of the community. In that article, the acting vice-president of the chamber said: Our chamber board has been actively keeping in touch with many flood-affected business owners and we are desperately worried about many of them due to the lack of suitable financial assistance available and the inconsistencies and barriers that exist to access funding and other financial support. The ability of our businesses to recover is integral to the long-term recovery of our town as a whole. The business chamber wrote to the premier asking her to come up, at any time that suited her, to sit with them and meet with them and talk about what they desperately need to rebuild and recover. The premier has refused to do that. She is sending a representative and quite frankly this is an absolute insult to our region. So I call on the New South Wales premier to listen to our community and commit to this meeting yourself. Quite frankly, New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian's response so far has been disappointing and, I believe, disgraceful-the fact that she is not herself coming up to meet with our community. I intend to keep calling on her to come and meet with them. We also need to see comprehensive, long term plans to address the mass destruction caused by the floods. We need much greater funds flowing to affected families, businesses and communities and indeed to our local governments, which have also suffered devastating losses. We also desperately need more funding to address chronic homelessness issues. We had quite a large rally in Murwillumbah recently to highlight the issue of homelessness in our region, particularly since the floods, but also the general issues relating to accessing affordable housing. As I have said before to the House in relation to the flooding caused by Cyclone Debbie, we need our governments to help us, and our need for that help is absolutely desperate. That is one of the issues that I was concerned about that was not highlighted or addressed in this budget at all. Since this unfair budget was announced, we have seen this incompetent government move from disaster to disaster. Whether it is cuts to the education funding or cuts to Medicare, they are truly incompetent and unfair. The Australian public do know this. This is also a budget that completely fails the economic credibility test. Remember, this is a government that promised to fix the budget. They had lots of talk about jobs and growth. Well, it does in fact fail the economic credibility test, because gross debt will now pass half a trillion dollars in the coming months, growth is down, employment is down, and wages growth is down. The budget also fails the jobs test, because unemployment is up. Also, the deficit is 10 times bigger for the coming year. This is an unfair budget because it delivers tax handouts for multinationals and millionaires, whilst hurting everyday Australian families. The only people who will see better days in this budget are the very well off or big business. That is a fact. For example, as a result of the budget, someone earning $1 million will pay over $16,000 less tax this year, while someone on $65,000 will pay $300 more tax in two years' time. That is incredibly unfair. In the budget the government chose to continue with its tax handouts to big business,  whilst increasing taxes the workers but does nothing meaningful to tackle a huge issue across our communities, which is the housing affordability crisis. Compared with our initiatives, such as action on negative gearing and capital gains tax, we are seeing absolutely nothing from the government. And, of course, they harshly cut $22 billion from Australian schools and also extended their cuts to universities. We know that last night in this House all those Liberal and National party members voted six times to cut that $22 billion from our schools. I can tell you that in regional and rural areas this will be particularly harsh and will hurt those communities. Also, this government is increasing taxes in the budget. As the real wages of ordinary workers go backwards, the government wants to slug low and middle income earners with new taxes. That is all that they are doing. We see the government running around trying to sell this budget by framing it around fairness. But it really is quite a contradiction with this government. How can it be fair when there is a $22 billion cut to schools, tax hikes for battlers, tax cuts for the top end of town, and their refusal to level the playing field for first home buyers. There is nothing fair at all in any of that, and people have seen through it. Indeed, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer said this budget was about choices. Well, they made their choices and they have chosen big business over middle and working class families. They claim to be about lower taxes and smaller government, but the coalition has propped up its budget with $21 billion in new taxes. One of the harshest measures is the government's $22 billion cuts from our schools, which is the equivalent of cutting $2.4 million from every school in the country over the next decade, or like sacking 22,000 teachers. In my electorate every school will be worse off under this government's cuts. The school cuts mean $14 million in cuts in 2018-19 to my local public schools and, of course, massive cuts to our Catholic schools. This will be devastating for rural and regional areas, like mine. In contrast to all of this, Labor will properly fund our schools, because we believe that every child in every classroom deserves every opportunity. We want better schools, better results and better support for our great teachers. Whilst the Prime Minister is cutting that $22 billion from schools, on the other hand, of course, he is giving a very big tax cut to big business of over $65 billion. So that is where this government's priorities lie, and it is only Labor that understands the importance of proper funding and needs based funding to ensure the future and full potential of all of our students right throughout the country. We have announced that we will commit to an extra $22 billion in funding for our schools and properly funding our schools and will continue to oppose this government's cruel cuts to our schools. Again, I highlight that last night in parliament we saw those members vote six times to cut that $22 billion from our schools. It is a disgrace, and our schoolchildren deserve so much better. We are also seeing this government ripping $3.8 billion from universities and making Australians pay more for a degree, so we will also oppose the unfair cuts to universities and their funding and the increase in student fees. Also, we will be opposing the change to the repayment threshold that really does impact on women, Indigenous Australians and lowincome earners the hardest. Again, talking about cuts to universities, and, indeed, any cuts to education generally, it is those people in regional and rural Australia who are impacted on the most. It is very difficult for our younger people to access training. We have also seen some massive cuts from this government to apprenticeships and TAFE. Indeed, at a state level as  well we are seeing the state Liberal-National government shut many TAFEs in our region. So they are making it harder for younger people to get training of all sorts, but when we look at the cuts to university funding that particularly impacts on people from regional areas. The budget also fails the test when it comes to health care, and it fails the Medicare test. The government have delayed reversing their unfair cuts to Medicare for three years, and that is because we know they are committed to destroying Medicare. We have seen that time and time again. In fact, yesterday we saw their secret task force to attack public hospitals. Indeed, we see that public hospital funding will be cut and the private health insurance rebate abolished under reported plans being progressed by a secret Turnbull government hospitals task force. It really is proof that they have not given up attacking Medicare. They are just expanding their attack to another target. They will try, in every way they can, to undermine Medicare, the universality of our healthcare system and bulk-billing initiatives. They will constantly try to do this. We will always be here fighting them and fighting against that. In this budget speech, we heard so many times the Treasurer talking about 'better days ahead'. Where are they? I can tell you that they are not in regional and rural areas like mine, the North Coast of New South Wales. The fact is that budgets are about choices, as I said, and the Prime Minister has made his choices. The Prime Minister and the Liberal-National government have made their choices. They chose big business over middleand working class families, they have chosen multinationals over Medicare and they have chosen big business over battlers. So it is about choices, and it is important to note that a Shorten Labor government will make different choices. We will make choices that put people first and create more jobs for Australians and choices where we properly invest in our schools, such as investing that $22 billion. We would also save Medicare from this government's very, very cruel cuts. We understand how important it is to have all those initiatives in place, and it will be particularly important for those people in regional and rural Australia, who will be very, very harshly impacted on by these cuts. I finish by saying the unfairness is harshly felt in regional and rural areas, particularly because of the education cuts but also the fact that this government is giving massive handouts to multimillionaires and big business but nothing for those everyday working people in the country. Those people are the ones who have told me that they know this government is not concerned about them. As I have said before, in regional and rural Australia, Labor has your back. We are always fighting for those people in the country to make sure they can have access to decent healthcare systems, education systems and infrastructure funding. We are the party of the country, the bush and regional and rural Australia. The Liberal-National Party is just the party of multinationals and big business. It is only Labor that stands up and fights for the country.",169
200,Ms ROWLAND,BILLS," My friend the member for Richmond took the words out of my mouth when she said, 'This is a budget that does nothing for middleand working-class Australia.' I think that that is evidenced by the fact that, in my electorate of Greenway-and I have checked with my staff, I have checked through my emails and I have checked through my correspondence-I have barely heard a whimper from my constituents about this budget. I am very amused to hear that the Prime Minister is reportedly talking to the party room about the need to go out and sell this budget. I would like to know, firstly, who they are trying to sell it to.  ",177
201,Ms ROWLAND,BILLS,"My friend from Barker interjected and said, 'It sells itself.' No-one is buying, buddy! The only feedback that I have had on this budget is outrage from my local community about the cuts to schools and the fact that this is a budget that completely ignores the needs of middleand working-class Australia. I will touch on two things. The first is a local piece of expenditure generally, and it enables me to talk about a very important group and an important project that is being conducted in my local area. The other focus I will have is on the portfolio of communications, which, again, simply registered a nothing in terms of the impact on the portfolio and the complete lack of focus, lack of vision and, quite frankly, lack of competence by the relevant minister when it comes to doing his job. To start off, I was very impressed when sometime last year I met with a local group called Skate Park for Riverstone. This group was brought together thanks to a number of individuals including Sonia Grima. These people have been advocating for a very long time to have some sort of youth facility in the Riverstone area and specifically a skate park facility. Riverstone, as many people might know, is an area of north-west Sydney undergoing tremendous change. It was once semirural and is now regarded as outer urban. When you drive down the streets of Riverstone now, from one week to the next it is a mass of new housing development. With that comes new families, changing demographics and new challenges. So I was extremely pleased to be able to support the campaign being undertaken by Sonia Grima and her fellow Skate Park for Riverstone members. Many of them, of course, are children and young people. They were brought together following the death of a 14-year-old skateboarder named Michael Hannon near Campbelltown in January. It brought home to them the need to have safe operating facilities for teenagers. He, unfortunately, died after a collision with a car. Sonia Grima took it upon herself to form this group and to lead the charge for a local skate park in Riverstone. It was very pleasing to see that Minister Fiona Nash has said that she is prepared and is working towards delivering a $400,000 grant to enable this to go ahead. Recently, Blacktown City Council was told by the minister: I recommend that you do not enter into financial commitments or begin any construction work on the project until such time as a Deed of Agreement has been signed with the Australian Government. Blacktown council submitted these application documents in December last year. Understandably, I have been receiving a number of requests, from people who are interested in and supportive of the Skate Park for Riverstone project, to follow this up. I have written most recently to Minister Nash this month seeking an update. I look forward to this being delivered. Of course, Blacktown council is the sponsoring entity for this project. The mayor, Stephen Bali, is very supportive of this. I genuinely hope that it will be delivered very soonthat we can finalise these funding arrangements and that we can actually get on with the job of delivering, as a community, for young people in the Riverstone area. I pay tribute to Sonia Grima and her team. I want to assure them that I am doing everything possible as their local member to ensure that this gets delivered, and I am very prepared to work with the federal government, and of course Blacktown council, to make that happen.  I move on to issues of the communications portfolio. Again, as I said, this exposes the utter incompetence of this minister and this government, including decisions made by the now Prime Minister when he was the Minister for Communications, decisions he made which are now coming home to roost, wrong decisions made in terms of technology choice and false assumptions made on the basis of finances-simply getting it wrong every step of the way. I note that in a speech to CommsDay in April this year Minister Fifield declared 2017 to be the year of the customer. Well, what does it say when, in debates in the parliament towards the end of last year on the issue of the NBN and on the issue of the long-term interests of end users, barely a member on the government benches could summon an understanding of the poor consumer experience that is currently going on in relation to this failed network-this multitechnology mix which is delivering nothing but stuff-up after stuff-up for consumers? You do not need to take it from me, because the facts are these. TIO complaints about NBN faults soared by almost 150 per cent over the 2015-16 period and complaints about specifically slow speeds increased by nearly 50 per cent. Seven of the top 10 postcodes for TIO complaints about the NBN during this period were for areas-what a surprise!-served by fibre to the node. So the Prime Minister's choice of technology, copper, of which he has purchased 15 million metres on his watch is delivering-surprise, surprise!-such a high level of complaints that have never been seen before. The TIO has subsequently advised the Joint Standing Committee on the National Broadband Network that the total complaints in the telco sector are projected to reach 150,000 for the 2016-17 period. If this projection materialises, it will reverse years of progress that the sector has made towards a focus on consumers and reducing complaints. In December 2016, just a few days before Christmas, it is notable that the government stripped information from the NBN website about what technology households and small businesses would be connected with. The reason offered for this was that consumers, apparently, do not care about what technology they are going to get. After being called out on this underhanded act, the NBN website was updated within a few weeks and the technology information became available. It is notable that this government, which on its watch failed consumers, has suddenly discovered consumers now because of, I suggest-and I am quite sure I am not wrong, and I am sure the member for Longman would support me on thiscomplaints to our offices about the poor quality of this government's broadband. For me, it is the No. 1 unsolicited complaint that I receive as a local member. It is interesting that the ACCC gave evidence to the NBN joint standing committee that it first proposed a four-year broadband monitoring and reporting program. So this was the government's solution-it would have a broadband monitoring program. Bearing in mind that we are at the end of May 2017, the ACCC first proposed a four-year broadband monitoring and reporting program in the week commencing the 15 February 2016. So it was over a year ago. What has the minister been doing? It has gone into the Fifield triangle-this void into which every important decision is simply sucked and then spat out in the most underhanded way. Why has it taken 15 months to get this speed-monitoring trial underway? Why weren't consumers the top priority for this government until, all of a sudden, it discovered it had a problem? Further, the $7 million in funding allocated for the speed-monitoring program over the forward estimates is not from government. It is not funding from government at all. It is the  telco sector that has been made to pay for it. Of course, it is not going to pass that cost on to consumers, is it? If the government itself never had any intention of funding this monitoring program from consolidated revenue, why did it take so long to get up and running? I will end on this point on this topic of consumers. On 7 April 2017-so only recently-the ACCC issued a media statement in response to the government's announcement that it will 'fund' the speed-monitoring scheme. The release stated: After appointing a qualified testing provider, the ACCC will commence the program in May 2017 … There is not long to go until May 2017 and-what a surprise!-the ACCC only just issued its tender documents this very afternoon, not meeting the deadline. I do not blame the regulator. It can only take so much direction. I blame this minister. I blame this hapless minister and his predecessor for putting us in a position where consumers are treated as though they are at the bottom of the food chain. Turning to other issues in the communications portfolio, I want to talk about spectrum reform. Despite all the rhetoric that this government espouses about the importance of communications in today's digitally networked economy, there is nothing in the budget to demonstrate that this government has any vision whatsoever for the media and comms sector or that it is prepared to put its money where its mouth is to support Australia's successful transition to a digitally networked, knowledge economy of the 21st century. Spectrum, as I said, is a case in point. When he was communications minister, the now Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull, kicked off the spectrum review on 23 May 2014-that is, more than three years ago. We have been waiting a long time for the spectrum review. The Spectrum review report included an implementation time frame which stated that the consolidated legislative reform package would be released in September 2015 to enable the passage of the legislation by early to mid-2016. That has come and gone. The original timetable would have seen the new legislation passed a year ago and here we are, almost at mid-2017, and not only has the legislation not been passed but the exposure draft has only just been released for initial consultation on what will be a two-step process before the legislation is introduced to the parliament later this year. When asked at estimates earlier this year as to whether he was concerned about the government's delay in progressing spectrum reform, the communications minister passed the buck, saying the delay was on account of the industry wanting consultation. Blame the sector because that always works! Apparently, it has nothing to do with the minister's lack of policy vision and nothing to do with the resourcing of public sector agencies tasked with implementing the recommendations of the Spectrum review report. Despite this being a generational opportunity and despite the fact that spectrum reform is worth so much to the economy and the fact that the review process has been subject so far to so much delay, what is in this budget for additional allocation for spectrum review implementation? What has the ACMA been allocated to prepare for spectrum review implementation in this budget? In a round figure, nothing-absolutely nothing; zero. The 2017-18 budget makes no provision for preparatory work to be undertaken by the ACMA to inform the draft bill. It is extremely concerning. Normally, spectrum review and spectrum management and implementation has a bipartisan approach because we need to make sure that it is aligned with international standards, and we know how much value that this scarce resource has for the economy. It is deeply concerning that the regulator is expected to prepare  for this generational change on the smell of an oily rag. With $177 billion in value to the economy over 15 years at stake, one would think it an opportune time to grant funding to the regulator to ensure the best practice research and design work is undertaken to inform the draft bill and ensure swift progress upon passage of the bill in transitioning to the new framework. I want to end on a brighter note, and that is that the government provided $8.8 million to the SBS in the budget this year. I am very pleased to say that because it vindicates Labor's long standing campaign, driven by this government, against the coalition's broken 2014 election promise of no cuts to the SBS, as well as then communication minister Turnbull's dud plan to increase advertising on the SBS to compensate for the cuts. We on this side of the House oppose the government's attempts to increase advertising limits on the SBS in 2015 and we made it very clear that we would oppose it again when it came up again in 2017. In March this year, the government quietly resurrected its plan to increase the amount of advertising on the SBS by introducing a bill to the parliament. The Prime Minister wanted SBS to double the amount of advertising it runs in prime time-a clear vindication of Labor being steadfast in our opposition to the SBS being forced to survive by increasing the amount of advertising. Rather than supporting a public broadcaster-bear in mind, this was on the back of a broken promise by then Prime Minister Abbott-this government simply sought to have the SBS increase advertising to the detriment of consumers. We are very pleased that we have been vindicated on that point.",178
202,Ms LAMB,BILLS," The long awaited 2017-18 budget that was passed by the Treasurer, Scott Morrison, earlier this month, is a budget that, despite claims frequently parroted by this government, is neither fair nor reasonable. I believe that the people of my electorate in Longman deserve fairness and I believe all Australian people deserve fairness, which is why I cannot stand by and passively let this government enact a poorly devised budget. The Liberal-National Party like to think of themselves as the party of money management, but this could not be further from the truth. They have proven time and time again by short sighted fiscal irresponsibility and mismanagement that either they have determined to widen the class divide through economic inequality or they really have no idea what they are doing. I will give them the benefit of the doubt here by citing Hanlon's razor: never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity. But neglect and misunderstanding is no excuse when it comes to a federal budget and to the livelihoods and futures of over 24 million people. One concept that the Liberal-National Treasurer seems never to have grasped with this budget is that budgets are about people. They are about their health, their education, their families, their welfare, their environment. And they are about their future. It is often said that the reason we have a kangaroo and an emu on our coat of arms is that neither of these native animals can move backwards. But we, as a nation, cannot move forward without looking forward, something that those opposite just refuse to do. Instead, they resort to short-sightedness for the sake of political spin. Moving forward is about investing in long-term, high-quality infrastructure. Instead, when he was the minister for communications, the Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, dismantle Labor's future-ready national broadband network and replaced it with an unquestionably inferior system. People in  my electorate, many of whom are still suffering from this appalling decision, were hoping for some remedial measures in this budget, but they have been disappointed again. Moving forward means that we are investing in education and in our children. It is most certainly not ripping $22 billion away from our schools' funding. It is not ripping away $22 billion that the LNP committed to when it promised each and every family and each and every student in my electorate a unity ticket to prior to the 2013 electorate. It promised to support the recommendations of the initial Gonski review, which promised real needs based funding. You really move forward when you understand that quick fixes are very rarely the solution to something as complicated and as important as the national budget. The government have taken no real steps forward. They have kicked up their feet and called it a day. But on this side of the chamber I am happy to say that the Labor Party has not. We are fighting back against this budget. Some in the media have claimed that this current budget is a good budget, a Labor budget. Whilst I appreciate that they are using 'Labor budget' and 'good budget' equally, the budget that Treasurer Scott Morrison brought down at the beginning of May was not 'good' and, I can tell you now, it certainly was not 'Labor'. It is not hard to see why the media may have made this mistake though. The Treasurer's address was filled with enough spin to make anybody dizzy, and his party's rhetoric has been guided by that centrifugal force. For example, earlier this month the members for Petrie and Dickson, two electorates that border mine, posted a video on Facebook. Like true champions of the people, they confidently spoke of the Bruce Highway and the Deception Bay overpass as a big win in the budget. However, what they did not mention was that this budget did not have any big wins for the Bruce Highway, nor did it have any wins for the Deception Bay overpass. In actuality, the money for these projects was previously allocated under another federal budget; it is not new money at all. These are not some projects for which the member for Dickson and the member for Petrie fought valiantly to secure funding. They were funded a long time ago. The government had just let them fall by the wayside. Instead of actually doing something and taking action for once, it had let the funds just sit there. The people of the Moreton Bay region could already be benefiting from the upgrades to the Bruce Highway and the Deception Bay overpass were it not for the inaction of this government. This government realises that its budget is so full of holes and so devoid of true wins for our constituents that it has now resorted to shallow political spin. If one of the biggest wins that you can parade from your budget is not actually from your budget, then maybe it is just not a very good budget. Now, I have to say, I do welcome the upgrades-of course I do. What I do not welcome, however, is the political sleight of hand that this government is using. It is dishonest and it shows a complete lack of respect for the Australian people. This is a government which has mishandled Australia's infrastructure time and time again, and the people of my electorate are suffering every single day because of it. The people of Longman have been denied quality infrastructure for years, and the government has done nowhere near enough to fix it. Finally, they are doing something about a highway, but we are still waiting to hear what will be done for our communications infrastructure like the mobile phone towers that provide cellular service right across the country. In my electorate there are a number of mobile black spot sites that desperately need addressing. People in a lot of these areas, which are not very  far from Brisbane CBD-actually they are less than about an hour away-receive no signal at all to their mobile phones. It is 2017, and technology that was popularised back in the 1990s has barely reached Longman. The government had a Mobile Black Spot Program in place to ensure that areas all around Australia that had this issue would be upgraded and be able to receive cellular service. The final round of funding for that program has just been announced, and it seems that a number of areas-again, in my electorate-have been forgotten, despite my having raised this a number of times in parliament since being elected. There was no new money for this program in the 2017-18 budget, so it looks as if the government has just thrown in the towel. We expect it though, because we know just how little this government cares about communications infrastructure. It was most evident when Labor's National Broadband Network was personally dismantled by the current Prime Minister for nothing short of some political gain. Instead of delivering what could have been the largest, most ambitious infrastructure project that our country has ever seen, providing high-speed, reliable internet to every household, Australians have been subjected to what can only be described as a dismal, dismal failure. All those years ago we had Prime Minister Turnbull promising that every single home would be connected by 2016. Do you remember that? That was last year. It is nearing the end of the second quarter of 2017, and there are countless homes and countless businesses in the electorate of Longman that are still waiting to be connected. But, thanks to the government's mishandling of the NBN rollout, in many cases the houses that are yet to be connected are actually the lucky ones. Let me tell you: the ones that have not been connected are the lucky ones, because I have heard in countless horror stories from residents and small businesses operating out of my electorate of their struggles when connecting to the NBN. For many, connecting to the NBN has left them with a line that is less reliable than the one they had in the days of dial-up. We live in a society where, whether you like it or not, a fast and reliable internet connection is absolutely imperative for many people's day-today lives, and the success of nearly every small business in today's modern economy is reliant on a fast and dependable internet connection. Not all that long ago I hosted a round-table in my electorate with a number of local small businesses. Each and every one of them was able to share a way in which this shoddy NBN had set their businesses back. As I have mentioned in this chamber before, the story from this discussion that stood out for me was of a retirement home on the passage side of Bribie Island. They lost all connectivity when they were apparently upgraded-and I use that term very loosely-to the NBN. They lost all connectivity to the internet and all connectivity to their landline. For a business in the aged care sector this can easily be a matter of life and death. A resident may need medication. They may need to get in contact with an ambulance. Without easy access to a landline phone or the internet they might not be able to get the services they need in time. But we all know that this government is not one to offer much support to people when it comes to their health. Labor believes that affordable access to high-quality health care is a fundamental human right. This government does not tend to agree, though. In his budget speech the Treasurer boasted that his government was lifting the Medicare freeze. Actually, you probably could have heard the exasperated sigh of 'finally' collectively being spoken by  the Australian people-except that it was not 'finally'. His health budget was full of smoke and mirrors. There are still some years to wait before that freeze is fully lifted. The bulk-billing incentives for GPs will be indexed from 1 July this year. That is not too long to wait, and I will happily concede that. But when there is a wait until 1 July 2018 for the indexation of just a standard consultation, and until 1 July 2019 for specialist procedures and allied health services, the government's budget really tends to lose its shine. When you realise that there is a further wait until 2020 for even more crucial services, it is evident just how little this government really thinks about supporting our health care. Vital services like pregnancy support and mental health care will have to wait over three years for their indexation date. That is over three years for people who need pre-pregnancy support or mental health plans. This means that, despite Malcolm Turnbull and his spin, they are still cutting $2.2 billion over four years. The average personal median income in my electorate is pretty low-it is about $500 a week. There are a lot of people living in Longman who suffer from heath issues. These people need their freeze lifted, and they should not have to wait for years for this to happen. You may have also heard that the government's secret hospitals task force has come to light in the last couple of days-the very, very secret task force",181
203,Unknown,BILLS,Honourable members interjecting,184
204,Ms LAMB,BILLS,"I hear this interjection. Does it not exist? Stand up for it-does it not exist? It does exist. At first glance you may think, 'Finally this government is doing something for our health care.' But, as with most of the Turnbull government's initiatives, what may sound good on the surface is truly anything but. This task force is not about hearing from all manner of stakeholders to deliver what is best for Australian people; this task force is another way for the government to outsource public hospital discussion to private interests. If you look at the list of participants from this secret task force, you will notice people from all manner of private organisations. What you will not see are people from public hospitals. You will not see consumers on this task force and you will not see people from the state health departments on this task force. What you will see is Prime Minister Turnbull selling off health care, and selling off the livelihoods of Australian people, right to the highest bidder. I ask you: how could anybody refer to this vicious budget as a Labor budget? It is absolutely not. Labor is the party that sought to implement the National Broadband Network to deliver fast, high-speed internet connection to every single Australian household. Labor is the party that introduced Medicare-the equitable healthcare system which is the absolute envy of countless other nations. Labor is the party of looking forward and taking risks to ensure that Australia thrives now and long into the future-long after any of our current members here have retired. What Labor is not is a party that plays to the self-serving, closedminded interests of corporate friends. It is not a party that turns its back on its constituents. We are not a party that would ever deliver an atrocious budget like the one that has just been handed down. Debate adjourned. NA Rearrangement",184
205,Ms PRICE,BUSINESS," I move:  That orders of the day Nos 2 and 3, government business, be postponed until a later hour this day. Question agreed to. NA Consideration resumed of the motion: That grievances be noted. Infrastructure",184
206,Mr ALBANESE,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," Back in 2012, the experts at Infrastructure New South Wales sat down to take a look at the major challenges facing Sydney's transport network. They later produced a report about their deliberations. Under the headline 'First things first', the experts, chaired by Nick Greiner, a former Premier of New South Wales, said the greatest transport challenge facing Sydney was rapid growth around Port Botany and the Sydney Airport. The Infrastructure New South Wales report said: With growth forecast to continue, investment is urgently needed in landside infrastructure to allow access to these gateways. It was identified access to the Port of Botany as the No. 1 priority. The advice could not have been clearer. The other imperative was access to the central business district of Sydney. It was these two requirements-access for freight to the port in particular and for cars to the CBDthat led to the beginning of what was termed the WestConnex project. What we have today with the WestConnex project, five years later, is a very different project. It is one which will not go to the port. It will not meet the very challenges that were identified as the reason for its existence. This is the worse example of planning that I have seen for a major infrastructure project. What you need to do with infrastructure is to get the plans right first, go through the community consultation process and the environmental approvals and then have funding provided. What we have with this project is literally a government which is making it up as they go along. This is a project where they literally started digging tunnels before they knew where the tunnels were coming up-an extraordinary proposition. It is a project which began with a cost of some $10 billion which has now blown out to $17 billion, which is now leading to calls for further extensions of the road network. In the 2014 budget of the Abbott government, the one where they cut funding for every public transport project that was not under construction, there was money handed out. It was handed out as advance payments for projects that had not been through planning proposals and had not been through the Infrastructure Australia process. That included the WestConnex project, where the $1.5 billion in grant funding has already all been paid-every single dollar of it-even though the project will not be concluded until into the 2020s. In government, we instituted a process whereby you would have milestone payments. That is the concept that you have to actually build something and achieve the milestones that have been set in order for state governments to then be rewarded with payments from the federal government. But what we saw with this project was $750 million forwarded as an advance payment. We also then saw $2 billion made available as a loan to the New South Wales government, even though the New South Wales government has got substantial revenue from the sale of essential public assets in New South Wales. This is what the Auditor-General had to say about the project. I will quote from the report released last year as a result of  representations that I had made asking for an audit into the financing processes of this project. He wrote: The WestConnex project had not proceeded fully through the established processes to assess the merits of nationally significant infrastructure investments prior to Australian Government funding being committed. This situation was identified in departmental advice to decision makers prior to decisions being taken. So there we have the Audit Office saying that ministers ignored the advice. With regard to the milestone payments, the Audit Office found that they changed what the milestones were in order to justify the payments being made. We also saw the ongoing complete failure of community consultation. The residents of Haberfield, St Peters, Ashfield, Leichhardt and Rozelle all tell the same story. Take just one example-that of Vince Crow, a long-time resident of Haberfield. In June 2014 Mr Crow received two letters from a representative of the WestConnex Delivery Authority. Both were delivered on the same day. The first letter said, 'We're going to need to buy your property,' and the second letter, signed by the same gentleman, said, 'We don't need to buy your property.' There was absolute uncertainty for this resident. The pattern of inaccuracy, unprofessionalism and miscommunication has been repeated across my community ever since. About 180 properties have already been acquired out of a total of more than 400. Indeed, there is the extraordinary circumstance whereby the New South Wales government kept secret from the community for more than two years the report they received in 2014 about compensation that people who were having their homes acquired were due. Across my community, residents have had to fight to protect public parks and sporting fields. Ashfield Park, Easton Park in Rozelle and Blackmore Oval in Leichhardt were all defended by the local community. I made representation about all of those public parks because open space is at a premium. Worst was to come with the idea that you would create a dive site next to the Leichhardt campus of the Sydney Secondary College. This was right next to the one oval that that overcrowded campus has. It was proposed to have a convoy of trucks rolling in and out of the worksite past school classroom windows. Fortunately, the New South Wales minister, Stuart Ayres, who I approached about this, intervened and it has been ruled out as a proposal. At the same time students in schools like St Peters Public School have had to put up with the demolition of homes right near the school. This had a real impact on them. Haberfield Public School students and teachers are very worried about the impact of the project on Haberfield. You would think, given the extent of disruption, that senior people in the New South Wales bureaucracy would be concerned about this. The Greater Sydney Commission has responsibility for planning in greater Sydney. In August 2016 the chair of the commission, Lucy Turnbull, was interviewed on ABC radio and was asked to comment on the fact that houses were being demolished in Haberfield to make way for WestConnex. The chair of the commission said, 'I'm not aware that there are houses going to be demolished at Haberfield.' At that very time dozens of houses, which were heritage listed in a heritage listed suburb, had already been demolished. There is complete contempt for these local residents. Delivering major infrastructure projects is never easy. I support good infrastructure, public transport as well as good road infrastructure, but you have to get the planning right. You also have to acknowledge that, in our growing global cities like Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane,  the key to dealing with urban congestion is public transport, not more and more road infrastructure. You must get the planning right, you must consult properly with the community and you must bring the community with you. In the words of the 18th century American statesman Benjamin Franklin, 'If you fail to plan, you are planning to fail.' The WestConnex project has now been set up under a separate authority so freedom of information laws and the normal accountability of a government agency do not apply in New South Wales. This is an example of avoiding bringing the community with an infrastructure project rather than having proper consultation. Maranoa Electorate: Telecommunications",185
207,Mr LITTLEPROUD,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," Can I acknowledge the member for Grayndler, who spoke before me. It is great to see you get a run here in the Fed. Chamber! Unfortunately, you did not get another question today in question time. If you stick with it, I am sure that you will, hopefully, have the first one to the Prime Minister tomorrow on an important issue of education-that we have lifted funding for every school in Maranoa. It is great to see the member for Grayndler get an opportunity in the Federation Chamber. He cannot get into the main chamber, but, if he sticks with it, maybe the Leader of the Opposition will give him a crack in the next couple of days and let him ask a question. The member for Grayndler is a great supporter of the people of Maranoa. In fact, he has visited the people of Maranoa on a number of occasions, which I do acknowledge. That is why I acknowledge the member for Grayndler, and I do hope that the opposition leader gives him the opportunity to ask a question very soon, because we like to see him. We miss him! But I digress. Today I want to talk about roaming. In the last couple of weeks, the ACCC handed down its interim finding into mobile phone roaming. Mobile phone roaming allows for customers to have access to mobile phone towers of other companies that they may not subscribe to. It is an important aspect of telecommunications, particularly in my electorate of Maranoa, which covers 42 per cent of Queensland-nearly 10 per cent of the Australian land mass. To provide continuity of telecommunications, particularly in mobile phones, across my electorate is so important. It is important that we are able to provide continuity to those people and give them the tools of the 21st century that we rely on to do business so they can take advantage of the trade agreements that we as a federal government have put in place over the last four years with Japan, China and South Korea, and we are moving towards one with Singapore. And I think there will also be a great opportunity with Indonesia. The people in my electorate need the tools of the 21st century to be able to do trade, to be able to sit on their highly sophisticated and very expensive machinery while planting cotton or wheat, to be able to utilise the technology that they have on those pieces of machinery, to be able to use the multimillion dollar businesses that they run, to be able to provide the infrastructure for them to trade, and to be able to take advantage of the free trade agreements that we as a government have put in place. Mobile phone roaming is important to my electorate, and I understand that the ACCC has said in its interim finding that it will not support the mandating of that. I respect the umpire's decision, but I am a little miffed by some of the findings in the report. Mobile phone roaming has been inquired into two previous times. In those two previous inquiries, the ACCC did not mandate roaming because it believed that the market would sort itself out and come to the conclusion that it would be viable. Unfortunately, that has not happened over the ensuing  period. But this time, unfortunately, the ACCC has abandoned that methodology and has, in fact, made its decision predicated on the fear of further investment in infrastructure on mobile phone towers across regional and rural Australia. I have to congratulate Telstra. They ran a fantastic fear campaign in articulating the case that they would not invest further dollars into rural and regional telecommunications if roaming were mandated, because, effectively, they have a monopoly. In my electorate alone, they have a significant monopoly and we do not have the opportunity of choice. I believe quite passionately that the people in rural and regional Australia should have the same opportunities as those in metropolitan Australia. The reality is that it is not a commercial case for any telecommunications company to, effectively, duplicate the infrastructure across rural and regional Australia, because of the vast distances that we have. But that should not mean that people in rural and regional Australia should not enjoy the same competitive tension that is in metropolitan areas. A pragmatic and realistic opportunity was missed. But we need to understand why the campaign was undertaken by Telstra. Telstra has around 17 million customers across the country, and every one of us who is signed up to Telstra pays a premium. If you walk into the Telstra store in Brisbane or Sydney or Melbourne and ask the assistant why you should choose Telstra over one of their competitors, the answer will be, quite clearly and loudly, that Telstra provides a far more significant network across this country. But to sign up to that you will pay a premium. Every one of the 17 million Australians who have signed up to Telstra will pay a premium, because they have a superior network across the country. You pay that premium and in fact it amounts to billions of dollars that Telstra is taking because of the superior network they are providing. Unfortunately, I have not seen those billions of dollars invested in the telecommunications infrastructure in my electorate. We have put in place our Mobile Black Spot Program, something that was never thought of before we came into government, before Fiona Nash, the first regional telecommunications minister in cabinet in the nation's history, which shows that we passionately believe in telecommunications and rural and regional Australia. Labor did nothing for all the time that they are there. They would not even know where the Great Dividing Range is, let alone what rural and regional Australia may be. We put $220 million into telecommunications in the bush. Telstra has had to come with us, with our hand holding them all the way to help them to invest in rural and regional Australia. Unfortunately, their friends at Optus also oppose mandated roaming. They believed they would no longer make the infrastructure spend if mandated roaming came into effect. They let the cat out of the bag at the Universal Service Obligation hearing in Sydney, at which I was sitting down the back. Their representative, when was asked about the Mobile Black Spot Program, said it was a great program initiated by this federal government but they would not see the commercial viability in undertaking further rounds of the Mobile Black Spot Program. So, effectively, this argument about further infrastructure investment for mobile phone infrastructure in the bush is nothing more than a furphy. The telcos have sold us a pup, because the reality is that Telstra is taking billions of dollars but is not investing it. So they are using the bush as a sales pitch to get more customers in the city, where it is commercially viable, but they are not investing in the bush. When this finding became public, I wrote to Andy Penn and asked him to come back to me by tomorrow to tell me, shire by shire and town by town, what the infrastructure spend will be in my electorate of Maranoa if mandated  roaming is not provided. I am yet to get that response, but I hope that I do, because he and his company had been on a grand publicity tour through Maranoa talking about the virtues of keeping roaming out of our marketplace, saying that they are going to invest billions of dollars. Well, their money needs to come out and they need to articulate quite clearly where they are going to invest in the electorate of Maranoa and in all regional and rural Australia. But there is also an opportunity to look forward-to look pragmatically at the total of our telecommunications policies. The Productivity Commission has just handed down a report on the Universal Service Obligation. It was set up to look at pay phones and landlines. We all know that the advent of pay phones is just about over-they have had their day. $300 million a year goes to Telstra to administer the Universal Service Obligation. Now is an opportunity to look at mandated roaming and the USO in unison. If you mandated roaming and you relooked at the USO you could actually ensure that the telcos invested more into the USOapart from just Telstra, but the Vodafones and Optuses of this world-to start a fund that would initiate the growth infrastructure that we need in rural and regional Australia to give us the tools of the 21st century to move forward. This is a pragmatic way to look at telecommunications policy for rural and regional Australia-to combine mandated roaming and the USO into one; to have the USO not only for landlines, because we need to landlines. In my electorate, where we do not have towers, the reality is that landlines are life and death. We need to have a base internet service but we could also have mandated roaming, where we could continue to increase the expansion of infrastructure and the network across regional and rural Australia that would ensure that we continue to get the tools of the 21st century we need. This is a pragmatic and honest way of looking at telecommunications in the bush. We need mobility in how we do business. I am proud to say that we have taken great steps, but it is now important that the telecommunications industry comes with us, because if they do not they will only impede the people, the engine room, of this nation in my electorate of Maranoa. Indi Electorate: Higher Education",187
208,Ms MCGOWAN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," I rise tonight in this grievance debate to call on the government to put an end to the silo approach and to work across portfolio boundaries to lift the burden from the shoulders of regional students. I was inspired and moved by the 75 young people who came to my budget feedback sessions and the 65 other young people who wrote to me. They work hard to finish their education, despite the challenges they face. But the systemic drag puts them behind their metropolitan counterparts and stops them from reaching their full potential. As their independent representative I am determined their voice be heard in this parliament. Higher education for regional communities is not a single issue. There are multiple challenges across portfolios and a multipronged approach is the only way to find a solution. Tonight I want to address three elements of this grievance: the need to increase the representation of regional students in higher education; the need to provide greater support for those transitioning between secondary and tertiary education, particularly when this includes a move from home to the city; and the need to ensure there is recognition of the workforce and economic development requirements of the community when we are addressing higher education.  We know there is a gap between metropolitan and regional communities in attending universities. Young people aged 15 to 24 years from rural and regional Australia are almost half as likely to be attending university as young people from metropolitan areas. This is not a new challenge. In 2008 the Review of Australian Higher Education drove home the point. People from regional Australia 'remain seriously under-represented' in higher education, even with rural universities, VET programs and public facilities in rural centres. A 2003 report from the then Department of Education, Science and Training told us that around 40 per cent of regional students had moved to attend university, while only four per cent of the metropolitan counterparts moved. Online study is often presented as an option for regional students wanting or needing to stay at home but also wanting to continue their education. While I want to believe-and I was very amused by the comments from my colleague from Maranoa-the NBN as that we have just been seeing on TV, that knowledge is not limited by space and time, that anyone can change the world from anywhere and it is easy to pass on these skills, my experience is, if there is no internet connection, then, simply, it is not an option. If you are one of the 880 people aged between 15 and 24 who live, for example, in Mansfield, moving for university does not come as a surprise. Depending on what side of town you live, there is only a six kilometre difference between travelling to Melbourne or Wodonga. It is a similar story for those living in the smaller communities across my community. You have to move. While regional universities are part of the solution they are not the whole solution. Movement is not always related to a lack of a regional campus or course availability. Young people see their pursuit of study in a city area as an opportunity to grow up, to assert their independence, to meet new and exciting people and to have experiences that are simply not available at home. Travelling to the city comes with its challenges. It is difficult to find jobs and build experience, and they cannot access an independent payment rate with Centrelink while they study. The 2017 budget's increase to university fees adds to this financial stress. But, according to Universities Australia, the biggest barriers for students are often related to issues beyond university. They cite pressures with health or stress, juggling work-life balance, the need to do paid work and overall workload as well as financial difficulties. A report from Education Training out West tells us students from rural and regional communities need more support during the transition phase from high school to university, with the most critical period being from December to March. The biggest threat to the sustainability of rural communities is a declining population of young people. While we want to encourage increasing number of students from regional areas to attend universities in the city, the statistics show they are unlikely to return in a hurry. So for me the challenge is to bring them home. Young people in my electorate work hard to build their futures. They take up the challenge of moving away from home to study. Many hope to return to lndi once their studies are completed and bring back the experiences and skills that will enhance growth and vibrancy in our rural and regional communities. To encourage this, I want our young people to come home. I want them to bring their skills and their vibrancy to us. But we need to assure them that there is an opportunity in their home communities. For this to occur, we absolutely need people to connect. We need those driving economic  development to work with those developing a workforce plan. And when these things are driven by government policy, we need government agencies to talk to each other. To their credit, the government recognise that there is a problem, and now, I believe, they have the opportunity to act. On 2 March 2017 the Minister for Education and Training, Senator Simon Birmingham, announced the appointment of Emeritus Professor John Halsey to lead an independent review into rural, regional and remote education. The review will foster the educational outcomes of regional, rural and remote students. It will provide recommendations to government on innovation and fresh approaches that will support improved access, the achievement of these students in school, and their transition to further study, training and employment. Good move! On 15 March this year, the government announced the Regional Australia Ministerial Taskforce, spearheaded by the Prime Minister, with no fewer than eight cabinet ministers, representing health, education, employment, regional development, infrastructure, transport, resources, innovation, industry and science. This task force will focus on closing the gap between the city and the bush. Following the establishment of the task force, Minister Nash was quoted as saying: I think the comparison is pretty clear. A lot of our city students have the opportunity when they're living in a metropolitan area to live at home and attend university. A lot of our regional students don't, so they'll be the types of things we're discussing. I wish the task force well. Rural communities know better than most the importance of connection. They know that education, health and employment have to be addressed together, not in silos. I called on the government to implement these initiatives with the same thought processes with which rural communities approach challenges in their own communities. We ask ourselves: Are there any barriers-social, financial, geographical or economic-keeping people away? Have we included future needs? I want to take this opportunity tonight to remind the government, in answering these questions, of another review they commissioned. In 2016 the government commissioned an independent review to examine the effectiveness of Regional Development Australia, known as RDA, in delivering the Australian government's regional agenda. The review was to make recommendations 'regarding its future scope, structure and delivery model, in light of developments in the Australian government's regional agenda'. I understand that the reviewer, Mr Smith, has provided his final report to the Minister for Regional Development and that the Australian government is seeking advice on the recommendations. We are very keen to hear the result, Minister. In Victoria, RDA committees comprise local leaders with broad and diverse skills and experience as well as demonstrated networks within their regions. They understand the challenges, opportunities and priorities within their local communities. So the RDA review and the RDA committees are really important for us. My call to the government tonight is to join the dots. I say to the government: you have an independent review into regional, rural and remote education designed to support students to succeed in school and in their transition to further study, training and employment. You committed $15.2 million in this year's budget to creating six new community owned study hubs and expand support for work experience. You committed $220 million to the Regional Jobs and Investment Packages to help the regions. You have a program designed to build  partnerships to ensure integrated and aligned arrangements for regional engagement and economic development. And you have established the Regional Australia Ministerial Taskforce to improve the lives of rural, regional and remote Australians. So bring it together. Don't let these initiatives continue to feed into silos. The regional ministerial task force must bring these initiatives together. In bringing my comments to a close, let me say that if the task force can do this then in rural and regional Australia our students, the future of our nation, will be able to get the education they deserve to meet the needs of our communities. This is an urgent cry. Groom Electorate",189
209,Dr MCVEIGH,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," With the Turnbull government's 2017-18 budget having been handed down, it is timely to take a step back and consider its role in supporting the families, businesses and future prospects of the people of my electorate of Groom. I have discussed that in the debate on the appropriation bills, but I believe it is also vital to look beyond the daily political debate in this place and truly consider the efforts of the government and its alignment with the values and aspirations of any region. As has been confirmed in numerous assessments and surveys over the years, Toowoomba, the largest population centre in Groom, is an internationally recognised family-friendly city. Our lifestyle, climate, infrastructure and service provision are the envy of much of the rest of the country. We did not get there by accident. We share a proud history of pioneering spirit, particularly in agriculture, based on family farming and family small business models. Many retail, manufacturing and service small businesses have their roots on the Darling Downs and, from the perspective of larger commercial operations, we have a history of spurring national names over the last century, including Defiance Milling, Toowoomba Foundry and the Southern Cross windmill, and KR Darling Downs Smallgoods, and firms of today such as Weis Frozen Foods and Russell Mineral Equipment. Our region has always celebrated enterprise and entrepreneurialism. I am proud to be part of a coalition government that is so focused on the importance of the family business and family group, above all else, as the basis of our society. In Groom, as I have said, such a focus is the hallmark of our region, as is the importance of recognising and supporting individual enterprise along with the recognition that we should have small government in place to support and encourage people and businesses; to incentivise them, not punish them with tax increases and intervention as those opposite might do; and to do so in a way that recognises that it is business and individuals that create wealth and employment in our country-not government, which more often than not should simply get out of the way. I draw the correlation therefore between what our region needs for its future, our government's ethos as I have outlined and the fact that in this budget we have delivered small business tax cuts, training opportunities and incentives for individuals and, particularly, small business to get on, to invest and to employ. I reflect too on the importance of security for the people of Groom, both locally and internationally. Yesterday and today we are reeling from the tragic loss of one of our finest police officers whilst protecting all of us. While we grieve and support his family and colleagues, we must also recognise, as I am sure those of all political persuasions do, the importance of those who protect us, whether it is a state or territory government's police service, or the federal government Federal Police and Defence Force personnel. We are  blessed with professional and courageous people in all such roles in our community of Groom, and the importance of our budgetary recognition, in our case as a federal government, cannot be ignored. It must continue to be prioritised as a key responsibility of any movement. I am proud of the Army Aviation Centre Oakey at Swartz Barracks and the electronic warfare base at Borneo Barracks, Cabarlah, in our region and of the continued resourcing of them and other establishments around our country. The budget's defence investment plan provides significant opportunities for our regional businesses in Groom and the challenge is there for us to step up, as I have been discussing with the Toowoomba Regional Council and with the Toowoomba and Surat Basin Enterprise economic development organisation. Toowoomba, as recognised by UNESCO, is a model city of peace and harmony, and we will lean on that shared vison as we deal with the current grief that we face. Our community will pull together as it has done before. Our community and faith leaders regularly come together, jointly, as Christians, Muslims, Buddhists and other great faiths from across the globe. Our government certainly recognises the rights and freedoms of all peoples and the universal rights, of course, of freedom of thought, worship, speech and association. But, as is the case with any fundamental right, so too do the individual and collective have a responsibility to respect the Australian laws that go with it. Our government's focus on the resourcing of border security is as important in Groom as it is elsewhere in the country. We are proud to be a refugee welcome zone but insist that all recognise our traditions and our Australian way of life. As our government recognises that sensible and respectful relations between our cultures is dependent on protections, as I have said, so too is it dependent on an open economy that does not close us off from opportunity and engagement. In Groom, that is certainly the case. Free trade agreements and infrastructure support for export activity have been secured during the Turnbull government's term in office and in this budget. I, and others of my colleagues, have rightly lauded the record infrastructure investment of the Turnbull government. The road, rail and air infrastructure underway, planned and proposed is indeed confirmation that the Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, is the infrastructure Prime Minster. Groom is the beneficiary of significant road and rail government allocations which complement the initiative of our private international airport at Wellcamp. It is important to support both the initiative of our community in exciting times and the serious needs of others when life is challenging. Our education investment in Groom supports such initiative, and the guaranteed Medicare and fully funded NDIS properly provides essential support where required. While we debate budgets, legislation and policy in this place, I suggest that it is vital to remember the community needs, aspirations and values on which they should depend to meet and support those requirements. If we believe in equal opportunity for all, and the coalition government does, if we believe in the security of our people, our way of life and Australian values, and the coalition government does, and if we are committed to a humane society where those who cannot provide for themselves can live in dignity, and the coalition government is-if we believe all of that-a balanced and responsible approach to budgeting essential services and facilitation of catalytic support and infrastructure is essential. I am proud to represent the Groom community here in this House and to, in particular, work behind the scenes to ensure the professed values of our coalition government continue to  meet their needs through this budget, legislation that is before us and competent policy development for the future. We certainly must debate figures, trends and statistics, but they only make sense, particularly in Groom, if we recognise and abide by the values that I have outlined. Tasmania: Cycling Tourism",192
210,Ms KEAY,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," I want to take this chamber on a brief journey in the time. I have available. I want to take the chamber on a tour that encompasses rugged coastline; unspoilt beaches, penguin rookeries dotted along the coast; cool climate wines, like pinot noir, chardonnay and sauvignon blanc; and fine food, like Cape Grim beef, Mount Gnomon pork, Tasmanian scallops, fresh crayfish, strawberries, blueberries, raspberries with King Island cream and, of course, Tasmania's world-class salmon and ocean trout. Sounds good, doesn't it? I want to take the chamber on a tour that covers 110 kilometres of coastline and rivers that connect 20 communities. I want to take the chamber on a tour where you, Mr Deputy Speaker Goodenough, your family and friends can load your bikes on the Spirit of Tasmania in Melbourne, arrive in Devonport-my home town-and ride off to your heart's content in any direction or simply walk a short way and take yourself to a different place. There is a shared pathway where cyclists and walkers can equally access all that is on offer in my region. This is the vision and experience that is waiting to be developed on the north-west coast of Tasmania. It is a vision that will see this region become one of Australia's top cycling tourism destinations. It is a vision that is supported by the local regional authority, the Cradle Coast Authority, and the community, through the Coastal Pathway Coalition. The Cradle Coast Authority is the regional voice for north-west Tasmania as well as the west coast and King Island. Its membership consists of the nine local government councils to represent and advocate the needs of the region. The authority collaborates and facilitates a diverse range of projects and initiatives involving all tiers of government, industry and the community. Its three areas of focus are regional economic development, natural resource management and tourism. The North West Coastal Pathway project supports all three of these focus areas. The Cradle Coast Authority has made this one of its key priorities, behind only the Cradle Mountain Master Plan. The Coastal Pathway Coalition is led by a group of cyclists: Andrew Leary and Ben Kearney from Turners Beach, supported by Keith Price, from Burnie, on behalf of Safer Roads for Cyclists. Keith, Ben and Andrew have been tireless in their work to see their vision become a reality. The Tasmanian government's draft plan, entitled Tasmania's cycle tourism strategic action plan to 2020, has been developed to generate more demand for travel to Tasmania through cycle tourism. Following the development of Labor's federally funded Blue Derby trails in north-east Tasmania-which, I must add, are extremely successful-there has been significant growth in Tasmanian cycle tourism. The Tasmanian visitor survey for the year to June 2016 showed that 39,000 interstate and overseas visitors undertook some form of cycling activity for that year, an increase of 41 per cent from the year before. This increase shows the appetite for cycle tourism and latent demand. The same strategic action plan states that cycle tourists are generally higher-yield visitors that spend more and travel more widely throughout the state. The average length of stay for a cycling tourist is 17 nights, well above the average of nine nights as stated by Tourism Tasmania. The plan sets out three priority areas:  consolidating trails and routes, marketing what we have, and providing the supporting infrastructure and services to provide the right experience once cycle tourists arrive. The Cradle Coast Authority has developed an investment prospectus to support the North West Coastal Pathway project. The prospectus identifies multiple economic and social opportunities for my region, such as increased and new economic activity for local businesses, creating 90 full-time equivalent jobs during construction; a flow-on effect translating to an extra $38.6 million of economic output; and, postconstruction, an extra $17 million per annum injected into the local economy, which translates to 97 new and ongoing full-time equivalent jobs. The north-west coast of Tasmania, unfortunately, has some of the worse health indicators in Tasmania and in Australia. People are at higher risk of fair to poor health, have higher indices of heart disease, are more than likely to be obese, and previous reports have stated that 71 per cent of north-west coast Tasmanians are not undertaking 30 minutes of exercise per day, which is contributing to poor health outcomes. The shared coastal pathway goes some way to addressing these health issues by promoting a locally active and healthy lifestyle. The project has social benefits, such as connecting communities. One only has to look at state and federal Labor's funding of the Ulverstone to Turners Beach shared pathway. It has connected these communities and encouraged people to walk and cycle. Businesses have grown and new jobs have been created. It is quite funny that the previous speaker spoke about the government not creating jobs, but this is government money actually creating jobs. It is quite amazing! The Cradle Coast Authority has identified five key sections of the shared pathway: Burnie to Wynyard, Sulphur Creek to Ulverstone, the Forth Rail Bridge reuse, Turners Beach to Devonport, and Devonport to Latrobe to Port Sorell. Within each section there are 15 priority stages. The Cradle Coast Authority has identified five short-term priority sectors that are ready to proceed right now. For each of these sectors, the relevant local council has allocated funding in its budget. There we go: government funding to create jobs! They are ready to go. What have the Liberals done? I have to say, some credit is due to the Tasmanian government for its work in developing the draft cycle tourism strategic action plan and for legislation to free-up disused rail corridors. However, I note that comments on the draft plan closed in February of this year, and almost four months later no final report has been produced. In February of this year the Premier heard the case for the project from the Coastal Pathway Coalition, the Cradle Coast Authority CEO and the Bicycle Network Tasmania CEO. Only last week, the state Liberal government handed down its budget, but, for reasons best known to it, not a single stage of this project was funded. This is despite the Premier's own plan stating: 'Developing supporting infrastructure is a priority for cycling tourism.' A number of local state Liberal MPs in my electorate also claim to support this vision, but their words have not been matched with actions. At a federal level, the former member for Braddon was presented with an investment document by the Cradle Coast Authority. He also attended the single biggest public meeting held throughout last year's election campaign, a meeting organised by the Coastal Pathway Coalition to promote this vision. Some 120 people attended to show their support, but, sadly, the coalition did not commit one cent to this vision over the campaign period or since. Even worse, following the election they knocked back Stronger Regions applications from the Burnie City Council and the Waratah-Wynyard Council to connect their communities. In a  triple whammy they backed it up with their budget earlier this month providing nothing for this project. There was nothing in the campaign. They knocked back funding applications. There is nothing in the budget. What has Labor done? That is the question I am sure the other side are asking. Labor can proudly say it gets it. It gets this project. Labor understands the social and economic benefit that cycling tourism and shared pathways can bring. Labor funded the Blue Derby trails in north-east Tasmania. Labor has funded every piece of shared pathway infrastructure in my electorate. During the federal election campaign, along with my colleague the now member for Lyons, we made several funding announcements. Labor said it would fund the Devonport to Latrobe section, the Burnie CBD section, the Cooee to Wynyard section and the Devonport to Port Sorell section. Over $6 million was committed by Labor in the last federal election. Since the election, I have hosted the shadow minister for regional services in my electorate, and he has been briefed by the Coastal Pathway Coalition and the Cradle Coast Authority. I am pleased to say that, unlike those opposite, the shadow minister gets it too. I take you back to my earlier remarks: fine food, fine wine and magnificent coastline-this journey is ready for all. It can be walked or cycled in short trips, stages or overnight. I say to those opposite at a state and federal level: this project truly can transform my region, create lots of jobs-as I have already said-and help connect those communities. The social and economic benefits are too strong to be ignored. To the coalition, I say: you can be part of something that can really bring about change, so join with Labor and come on the journey. Barnett, Hon. Colin James",194
211,Mr MORTON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," It is with great pleasure that I stand before you to talk about someone who I have had the pleasure of working very closely with and to talk about their contribution to Western Australia. The Liberal state government led by Colin Barnett has the legacy of one of the most successful governments to lead WA. It was a government of integrity, a government of principle, an ethical government, free of the inaction and scandal that dogged the former Labor government in WA-inaction and scandal that saw Labor ministers sacked or resign for their improper use of high office. The Barnett government was a team of skilled and talented ministers that led reforms in a great number of portfolios over the 8½ years from 2008. They are reforms that have shaped Western Australia in mining exploration, job creation, health, education, law and order, and infrastructure investment. Mr Barnett's influence on WA politics is much longer than his time as Premier. He came to the WA parliament in August 1990, winning a by-election in Cottesloe after the resignation of former Liberal opposition leader Bill Hassell. A former economist and executive director of WA's Chamber of Commerce and Industry, he was promoted very quickly into the shadow cabinet. In opposition he held the portfolios of housing, works, fuel, energy and state development. Mr Barnett was elevated to the position of Deputy Leader of the Opposition by Richard Court in the lead-up to the 1993 state election and was deputy leader, minister, leader and Premier from that time until the recent election-24 years in the WA Liberal leadership team. He began his ministerial career after the Liberals defeated Carmen Lawrence in 1993. He spent time as opposition leader from 2001 to 2005, and a defeat of the Carpenter Labor government brought him to be the Premier of Western Australia. As Premier, Mr Barnett's agenda was to take WA to the world, in partnership with the federal government and in the  interests of WA first. WA led by Colin Barnett capitalised on the rise of Asia. Their middleclass boom, extraordinary population growth, rising incomes and urbanisation became WA's success. Our mineral resources and construction and mining expertise were in palpable demand. Huge projects like Gorgon, Wheatstone and Pluto fuelled a massive expansion of the state's economy. The Barnett government backed exploration and project expansions to keep the state competitive. Within this decade, LNG production trebled to make Western Australia the world's second largest LNG producer, and iron ore production more than doubled. Western Australia will continue to dominate Australia's exports. On Colin Barnett's watch, WA's asset base grew by 55 per cent and more than 98,000 jobs were created. Mining royalties were invested in infrastructure to support and foster our economy. Ports, roads, rail, freight regulation reform and payroll tax exemptions for apprentices and trainees meant that government did its part to support business and jobs. With the expansion of WA, workers and families moved to our state-450,000 people moved to our state over those 8½ years. With our newest sandgropers came challenges. Twenty minutes could no longer be the norm for getting anywhere in our city. But Western Australians welcomed the massive population surge and dealt with it well. WA built jobcreating infrastructure to look after everybody-roads, rail, hospitals and schools. Mining aside, Barnett also personally took on the science and later tourism portfolios as he looked to diversify WA's economy. Agriculture, tourism, education, health services, science and innovation remained a focus of the Barnett government. Again for WA, the driving force was Asia, with vast populations wanting access to quality agricultural produce and first-class education and health services. The government expanded agricultural production through the development of the second stage of the Ord River project. Irrigated land in the Ord is producing chia, sorghum and millet for export to Asia. With the assistance of the state government, many Western Australian food producers began to make solid inroads into Asia, exporting products like: chilled, frozen and processed meat; live cattle and sheep; and honey. It is easy to forget that Colin Barnett took over the premiership following the global financial crisis. But in 8½ years Perth City and Western Australia has transformed. Colin Barnett was a statesman for Western Australia and a statesman we were very proud to have on the international circuit representing our state and our country. The WA Liberals rebuilt our health system with: a $7 billion health asset program which modernised our healthcare system; new hospitals such as the Fiona Stanley Hospital, the Midland, Albany and Hedland health campuses and the new children's hospital soon to open; and major redevelopments at Joondalup and Busselton health campuses and also at Kalgoorlie Hospital. In total, 61 hospitals and health facilities were built or upgraded. Health spending was increased overall by 80 per cent. Disability spending increased 120 per cent. Spending on and investment in mental health grew. WA nurses were the highest paid in the country. On our transport infrastructure, the Barnett government focused on the needs of our population due to the boom. They completed the Gateway project. They sunk the rail line between Northbridge and Perth. They extended the Mitchell Freeway to Hester Avenue and commenced Roe 8. They extended the railway line to Butler. They commenced the  Forrestfield Airport Link. They built train station car parks. Hundreds of kilometres of bike paths were constructed across WA and free public transport was introduced for seniors. It is on education that I know Mr Barnett is most proud. The Barnett government built 56 new schools. They introduced the independent public school model, allowing greater autonomy for schools to determine their own needs. The Barnett government managed the successful transition of year 7 students into high school. On crime, the Barnett government: boosted police numbers by 1,050; introduced mandatory 75 per cent of the statutory maximum sentences for serious and sexual assaults committed during a home invasion; and introduced mandatory jail sentences for assaults against police, ambulance officers, transit guards, court security and prison officers. Tough anti-graffiti laws have seen an 88 per cent decline in graffiti offences. Tough hoon laws resulted in 2,028 vehicles being impounded in 2015 alone. The Barnett government also revitalised Perth through investment in Elizabeth Quay, the Perth City Link, the Perth Cultural Centre, the new Perth Stadium and a new museum, on which construction will start soon. These projects will be recognised as more significant as time goes by. But find me anyone who has visited Elizabeth Quay who has not enjoyed the experience. When Perth's No. 1, nightly news bulletin changes their opening credits to include a twilight shot of Elizabeth Quay, you know we have quickly come to love it. Find me someone who cannot wait for the new stadium to be opened to watch the derby. Find me someone who does not have a story of the first-class health services at our public hospitals, including Fiona Stanley Hospital in my electorate of Tangney. Find me someone who does not feel safer with an extra 1,000 police on the streets. Our state now is very different to when Colin Barnett first became Premier in 2008. Every Australian can remember what our state was like in 2008-or can they? When I was state director, working with Barnett as opposition leader, we ran a television commercial that asked Western Australians to nominate three things that the previous Labor government had achieved in Western Australia. The reason we ran that election commercial was that people could not name three things that the previous Labor government had achieved. The same cannot be said for Colin Barnett and his government. Colin Barnett and his government have transformed Western Australia. It is no longer 'Dullsville'. Investment in priority areas was needed after Labor's underinvestment and to deal with the challenges of rapid population growth. Some 450,000 additional people came to call WA home under Colin Barnett's watch, but the quality of our services were maintained at high levels. This is a honeymoon period for MCGowan and the Labor government, and I wish them well. The new Premier is keeping his hi-vis, hard hat and golden scissors in the back of his car, because not a day goes by when he is not opening a completed project that was designed and commissioned by the Barnett government. I do wish the MCGowan government well. I am sure they will soon learn that opposition is an easier place than government. In government decisions have to be made-decisions like supporting jobs that will be created through Roe 8 and Roe 9 in my electorate. Mr Barnett served during the terms of five Australian prime ministers, three US presidents and three British prime ministers, and through all that time he remained committed to the  people of Western Australia. I thank him for his commitment and service to the people of WA, supported by his wife, Lyn, and his family. Over time, history will be rightly generous about the time and commitment that Mr Barnett gave to the people of Western Australia. Colin Barnett's wisdom and steadfast leadership should be a playbook for leaders inside and outside of politics. I wish Colin Barnett well.",196
212,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," There being no further grievances the debate is adjourned, and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Federation Chamber adjourned at 19:13 ",199
