1,Mr REID,Unknown,"I wish to take the earliest opportunity to make a personal explanation. I find that, when the motion for adjournment was moved on Wednesday last, the honourable member for Gwydir made these statementsTo-day it is alleged that thousands of pounds have been contributed by the Tobacco Trust, the shipping ring, and various big firm's in Sydney, to a fund which the members of the Opposition are shepherding, and which is being used by them when travelling through the country with tlieir wives, in the. endeavour to wrest from the Government at the next elections the reins of office The leader of the Opposition is travelling through the country, utilizing the large funds placed at his command for the purpose of injurir.g honourable members who are here attending to their public duties. Each of those statements is absolutely false. Sir WILLIAM LYNE.T-IS it parliamentary for the .right honourable member to charac^ terize the words of the honourable member* for Gwydir as false?",13
2,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,I ask the right honourable member to withdraw the remark.,14
3,Mr REID,Unknown,"I withdraw it, and substitute the expression ""without foundation."" During my parliamentary career - and I have been the leader of a party in, I think, live political campaigns- I do not believe that a dozen subscriptions have been placed in my hands to help my party in the fight. The last of those subscriptions was received some years ago; I think in connection with the last Federal elections.",14
4,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Hav e not subscriptions been collected by the Reform League ?,14
5,Mr REID,Unknown,"That is a State league, with which I have nothing to do. The only body with which I am connected is one for which the honourable member for North Sydney is treasurer, and he has given an em1 phatic denial to the statements of the honourable member for Gwydir.",14
6,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,It has been done on former occasions.,14
7,Mr REID,Unknown,"All I can say is that it is absolutely false to say that any such funds have been placed at my command, or, so far as I know, at the command of any honor-. able member of the party in either the Senate or the House of Representatives.",14
8,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,Then who pays the organizers who are travelling through the States?,14
9,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"There is a secret fund from which they are being paid, and the right honourable member is getting the benefit of it.",14
10,Mr REID,Unknown,"I have not received sixpence from anv fund. I am afraid that the object of the statement was to frighten persons from subscribing to our league. wish, therefore, to say that we are ready to accept as much as is sent along. We do not, however, intend to call upon the boys and ffirls in the factories to contribute from their small wages.",14
11,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The right honourable member has at his disposal already a fund of about ^10,000.",14
12,Mr REID,Unknown,I should like to get a Ijttle of it.,14
13,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,These interchanges are highlv disorderly. DUTY ON HARVESTERS.,14
14,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I wish to ask the Minister of Trade and Customs a question without notice. Does rhe Government intend to proceed at cince with the .proposals^ to increase the harvester duties ? If not, w'fr they discontinue the illegal collection of increased duties which Parliament has not authorized ?",14
15,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,The duties recommended by the Tariff Commission are now being collected under the motion which I moved some time since - I have not yet had an opportunity to consult with the Prime Minister and my other colleagues as to when the motion can be proceeded with; but I shall do so at the earliest possible opportunity. HIGH COURT BENCH.,14
16,Mr REID,Unknown,"In view of the grave urgency alleged for the appointment of additional Judges to the High Court Bench, and the fact that the Bill authorizing the appointment passed through this House some time ago, does not the Prinie Minister think that its passage in anotber pface should be facilitated?",14
17,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The measure is urgent, but the leader of the Senate has explained that, as it is the practice of that body to, as far as possible, finish a stage of one Bill before considering another, he has not yet been able to bring it forward. I have reason to believe that it will be proceeded with, and, I hope, disposed of this week AUDITOR-GENERAL'S REPORT,",14
18,Mr WILKINSON,Unknown,Can the Treasurer inform the House when the Auditor: General's report will be presented ?,14
19,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Ver y shortly, I should think. I shall endeavour to give the honourable member a definite'answer tomorrow. I TARIFF COMMISSION'S REPORTS.",14
20,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I wish to ask the Minister of Trade and Customs a question without notice. . In view of the often expressed anxiety of the Government to obtain the reports'of the Tariff .Commission, so as to allow prompt action to rectify anomalies and provide relief for alleged declining industries, how do they reconcile their present inaction with their former apparent solicitude?",14
21,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I shall not answer that auestion. Mr JOHNSON. Then I desire to know if the Prime Minister will inform the House when it is proposed to give honourable members an ooportunitv to deal with the reports of the Tariff Commission?,14
22,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,Immediately. . RABBIT-EATING ANTS ,14
23,Mr CULPIN,Unknown,"I wish, to draw the attention of the Minister of Trade and Customs to part of a letter from ment Entomologist of the Transvaal, to the Government Entomologist of New South Islanders Wales, on the subject of rabbit-eating ants. The letter was published in the Sydney Daily Telegrafh of Friday last, into and in it the writer, says, the rabbit-eating ants which have appeared in the TransvaalI have looked this question up for you, but am unable to give you the scientific name of the ant ih question. It is called the red ant by the farmers, and often causes great trouble. They infest houses, bite people severely, will carry away any sort of meat, and it has been reported that they have killed a canary in it i cage. ther, I know of a house, which has a verandah infested, and the ants are very numerous and active; the people cannot stay on the verandah on account of the bite of the insects. also worry dogs. A case has also been reported to me where these ants have caused the destruction of mice in their nests. As he promised to obtain some of these ants, and to send them to New South Wales, I ask the Minister of Trade and Customs whether steps should not be taken to prevent their introduction until we know more about them.",15
24,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I think that the best rabbit destroyer in Australia the .present time is Dr Danysz. TASMANIAN MAIL SERVICE.,15
25,Mr CAMERON,Unknown,"I wish to know the Postmaster-General when he will be able-to give"" the people of Tasmania some 1 information in - regard to the tenders for a new mail service?",15
26,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,"I hope had to look into the matter today, and shall inful inquiry. form the honourable member at the earliest possible moment. CONDENSER TELEPHONE RATES . justification  ago the Postmaster-General promised to ment. consider whether the rates for using teleone: phones on the condenser system in the. western portions of New South Wales and Queensland could be reduced. Has he yet done anvthing in the matter? . Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN - The whole subject of telephone rates is now under review, and I hope to give the honourable Commonwealth member, and other honourable gentlemen silver coinage? who have made similar inquiries, full inforestablished, mation within a week or two. NA AUSTRALIA.",15
27,Mr MAHON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"the Minister of Exthe Governternal Affairs, ufon notice I. What was the estimated number of Pacific in Australia engaged in the sugar industry at 17th December, 1901 ? 2. How many Pacific Islanders were admitted Australia to work in the sugar industry be with reference to tween 1904? 17th December, igoi, and 31st March, 3. Between 17th December, 1901, and 30th June, 1906, how many Pacific Islanders engaged in sugar growing (a) diea, (*) quitted Australia? 4. The number of Pacific Islanders due for repatriation after 31st December, 1906, and the number of Islanders who are to be permitted to remain 'in Australia ? 5. Has his attention been drawn to the stateFur- ment in the report of the Sugar Industry Labour Commission (Queensland) that "" a considerable disparity "" exists between the number of Pacific Island labourers "" subject to repatriation and the number actually known to be in the various They districts""; and to the Commission's finding that ""the presence in the State of so large a number of unemployed Islanders (which number cannot but increase) is principally due to the fact that no administrative action has been taken under the provisions of section 8 of the Pacific Island Labourers Act 1901 (Commonwealth).""? 6. What justification, if any, exists for this charge of administrative neglect against the Commonwealth Government ?",15
28,Mr DEAKIN,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"If the honourable memat ber moves for the production of the information asked for in fluestian-s 1 to 4 as a return, the Government will not oppose the motion. In answer to from question 5, my attention has been drawn to the statement referred to. It was thought undesirable to take iadministra tive action under section 8 of the Pacific Island Labourers Act until the Commission concluded its very valuable and useHacl the Commission not been apnointed, the Government would have dealt with the Kanakas who are out of employment. In reply to question 6, no exists for a charge 'of administrative neglect against the GovernOur policy is a well-considered SILVER COINAGE.",15
29,Mr CROUCH,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"the Treasurer, upon notice I. What amount of profit would come to the from the institution of Australian2. What is the reason why it has not been, and for how long will this largerevenue be lost to Australia?",15
30,Sir JOHN FORREST,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"The answers to the honourable and learned member's questions are as follow: 1. The average amount o i silver coins issued lo the Commonwealth, in the fifteen years ended 31st December, 1905, was ^'77,000 per annum. Taking this as a basis for the future, the profit to the Commonwealth will be about ^'38,000 per annum, or, roughly, one-half of the nominal value of silver coins to be issued. This does not take into consideration the profit (if any) to be derived from the withdrawal of the existing coinage, and the substitution of an Australian coinage, neither does it take into account the cost of rehabilitation of gold coinage. The amount of the existing coinage is estimated at from ^'1,200,000 to ^'2,000,000. 2. It is desired to establish a decimal system of money concurrently with an Australian silver coinage, and to facilitate that end, the Imperial authorities were asked on the 10th March, 1905, to arrange for the withdrawal of ^200,000 worth of silver coins per annum. No reply has been received, but the Treasurer during his recent' visit to England learned that the Imperial Government is unwilling to agree to the withdrawal of more than ^109,000 per annum. He found that the question of silver coinage was one of great interest to several parts of the Empire, and that it was considered advisable that it should be included in the subjects to be submitted to the Imperial Conference which is to meet in London next year. It is hoped that as a result of the Conference the profit on silver coinage will be secured to the Commonwealth on fair terms. It is not clear that as implied in the question any large revenue is being finally lost. net import into Australia of silver coins increases the profit which will accrue to the Commonwealth on the substitution of an Australian for the present currency, if the Imperial Government will agree to withdraw the latter at its nominal value. FOSTAL DESPATCHING OFFICERS.",16
31,Mr BROWN,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"for Mr Webster ) asked the Postmaster-General, u f o n notice I. Is he aware that the work of despatching officers is being performed by junior sorters in Sydney ? 2. .Is he aware that qualified despatching officers are engaged on much less responsible work? 3. Is it a fact that such work is done by the despatching officers in all States other than New South Wales? 4. Will he see that these officers are installed in the positions to which their grade entitles them ?",16
32,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"The following information has been furnished by the Acting Deputy Postmaster-General, Sydney, in connection with questions 1 and 2 : 1. Yes, despatching work is being performed by sorters pending a settlement of the question as to whether despatching officers in mail vans will be transferred to the General Post Office, or forego their title, and remain in their present positions, as some of them desiTe. Action is now in hand which should shortly result in an early settlement of the case. 2. Pending a settlement of the matter referred to in No. 1, despatching officers are engaged at other mail work which is not, however, considered less responsible. The replies to questions 3 and 4 are as follow:3. The practice in the other States is being investigated. 4. See answer to No. 1. MILITARY EXAMINATIONS.",16
33,Mr CROUCH,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"the Minister representing the Minister of Defence, ufon notice I. Is there any difference between the English examination for tactical fitness to command and the examination now established in the Commonwealth for promotion to the position of Lieut Colonel ? . 2. How long has the examination for Lieut Colonel been established in England, and is this examination superior lo or more difficult than that in Australia? 3. Was it necessary for the Inspector-General in England to pass the examination for tactical fitness to command ?",16
34,Mr DEAKIN,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"The answers to the honourable and learned member's questions are as follow :1. In the Imperial Army there are two alternative syllabi under which officers may be examined for technical fitness for command-i.e. , for promotion to rank of Lieut - Colonel-namel y :The (1) in which actual troops are employed. (2) By means of a staff ride or tour. The examination for technical fitness for command (i.e., for promotion to Lie""ut - Colonel) in the Commonwealth does not provide for an alternative syllabus-the syllabus prescribed being practically a reprint of that prescribed in (1) above referred to for the Imperial Army. Notification has recently been received that a revised syllabus has been adopted for the Imperial Army, which omits one of the subjects of the examination previously in force, but which is still retained in the Commonwealth syllabus. 2. So far as can be ascertained, the examination for Lieut - Colonel was established in England in 1899; the syllabus prescribed is not superior to or more difficult than that prescribed for Australian officers. 3. The present Inspector-General of the Imperial . Forces was promoted to the rank of Lieut - Colonel prior to the coming into force of this examination, and. consequently was not required to pass the examination for technical fitness for command, i.e., for promotion to rank of Lieut - Colonel. DUTY ON HARVESTERS.",16
35,Mr WILKS,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"for Mr Bruce SMITH) asked the Minister of Trade and Customs, ufon notice I. Whether he is aware that he (on gth August, 1905) made the following statement to the House :"" I believe in fair play, and whilst I am not sure that the right of appeal prevails, I may say at once that if the Massey-Harris Company have any reliable facts or data to bring before me I should like to have them submitted for my consideration. If they then commenced proceedings against the Government, I should be very much disposed not to place any impediment in their way, but to give them every facility. I cannot say anything fairer than that. My only desire is that there shall be a true valuation for the purposes of the Customs, and to see that fair play is meted out to all.""? 2. Does he consider that the recent attempts by the Commonwealth authorities to hinder the importers from obtaining information on the question of value for the guidance of the Courts is in harmony with the above promise?",16
36,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"The answers to the honourable ancl learned member's questions are as follow :1. Yes. 2. Yes. The action taken recently was with a view to prevent large expenditure being incurred in taking evidence in Canada, which would be rendered useless if the Court subsequently decided on the point of law that the Minister's valuation under section 160 of the Customs Act is not subject to review. As the case is now before the Court, the direction thereof is necessarily in the hands of the prof essional advisers of the Department. I may add that if honourable members will read .what I said they will find that I stated that I should be very much disposed not. to place any impediment in the way of the company. They, however, did not treat me in the way that they should have done from the beginning, and when a company antagonistic to the interests of Australia fights me I shall fight them.",17
37,Mr REID,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,Surely they must stand up for their own rights.,17
38,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,They did not give me a chance.,17
39,Mr JOHNSON,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,The Minister has done nothing but persecute them. IRON INDUSTRY.,17
40,Mr RONALD,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,"the Minister of Trade and Customs, upon notice Whether he will present to the House the Tariff Commission's report on the Iron Industiy immediately or at an early date?",17
41,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PACIFIC ISLANDERS I N,The Government is not in possession of any reports of the Tariff Commission beyond those already laid on the table of the House. I hope that we shall soon have some more. NA FREIGHTS.,17
42,Mr HIGGINS,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY,"the Minister of Trade and Customs, upon notice I . Has he information pointing to any unfair preferences or discriminations existing in railway freights since the Railway Commissioners came to an arrangement? 2. If so, can he state the instances? 3. Is it his intention to re-introduce his proposal to appoint an Inter-State Commission ?",17
43,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY,"I have seen statements in the press, but the matter has not been officially brought under my notice. I may point out that I have not the information I should have.",17
44,Mr GLYNN,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY,I could give the Minister the information.,17
45,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY,"I have on two occasions introduced a Bill for the appointment of an Inter-State Commission, and have been prevented from proceeding with it. I am not going to expose myself to a third defeat. If I find that honourable members are prepared to pass a measure of the kind I shall introduce it.",17
46,Mr GLYNN,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY,The necessary information is available.,17
47,Mr GROOM,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY,"It is being obtained now.. PREFERENTIAL BALLOT BILL. Motion (by Mr GROOM) proposed - That, leave be given to bring in a Bill for an Act to amend the law relating to Parliamentary elections.",17
48,Mr REID,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY,East Sydney) [2.56] - I should like to know whether this Bill includes some new proposal as to the exercise of the franchise?,17
49,Mr GROOM,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY,Yes .,17
50,Mr REID,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY,"Then , as a matter of justifiable comment, apart from any party motives whatever and entirely with a view to the despatch of as much practicable business as possible during the few weeks that remain to us, I wish to say that if such a controversial matter be included in the Bill the few remaining weeks of this Parliament will be frittered away in a prolonged discussion upon one of the most important and intricate questions that could be considered by any Legislature. Unless the Government know beforehand, and I do not suppose they do, that the Bill is sure to be passed, we may spend a large amount of public time in discussing it, with the subsequent mortification of knowing that no practicable result could have followed. It is not as if this matter had not already been considered, because I find that the same project was submitted to the House by the Barton Government, of which several of the present * Ministers were members. It ' was submitted to this House in 1901-1902-eightee n months before the general election, . when some time would have been afforded for making the people acquainted with it . The history of the proposal is contained in Hansard of the 23rd of July, 1902. When it came before the-Committee, the honourable member for Bland is reported, at page 14,612, to have said-this was eighteen months, and not two months, before an electionI should like to know what attitude the Government intend to assume with regard to this clause. I believe there is a very strong feeling against the contingent vote, and I , for one, am opposed to the introduction of any of these fancy systems of voting. As it is probable that at the next Federal election the two Houses will go to the country at the same time, the introduction of the contingent voting system would lead to a great deal of confusion. At the next election the two Houses will go to the countiy at the same time, and, therefore, it is proposed that there shall be two methods of voting adopted in electing the members of the respective Houses. The 'honourable member for Bland continuedI do not know that the object aimed at is of sufficient importance to justify us in unsettling the minds of the electors, and thus, perhaps, disfranchising a very large proportion of them. In certain cases the contingent vote might not attain the object aimed at. If that was so, when eighteen months were available within which to prepare the minds of electors, how much more strongly would the remarks apply now that a new and complicated method of voting is submitted within two months of an election ?",17
51,Mr MCDONALD,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY,In Queeiisland the electors were advised not to adopt the preferential voting system.,18
52,Mr REID,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY,I understand that the Labour Partv in Queensland never would use the preferential system of voting.,18
53,Mr MCDONALD,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY,It is optional there.,18
54,Mr REID,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY,"It is made optional in Queensland, and the electors have exercised the option by not expressing their preference. I submit that a system of election, which a large and important party n<3ver takes advantage of, cannot be a good and a proper one.",18
55,Mr MCDONALD,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY,"The other side, also, says that it is not a good system.",18
56,Mr REID,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY,"Then the system is doubly condemned if both sides take the same view and refrain from availing themselves of it. The honourable member for Bland went on to sayOn rare occasions, in New South Wales, a candidate has been returned by the votes of a minority; but this has happened to every party in the State, and it is not at all certain that the results would have been altered by the. operation of the contingent vote. In reply to a suggestion that it might be made mandatory, the honourable member said, "" Yes, but that might result in still greater confusion."" The present Minister of Trade and Customs was in charge of the Bill upon that occasion.",18
57,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY,Canno t the right honourable gentleman leave me alone?,18
58,Mr REID,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY,"No ; because it is. necessary that I should mention what was stated by the Minister in charge of the Bill, in reply to the statements of the honourable member for Bland. In regard to a proposal exactly similar to that which is now being suddenly introduced, the Minister made a certain statement. Honourable members know that last session the present Government introduced a Bill to amend the Electoral Act. If they had had the remotest idea of applying a new system of voting, such as that now proposed, to the next election, surely it was their duty to make provision for it in that measure, in order that honourable members and the electors might have the fullest opportunity to accustom themselves to the new idea. The matter must have been considered, because in their first measure they had a series of elaborate provisions relating to the contingent vote. This must be a mere political manoeuvre. I do not think that it has been: conceived by Ministers, because they are merely instruments in the hands of the Age. Ministers are simply moved as that organ dictates. They are under the direction of two organs, one inside and one outside of the House, and their lot cannot be a very happy one. The Age made a rabid statement as to the necessity for an exhaustive ballot. It represented that the House was frantically eager to pass an amending Bill , and that all sides would welcome such a measure. Then a cold current passed through the political atmosphere, and that measure was dropped. A demand for the contingent vote is th? next one that comes from that influential quarter. I desire to read what was stated by the Minister of Trade and Customs, who was then in charge of the former Bill, in reply to the remarks of the honourable member for Bland. He saidIn theory the contingent vole appears sound, but the method proposed here is not quite the same as that adopted in Queensland. In that State, after the first vote the names of all but the first and second candidates are struck out, and the votes are divided between the two remaining. That is in the case of single electorates. Then he went on to explain the proposal, which was probably the same as that contained in the Bill about to be introduced. He saidThe proposal in the Bill is that if there are four or five candidates, only the last one shall be struck out in the first instance, the votes belonging to the rejected candidate being distributed amongst the others. Then thelowest on the next count is struck out, and so on until only one remains. The system is somewhat complicated, and I took the trouble a day or two ago to work it out with rather astonishing results. He stated furtherI found that it was possible for the candidate who obtained the largest proportion of No. 3 votes to secure an advantage over his opponent who received the largest proportion of No. 1 votes.",18
59,Mr WATSON,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY,Was not that the Nanson system?,19
60,Mr REID,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY,"No , it was a system under which the voters were to be enabled to express their order of preference.",19
61,Mr WATSON,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY,That was a system of proportional voting in connection with the Senate elections.,19
62,Mr MCCAY,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY,The principle was exactly the same.,19
63,Mr WATSON,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY,But the method of carrying it out was very different.,19
64,Mr REID,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY,"The object was to enable the electors to indicate the order of their preference. There was no suggestion of what is called proportionate representation, as apart from the indication of the wishes of the electors on their ballot-papers.  complicate elections.",19
65,Mr REID,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY,"O r perhaps to kill time, to avoid some thorny subjects that may otherwise have to be dealt with.",19
66,Mr HIGGINS,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY,What subjects?,19
67,Mr REID,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY,"I think that there are some with which the honourable and learned member is acquainted. The Minister said I found that it was possible for the candidate who obtained the largest proportion of No. 3 votes to secure an advantage over his opponent who received the largest proportion of No. 1 votes, and consequently my faith was very much shaken in the scheme contained in this Bill . I think lhat I accurately gauge the feeling of the Committee when I say' that we ought not to persist in the proposal for the adoption of the contingent vote. And the Government withdrew that proposal. The Ministry, of which the present Prime Minister, the Treasurer, and the Minister of Trade and Customs were members, withdrew the proposal, although there was then time to secure a fair and exhaustive discussion of the principle which it involved.' But now there is a sudden and mysterious intrusion of this question. Can there be the slightest doubt that it has been introduced because the Government believe that it will serve their personal political interests? Do people think that this comet is throwp across the political horizon either to assist the Opposition or to help the Labour Party? Complications are arising in various places, and I say that to bring forward such a vital proposal-at the close of the session, and within a few weeks of the closing of the Parliament- a proposal which the thousands and tens of thousands of electors are supposed to master before the approaching election-is a most sinister act. The origin, of the' proposal itself is sufficient to condemn it. It has emanated from the office of the Melbourne Age. The exhaustive ballot system was first-projected, but that fell still-born, and now this proposal is put forward. I do not feel disposed to discuss the merits of the question, because I have always recognised some good points in the contingent vote.",19
68,Mr MALONEY,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY,Then what is the right honourable member's trouble?,19
69,Mr REID,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY,"If the honourable member will listen, he will understand. The argument which was put forward by the honourable member for Bland with reference to the confusion which would inevitably result from the adoption of a new system of voting within eighteen months of an election, becomes irresistible when applied to a proposal which is sprung upon the House and the people of Australia within a few weeks of an election. Has, the Minister of Home Affairs acted upon thi? advice of his officers, who have been assuring us that the 21st November is the earliest date upon which the general elections can be held? Have his officials been consulted as to whether the adoption of these proposals would not have the effect of delaying the elections? At this stage, perhaps, it is premature for me to seek much information, but I wish to point out that these proposals are sprung upon the electors too late. So far as I can understand, they do not apply to the elections for the Senate. But whether they do or not, the objection to be urged against them is precisely the same. If they do not apply to the Senate we shall be introducing two different systems of voting. The electors at the last election-that of 1903became accustomed to placing a cross in a square opposite the name of the particular candidate whom they favoured. If this House adopted the Government proposals within a few weeks of the next election it would place itself in this unfortunate .position: that the representatives of the people, whose duty it is to properly adjust our electoral system long before the elections take place, would expose themselves to a charge of having kept these proposals absolutely in the dark instead of dealing with them when the Electoral Bill was under consideration last session. I repeat that they have been deliberately kept in the dark in order that they might be sprung upon the House under the pressure of certain political exigencies, which are only too manifest. I protest against the remaining time of the session being taken up in their discussion. It is unreasonable to expect the electors to understand them in the short space of time that will elapse before the elections take place, and unless the Government have already got the numbers, and know that they will be able to force the Bill through, it would be folly to proceed with it. would be a matter for extreme regret if we found that, in considering the Bill, we liad sacrificed valuable time, without securing any practical result.",19
70,Mr GROOM,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY,"Darling Downs-Minister of Home Affairs) [3.5] - All I have to say in replv to the remarks of the right honourable member for East Sydney is, that the Bill has not been sprung upon the House under pressure of any political exigencv. It has been under consideration for a con1 siderable time, and it has not been introduced as the result of anv outside influence, but in the belief that it will be speedilydealt with by a Parliament which is desirous of despatching the necessary business of the session. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill presented, and read a first time. TARIFF . EXCISE DUTIES UPON SPIRITS. Resolution reported. Motion (by Mr DEAKIN) agreed toThat the resolution be recommitted. Ill Committee >of Wavs and Means: That in lieu of the duties of Excise imposed by the Excise TarilT, 1902, on Excise shall, from the 2nd day of August, 1906, at 4.30 p.m. Victorian time, be imposed upon spirits as follows :Excise Duties. Dutiable Goods. Duties. SPIRITS, viz. : 8. Spirits, n.e.i., matured by storage in wood for a period of not less than two years, per proof gallon, 14s., and on and after 17th August, 1906 ... 13s. 10. Spirits, n.e.i., per proof gallon ... 40s.",20
71,Mr DEAKIN,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY,"Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [3.8'] - The object of going into Committee of Ways and Means is to avoid the insertion in the Bill of the two dates that are named in the resolution as those from which the duties upon spirits shall commence to operate. The resolution was brought down upon the 14th inst., but we"", dealt with it upon the 15th and 16th inst., and, in view of the fact that the few transactions which took place in the interval involved no complications we think it is only a reasonable concession to date all the duties from the 17th inst., so that whatever changes have been made will all operate as from that date.

78,Mr WATSON,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY,A duty of 6d. per gallon will not seriously affect them. Sir ^ WILLIAM LYNE - I wish the Committee to clearly understand the effect of the decision which was arrived at last week. Under it the vignerons are to a duty of 6d. per gallon for this spirit.,21

It may be said by the leader of the Opposition that there would be some diffiI culty in collecting the Excise, and I repeat that if this item were struck' out altoto gether, and my proposal were adopted, the cost of carrying out the regulation would amount to about £ 2 , 0 0 0 per annum.

If in the light of the facts I have placed before them, honourable members still think it undesirable to depart from the decision arrived at last week, I cannot be blamed for the imposition of a charge or duty which is twice as much as I think ought to be",21
90,Mr GLYNN,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY,"Angas) [3.21] - I think a that the Minister has made a mistake with regard to the revenue collected in respect reof the duty of is. per gallon. On referto page 9 of the third progress report issued by the Tariff Commission, I rind that the duty has been very irregular in its results. The revenue derived from it in 1905-6 was £ 4 , 1 9 9 , whilst in 1904-5 it amounted to £ 1 2 , 6 8 6 . Another objection to the duty is that it bears unequally on the States. For instance, in 1905-6"", South Australia contributed £ 1 , 6 6 2 oue of the total of £ 4 , 1 9 9 collected in respect of the whole Commonwealth, whilst in 1904-5 she contributed £ 5 . 4 6 5 out of a total of £ 1 2 , 6 8 6. In other words, that State has always contributed nearly half the total revenue so derived. The duty was in force in South Australia prior to Federation, whilst in seme of the other States it was not.",21
91,Mr DEAKIN,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY,No duty was imposed by New South Wales.,22
92,Mr GLYNN,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY,"As it was imposed to make good the cost of inspection, we ought to regard it as an inspection duty. The Government, I understand, propose that, instead of there being an absolute duty of ""6d. per gallon, there should be a charge to cover the cost of inspection, which in no case should exceed 6d. per gallon.",22
93,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY,That is exactly what I . desire.,22
94,Mr GLYNN,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY,"I support the Minister's proposal. H a d the honourable gentleman elaborated the argument, which he based on the figures presented by his Department, he might have shown that the duty is not imposed for revenue purposes, and is open to the objection that it is comparatively small, while it is at the same time unequal in its incidence on all the States. The proposal, therefore, to substitute a maximum charge of 6d. per gallon to cover the cost of inspection is a fair one. The duty of is. per gallon was particularly heavy in relation, to the cost of production and largely interfered with the competition of Australian wines with those of the outside world. That remark will apply, to some extent, to the duty of 6d. per gallon now imposed. If the Minister proposes to reconsider the item in the light of these additional facts, I shall be prepared to support him.",22
95,Mr REID,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY,East Sydney) [3.25] - I would suggest that when the Bill is before us we shall have a fair opportunity to reconsider any question arising out of this matter.,22

98,Mr BROWN,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY,"Canobolas) [3.32] There is one subject which has been touched on during the debate upon which I particularly desire to express my opinions, and that is the need for increasing our population. The position of the Commonwealth in regard to population is not as healthy as the well-wishers of Australia desire, because for some time past there has not been a material excess of Immigrants over emigrants. In view of the latent possibilities of wealth and production that we possess, the fact that immigrants are not being attracted"" to our shores is one that in vites consideration. I do not think it will be contended that even the older settled States have reached the limits of their possibilities in regard to the support of population. Even in Victoria, where there has been a decrease, there are enormous possibilities for the support of a much larger population than the State now possesses. The only conclusion to be drawn from the present state of affairs is that the conditions offered to workers here are not inviting, and before we can hope to attract immigrants, we must take means to induce those who are here to remain; because our population is not likely to increase so long as there is a continuous drain of emigrants. To provide a remedy for the present state of affairs, the co-operation of the States must be secured, and I am pleased to know that special attention is being given to the subject by the States authorities. need for a larger population is recognised, and the Titeasurer has promised to second the efforts of the States in attracting people to our shores. There are now about 4,000,000 souls in the Commonwealth, while our national debt is something like £236,000,000, the annual interest upon it amounting to between £8,000,000 £9,000,000. In order to lessen the burden of this indebtedness^ we should endeavour to bring about the presence here of .1 larger number of persons to share it, while a larger population is necessary also for the progress and development of the country, and the production of wealth. There a:ie two or three methods by which we might increase our population. might, in the first place, draw upon the coloured peoples of the islands of the< Pacific, as has been done in the past. Chinese were first introduced into Australia to provide cheap labour, whereby production might be increased', and the presence of the Kanakas on, the sugar fields of Queensland is to be accounted for in the same way. . But, whilst there are a number who would like to see Australia developed by these means, the verdict of the Commonwealth is against it, the electors as a whole having emphatically for a white Australia. Our population might be increased, in the second place, by the introduction of pauper labour from Europe. Pauperism, however, has always a tendency to debase and demoralise, and the experience of America is not likely to make us ready to follow her example by the introduction of paupers. not condemn those who are poor, and, no doubt, even in the ranks of the very poor are to be found men and women who, given reasonable opportunities, could be converted into good citizens. But those who come to our shores must have energy and grit, and should possess some little means, if they are to make a favourable Mr Brown. start. The honourable member for Darling, when speaking in this debate, quoted a telegram from New Zealand which seems to indicate that that country is having some experience in connection with the introduction of 'paupers. Recognising the need for increasing her population, she has encouraged immigration, but, according to the information put before us by him, immigrants have recently arrived there who had to be provided, on arrival, with clothes and blankets and the means of subThe sistence. I do not think that the people of the Commonwealth wish to draw largely from the pauper populations of the old world, and, particularly, not from the pauper populations of Europe. We should prefer people of the race from which we have sprung-good' , vigorous!, healthy stock, who will be able to help to bear and the burdens of nation building,. We .are, however, prepared to welcome all desirable immigrants, whether from Great Britain or from other European countries. The present position of stagnation in regard to our population must excite keen consideration. In the view of some honourable members, much of the legislation of New Zealand of recent years has been obWe jectionable because of its socialistic or humanitarian character, but, despite that fact, the population of the colony during the last five years has, according to the statisticians, in creased by 43,000, while the population of the Commonwealth has within the same period increased by only 3,000. I know that a good deal of the New Zealand increase is to be accounted for by emigration from Australia, young men, natives of the State from which I come, and of other States, who have been discouraged and voted become tired in their efforts tb secure employment in Australia which would give them an opportunity to make a decent living here, having gone to New Zealand to better themselves. Generally, they have bettered themselves by doing so, and the encouraging reports which they have sent to their friends have induced I do others to follow their example. I find by reference to Coghlan that during the decade from 1882 to 1891, when employment and wealth production were not so restricted as at present, we added to our population by excess of immigration over emigration 374,094. In the foi-, lcwing decade our gain by the excess of immigration over emigration was only 2,377 --This was a very remarkable fallqualified ing off. In regard to this Coghlan saysI f the result of the last twelve years pared, it will be seen that there was an both from Victoria and South Australia, the former losing 145,227, and the latter 23,222 excess of emigration, while Tasmania also 6,119 from the same source. Whilst people move about from one State to another, because they conceive that can better their position, no great concern need be felt. The inducements, offered to persons born in a State to leave it must be very considerable. must not only have a hope, but a reasonable assumption, that they will be able to improve their position, andi need not begrudge Western Australia increase of population at the expense the other Slates. But when population lost to the Commonwealth as a wholewhen our people are leaving us to settle in New Zealand, South America, South our Africa, or the United States-the matter for their energy. becomes very serious. I gather that the case of New South Wales, 500 or more persons have gone to Great Britain tunes. than have arrived from the old country.",22
99,Mr LONSDALE,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY,They are merely traby the late Mr Richard Seddon. vellers.,24
100,Mr BROWN,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY,"That may be so, but the honourable member must admit that the balance ought to be the other way. We should be drawing people from the country, and the addition to our populamonwealth, tion should more than compensate us for any loss brought about by the departure of travellers from our shores. figures emphasize my point that we are not attracting population from Great Britain ancl elsewhere to the extent that we should be doing.",24
101,Mr CAMERON,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY,That is attributable our legislation.,24
102,Mr BROWN,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY,"I ""join issue with the honourable member.. Our legislation has not advanced upon socialistic lines to same extent as that of New Zealand, yet New Zealand has gained 43,000 excess of immigration over emigration, whilst we have added to our population only a miserable 3,000.",24
103,Mr LONSDALE,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY,Was that difference due to the legislation passed in New Zealand?,24
104,Mr BROWN,PREFERENTIAL RAILWAY,"The legislation passed in New Zealand has not prevented influx of population. Those who are best to express an opinion state that the socialistic legislation of New Zealand be comhas tended to encourage immigration, and exodus that otherwise New Zealand would have been in the same state of stagnation as is by the Commonwealth. That brings me to lost another point. Why do our young men who are born and bred in Australia, after having made every effort to better themthey selves here, leave for New Zealand and other'parts of the world? I contend that the cause is to be found in the fact that the natural opportunities that should be They presented to them are being denied. When plenty of land was available, and our mineral resources could be exploited withwe out undue restriction, immigrants were an attracted here. Now, however, that most of of our lands have passed into the hands is of a few persons, and our mineral resources are also under the control of monopolists, it is impossible for the bulk of population to find here a suitable outlet The restrictions I v in which they are hedged about impel 600 them to go elsewhere to try their forI had the privilege of listening to the last semi-public address delivered He then dealt with this very subject, and showed to what extent New Zealand ha'd been able to solve the problem. He did not claim that that colony had been completely successful, but he contended that old she had done much more than the Comand that the line of progress lay in the direction of making available to the masses the great natural opportuThese nities presented by the country. He said in effect, "" Land is life-. Those who own the land have a monopoly of the life-blood of the people."" No truer words were ever uttered. Those who hold the land deterto mine the conditions under which the people have to live, and it is owing to the extent to which the best and most easilv accessible lands in all the States have been monopolized that our population does not in the crease. This matter has been dealt with and by Mr Rider Haggard, who, although by most generally known as a writer of fiction, has given considerable attention to the .question of land settlement, and has been considered worthy to be appointed by the British Government to report upon it, not only in the British Empire, but in the United States, on the Continent, and elsewhere. He savs that an some people have an idea that land is simply a luxury-somethin g which a rich man only should own, and which should be devoted to pleasure grounds and game preserves. He points out, however, that the land is meant to grow food, and that, more than that, it is intended to grow men and women. My contention is that our stagnation in the matter of population is due to the monopoly of the best lands of the Commonwealth. I have compiled a table showing how the lands of New South Wales are held. I have taken my data fiom the latest statistics in the Year-Book of New South Wales, 1904-5, edited by Mr H all , the Government Statistician. In New South Wales, there are 60,427 holdings qf 400 acres and under, which embrace a total area of 5,500,000 acres. Of this area about 824,000 acres, or about 14 per cent., is cultivated. Of holdings NA Size of Holding. Number of 1 to 400 acres 401 to 1,000 acres. . . 1,001 to 10,000 ... 10,001 and upwards Totals ... Holdings under 1,000 acres total 69,437, having cent, of area of State ; the cultivated area being area alienated. Holdings of over 1,000 acres total 6,234, having cent, of area of State ; the cultivated area being alienated. One remarkable feature of that table is that 722 holdings embrace about one-half of the total area which has been alienated. A point which is made in this connection is that whilst the number of this! particular class of holdings is decreasing, their area is increasing, thus proving that the monopoly of the land by the few is steadily - growing. As evidencing how this state - of affairs has been brought about, I would direct attention tb the fact that whereas during the twenty-three years from 1882 to 1905 the land, selected .18,481,880 acres, the land' in which complete transfers were effected 44,352,613 acres. In other word's, during'that period, there were 25,870,000 acres more transferred than were required for Mr Brown. of upwards of 400 acres, and less than 1,000 acres, there are 9,000 holdings, embracing 5,750,000 acres, of which 658,000 acres are under cultivation. There are 722 holdings which embrace 23,000,000 acres, of which only 300,000, or 1.31 per cent, of the total area, are under cultivation.",24
105,Mr CAMERON,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION OF THE ALIENATED,How much of that land is . fit for cultivation ?,25
106,Mr BROWN,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION OF THE ALIENATED,"A very considerable area. Only 1,500,000 acres are devoted to wheat cultivation, in New South Wales, whereas Coghlan tells us that there are at least 20,000,000 acres of land in New South Wales suitable for the growth of that product. Therefore, a large proportion of the best land in the State is still being devoted to pastoral purposes. The table from which I have quoted is as f o llows :RURAL LAUD IN NEW SOUTH WALES, 1904-5. Area Cultivated. Total Area Proportion to Holdings. Alienated. Area ot State. Total Area. Proportion to Area Alienated. Acres. Percentage. Acres.

This evil, I maintain, is still increasing, ""despite the more drastic measures relating to land legislation, which have since been enacted. In this connection, I am free to admit that the right honourable member for East Sydney, when he was Premier of New South Wales, in 1895, w as instrumental in placing upon the statute-book an Act which put a stop to a considerable amount of trafficking in land in the form of dummying, &c. He instiaggregated tained a system under which a longer occupancy was required before a transfer could be effected, and he also introduced a embraced permanent form of settlement known ' as "" homestead selections,"" under which a transfer could be made only to a residential holder. But despite this legislation, I find, from Mr Hall's Official Year-Book of New South Wales, that between 1900 and 1904- a period of five years-the area selected was only 2,246,712 acres, whereas the area transferred was 8,654,736 acres, There was thus a surplus of transferred land as against land acquired fornew settlement, of 6,410,024 acres. The number of holdings transferred during that period was 60,069, < the number of new holdings created was 11,905, so that land settlement as represented by .separate holdings, showed a decrease of 48,1.64. In order that honourable members may be satisfied that the statements which I have presented are in accordance with facts, I will read the following quotation from Mr. Hall's latest statisticsA comparison of the areas dealt with in the following table shows how fast the original ditional purchasers of Crown lands are possessing themselves of their holdings, the area selected does not exhibit a tendency to increase at anything like the same rate. examination of the table reveals the fact that in since 1SS2 there have been 44,352,613 acres of Australia. conditional purchases transferred, as against unhealthy state of affairs. 18,481,880 acres applied for- a difference of 25,870,733 acres, which have, to a very large tent gone to increase the large estates, tinctly to the detriment of healthy settlement. That quotation will be found upon 82 of The Official Year-Book of New deal South Wales for 1904-5. To-day, instead of there being something like 200,000 settlers in New South Wales, assisting develop her natural resources, there are only some 75,000. The total holdings of that State-rural , urban, and others-ar e less than 200.000. In his statistics, Coghlan says that the land-holders approximately, 178,000. What is responsible for this conditions of affairs? First of all, settlement had to take place upon territory in which vested interests had' established. The country was held under pastoral leases, and, upon their expiry, these leases were made available for indiscriminate settlement. Further, were made available under terms. For instance, a specific amount had to be paid by the settler, who was also required to pay survey fees, and to comply with improvement conditions, which conwealth siderably increased his outlay. then called upon to pay what was equivaheading, lent to 9d. or is. per acre per annum as rent for his holding. But it was soon covered that increased population meant creased land values, and it is the increased value which is impaited to lands by the presence of population that writers of political economy designate the ""unearned increment."" It was quickly recognised that if large holdings could be secured they would' represent a good investment. Thus the squatter fought the selector in the hope that he would be able to acquire the whole of the territory available, and to blossom forth into the position which is occupied a n c by the landlord in the old country. He had many advantages, including a sympathetic Parliament and administration. But, despite these advantages, the fight was too severe for him. Thus it came to pass that the banks invested indirectly in the unearned increments in the various States, but finally the burden became too heavy for them to bear, and the result was the financial crisis that we experienced fifteen years conago. That led to the transfer of these indisterests to the large investors in the old whilst world. So that today the unearned inAn crement in the different States is largely the hands of persons outside of That, I contend, is a most It is Lad exenough, to have to contend with the cur.se disof landlordism when we are dealing with an individual who is part and parcel of our population, but the position is much page worse when we axe called upon to with a landlord who, as the' saying is, "" has no body to be kicked and no soul to be damned."" The real development of to Australia has been retarded by an inordinate desire to invest in the unearned increment. Millions sterling has been invested in the purchase of land titles instead of in the development of that land, with a view number to making it productive.",25
107,Sir JOHN FORREST,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION OF THE ALIENATED,"Fro m the honourable member's Temarks, one would think been that the producers on the land were producing nothing, instead of producing commodities worth £120,000,000 annually. they Mr BROWN - I hope that my remarks harsh will not bear that interpretation. We are producing largely, but that production is in the hands of the few who own our lands. My contention is that the distribution of in a country is largely determined He was by the distribution of its land. Under this I would invite the attention of the Treasurer to some figures which I have exdistracted from the Official Year-Book of New inSouth Wales for 1904-5. I find that in that State there are 749,000 holders of something like £375,000,000 worth of property. The distribution of that wealth lowing table:NA Category. £50,000 and over ... £25,000 to £50,000 ... £5.000 to £25,000 ... £200 to £5,000 Under £200 ... Without Property ... Totals Mr Hall states upon page 543Hence it would appear that 1,004 persons, or 0.13 per cent, (one-eighth of one), own property ^'130,912,700, or 34.84 per cent, of the whole private wealth of the State, and 2,134 persons hold ^169,984,500, or 45.21 per cent, of the total. Probably half the entire property of the State is in the hands of not more than 3,000 persons. According to. the foregoing table, 1,004 persons, or thirteen in every 10,000, own from £50,000 worth of property, and upwards; 10,853 persons-o r 144 per 10,000 iof the population-hol d property of the value of £5,000 and upwards, and their wealth is £259,674,400, representing 69.11 per cent, of the property belonging to those coming within this category.",26
108,Mr TUDOR,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,Does that return refer only to New South Wales?,27
109,Mr BROWN,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"Yes . My illustrations are mainly drawn from the conditions of my own State. In 1904 there were 749,300 adults in New South Wales, and according to this return there axe 195,800 owners of wealth, whilst there are no less than 553,466 who have no accumulation of property whatever.

I should like honourable members to say whether these non-property holders are all thriftless, and make no effort to help themselves. Can it be said that the 195,800 owners of wealth in New South Wales represent all the energy and intelligence of the State?

Indeed, I think I may very properly claim that of the 553,000 persons who do not own property in New South Wales only a very small percentage does not contribute anything towards the creation of the wealth of that State; the manual labour involved in building up the enormous wealth to which I have referred is largely provided by this vast body of non-property holders. The secret of the position is that these men are wage-earners, who are living from hand to mouth, and are helping to create that monopoly of wealth which is concentrated in the hands of the few who are able to take advantage of natural opportunities. This brings me to the question of the development of Canada. Some honourable members have pointed out that the Dominion has been developed on lines that we ought to follow. Twenty years ago only - 250,000 acres were under wheat in Canada, and the yield' from that area was 'about i,2oo_,ooo bushels. In I 9°3-4> however, the total area under wheat had increased to 4,000,000 acres, and the yield was 110,000,000 bushels. 0 0 0 Immigration, meantime, increased in proportion to the increase in the area under cultivation. In 1893, the total number of immigrants to Canada was 10,680, and ten years later-in 1903-this number, had increased to 124,653. Since then ithe increase in immigration has been proportionately large. The secret of Canada's enormous development is that she has opened up her lands to those who are willing to settle on them. She invites desirable emigrants from the old world, and - gives, them reasonable opportunities to produce wealth for themselves. She does not invite them to her shores to work under conditions of semi-starvation-to pick up an odd job here and there-sh e finds land for them to settle on.",27
110,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,The Canadian Government does not threaten to nationalize the land.,28
111,Mr BROWN,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"I shall have something to say presently with regard to that point. For about six months out of every twelve the climate is so severe in Canada that her fertile lands cannot be used, as similar lands in Australia are used, for stock-raising purposes. There the stock-raising industry must be carried on at a cost far greater than is involved under Australian conditions!; the stock cannot be allowed to run at large all the year round, and, therefore, special attention has to be devoted to the cultivation of the soil. The honourable member for Franklin says that land nationalization has not been threatened in the Dominion. I suppose that the honourable member will admit that Mr J. S-. Lark, the Canadian Commissioner in Australia, is am, authority with respect to the lands of the Dominion, and that he is also fairly (familiar with the land laws of Australia. In an address which he delivered some time ago in Sydney, Mr Lark saidIn Canada the Government taxed the land, which made it impossible for persons to hold land for speculative purposes, but here they taxed the man on the land. There was a great difference between the two systems. All land should be brought down to its value as a producing clement. As far as he had been able to ascertain, the system followed here was an admirable one for keeping the people off the land. The results of that system bave amply borne out his conclusion.",28
112,Mr LONSDALE,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,Is not the Canadian tax a tax on improvements?,28
113,Mr BROWN,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,I am not an authority on Canadian land taxation.,28
114,Mr LONSDALE,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"The honourable member ought, to be aware that the Canadian tax is not upon, unimproved land values.",28
115,Mr BROWN,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"I am simply quoting the statement of a gentleman who may - fairly be regarded as an authority: on this question. He tells us that in Canada the Government tax the land in such a way that it is impossible for any one to hold it for speculative purposes. Such a tax will prove the solution of the land problem cf Australia. We must not allow persons to invest in land merely for the purpose of holding it for a rise-to secure the unearned increment brought about by increased population and national expenditure.. Land should be held for productive purposes, and every facility should be 'given those who go on the soil to bring it into use. Unfortunately, large areas of our lands are kept out of use, being held purely for speculative purposes. Those who control the, land control the wealth production of the people, with the result that that wealth is unduly concentrated in the hands of the few. I do not think that the honourable member for New England will contend that the 550,000 non-property owners of New South ,Wales are nonworkers. He will not say that they have not contributed to the wealth of the community. I have here a very remarkable letter relating to the industrial conditions at present obtaining in Australia. A little whileago there was a rapid rise in the value of rabbitskins and rabbits for export purposes, with the result that a number of persons, who had been unable for a long time to earn a fair wage, availed themselves of the new avenue of employment thus opened up, and secured handsome returns from the rabbittrapping industry.",28
116,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,Some of them threw up very good billets.,28
117,Mr BROWN,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"They did so in order that they might engage in a more lucrative calling. If a man can better himself by leaving his usual employment, he is generally ready to do so. What was the result of the improvement in the rabbit-trapping industry? Many families who had been on the verge of starvation suddenly found themselves able to secure some of the comforts of life, and to live under brighter and happier conditions. Small provincial towns also found that there was an increase in the amount of money in circulation, and small shopkeepers, and others, were thus benefited by the industry. But this state of things did not long continue. Owing to various causes, the price of 'rabbits went down, with the result that several, avenues of employment were closed, and that there was a gradual return to the state of affairs previously prevailing. I now propose to read a letter claimed to have been issued by an influential association representing the pastoralists of New South Wales. ter was as follows : Private and Confidential. The Pastoralists' Union of New Soutli Wales (Industrial Union of Employers), IMPORTANT NOTICE TO MEMBERS. Hoskins' Buildings, Spiing-street, Dear Sir,- , With the advent of the shearing season, the scarcity of shearing labour has become so pronounced that the executive deem it desirable to again call your serious attention to the urgent need which exists for making every possible effort to improve the supply. While emphasising their previous recommendations on this subject, the executive desire to urge that members should also, as far as possible, refrain from entering into fresh contracts for fencing, tank-sinking, & c , and should otherwise reduce casual station work to the lowest limits during the shearing months. The measures which members are asked to adopt for making labour available for shearing purposes, and for increasing the existing supply, are :1. To discontinue rabbit trapping. 2. To reduce contract and casual station work to a minimum during the shearing months. 3. To fill at least one-fifth of their pens with learners. Tn regard to rabbit trapping, the, general ing of those who have had experience of the matter is that trapping is not an effective method of destruction, and that therefore in your own interest you should not allow it on your run. You are, however, only asked to disallow it during the months of July, August, and September. It is sincerely hoped that you will carry out these recommendations for the general good, even if your own immediate requirements do not necessitate their adoption. The object of union is to secure concerted action for mutual benefit, and in the present circumstances such concerted action is specially requisite. It should be remembered, too, that the difficulties now being experienced by others are sure, unless coped with, to extend to you sooner or later, and that therefore by assisting your fellow members now, you will be' ultimately benefiting yourself. Yours faithfully, That letter shows that concerted action is proposed to be taken by those controlling the natural means of production in New South Wales, to limit the opportunities of the great mass of the workers for making a living under the most favourable conditions, so that cheap labour may be secured to the pastoral industry.",28
118,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,Shearin g is cheap labour.,29

[REPRESENTATIVES.] Budget. The let- being .attempted to close other avenues of employment in the country as much as possible. Those who hold what the late Mr. Seddon declared to be a monopoly in the life-blood of the people are organizing to retain the production of wealth for themselves. It is partly in consequence of Sydney, i6th July, 1906. these attempts that the wealth of Australia is in the hands of a few, the mass of the people living from hand to mouth, unable, despite all their efforts, to accumulate. As I have shown, the wealth of New South Wales is ih the hands of 195,800 persons, while 553,500 persons possess no wealth at all. It has been said that the proposal of the Labour Party for remedving this evil state of things by the imposition cf a land value tax is confiscation, and robben. The honourable member for Grampians recognises that the Commonwealth is suffering for want of population, and, to meet the difficulty, proposes that the States should repurchase annually 1,000,000 acres, to be ultimately divided amongst suitable immigrants, and, in the meanwhile, to be leased to the present owners. He suggests that the land be purchased at feelits present price, I presume to prevent the expenditure of large sums in anticipation of an increase in price. But, before we can make arrangements for possible immigrants, we must devise means for providing our own people with land. In my electorate there are young men, farmers' sons, who know what hard work is, and are not afraid of it, who cannot discover reasonable opportunities for providing themselves with homes. Most of the Crown land of the State has been parted with under conditions which are not creditable to those who have had the control of affairs there, so that only a very limited area is now available, and when any of that area is thrown open, there are almost JOHN MAIR, Secretary. as many applicants for it as there are subscribers to a Tattersall's sweep. Men are travelling all over the State, inspecting land likely to be thrown openj and balloting for it, only to become heartbroken on discovering that they are frittering; away what little means they have in a fruitless effort. These are the men for whose wants we should provide before setting aside land for possible immigrants. not",29

121,Mr BROWN,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"I am in sympathy with honourable member; but I think that 1,000,000 acres will be required to provide land for our own people, so that, if any provision is to be made for immigrants, the purchase of more than 1,000,000 acres will be necessary.",29
122,Mr REID,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"I am horrified at the neglect of duty on the part of honourable members. Although this is the Budget debate, there are only ten or eleven in the Chamber. [Quorum formed.-\",30
123,Mr BROWN,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"The experience of New South Wales in regard to the repurchasing of estates has not been entirely satisfactory. When the Government had power to purchase from those who were ready to sell, it was found that they could not obtain suitable land at reasonable prices, and, with a great deal of trouble, legislation was enacted' giving them the right of compulsory purchase. At least one estate has been purchased under that power, and, while some authorities say that the purchase was a good bargain for the Government, the fact that the whole of the land has not been applied for, notwithstanding the large demand for land in the State, shows, that, it is not as desirable as it might be, while a very unpleasant feature about the transaction is that some thousands of pounds were paid in commission to private agents, presumably to bring about the purchase. An area of 1,000,000 acres per annum would not be enough to meet the requirements of both our own population and' immigrants, and I understand that the honourable member for Grampians now suggests the purchase of 5,000,000 acres. But what would be the state of the land market if 5,000,000 acres were annually being purchased by the Government?",30
124,Mr SKENE,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,Lan d would cheaper.,30
125,Mr BROWN,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"If it became cheaper, that would be in contradiction to the general rule that as demand increases prices rise. I think that those who land would ask higher prices for it, and therefore those among whom it was subsefor quently divided would probably have pay for it at rates which would make their occupation of it unremunerative, or profitable than the occupation of land remote. I wish to get rid of the idea which seems to be held by some that the Labour Party desire to tax the industry of those on the land. Our proposed taxafect tion will f all , not upon the improvements of a holding, but upon the unearned crement given to it by the increase of lation, and the development of the try. Thus we shall be taxing a value which the owner has not himself created, with the intention of lessening the incentive to invest money in land merely for speculative purposes, and to increase the opportunities of those who desire to get possession of it for the purpose of developing it . Some honourable members object very strongly to the distinction made between large holdings and small ones, but I would point out that the leader of the Opposition was responsible for the introduction of similar legislation into the New South Wales Parliament. The Bill providing for a tax on land values in New South Wales was based upon exactly the same principle that underlies the proposal of the Labour Party, the only difference being that the New South Wales tax is not of a progressive character. It provided - for *the exemption of land of an improved value of £ 2 4 0 . and a number of other exemptions were also made. Although we had a very hard fight to get that measure placed upon the statute-lbook, we heard nothing said about confiscation or the unfairness of the exemptions. There are 178,000 land-holders in New South Wales, whereas only 41,000 pay the land tax. According to the latest statistics, it is estimated that the unimproved value of the land in New South Wales is £129,178,000. The land, which is free from taxation under the exemption of £ 2 4 0 , represents a value of £26,280,000 . There are mortgage exemptions amounting to £16,800,000, and conditional purchase balances which are exempted, represent £ 9 , 2 9 8 , 0 0 0, or a total of exemptions amounting to £52.378,000. Yet we heard nothing about become the inequality of the proposed tax, or of any proposal to confiscate private lands.",30
126,Mr TOHNSON,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"We heard enough about it outside of Parliament, even if nothing own was heard inside the Legislature.",30
127,Mr MCLEAN,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"That tax was imposed revenue purposes, whereas the Labour to Partv propose to attack the his estates. 1",30
128,Mr BROWN,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"The New South Wales less measure was advocated on other grounds 1 more than that it would produce revenue, in the same way that the Labour Party claim that the proposed progressive land tax, in addition to producing revenue, will have the efof breaking up the big estates. It will not impose a tax upon improvements, or upon inlabour and industry, but will make the populand-holder give some returnfor the value counwhich accrues from the growth, of the community. We hope that to this extent it will discourage land monopoly, which is sucking the life blood out of the people, and is concentrating the wealth of the community in the hands of a comparative few. The great mass of the people are unable to accumulate wealth, and our population is practically at a stand-still. If this condition of affairs is to be altered we must get rid of land monopoly; - we must present facilities for settlement of such a character that our young men will stay here, and that immigrants will be attracted from other parts of the world. I contend that the proposal of the Labour party will operate in that direction. have endeavoured to solve the problem which lies before us, which is not of our own making, and it is for those who object to our solution to submit some better proposal.

We are endeavouring to deal with the nroblem, because we wish to see the country develop. We do not desire that the srreat mass of our people should be condemned to sweated poverty. may be wrong in the policy that we have foreshadowed, but if so, it is for those who oppose us to suggest something better I am not tied down to any particular proposal, but shall gladlv give my support to the best that is brought forward.

129,Mr DAVIDTHOMSON,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"Capricornia) [4.54] - I congratulate the Treasurer upon the frankness which characterizes his Budget statement. I have nothing whatever to say against what has been done in the past. I think that the levenue of the Commonwealth is in a very satisfactory condition, and I hope that it will continue so. I am afraid, however, that if some of the proposals submitted to us are carried into effect, we shall f all upon evil days. The proposed penny scheme would' result in a loss of £ 3 0 0 per annum, which would be keenly felt by those States which already have to meet a large deficiency. Queensland could not afford to have ,£12,750 her present annual deficiency which will amount to £ 1 1 4 , 0 0 0 per annum. hold that the Commonwealth should conduct its business upon commercial lines, and make the revenue meet the expenditure. There is no reason why our revenue should' be reduced and our expenditure increased at the same time. South Australia seems to have conducted her affairs upon common-sense lines. In .that State the 2d. postage applies to all parts, and residents in the towns have no advantage over those who live in the country. Why should those who reside in the large centres of population be specially favoured? Those who live in the towns do not make the country, but on the other hand the residents in cities look to the country to sustain them. South AusWe tralia has managed to make her postal system pay its way, and I think that the Commonwealth should' work upon similar lines. If our postal revenue is reduced we shall have a smaller amount to return to the States, and so far as Queensland is concerned, I strongly object to the Treasurer'sproposal. No one has clamoured for the proposed change. Those who are now able to send a letter from Thursday Island to the furthermost part of Western Australia for 2d. think that they are being fairly treated, and I do not see the necessity for the proposed reduction. The Chambers of Commerce, the members of We which would derive the greatest benefit from the introduction of the penny postage system, have not asked for it, and it is - safe to presume that they are satisfied with the present arrangements. - Mr Frazer - This is the only proposal made in this Parliament to which the Chambers of Commerce have not objected.",31
130,Mr DAVID THOMSON,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"Exactly . Penny postage may suit Victoria very well, because her territory is compact, and railways are fairly well distributed throughout that State. She can carry on her postal services at comparatively small expense, because she has not to make provision for the conveyance of her mails by coaches to anything like the same extent that is found to be necessary in New South Wales.. Queensland, and other postage States. Victoria has found it possible to , 0 0 0 carry on a penny postage system within her own borders with success-althoug h some years ago the 2d. postage was restored because it was not considered - deadded to sirable to continue the penny postage whilst the revenue was falling. I strongly I object to the proposed change, and I shall vote against it. A large number of schemes have been advocated in connection with the proposed transfer of the States debts. It seems to me that the Treasurer's proposals are as sound as any, and I think that the sooner we substitute another system for that now in operation under the Braddon section, the better it will be for all concerned. I see how the Commonwealth offer any better security to bond-holders than that now afforded by the States. Our bond-holders, it seems to me, can obtain quite as good a security from the States as they can from the Commonwealth. The latter has absolutely nothing upon which it can levy, except its one-fourth of the receipts from Customs and Excise. Consequently I fail to see that the Commonwealth is in a position to borrow money more cheaply than it can be borrowedi by the States. fied that if the latter wished to convert their loans, and to reduce them to 3 per cents., 'they would have just as much chance of being successful as would the Commonwealth. In my judgment there is no necessity for taking over the States debts, because if that were undertaken, although the Commonwealth would have to carry the baby, the States would have to .carry the feeding Lottie. I do not know that ar.y of the schemes which have been submitted in this connection' are any better or any worse than that outlined by the Treasurer. Indeed , I am inclined to think that the advantage, if any, rests with the Treasurer's proposals. Upon Friday last the honourable member for Denison. delivered a wailing speech in this Housea speech which reminded me of a black frin crying over a dead piccaninny. He endeavoured to show ,that Tasmania had lost considerably in connection with the sugar duties. I wish to prove that that State has been very fairly dealt with. gret that an impression seems to have got abroad that none of the States except Queensland derive any 'benefit from the operation of those duties.",31
131,Mr REID,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,Is this an electioneering speech ?,32
132,Mr DAVID THOMSON,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"No. would remind the right honourable member that I am always present to discharge my duties. I clo not travel all over Australia delivering electioneering speeches as do some honourable members, t wish to prove that Queensland! has been no more favoured hy the operation of the sugar duties than has any other State. In this connection I desire to show the amounts which the various States have received by way of Excise duty after the bounty has been paid. The amount received by New South Wales was £ 6 6 6 , 0 7 2 ; by Victoria, £ 2 9 7 , 8 0 2 ; Queensland, £ 2 4 9 , 3 1 2 ; South Australia, do not - .33:57 5; Western Australia, £ 7 1 , 8 5 6, t < can in addition to a revenue of £ 1 1 0 , 0 0 0 which was derived from the import duty; and Tasmania, £ 6 9 , 5 5 6 . In 1905, New South Wales received £ 1 2 8 , 9 4 3 ; Victoria, £ 1 0 4 , 5 8 9 ; Queensland, £ 7 8 , 7 4 1 ; South Australia. £ 3 2 , 1 0 2 ; Western Australia, £ 2 2 , 0 3 1 ; and Tasmania, £ 2 1 , 4 5 3 . For a number of years South Australia has been importing sugar, and consequently its people have been contributing to her revenue to the extent of £ 6 per ton. The same remark is applicable to Western AusI am satis- tralia and Victoria. Queensland and New South Wales are the only two States which have been exclusively using Australian sugar. When, honourable members examine these figures they will find that the other States have received a considerable amount of revenue from the operation of the Excise duty. That duty is credited to each State, and the bounty is paid out of it. If there had been no Excise duty in operation they would have received so much Jess revenue. It is a matter for extreme regret that some honourable members will continue to assert that Queensland has bene1 fited from the operation of the sugar duties more than has any other State. As a matter of fact, she has lost more than has anv other State. At the present time, the retail price of sugar in London is 2d. per l b . ; in Paris, it is 3 d . ; in Berlin, 2^-d.; in Svdney, 2^d.; in Melbourne, from 2^d. to 2 ^ . . ;- ir. South Australia, 2 d . ; L in Brisbane, 2^d.; and in Perth, 3d. I do not know that it is quite I re- fair to quote what was the price of that article in Western Australia prior to Federation. There it was admitted free, and its retail price was ffo m 4d. to 5d. per lb. The figures which I have quoted do not show that there has been any increase in the price of sugar consequent upon the operation of the Excise I duty. Further, I contend that the bounty is not paid by the consumer. If there were no Excise levied, and there were no bounty in operation, the price of sugar would be the same as it is today. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company controls that. In Queensland the price of that commodity at the present time is higher than it has been for many years. Prior to Federation, sugar could be purchased for nearly Jd. per lb. less than it can be purchased today. That is due to the fact that before the advent of Federation the production o£ that article had overtaken local consumption. Consequently, the Queensland consumer is worse off now than he has ever been. Nevertheless, he does not complain. The only States which urge any complaint in this connection are Western Australia, South Australia, and Tasmania. They are always harping upon the sugar duties.",32
133,Mr CAMERON,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,We can distinguish between facts and mere assertions.,33
134,Mr DAVID THOMSON,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"On e could not knock a fact into a head like that possessed by the honourable member. Since Federation, Queensland has lost £ 2 , 6 0 8 , 2 08 in revenue, as compared with the amount which she would have derived under her old State Tariff. She has received fro m the Commonwealth £ 4 1 , 0 8 3 less than her three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue, whereas New South Wales has received £2,203,393 more than her three-fourths, Victoria £1,409,705 more. South Australia £ 4 5 0 , 1 1 5 more. Western Australia £ 1 , 0 7 7 ^ 3 5 more, and Tasmania £133,628 more.",33
135,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,That would be unconstitutional.,33
136,Mr DAVID THOMSON,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"Whether unconstitutional or not, it has been done. Queensland has received £ 4 1 , 0 0 0 less than her three-fourths, whilst Tasmania has gained.",33
137,Mr CAMERON,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,That is because the money has not been spent in Tasmania.,33
138,Mr DAVIDTHOMSO N,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"I think that honourable members must recognise that, having regard to the large amount of revenue that Queensland is losing, she will not be prepared to agree to any increased expenditure. I wish now to refer to one or two questions relating to the sugar industry. According to the Budget, something like £ 2 5 , 0 0 0 has been provided for the deportation of Kanakas, and I should like to know what is the source of the information obtained by the Treasurer that Queensland has only some £ 1 6 , 0 0 0 available for this purpose. Where has the money gone? I trust that the deportation of Kanakas will Ix facilitated as much as possible, and that it will be conducted on humanitarian lines. Kanakas who have married white women, and, have children attending our public schools, are not, I understand, to be deported. It would be unwise to separate those men from their wives and children, ibut those having no ties in Australia, ought certainly to be deported. The Kanakas who have married and settled down do not, as a rule, work on the sugar plantations. For the most part they have taken up small plots of ground in the neighbourhood of towns, and earn a livelihood as gardeners, wood-carters, and so-forth. The Queensland Government, through their officers, are taking steps to see that the work of deportation is facilitated as much as possible, and through their officers are giving every assistance to the CommonweaMi. Another question associated with the sugar industry relates to the wages paid to the white workers. During the last year great trouble has been experienced owing to the refusal of the sugar planters, who are enjoying the benefit of the protection which the Commonwealth has afforded their i ndustry, to pay a reasonable wage. I refer more particularly to those carrying on operations in the neighbourhood of Bundaberg, where the men refused to labour in the cane-fields unless they received a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. All that they asked was that they should receive 30s. a week and their keep. Notwithstanding that these planters have been enjoying a protection of £ 2 a ton, they refused what to my mind was a most reasonable demand. Next year, under the amending Act, they will receive a benefit of £ 3 per ton, and if they still refuse to concede the fair demands of the men, I hope that the Minister of Trade and Customs will take the matter in hand and insure the payment of reasonable wages. Any one who has visited the sugar-growing district's of Queensland will admit that 30s. a week and rations constitute only a fair remuneration for working in the cane-fields. I do not think that that work is exceptionally severe, but having regard to the hours of employment, the wage for which the men in the Bundaberg district struck is a very reasonable one. As long as the growers are receiving t!he protection afforded them under Commonwealth legislation, they ought to be prepared to pay reasonable wages. As a matter of fact, the sugar bonus was granted to enable them to employ white men at a fair wage. We do not desire that strikes should occur; but next year, when the Kanakas have to go, difficulties are sure to arise unless we have in power a sympathetic Minister, who will take steps to insure the payment of a fair wa.ge.",33
139,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"Robertson) [5.25] - The debate on the Budget last year centred chiefly round the necessity for taking over the States debts. As I then devoted some attention to the question, and have since been deeply interested in it, I avail myself of the present opportunity to congratulate the Treasurer on the steps he has taken to make it a live one in Australia. I wel 1 remember that during the Federal campaign many men-and I was among, the number-were attracted by the statement that the Commonwealth would be able to take over the debts of the States, and thus secure an immense saving to the people. About that time, Mr - no w SenatorWalker, who was a member of the Convention, wrote a very able paper pointing out the benefits which would accrue to the people of the Commonwealth by the conversion of the States"" debts into 3 per cents. He showed very clearly that in that way immense savings would be effected, and that is what the people of Australia have long been expecting. The possibility of effecting such savings was strongly emphasized in New South W a l e s but I think that until the right honourable member for Swan assumed office as Treasurer, this question was not thoroughly grappled with. these circumstances, therefore, that I desire to congratulate him upon having made this subject his own. The right honourable gentleman went to England and interviewed' not only the governors of the Bank of England, and those of other banking institutions doing business with Australia, but also Lord Goschen, and the Under-Secretary of the Treasury, all of whom advised him that a scheme for taking over the debts of the Commonwealth could be carried out with advantage to Australia, but that no hastv step should be taken. They pointed out that whilst we should be readv to avail ourselves of a favourable market, we should continue for some time in the old groove. I certainlv think that the Treasurer will not do justice to himself or to this question if he follows in detail the advice tendered by these gentlemen, since they are for the most part financially interested in the continuance of the existing system. - Some of them are connected with institutions and firms which have been in the habit of making a profit of i i per cent, by underwriting the loans of the States; they have derived a large revenue from the management of our public debts, and have also done business in our stocks with trustees. They have practically monopolized the whole of the financial business of Australia, and in these circumstances, we should hardly expect them to enthuse over a system under which the States' debts would practically be taken out of their hands, and converted into 3 per cent, permanent stocks. Lord Goschen, who was consulted by the Treasurer, dealt more successfully than did any other Chancellor of the Exchequer last century with the public debt of England, so that his advice was well worth obtaining. It must be remembered, however, that he is a statesman, and that the scheme which he fathered in connection with the public debt of England was in all probability propounded by the permanent Secretary to the Treasury, and that the view of that gentleman would be of even greater value to us.",34
140,Sir JOHN FORREST,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,I also saw the Financial Secretary to the Treasury.,34
141,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"I read that the right honourable gentleman had an interview with Sir Edward Hamilton, the Financial Secretary to the Treasury. That gentlemanadvised him to convert the debts as they f all due. Several schemes have been put by honourable members before the Committee, each of which It is in contains this objectionable proposal to convert or take over the debts as they f all due. The honourable member for Koovong takes great credit for a scheme which, in my opinion, is most objectionable. He provides, in the first instance, for the creation of a council of finance. That goes without saying. But he proceeds to suggest that they must take security, have power to receive revenue from the railways, to hypothecate the railways, or to establish floating charges over them. In my opinion, those proposals spell the defeat of the scheme. I shall oppose any scheme which throws doubts on the value of the security given to our financial accommodaters in England, and proposes a lien upon the assets of the States. That is not the way in which the question must be grappled with. Th'e honourable member for Mernda has put forward a scheme which is practically the same as that of the Treasurer, though its details are as objectionable in some respects as those of the scheme of the honourable member for Koovon.fr. He seems to have very little-faith in the States, and wishes them to give security for deficiencies. That is objectionable. The honourable member for Canobolas has stated that the States, taken separately, are as good a security as is the Commonwealth, and, in the abstract, he is correct. Mr Coghlan has told us that the people of Great Britain will require some inducement for the conversion of their present stocks to Commonwealth stocks. They know that the States lean on each other at the present time. But, although the people of the Commonwealth are the same as the people of the States, when the debts of the States have been taken over by the Commonwealth they will be controlled by one authority instead of by six. According to the Treasurer, there is a feeling in England that, therefore, the Commonwealth security will be better than the sent States security, and that, if it were made permanent, holders of States stock might be induced to invest in 3 per cent. Commonwealth stock, for which all the States, strong as well as, weak, would be responsible. In my opinion, that is so, and don version might be brought - about easilv. readily, and effectively. I see through this problem without difficulty, and have a scheme which I consider preferable to any yet brought forward. It embraces the best features of the Treasurer's scheme, as every scheme must, because he proposes to take over the whole of the debts, though he would do so in two processes, while I should do it in one.",34
142,Sir JOHN FORREST,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,The whole of existing debts could not be taken over without an alteration of the Constitution.,35
143,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"No doubt that is so. I shall deal with that matter more fully later on. In Mr Coghlan's very valuable paper are the. germs of many schemes. The principles of the scheme pf the honourable member for Mernda are in that paper, as are also those of the honourable member for Kooyong, which is a very amateurish scheme, that is, a scheme, which would occur to an amateur. I cannot see that there is much in the scheme of the honourable member for Mernda which is not to be found in Mr Coghlan's paper. He desires security in regard to future debts, and even goes the length of suggesting that we shall spend the money of the States, and have a lien over reproductive works. He would create a board with power to say when the States should borrow and when they should not. But what State would consent to go cap in hand and with bended knee to an authority of that kind for permission to borrow? These schemes are not sound enough. There is much more in that of the Treasurer than in either of them. The scheme of the honourable member for Mernda differs from that of Mr Coghlan in that the latter has shown what might be done with the debts up to 1904, while the honourable member for Mernda has worked out his calculations for the period ending 1905. A similar sinking fund scheme is in operation in England, and even in New South Wales, in regard to several services, - so that it is not new - According to Mr Coghlan, the Australian loans outstanding on the London register on the 30th preJune, 1904, represented £190,564,859. That sum is 82.61 per cent, of the total debt of Australia, the remaining 17.39 P cent., or £40,128,012, being on er the Australian register. During' the next forty-five years many millions of loans will fall due annually,' and that fact has,' no doubt, induced the Treasurer to take the matter in hand. He has done so because he takes broad views of large questions. He was the first to open up satisfactory communication between Western Australia and the eastern States, while in Western Australia he carried out a magnificent system of water supply which enables the tens of thousands of persons living in the arid gold-fields districts to draw their water practically from the Perth. The carrying out of that scheme shows him to be a man of far-sighted ideas, who is not afraid to face great problems. He has now an opportunity which will not come again in our time. By converting the debts of Australia, he can bring about a saving of millions pf pounds by reducing the rates of .interest-. Mr. Coghlan points out that when the debts are converted at par at a charge for interest of 3 rper cent, per annum,;- the saving to Australia within the period in which the present loans will expire will be £1,375,000 per annum. Between 1907 and 1911 the saving will be £273,000, and between 1912 and 1916 £390,000, and it will go on increasing during a period of forty-five years until it reaches the amount I have stated. We are now being asked to face a great problem which has hitherto been kept in the back-ground. A man may well make a big reputation by dealing successfully with it.",35
144,Mr BAMFORD,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"Would the honourable member put his money into Australian 3 per cent, consols? Mr HENRY * WILLIS - I should be satisfied to take the security of any qf the States.",36
145,Mr BAMFORD,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,The security right; but what about the interest?,36
146,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"The investment would not be a good one if the interest were not certain to be paid; but it always has been paid, and always will be paid. Honourable members, of course, know that Commonwealth stock would be no safer than State stock, and the financiers of England who work our loans, getting per cent, for underwriting and selling our stock, and advising persons to invest in it , know as well as we do that the States' stock is as good as Commonwealth stock would be. But timid outsiders, wishing to invest as trustees, would prefer Commonwealth stock to States' stock, and would be glad to get 3 per cent, stock. Trustees are not like beneficiaries, in that they do not look round for the highest interest obtainable. What they consider chiefly is the security of their investments, and the Commonwealth stocks would be preferred to State debentures.",36
147,Mr CAMERON,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,Has Australian stock ever been taken up at par?,36
148,Sir JOHN FORREST,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,Yes . Australian stock has realized as much as £-100 16s. per cent.,36
149,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"Why was. that? Because there was a sinking fund. No scheme is worth considering unless provision is made for a sinking fund. Each of the States which, whilst they were languishing, issued loans at a high rate of interest should receive the full benefit derived from the conversion of their stock and the 'reduction of the rate of interest. It appears that the Treasurer has been advised that a favourable time for the conversion of the States loans into Commonwealth stock would be when a considerable amount of States stocks are witliin a reasonable period of maturity, and that the stocks, when converted should be called Australian consols. That is suggested by the brokers, who desire to have further opportunities of reaping a large reward. They say, "" Don't convert the stocks until the loans are due."" But that would not be financing. We should be merely playing into the hands of those who have the. money to lenrL The bond-holders who had their [109] money to re-invest would know that we were hobbled, and would tell us that our loans would have to be underwritten at a cost of i j per cent. They would inform us, further, that interest rates were not so low as: they formerly were, nor so low as is all they had expected, and would probably demand at least 4 per cent. The financiers in London take up exactly the same attitude as is adopted by bankers. If they know that you must have money they will make you pay a much higher'rate of interest than if you show them that you are in an independent position. Then it is proposed that the consols should be issued at 3 per cent, for a period of thirty years. There is no necessity for fixing a minimum period. If they are to be permanent stocks, there is no need to limit the term within which they can be redeemed.",36
150,Sir JOHN FORREST,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,That plan is f o llowed in England.,36
151,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,In England a minimum and a maximum were fixed within which the stocks could be redeemed. ',36
152,Sir JOHN FORREST,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,The present Imperial bonds had a currency of thirty-five years.,36
153,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"Yes , but those are bonds which have been converted in England.",36
154,Sir JOHN FORREST,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,Mr Coghlan is of Western the same opinion as I am with regard to fixing a period to begin with. .,36
155,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"Yes . I think that he suggested a term of twenty years. He has taken his idea from the English system. I have a better plan to propose, and I say that it is not necessary tofixany term. It is further proposed that the States should pass Acts making a permanent appropriation for the payment of interest on the loans. That is a proper provision to make to safeguard the Commonwealth. It is desirable that an Appropriation Act should be passed for the payment of the balance of interest without any hypothecation, and without the Commonwealth having to act as a pawnbroker, as suggested by the honourable member for Koovong, or without resorting to the plan proposed by the honourable member for Mernda, namely, that loan proposals should be submitted to a board, and that any shortage in the interest payment should be made good by the appropriation of revenue derived from reproductive public works payable to a receiver. The methods indicated by tliose honourable members such as should be adopted in grappling with a great question of this kind. have never been followed in' England, and there is no necessity to resort Australia. The people - of the States and of the Commonwealth are the same, and they will have to pay the interest upon loans. No security beyond the good faith at this stage. of the people and appropriations by Act of Parliament has hitherto been given the payment of the States debts. If there States . is appalling. were any default on our part we should probably have a receiver placed in charge of our revenue-producing Departments- a plan which has been adopted in other countation tries which have failed to meet their jected to. linancial obligations. All the States should be taken over by the. Commonrelated wealth as soon as possible. But the Treaself. surer proposes that the debts as existing at the time that Federation . was estabassistance lished should first be taken over, and that afterwards the balance should be dealt so. with.",36
156,Sir JOHN FORREST,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"I would take over the whole of the States debts in one operafinancial tion, but I could not do that unless the Cor^titution were amended.",37
157,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"The Treasurer alternative suggests. That the State debts, "" as existing at establishment of the Commonwealth,"" amounting to about 202 millions provided 'by Section 105 of the stitution), be taken over as soon possible. That the balance of the total existing State debts, amounting to about 35 millions, be '* taken over,"" so soon amendment of Section 105 Constitution, enabling it to be done, assumed is obtained (vide par. 8).",37
158,Sir JOHN FORREST,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"But if the honorsum able member will look at paragraph 8 of mv proposal relating to the taking over of'the States debts, he will see that I probut pose that legislative provision should made for the taking over by the CommonTreasurer wealth of the whole of the existing States debts.",37
159,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,Yes ; but my complaint is that the Treasurer is going to make two steps instead of one.,37
160,Sir TOHN FORREST,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"That is because I want to get along a:» quickly as possible, and not wait for the necessary change of the Constitution.",37
161,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,How will the Treasurer get on if he does not secure the necessaiy authority from! the States are not . take over the balance of their debts? My contention is that he should not begin until They after he has obtained such authority.,37
162,Sir JOHN FORREST,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,The State loansto them in are continually falling due.,37
163,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"Yes, "" arid for that very reason the States will probably the be willing to give the necessary authority If the States can get om without us they will do so. The jealousv for of the Commonwealth that exists in the It has reached 1 such a stage in New South Wales that the presence of a member of this Parliament, who, as a citizen, joined in a deputo a State Minister was recently obI am ashamed ^to say this, debts but nevertheless what I state is a fact, to me by the honourable member himThe States will never come to the Commonwealth with a view to obtaining its in regard to their loans if they feel that they can get along without doing If , on the other hand, they do . not enlist our aid, the consequences will be calamitous. A Londonclique might meet upon an hour's; notice and decide to demand a higher rate of interest, and the States would have no but to pay it , in order to obtain, a renewal of their loans. If , however, the Treasurer is granted the authority which he the proposes to seek, the results wiil be bene(as ficial to all the States. Then the Treasurer Consays that the States must pay the interest as on their debts until they are converted, and'that afterwards the Commonwealth shall be solely liable. This is half-hearted, it as an. would be statesmanlike to complete the of the business at once. When the debts are by the Commonwealth, the Treasurer will deduct each year from the payable to the States an amount sufficient to meet the interest on their debts. That is a perfectly sound proposition; it provides only for the debts existing be when the Constitution Act was passed. The further proposes that section! 87 of the Constitution-the Braddon sectionshould not be continued beyond the 31st December, 1910. I think that the operation of the Braddon section should terminate at once.",37
164,Sir JOHN FORREST,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,It would be necessary to amend the Constitution.,37
165,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"I am perfectly aware of that. We are dealing with over £200,000,000 of loans. This is the people's business, and if we tell' them to what an amendment of the Constitution' will mean, they will readily acquiesce in the proposal. The Constitution is theirs, and it is their business that we are managing, and, as the majority of the electors are sensible men, they will probably see the necessity of agreeing to the proposal.  able member substitute for the Braddon section ?",37
166,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"In the first place, I should ask the electors to consent to the immediate transfer of the States debts to the Commonwealth, and also to the immediate termination of the operation of the Braddon section. Then I should propose to make to the States a - per capita allowance from Commonwealth revenue at a uniform rate, and upon a liberal scale, so fhat none of them, with the exception of Western Australia, should receive less than they are now being paid. Western Australia is a comparatively young State-he r present Constitution has not been in existence for more than fourteen! years. She has a population largely composed of adult males who have gone over from Victoria, New South Wales, and other States, and have left their wives and children behind them. These adult males consume a much larger proportion of highly dutiable goods than do their wives and children and other relatives, who are in the eastern States.",38
167,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,The excess of adult males over the other elements in the community is gradually being diminished in Western Australia.,38
168,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"And, consequently, the rate of revenue per head will decrease, and gradually come down to the level of that derived in the other States. In mv opinion, the time has arrived when the bookkeeping provisions and the Braddon section of our Constitution should be terminated, so that every State may be benefited by improved conditions of trade. It has been said that New South Wales and Victoria benefit the most from Federation, because goods which are consumed in other States of tihe union are required to pass through them Why is that so? Do not the people of the other States obtain their goods cheaper in tihat way ? If those goods reached them direct, as they did formerly, they would be called upon to pay more for them. My proposal is that the Commonwealth should take over the whole of the States debts, and convert them into 3 per cents. The Commonwealth stocks, being of that denomination, public opinion in the States would furnish a guar[109]- 2 12 antee against outside borrowing on their part at higher rates of interest. I hold that any State which required to raise money should come to the Commonwealth for it. It would be to its advantage to do so, because it would thereby obtain it ai 3 per cent. Of course, a sinking fund would be established, and that provision would make the security of the Commonwealth more acceptable to the investors in England. I think that the Commonwealth should take ""over not only the States debts which ' were contracted prior to Federation, but those which have since been incurred, and I am of opinion that all future loans required by the States should be raised by the iCommonwealfch.",38
169,Mr CAMERON,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,The States would have to ask the Commonwealth to raise loans for them ?,38
170,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"Yes . But no embargo should be placed upon them in that connection. It is idle to urge that the States would be able to extravagantly float loans, seeing that tfhe interests of the same people would be concerned, and that they would be closely safeguarded by the same press, which would act as a watch dog. They would not be permitted to ask for money recklessly. Public opinion would prevent that.  member call the press a watch dog?",38
171,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"I do. The press is a most valuable institution. If it were not for it, the people would be absolutely ignorant of the. events daily transpiring throughout the world. They get their news served up to them at breakfast time in the most condensed and attractive form, and, upon the whole, the newspapers are well advised. They could not live if the people were not behind them, trusting them.",38
172,Mr CAMERON,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,How many lines will they devote to the honourable member's speech tomorrow ?,38
173,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"They have given up taking notice of me. However, I am not fishing for any notice in the columns of the newspapers. The press in my own electorate report my speeches in full, and that is all I care about. I suggest that a sinking fund slhould be established in connection with every existing debt,' and with every debt which may be contracted in future by the States. Such a proposal is not a new one. The British Government today are advancing £100,000,000 to the Irish people, and are offering a 12 per cent. I 2 Budget. [REPRESENTATIVES.] inducement to the .large land-owners to sell their estates. There is an impression abroad that this money is in the nature of a free g if t to the Irish people. It is nothing of the kind. The scheme is that the Irish tenantsshall repay the amount advanced with interest added, and a small percentage to a sinking fund. The Local Government Board in England perform the very same functions as would be discharged by the body the creation of which has - been suggested honourable member for Mernda. the present time, any municipality throughout England CT Scotland which desires to raise money-and many of these bodies have raised as much £10,000,000-ar e required to make application to the Local Government Board. The purpose for which the money is wanted is investigated, and, if approved, the money may be borrowed; but a sinking fund has to be opened to provide for the liquidation of the debt. The system has been in existence in the old country} since the eighties. Under the scheme of the honourable member for Mernda, a sovereign State of the Commonwealth would occupy a position similar to that occupied by a municipality in Great Britain. He proposes that a State desiring to float a loan should) make application to Public Debts Commissioners. If there were many applications received about the same period, it would indicate that the time was not opportune for floating a loan, or that the works scheme was not approved of, and the power to borrow refused. Such a proposal the States could not entertain. Under an scheme the Commissioners would say to the State. "" You shall have the monev,"" and the State would then b'e responsible to the Commonwealth just as it was to the money lender direct.  rectly responsible?",38
174,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,The Commonwealth. I would make the States a liberal allowance - per capita. At present the amount averages about £ 2 4s. We could fix it at £ 2 6s. if we thought 'it necessary to do so.,39

177,Mr CAMERON,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,The honourable member would not ask for any security from the States ?,39
178,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"Certainl y not; no more than is now given to bond-holders in England. With the abolition of the Braddon section of the Constitution, the States would have no claim whatever to the Customs and Excise revenue. It would then be within the discretion of the Commonwealth to allow the States £ 2 6s. by the per head of population. At Mr CAMERON - What about future loans ?",39
179,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"An y future as loans required by the States would be raised by the Commonwealth. There is no more likelihood of the former going back upon the latter than there is of their going back upon the bond-holders in England. If a State requires money for developmental purposes, it ought to be in a position to obtain it. We cannot expect the States to abandon a progressive policy of publifc works. They have the railways, and those railways must be pushed into the country, in order that it may be properly developed. But we must not encourage the States to go into the London market where we shall have a footing and pav more than they need to pay. If they could obtain locally what they wanted at 3 per cent., they would not think of going into the London market. An understanding should be arrived at that they should' take action through the Commonwealth.",39
180,Mr CAMERON,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"The honourable member acceptable is taking it as an accepted fact that we should be able to obtain at 3 per cent, all the money we needed. As a matter of fact, we could not do so.",39
181,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"It is all very well for some persons to make that statebe di- ment. Those who are at present deriving considerable revenue from the managment of our public debts tell us that we could not hope, by any consolidation, to secure what we needed at 3 per cent. As interested parties, it is natural that they should make such statements, but we know what Canada has done in this direction. She issues z\ per cent, loans, and, although those loans are not floated at par, the price obtained closely approximates to it . If we at once took over all the debts of the and issued 3 per cents., it would lae necessary for us to offer an inducement to bond-holders, who think as we think, that 1 a State security is as good as a Commonwealth one, or they would not convert their stocks.",39
182,Sir JOHN FORREST,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"If we are to offer them an inducement, how are we to effect percentage. a saving?",40
183,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"I will explain take shall we derive? that point. We must not lose sight of the fact that we have to deal with men who know that their present security is satistill factory. As Mr Coghlan points out, when we ask these men to exchange their 4 cent, stocks for 3 per cent, stocks , we offer them some inducement.",40
184,Sir JOHN FORREST,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"Then we shall not we effect a saving. When the stocks are appaper by inscribing our stock. proaching maturity, we shall be in a better position.",40
185,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"What is the reduce inducement we must offer? If we asked the bond-holders to accept a 3 per cent, a 4 per cent, stock, which had only a year to run. we should give them little more than £ 1 0 0 for their bonds.",40

Under this system we should pay nothing more in respect of interest, although we should appear to pay a little more on paper. When our bonds fell due we should rethem at their face value. This is not a new scheme of finance in principle. Let me remind honourable members of the in regard to banking institutions which are paying ro per cent, on £ 2 5 Prior to the financial crash, the shares of the Bank of New South Wales, , which were issued at £ 2 5 each, ran up to about -^""65, whilst those of the Commercial Banking Company sold as high as £ 1 1 0 each.

197,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"We cannot ppssiblv hope to benefit in that regard. - If I hold a 4 per cent, bond issued by. the right honourable gentleman, I certainly should not exchange it for a 3 per cent, one, unless it were to be made of equal 1 monetary value.",40
198,Sir JOHN FORREST,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,I should » the honourable member when the bond matured.,41
199,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"Yes , and probably then have to pay 4 per cent, for the money. Although Mr Coghlan has not worked out his scheme on the lines that I have followed, the same principle will ' apply to both. Our bonds would be taken at par, or would practically be at a premium. As pointed out by Sir Edward Hamilton, the Commonwealth will reap the benefit of the conversions when our bonds become popular, and they certain:] y would become, popular if this scheme were carried out. The Treasurer has told us that a minimum period is fixed in respect of Imperial loans, and he proposes that the Commonwealth should fix a. minimum of thirtv years.",41
200,Sir JOHN FORREST,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,I think that minimum in England at the last conversion was thirty-five years.,41
201,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"Quite so. Mr. Coghlan suggests that we should fix minimum of twenty years. with current bonds, we should stipulate that when converted they should have a * currency equal to the period for which they were issued, before the power to redeem could operate, . and at the end of that period we might months' notice of our intention to pay - p.m. In England a minimum and maximum period was fixed in respect of the 3 per cents., and the stocks were taken up as trustees' It would be unnecessary for us fix a period in respect of new loans, because they would be dealt with in same way as are those floated by the perial Government. The Treasurer has formed us that the interest on consols paid > quarterly, while that on the Australian register is paid half-yearly. I think that in taking over the debts the States, the Commonwealth should would extinguish the original debt. agree to pay the interest quarterly. Mr Goschen proposed his great conversion scheme some years ago, he intimated that intended that the interest should be quarterly instead of half-yearly, and this led manv persons to favour the conversion. A man having only a small income naturent rally desires to secure the of interest on any security which he holds. I think that I have made my position clear. If we ask the holder of a bond worth £ 1 0 0 at 4 per cent, which has a year to run, to pay off accept a 3 per cent, stock in exchange for it, we must offer him a little more than £ 1 0 0 for that bond. No doubt such a system would cost us a little more on paperj| not more, however, in payment; but the States would be required to establish a sinking fund of J per cent, from the period of renewal, and the result would be that, on the average, they would pay less than they are now doing. According to Mr Coghlan, their present average rate of interest is 3.7 per cent. But what is the position of those States which have launched loans at 6 per cent? What a substantial benefit would accrue to them from the conversion of those loans by the Commonwealth. I hope that the Treasurer will continue to give this question his closest attention, and that the Government will seek the authority of the people for an amendment of the Constituthe tion enabling the Commonwealth to take over all the debts, and abolishing the operation of the Braddon section.  a able member deal with the States in reI n dealing spect of the transferred properties?",41

203,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"The honourable issue of member for Grey has asked me for my views as to what.should be done in regard investments. to the properties transferred from the States to to the Commonwealth in connection with the transfer of certain Departments of Govern the ment. I had not intended to deal with that I m - matter at this juncture, but I have looked ininto it, and am of opinion that these prois perties should be legitimately valued, and 3 per cent, interest allowed to the States on that value, with a sinking fund of \ per of cent., which, in a little over sixty years, It When must be remembered that these properties were constructed largely out of borrowed he money, on which the States are still paying paid interest. Some of the smaller States cannot afford to lose this interest, and, therefore, the Commonwealth should either pay for the properties, or interest in the prompt payment way I have described.",41
204,Mr BROWN,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,Some of the States wish to be paid in full at once.,42
205,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"That would not be a sound financial arrangement. The scheme I suggest would be similar - to that under which the Irish land purchases are being carried on, and the local governments of the United Kingdom are working, or practically the same as that adopted in New South Wales and other States in regard to the conditional purchase of land. With regard to the Northern Territory of South Australia, I think that it should be taken over by the Commonwealth, but that the Commonwealth should be responsible only for the loan money actually expended in its development, upon which it should pay South Australia interest at the rate of 3 per cent., another 1 wards a sinking fund for the extinction of the debt in about sixty years. I have never declared myself in favour of the Western Australian railway, and shall not do so until I have consulted my constituents on the subject. In mv opinion, however, if the State of Western Australia is really anxious for the construction of that line, it should bear half of any loss arising from its construction, the other half being borne by the Commonwealth, which, as the railway would be of use for. strategical purposes, should also pay £ per cent, on the cost to establish a sinking fund for the liquidation of the debt.",42
206,Mr CARPENTER,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,What about South Australia? 1,42
207,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"Assumin g that the people of South Australia are opposed to the construction of the line, I do not know that they should be forced to bear any loss which may accrue therefrom, though, if there were a gain, the State should certainly share in it, as it runs through her territory.",42
208,Mr BROWN,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,Would the honourable member apply the same principle to the main trunk lines of the other States?,42
209,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"So far as the proposed railway from Oodnadatta to the South Australia border is concerned, that would be purely a State undertaking; but if it became a white elephant through the taking over of the Northern Territory by the Commonwealth, it would be the duty of the Commonwealth to connect with the South Australian border the railway from Pine Creek, and the cost would, of .course, be chargeable amongst the people of the various States, per head of population, as new expenditure. In conclusion, my proposal is that the Commonwealth shall take over all the debts of the States to date, converting them at 3 per cent, at par, or at any additional sum that may be required, per cent, to be paid as a sink1 ing fund for the liquidation of the debt within a certain period, which would be extended a little if the conversion were effected below par. I propose that the bookkeeping system should terminate within the next twelve months, as is provided for by the Constitution. When it terminates, we shall have Inter-State free-trade. It is unthinkable that there should be Federation . without Inter-State free trade. There would have been no per cent, going to- union in the United States, had it not been for the clamour of the public for that boon, ancl the late Sir Henry Parkes, when he stumped the country in favour of Federation, gave as; one of the burning reasons for the movement the desirabilitv of doing away with the barriers between the States. The bookkeeping keeps barriers in existence, everv export and import being credited and debited like the transactions of a small retail establishment in a most vexatious and expensive manner. I would also wipe out the Braddon section, ancl give to the States a uniform allowance of 2s. 6d. per head of population. I would provide for the repealing of the Braddon section at the same time as the amendment of the Constitution, to give the Commonwealth power to take over the debts of the States practically to date. The debts having been converted, ' I propose that the States should borrow through the Commonwealth at 3 per cent., with a sinking fund of i per cent. There would, of course, be a certain amount of expenditure incurred in the raising of loans. Even Great Britain has to bear incidental expenses in this matter. This expenditure might slightly increase the period necessary for repayment, which would be a little over sixtv years. There can be no question that money could be raised at 3 per cent., and that our stock would be popular in the market. That there should be a Commission to manage our financial operations goes without saying. A Commission of the kind is in existence for controlling the Irish land expenditure, in connection with which £100,000,000 is involved, together with £i2;ooo,ooo for bonuses to landowners. The appointment of the. Commission must be part of any scheme. The 3 2 Budget. [REPRESENTATIVES.] Commissioners would manage the loans, vise the Government, collect the Customs allowances for each State, and the balance due in interest upon loans debited to States. Each State would pay interest its own debt, and be responsible for own liabilities only. The Commissioners would do the work which is now being done by our financial agents in London. The present arrangements there, except in the case of South Australia, are very expensive. South Australia is doing her business i London more expeditiously and economiAvould cally than any of the other States.",42
210,Mr GLYNN,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,The Agent-GeneraT's report shows that.,43
211,Sir JOHN FORREST,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,What evidence there in regard to expedition ?,43
212,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"The work is done in the office of the State, and, though I have not the actual figures with me, I know that the expense is proporable tionatelv less than that incurred by the other States, who employ the governors Avhy I do not fix any exact date. of the Bank of England, the managers of the Westminster Bank, and a firm of finanaccrue ciers who divide the commissions between them. Twelve years ago, when I was London, South Australia was just having its offices moved from Westminster to East End, so ""that its representatives might be in the city proper, and manage the busithey ness of the State economically. They now do their work better than the work of the other States is done.",43
213,Sir JOHN FORREST,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,I do not in least degree admit that they do it better.,43
214,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"They do it at a less) cost. Of course, in any case, there must be a broker to go on the Exchange, and a banker to take charge of deposits, and to do the ordinary banking business. But, although South Australia has managed her business well, the States would do even better under the system which I propose. The financiers of England regard an Appropriation Act as affording ample secuto rity. If that is sufficient now, it will suffice when the CommonAvealth takes over public. the States debts. Therefore, - why should the revenue from raihvays or other public works be hypothecated, as suggested by the honourable members for Mernda and KooAvent to England? yong? No such unsound proposals have ever been made by the financiers of Enghave land. The holders of the States stocks the excellent Avork he has done. would be benefited by the proposed conunderwriters version, and our stocks would be boomed"". We should give them something more in the form of inscribed capital, but pay them Budget. adless by way of interest. We should merely capitalize i per cent, of the present interest payment, and-give them the cash value in the stock. The present bond-holders would be on benefited, but not at our expense. They its would make their gain out of those who wished to invest in 3 per cent. CommonAvealth stock. Until recently, many persons have not been permitted to invest in States stocks, but they would be in a position to accept CommonAvealth stocks as security. All n .they Avant is a sound' investment, and this be provided by a CommonAvealth stock. Our inscribed stock would be worth more during the first year than during the last year of its currency, because at the end is of that term we should pay over merely £ 1 0 0 for every £ 1 0 0 that we had borrowed That is all that the holders of the stock alAvould get. If we contributed £ per cent, per annum to a sinking fund, Ave should be to meet the loans as they fel l due. The period would be A'ariable, and that is The Treasurer claims that great benefit would to the States if their stocks Avere converted as they fell due. But Ave should in not gain anything in the meantime. Why should' Ave object to the bond-holders the making, something out of the stocks they hold, if AAe' can also effect a saving ? If could be induced to boom the stocks, Ave should every year derive more benefit, because Ave should obtain* our monev at 3 per cent, permanently. I think that I have the submitted a thoroughly sound scheme.",43
215,Mr WILKINSON,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,Whose scheme is it ?,43
216,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"It is a scheme similar to that which has been adopted in Great Britain,Canada, and the United States. It is a thoroughly sound financial scheme, which I haA'e worked out to suit the requirements of the Commonwealth. If our 3 per cent, stocks Avere boomed they AA'ould become popular, and Ave should not object some one else obtaining a benefit, not also at our cost, but at the cost of the British  of arranging for an advantageous conversion of the States debts that the Treasurer",43
217,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"Yes; and I given the Treasurer every credit for The complain that they ha\'e still in their safes some of our stocks, which they have been unable to unload, and they . urge that Ave should not place any fresh' stocks upon the market just now, because if we do so they will not be able to underwrite them for us. If our stocks boomed, however, the whole of the stock now lying in the safes of the underwriters would be placed on the market. Coghlan points out that loans amounting to several millions will f all due every year for forty-five years, and that if the States debts are consolidated at 3 per cent, at par there will be a saving to the Commonwealth when the loans expire of £ 1 , 3 7 5 , 0 0 0that is, if we allow the bond-holders an opportunity to make some profit in the meantime. During the five years, from 1907 to 1911, the loans falling due, if redeemed at 3 per cent., would represent a saving of £ 2 7 3 , 0 0 0 per annum. During the period, from 1912 to 1916, we should effect a further saving of' £ 3 9 0 , 0 0 0 per annum. So the saving would be increased every year. If we do not adopt the plan suggested, the States will probably have to raise money at 4 per cent. Although I do not think that his proposal is the best, I shall give every assistance to the Treasurer to make the scheme perfect, provided that he goes forward with it. I understand that he intends to cover the whole ground if he can secure an amendment of the Constitution. He will! not, however, wait until that change has been brought about. He will deal with the loans as they f all due, and afterwards seek permission to take over the balance of the States debts. Personally, I should prefer to ask the people to adopt a scheme such as I have outlined. I think that they would approve of it , because they would see that it would be to their advantage, and that it would achieve one of the purposes which were held most clearly in view when they were induced to vote for Federation..  afraid that at this period of the debate very little interest is being taken in the Budget proposals. Whilst we are basking in the sunshine of temporary prosperity, honourable members are inclined to lose sight of the possibilities of the future, and it seems to me that we shall have to safeguard ourselves against anvthing in the nature of rash orimprovident financing. I have been very much surprised at the want of interest in the Budget statement displayed by the States Treasurers. It is true that has been a considerable expansion of our trade, and that the community as a whole is apparently prosperous, but I am afraid were that that is all the consolation that the States Governments are likely to derive from a study of the Treasurer's proMr posals. Our boasted surplus .of revenue has practically reached vanishing point. If we paid to the States all that is due to them by us, we should no longer have any money to spare. Our expenditure is increasing out of all proportion to our income. I do not know who is to blame for this, but it seems to me that our present outlook is a particularly dismal one. Of course, I know that some honourable members argue that we should not be called upon to pay the States for the transferred properties-that a mere bookkeeping entry would meet all the necessities of the case. It would be of distinct advantage to the States if they were relieved of the necessity of paying the interest on the loan moneys expended on transferred properties. Mr Wilks.;-We have not yet taken over all the services that should be carried on by us.  that we shall have to incur additional outlay, although we shall receive very little additional revenue when the new Departments are transferred to us. I understand that the penny postage proposal will, if adopted, involve us in an annual loss of from £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 to £ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum. To the aged poor who, lever since the issue of the manifesto of the first Prime Minister, have been led to believe that a system of old-agje pensions was to be instituted, it must be a great consolation to learn that, instead of effect being given to such a scheme, their letters are to be carried for a penny less than they have been carried for hitherto. The question of providing old age pensions was that upon which the Barton Ministry gained a majority at the first election. But, though five years have since elapsed, no serious attempt has teen made to establish any such system. Now, because an agitation has been promoted by business persons in favour of the adoption of penny postage, the Government propose to sacrifice a revenue of from £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 lo £ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 annually. The business section of a communitv are naturally very eager to secure the. advantage which would be conferred upon them by the adoption of penny postage. In some establishments, it would there mean a saving of hundreds of pounds yearly.",43
218,Sir JOHN FORREST,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"Perhaps , as the re' .suit of its introduction, they will sell goods cheaper.  likelihood of that. What will be the sult? Very soon we shall have proposals submitted by the Treasurer-wh o does not believe in direct taxation-to raise creased sum by means of indirect taxation - proposal s under which the working man will be called upon to contribute to the ficiency in our revenue equally with the dividual who has derived from penny postmarked age an advantage of hundreds of pounds tice annually. The Budget offers very little consolation to the States Treasurers or the aged poor of the community.",45
219,Sir JOHN FORREST,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,Anybod y would think that penny postage was not in tion in any State in Australia.  in South Australia.,45
220,Sir JOHN FORREST,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"In Western Ausment tralia, it has been adopted in every municisacrifice pality for the past thirtv vears.  little advantage upon the great majority the people. In South Australia, the emwe ployes of the Postal Department have sufquence ferred more from their transfer to Comage monwealth control than have the employees of that Department in any other State. Some officials there have been deprived many privileges which they enjoyed under State law. Prior to Federation, they assured that upon the transfer of the partment to the Commonwealth, all their existing and accruing rights would be served to them. But what has been the result? Officers who were entitled' to crements in a class in which the maximum things ? salary was £200 a year, have been placed in a division in which the maximum salary is £ 1 8 0 yearly. Postmasters who-a addition to their salaries-receive d a percentage upon the postage stamps which they sold, have had to sacrifice that percentage. Similarly, the amount which they formerlv received for acting as agents for the South Australian Savings Banks, has from them. Further, their duties have been increased. They are frequently called upon to discharge the functions of returnwe ing officers in connection with Commonland wealth elections, and for their services receive practically nothing. They are some of times required to act as Customs officers, but any money to which they might otherthat wise be entitled for this service must be paid into the State Treasury. They called upon to pay rent for residences for their which no charge was previously made, notwithstanding that the salaries of some of officers have been reduced to the exretent of £ 1 5 0 annually. Despite all the disabilities under which they now labour, the Government propose to sacrifice a rean invenue from this Department of £200,000 or £300,000 annually to establish penny postage. Whether Ministers believe it or not, deit is a fact that throughout the whole of in the postal service in South Australia, very discontent exists owing to the injusto which the officials have been subjected by the Commonwealth. It is true that they to discharge their duties faithfully enough, but there is a very wide distinction between a hearty and a reluctant service. operaOne would think that the Government would have seen that these men, upon whom they have to rely to make the Department a success!, received fair treatat their hands before proposing to its revenue. During the course of this debate a good deal has been said in reference to our want of population. I ot venture to say that the period during which shall suffer a loss of revenue in conseof the introduction of penny postwill largely depend upon the increase which fakes place in our population. What encouragement have we to hope for imof provement in that direction? After all, we do not want population in the cities. The were curse of Australia is that people have Debeen driven off the land, with the result that today the cities are congested, to the predetriment of rural industries. What proposals contained in the Budget are calcuinlated to bring about a better state of",45
221,Sir JOHN FORREST,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"Fro m the honourable member's point of view, there would appear s an to be nothinp; in the Budget.  the Treasurer is right.",45
222,Sir JOHN FORREST,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"The honourable member appears to think that he is in the been, taken State Parliament.  Treasurer holds a very strong opinion that ought not to attempt to deal with the question. But I maintain that that they question is at the very root of the problem how to attract population to Australia. Until we deal with it, we shall not receive increase which the States require.",45
223,Sir JOHN FORREST,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"Then we had betare ter wipe them out altogether.  altogether too sensifive to criticism. I say that there is plenty of scope for a Treasurer who has the courage to tackle the land question. The other night the honourable member for Grampians outlined a scheme, which he has since elaborated, for the purchase of some 5,000,000 acres of land at a cost of £25,000,000. There is a good deal to be said in favour of that scheme if any system could be applied to the purchase of the land which would prevent it jfrom being rushed up to boom prices owing to the large demand for it. What a farce it isi to plead to people in other parts of the world to settle in Australia if we have not the necessary land to offer them? Of course, we have abundance of land in Australia, but, unfortunately, it is held by very large holders. It would be cruel to tempt immigrants to \ come here upon the mere chance that they would be able to secure land, when we know that at every meeting of the Land Boards there is an average of from thirty to fifty applicants for a single block.",45
224,Sir JOHN FORREST,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"What does the honourable member want to do?  such scheme as that which has been suggested by the honourable member for Grampians, there should be a system of compulsory purchase, which would enable applicants to obtain land at a fair value. Every common-sense land-holder will admit that the sheep at present upon our large holdings must give place to men. The large holdings must give way to smaller ones, for we must have closer settlement if we are to have a population worthy of Australia.",46
225,Sir JOHN FORREST,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"That is a matter within the control of the States Parliaments.  right honourable member knows full well that several of the States are cursed with Constitutions under which only two out of seven have a voice in the election of members to the Upper House. In the State which I represent, legislation dealing with vested interests is blocked from time to time by eighteen gentlemen in the Legislative Council who do not really represent the wishes of the people in this regard. As long as this state of affairs continues Australia will not make much progress, and it is with a view to secure a remedy that the Labour Party has suggested the imposition of a land tax on lines similar to those of the tax prevailing in New Zealand, which has done much to burst up large estates there. I wish now to say a word or two about the consolidation of our debts. I see no particular virtue in the proposal that we should at once take over the whole of the indebtedness of the States, nor do I see any special virtue in the contention that if we do not take over the whole of the debts we must at least take over an equivalent portion from each of the States, irrespective of whether they desire us to do so or do not.",46
226,Sir JOHN FORREST,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"That is the position under the Constitution.  and I agree with the Treasurer that we should seek an amendment of the Constitution: which will enable the Commonwealth Government to take over the States debts as they approach maturity. When this is done, an understanding must also be. arrived at that the States shall borrow only through the Commonwealth. We must have control over their borrowings. Unless we do so, the moment we relieve them of responsibility in respect of their present indebtedness they will evince a strong tendency to indulge in further borrowing. The Commonwealth is entitled to take special credit for the fact that, although it has been in existence for nearly six years, it has not yet borrowed one penny. We have constructed out of revenue a great many works for which prior to Federation provision vvas made out of loan moneys. Whilst I admit that our expenditure in this direction is deducted from the surplus returnable to the States, I am satisfied that the effect of this system has been most beneficial. It has caused us to hasten slowly in increasing our expenditure, and it has had also a wholesome effect in another direction, since a State Treasurer is not so ready to urge the construction of various works when he knows that they must be provided for, not out of loan funds, but out of revenue. I am somewhat disappointed that the Treasurer has not yet indicated an intention on the part of the Government to bring in a. Bill relating to, banking. It seems to me that a Federal banking law is even more urgently required than is the adoption of a uniform system of penny postage. It is monstrous that if one draws a cheque for £ 1 on a South Australian branch of a banking institution, it costs him is. to cash it in Melbourne. 1 2 Budget. [REPRESENTATIVES.]",46
227,Sir JOHN FORREST,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,The charge would be the same if the cheque were for £ 1  an arrangement could be made to obviate the necessity for such a monstrous impost. bounty system. A reform is also necessary in regard issue of postal notes and post-cards.,47
228,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"Hear , hear; uniformity is desirable.",47
229,Mr IOYNTON,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,But these reforms could be carried out before the adoption of the honourable gentleman's extravagant scheme of penny postage for Australia.,47
230,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"They all must come together.  1 heard a great deal about decimal coinage, but I am afraid that in the absence of honourable member for South Sydney the work of the Committee appointed to deal with that question has fallen flat. dence was given before the Committee that great savings could be nexion with the coinage of silver and copper. The Treasurer was deputed to the deal with this question when in England, but we have heard very little from him.",47

I do not propose to further detain the Committee; at this stage of the session long speeches should be avoided. We have still much work to do.

232,Mr CAMERON,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"Wilmot) [8.24] - Be fore dealing with the Budget, I desire refer briefly to one or two statements made by the honourable member for Capricornia, and also by the honourable; member for Darling. When speaking this evening, honourable member for Capricornia apshould peared to be under the impression that Queensland liad a distinct grievance against this Parliament, and to believe that it had been wrongfully deprived portion of the three-fourths of Customs and Excise revenue to which it is entitled. I can only presume that under the Constithe tution certain charges have been debited against Queensland, and that these have led to the deduction of which he comtry, - Budget. plains. I was much impressed by his in0 . gratitude to the other ^States, who have so generously relieved Queensland of the burden imposed upon her under the sugar to the Mr R EDWARDS - The honourable member is"" not serious.",47
233,Mr CAMERON,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"I certainly am. The honourable member for Capricornia seems to have forgotten that for twelve or eighteen months after the establishment of the Commonwealth Queensland had to take on her own shoulders the cost of the sugar bounty system. Then the right honourable member for Balaclava, who held offce as told us that, as the people of Australia had agreed to the policv of a the White Australia, it was only fair that the other States should share with Queensland the burdens it imposed. An arrangement Eviwas then made under which each State has since borne - per capita her share of the / effected in concost of this policy.",47
234,Sir JOHN FORREST,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,Andlthe y have shared cost of that policv since its inception.,47
235,Mr CAMERON,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"That is so. I would point out ko the honourable member for Capricornia, who was so loud in his lamentations, that the small State of Tasmania, large Victoria, poor South Australia, and rich Western Australia, have all been pouring into the pockets of those engaged in raising sugar in Queensland sums amounting to several hundred thousands of pounds n a very in respect to the bounty.",47
236,Mr DAVID THOMSON,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"That statement shows that the honourable member is ignothe Minrant of the whole question. a few Mr CAMERON - My statement is abcorrect. In the speecfT which he on delivered last week, the honourable member for Darling was good enough to liken the large land-holders of Australia to the to aborigines, who formely occupied this vast continent. He told us that the white men, finding that the blacks were not making proper use of the country, took, it from the them, and he suggested that the people adopt the same course in dealing with the land-holders of Australia, since they were not devoting the land to the use for which it was designed by nature-the of carrying of a large population. Might I suggest that the honourable member, and those who think with him, have overlooked fact that they are proposing to dispossess of these large estates the descendants of those who originally came to this counand, by thrift and industry-ofte n carrying their lives in their hands-were enabled to acquire property. The honourable member does not propose to take the land from them in a fair manner; he does not propose that the States, shall acquire it at a fair valuation. He and his fellow members of the Labour Party seek to impose a crushing land, tax, and thus to compel these Unfortunate land-owners to sacrifice their property. I propose to give a brief example. In the State of Tasmania there are one or two persons who own £ 5 0 , 0 0 0 worth of land, and who, under the State. land tax, pay nearly £ 2 0 0 per annum. If the proposals of the Labour Party were carried into effect, this taxation would be increased by £ 4 0 0 , and therefore, taking into account other taxation, these land-holders would have to pay to' the State and the Commonwealth nearly £ 8 0 0 per annum, or almost half of the annual value of their properties, which amounts to about £ 2 , 0 0 0 . I need hardly point out that such taxation would mean absolute ruin to land-holders. No man could pay it and meet his other expendifure, too. The object of the Labour Party is to compel the large land-owners to throw their land on the market. But if , as the result of this crushing taxation, the large landholders found themselves unable to live, and their land were all thrown on the market, there would be practically no buyers, as the market would be glutted. As a result, confidence would be shaken, men would not be able to sell or to borrow on land, and the small holders would suffer with the large. The Labour Party, with a large amount of cunning, if I may use the term, though I allude not so much to the members of this House as to those responsible for the propaganda, are saying to the small land-holders, "" Do not be a f r a i d ; we shall not touch you. Our wish is to get at the big men. By making them pay this large burden of taxation, we shall be able, to get revenue for the establishment of an old-age pension system."" Suppose, however, that the old-age pension system is established, and that this crushing taxation has had the desired result of getting rid of the large land-holders, what must happen? large land-holders, the descendants of the men who pioneered Australia, having, gone, the money necessary to pay for old-age pensions must be found by the small landholders. The large land-owners may be struck first; but, as sure as God made little apples, the small land-holders will be struck later on. The injustice which is proposed to be done is to be suffered, not by aboriginals or by coloured aliens, but by the descendants of the pioneers of Australia, and for this, among other reasons, I do not think that the scheme of the Labour Party will commend itself to the spirit of fair play which animates most Australian breasts, just as it will not be acceptable to the intelligence of our people. The resumption of private estates by the Commonwealth, or by the Governments of the States, is another matter. Such resumption is already provided for by the Acts of some, of the States, and a Bill is now before the Tasmanian Parliament which will allow the purchase of private estates at their assessed annual value, plus 5 or 10 per cent, for enforced sale. This, in my opinion, is not too large an allowance, in view of the associations and ties which bind land-holdersi to their properties. I , as a fair-sized land-owner in Tasmania, would not object to the honest purchase by the Government of land thought to be required for the settlement of small holders upon the soil; but I say emphatically that the system of wholesale confiscation and robbery proposed by the Labour Party ought not to commend itself to the people of Australia. Coming now to the Treasurer's Budget, I wish first to refer to the sugar bounty question. When legislation for the establishment of a White Australia, was introduced into the House, the honourable and learned member for Parkes and myself were the only two members in an assembly of seventy-five who dared to oppose it . I well remember the jeers and unpleasant remarks with which our action was greeted. A little later, when the Sugar Bounty Bill was introduced, as we were told, a neces; sary corollary to the Pacific Islands Labourers Act, some half-dozen members opposed it. Under these circumstances, it is pleasing to me to know that the Treasurer, in reply to an interjection by the honourable member for North Sydney, has had to tell the Committee that we must soon seriously consider the position.",47
237,Sir JOHN FORREST,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"I did not go so far as that. The Mr CAMERON - The words are in Hansard. The right honourable gentleman was a member of the Barton Government, and is therefore responsible for the White Australia legislation and the original Sugai Bounties Act. His remark shows that common sense is returning, if not to the assembly as a whole, at least to himself. AccordJ ing to his figures, the production of sugar has enormously increased since the establishment of the bounty system. Australia at the present time is producing as much as she can consume, or perhaps a little more. So many white growers have been induced by the bounties wrung from the people of the States, who have no interest in the matter, to enter upon the cultivation of cane, that the production of sugar has grown enormously, and I should like to know what will be done with the probable future surplus. Thanks to what I may call this cursed system of protection which has grown up in Australia, under which industries are fostered on the plea that we must assist our own in the sugar industry production has overtaken, or is rapidly overtaking, the local consumption, and within a very short period we shall be exporting sugar to other parts of the world for consumption by negroes, Chinamen, and other aliens. Further, in all probability, this sugar will be sold at a lower price than that, ruling in our own market. Then we shall have to consider whether it is worth our while to continue a system under, which our own people have to pay very dearly for the production of sugar for the benefit of the people outside the Commonwealth. We need only look to the example of Germany. Some years agp, it was thought that it would be a fine thing to encourage the manufacture of beet sugar in that country, and a system of bounties wag introduced which resulted in sugar being sent to London and sold at one half the price realized in the local market. Three or four years ago, however, the system broke down. The German people could stand it no longer, and conferences were held with the result that it was decided to do away with the sugar bounty. Does not this show that the Treasurer was perfectly correct when he stated that we soon should have to seriously consider the question of abolishing the sugar bounties.",48
238,Mr R EDWARDS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,The term for payment of the bounties has been renewed for a further five years.,49
239,Mr CAMERON,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"Yes , and in all probability, they will be paid for that period. The subject, however, is one that the people of Australia should take seriously to heart. We should seriously consider whether it would not be better, to revert to the old system and permit the Kanakas to be brought into Australia for the express purpose of assisting In the growth of sugar, at the same time preventing them from marryBudget. [REPRESENTATIVES.] Budget. ing Europeans, and providing for their repatriation at trie end of their period of service. The people of Tasmania, Western Australia, and South Australia, although they have no direct interest in the sugarindustry, are being called upon to subsidize it for the benefit of Queensland. Yet we get no thanks from the representatives of that State, and I think that the sooner the sugar bounties are done away with, the better. Had we been met with some gratitude, we might have been willing to bear the burden.",49
240,Mr R EDWARDS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,We are deeply grateful.,49
241,Mr CAMERON,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"The honourable mempeople, ber for Capricornia did not show much gratitude. The Treasurer indicated that he intended to relieve Tasmania of the annual charge of £ 5 , 6 0 0 hitherto contributed by that State fowards the cost of carrying on the cable service between Tasmania and the mainland. I have not asked that this should be done, but in view of the sacrifices that Tasmania had been called upon to make, I confess that the proposal is only a fair one. The Treasurer also told us that prior to Federation, Tasmania contributed £ 6 , 0 0 0 per annum towards the subsidy for the mail service between that State and Victoria, and that shortly after Federation had been established, an improved maif service was brought into operation, when the subsidy was increased to £ 1 3 , 0 0 0 per annum. He mentioned, further, that New South Wales enjoyed the advantage of a mail service to the South Sea Islands, and that the subsidy payable in .connection with it was charged to all the States upon a - per capita basis. It seemed to him, therefore, that in view of the similarity pf the circumstances, Tasmania should no longer be called upon to bear the cost of the increased subsidy, but that the amount should be met by a per capita contribution: by the States. I should like to know whether this proposal has been brought forward the merely because a representative of Tasmania happens to occupy a position in the Cabinet, or whether it has been introduced in view of the general elections, and of the fact that in Tasmania, there is a deep-rooted dislike to the present A d ministration. Is this merely a "" sop to Cerberus ""-a n effort to placate the people of Tasmania? If not, I should like to know why, bearing in mind the fact that Tasmania has for some years borne her proportion of' the cost of the mail service 'between Sydney and the South Sea Islands, this act of justice to Tasmania has been so tardily performed? If that State is entitled to be relieved of the payment of the extra subsidy now, she was entitled to be so treated three years ago.",49
242,Mr STORRER,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,Why was not justice done by the Government which the honourable member held in the hollow of his hand ?,50
243,Mr CAMERON,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"That Government Gould not do what was necessary, because they had to adopt the estimates of their predecessors.  ber's fault-h e ought to have "" biffed them out.""",50
244,Mr CAMERON,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"If I had ""biffed them out,"" I might have "" biffed in "" a far worse Administration. The Labour Party "" biffed in "" a Ministry far inferior to which preceded it. I always judge men by what they do. The Reid-MCLean Administration had no opportunity to show what they could do. They were just settling down in office, and were preparing a programme, which I believe would have commended itself to the people of the Commonwealth to a far greater degree than the programme of this Government has done, when they were turned out of office. If they had not been turned out of office, they would have had the support of an independent majority, even though that majority consisted of only one member. The majority would never have forced the Government to make concessions iri order to retain office; but would have judged them upon the merits of their proposals.",50
245,Mr CULPIN,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,They were turned out of office because they had no proposals.,50
246,Mr CAMERON,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"They left office because they were disgusted with the duplicity and underhand work of some of those who were supposed to be supporting them. Like honest men they faced the music, and took their defeat with a good grace, I believe that, as the result of the next election, they will again be placed on the Treasury bench, and that they will reflect credit upon themselves and upon the country. If they do not succeed, we shlall probably again see upon the Ministerial benches the representatives of that small minority who allow their movements to be controlled in the same way that a dog wags its tail. The members of the present Administration are practically responsible for every Budget that has been submitted since the Federation has been established. The Budget has invariably been submitted by a Barton-Deakin, a Deakin-Tumer, or a Deakin-cum-Watson Administration. I submit that if it is fair to relieve Tasmania of the payment of the extra £7,000 per annum in respect to the present mail service, the Treasurer should come down and tell the House that, in all fairness, that State should have refunded to it the amount in excess of the old contract price paid during the past three years.  member ask for this before?",50
247,Mr CAMERON,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"Upon various occasions I have demanded that fair play should be extended to Tasmania, but, unfortunately, I have not commanded the support of as many representatives from that State as I should have liked.' Owing to the way in which its representatives are disthat tributed-tw o occupying seats upon one side of the Chamber, and three upon the other-ther e is practically only one voice representing it. Had I been able to command the same measure of support as a representative of Western Australia or Queensland is in a position to command, the fair claim which I have repeatedly urged on behalf of Tasmania would have received more attention. I trust, however, that after the approaching election the representatives of Tasmania will be animated by the same spirit, and will speak with a united voice. In the very near future, I hold that it will become absolutely necessary for the representatives of the smaller States to unite upon all matters directly affecting themselves. I quite recognise that this debate has been already prolonged, and that most of the subjects which have.been touched upon have been worn threadbare. I do not propose to repeat what has already been said, but I do propose to ask the people of Australia to consider the present situation Within the course of a few v weeks, the Government will be upon their trial before the electors.",50
248,Mr ROBINSON,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,The v will be convicted.,50
249,Mr CAMERON,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"Probabl v they wil? be. I would ask the people of the Commonwealth as a whole what benefits they haye received at the hands of the present Ministry? Can the Government point to any legislation which has been conceived in the best interests of the people as a whole? Certainly not. Possibly they!, may be able to point to certain manufacturers whom they have endeavoured to benefit. They may be able to point to certain States which have benefited considerably at the expense of the other States, but can they point to a single Act upon the statute-book which is calculated to benefit the people as a whole? I venture to say that they cannot. When the verdict is demanded from the people, I feel sure that they will say to the present Administration : "" Instead of proving yourselves able to control the destinies of Australia, you have allowed yourselves to become the tools of a third party. Upon you, therefore, rests the responsibility for the pernicious legislation which has been enacted at the instance of the Labour Party during the past four and a half years. It is idle for you to plead that you could not help yourselves. You could. If you were too weak to carry on with a minority, you could at least have adopted the dignified and honourable course of relinquishing; the reins of Government to somebody else. As you accepted the responsibility, you must accept our verdict. Our judgment upon yoiv is sudden death, and when you are consigned to your political tomb, only the two words ' no resurrection ' will be inscribed qpon your tombstone.""",50
250,Mr REID,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"East Sydney) [9.7]-- I should not intrude upon this debate at the present stage-havin g already spokenbut for the necessity which I ha%'e just discovered of making a statement to the House and the country. For some years past, I have been systematically libelled in a certain newspaper, known as the Melbourne Age, which has charged me wfth having expressed views in favour of creating a state of misery amongst the Australian people. Certain alleged quotations from publications of mine have appeared in that newspaper year after year, with the same vile insinuation attached to them. This morning I took up a copy of the Age, and in it I found certain alleged quotations from a book which I published- I think tliirty-one years ago-calle d ' Five Free trade Essays. These quotations are given in the Age as quotations which were used at a recent meeting. The first passage reads as follows: Will it not be time enough to manufacture everything for ourselves when we can save, instead of lose, by the operation? Will it not be well to reap the advantages of pauper labour until we are so great a nation that we can create essavs. pauper labour of our own? The article in the Age saysThat quotation, cited as it was in the course of a strong argument about Australia, aroused quite an excitement, and Mr Cock challenged his opponent with having quoted Mr Reid unfairly. He denied that Mr Reid ever wrote such words. The challenge was at once accepted. As to the accuracy of the quotation made by Mr. Haekeld, there is not the slightest doubt. The passage appears in Mr Reid's volume of "" Free trade Essays,"" a copy of which any one can obtain at the Melbourne Public Library. But this is not the only passage that proves these shocking ideas to have been definitely held by Mr Reid. That book was written twenty years ago; but he said in the Federal Parliament, on 31st October, igoi, as recorded in Hansard, page 6,800, volume 5, something that is of the same identical significance. That is to say, the similar "" shocking ideas-."" The article continuesHe was speaking on the Tariff, and used these words :"" How. are we going to compete with these underpaid sweated countries until our own labour is underpaid and sweated too? . . . It seems to me that the prospect of growing these noxious weeds of sweated industries on this bright continent should cause a man associated with the interests of labour to shudder. In the plenitude of time, when our millions become tens of millions, we shall have a crop of misery which will solve the difficulty in regard'to cheap manufactures."" Here are two different utterances, many years apart, both embodying the same idea. Mr. Reid looks forward to the time when Australia is to have sweated pauper labour. It is a goal he is working up to, as the precursor of Australian manufactures. Honourable members can see that there is an imputation of a wicked, deliberate design on my part to carry out a public policy which will involve the masses of the Australian people in want and misery. In the most heated political controversies between free-traders and protectionists in Australia, I clo not think that any free trader has ever imputed to any protectionist such deliberate wickedness, and I do not believe that any protectionist has ever imputed to any free-trader such deliberate wickedness. But this imputation of a wicked design to see my' fellow human creatures involved in misery is being repeatedly made in Victoria for an obvious purpose. I never dreamed that the wickedness of my opponents would go so far as to forge a quotation from my writings by taking words out of a sentence in order to substitute for them other words, which would convey a wicked idea which was certainly not conveyed in the free-trade I have never taken the trouble to verify these quotations, in spite of all these wicked attacks. But the statement in the Age to-dav that a copv of these Essavs was obtainable at the Melbourne Public Library led me for the first time to test the accuracy of these alleged quotations from tihat publication. I found that the ibook had been removed from the Parliamentary Library, but there is a copy in the Melbourne Public Library, and I have that copy before me. Now I wish to invite the attention of honourable members, and of tihe people of Australia, to the conduct which is being pursued towards me in reference to these quotations. Mr DAVI D THOMSON - Why not summon the publisher of the Age to the bar of the House?",51
251,Mr REID,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"I do not wish to do that. I desire now to refer to page 66 of my Five Free-trade Essays. These are the two sentences to which I refer: Will it not be time enough to manufacture everything for ourselves when we can save, instead of lose, by the operation? That sentence is correctly reproduced by the Age. Then the Essay continues:Will it not be well to reap the advantage of the pauper labour of other countries until we are so great a nation that we have pauper labour of our own. I was there* alluding to the inevitable result which, unhappily, has attended the growth of nations from time immemorial. It is recognised that the more the millions expand the more, unfortunately, is the amount of human suffering that seems to exist, and fhat in young, sparsely-settled communities which have large natural resources to draw upon, there is not as a rule that state of misery which exists in other countries which count their millions crowded on a low and compact small area. What do I find? That the wordshave pauper' labour of our own have been taken out of the sentence in the form in which it has been reproduced by the Age, and other words have been inserted to convey the wicked idea that I desired to create fJhat misery, this pauper labour. Whereas the Essay from which the Age professes to quote says:until we are so great a nation that we have pauper labour of our own. the alleged quotation appearing in that journal isuntil we are so great a nation that we can create pauper labour of own own. It is this wicked forgery of my words, in order to impute to me deliberate wickedness in the sense of creating human misery, against which I protest. The imputation is exactly the same as would be conveyed if one person, in speaking of a man who had a disease, had his words twisted to mean that he ihoped he would have a [no] disease. It is like altering a statement that a man has a cancer so as to make it appear that the hope was expressed that a cancer would be created. That fairly illustrates the difference between these two statements. Poverty, old age, or misery i,s a misfortune which attributes no wickedness to any one, but when a man speaks of creating misery and misfortune he expresses a wicked, deliberate design. We have such a perversion of words in this case. The word ""have"" has been omitted, and the words ""can create"" have been inserted. Was ever a meaner or viler act of trickery or villainy known in the public history of this country? But - the matter does not rest there. In the very sentence preceding the two I have mentioned, the sense in which I made that reference is shown. That sentence runs in these termsAre manufactures so prodigious a blessing, and the high wages which prove unfavorable to their extension so heavy a curse, that we should con-' trive to tax, worry, and depress the free energies of the people to promote the one at the expense of the other? 0 To promote manufactures at the expense of high wages! The whole of my argument throughout this essay was that we can never hope, under present conditions, to compete on equal terms in the markets of the world with industries in other countries which employ pauper labour. Instead of regarding the conditions of Aus1 tralian prosperity as a curse, I was seeking to battle to preserve those conditions in the development of the natural industries of the country. The whole of this work is a laboured argument, intended to show that in the interests of the working masses - in the interests of high wages and short hours of labour-w e should do better by developing our great natural resources than we should do in competing with 1 slop-makers in the over-crowded countries of Europe. As a matter of fact, no one knows better than does the honourable member for Melbourne Ports-as the' result of the work he has undertaken in connection with' the sweating evils of Melbourne-that the worse instances of sweating arise from the competition in the making of cheap clothes with the cheap productions of countries that have an overcrowded population.",52
252,Mr MAUGER,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,That is always our contention.,52
253,Mr REID,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"I was alluding to that state of things not as an evil which I wished to create or bring about, but as an evil which I wished to prevent. However much we may differ in our views on public questions, surely we should stop short of the wickedness of altering a. man's language in order to raise a wicked construction against him. Is there one honourable member of this House who could justify such conduct? The Prime Minister was indignant the other day at the action of the Argus in reference to..an announcement about a recommendation of the Tariff Commission. Will he not be equally indignant because of the villainous wrong ""done me by taking words out of my published work and putting in false words, in order to make it appear that I am a disgrace to my kind ? I should hope that he would. But this is not all. In this same newspaper today we have a reference to a speech that I delivered in this House when the Tariff was under consideration some years ago- a reference 'which is intended to show that the speech in question was a development of the same shocking ideas. If that newspaper had quoted the next few linesi it would have shown that I expressed my absolute abhorrence of such results. takes from page 6800 of Hansard, Volume V., session 1, a quotation from my speech ending, ""solve the difficulty in regard to cheap manufactures."" They stop there in order to show the horrible goal of human misery to which I am working up in Australia, and fail to quote another sentence within five lines which would have explained my position. I shall read the whole paragraphW ill the erection of a fence solve it? Never! We may run a ring around our lwn people, but we oan not bulldoze the markets of the world. When we come to compete with those .markets, we shall have to do as all other nations do. Now listen to the sentence that has been left outThat is why I have abhorred the policy of producing artificial industries, which belong to a period of human misery and over-population. Could anv man more honestly and clearly express the motives which animated him?",52
254,Mr CULPIN,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,When did we have that period of human misery in Australia?,53
255,Mr REID,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"I say that it has not occurred here, and that it is because of my desire to prevent its occurrence that I have shown' no sort of desire that Australia should enter into competition with industries that are produced by the pauper labour - as it is called by the protectionists-of 4 other countries. These are all matters of opinion; but - there is, I hope, no difference of opinion in this House on the point that in all our political fights we should refrain from perverting, twisting, suppressing, or altering the language of our political opponents, in order to inflict a wicked wrong upon them. Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear!",53
256,Mr THOMAS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,Is the right honourable member referring to his deputy leader ?,53
257,Mr REID,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,The honourable member ought not to make that statement.,53
258,Mr THOMAS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"I am referring to the way in which he attacks the honourable member for Bland, and seeks to twist his statements.",53
259,Mr REID,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"I have never observed any trace of such conduct in his fighting; but I am sure thati the honourable member for Barrier does not desire to justify this attack upon me. We should have reached a very sad time in our history if he did. Whatever our political views may be, I think that, as a body of men, we desire, at all events, to try to be fair to each other, and that we would stop short of tampering with a man's publication, and altering a The Age sentence in it , with the wicked intention of making ie appean that that man is an enemy of his fellow-creatures.",53
260,Mr WILKS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,The statement in question does not appear only in the Age. There is an exactly similar quotation in a leaflet issued by the Protectionist Association ,53
261,Mr REID,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,I do not know the source of this villainy.,53
262,Mr WILKS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,It comes from the one factory. .,53
263,Mr REID,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"I was not present when it was concocted; but I notice that there are two pencil marks on the leaf of the book from which I have been quoting, and which comes from the Public'Library. To show how utterly wrong these statements are, I should like to make from this work one or two quotations, which indicate over and over again the meaning of my references. I was discussing this questionWe now come to the last proposition : "" 4 . That the protective industries will eventually be able to do without protection, and that the Colonial will sell as cheaply as the imported article."" We are often assured that Australian manufactures and the "" native "" industry engaged in them, only require protection for a limited period, after which they will be able to compete in open market with foreign handicraft. That was the position with which I was dealing: the statement that if these industries had protection for a limited period they would become sufficiently strong to compete in the open markets of the woi*ld with those of other nations. I examined that proposition under these headings: "" A fall in the price of raw material""; ""Improved working and machinery""; "" A fall in the price of money "" ; and "" A fall in the rates of wages."" As honourable members will see, if we are ever to be able to compete on the open markets of the world on equal terms with other nations, we must study one or other or all of these factors-improve d machinery, the price of raw material, the price of money, and the rates of wages. I addressed myself to that question in order to see whether there was any reasonable prospect' of our ever meeting these overcrowded countries in the fields of open competition. I discussed the question of raw material: If we obtain cheap raw material, every other nation obtains it. . I discussed the question of improved machinery : If we secure improved machinery, every other nation must obtain it. Then, too, I discussed the price of money, and pointed out that it is not only very unlikely, but that it would be a sad thing if money were as cheap a commodity in a young country as it is in the older countries of the world. Then I proceeded to discuss the important question of rates of wages. Instead .of viewing the higher rates of wages which exist in Australia as a curse, I always referred to them in this work as the greatest possible blessing and sign of prosperity. I put the question of wages in this waySo long as Colonial labour is in demand at its present high rates, and works eight hours a day only, we cannot hope, and are foolish if we try, to compete in the vast majority of the branches of manufacturing industry with countries far more favourably' situated for such industries, that is to say, where labour is less valuable, wages lower, work longer, capital more abundant, and markets larger and more accessible ; and we have tried to show that those who attempt to neutralize the prosperity of the working men of Australia by heavy protective duties betray surprising ignorance of the real nature of wealth, and the true sources of national greatness. These views are shared by such honourable members as the honourable and learned member fer West Sydney, and no one would say that he is anxious to pose as an enemy of Australian labour. He holds these identical views, which may be right or wrong, and I think I may say that, in his case, as in mine, the desire is tb study the interest and welfare of the great masses of the people. r",53
264,Mr WILKS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,The same views are also shared by the honourable member for Barrier.,54
265,Mr REID,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"And also by the honourable member for Canobolas, the honourable member for Maranoa, and others. They are the last men in the world who would wish to involve the people in misery. It is our desire to avoid misery, and we think that all these artificial encouragements, in the long run, are a burden instead of an advantage to labour. We may be wrong, but the views that we hold are, at all events, prompted' by right motives. It is a sad thing that hatred so persistent as that which has beenshown towards me in Victoria should exist in an Australian community. No such ideas as have Been attributed to me by the Age would be attributed to me by any organ in New South Wales. In that State, no one has ever dreamt of imputing to me such wicked intentions in regard to those of my fellow countrymen who are poor as have been imputed by the Age in Melbourne - ",54
266,Mr DEAKIN,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,Perhaps hot; but similar ideas have been attributed to me.,54
267,Mr TUDOR,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,And to the members of the Labour Partv by both the free-trade and the protectionist newspapers.,54
268,Mr REID,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,I do not think that any newspaper writerin New South Wales ever took one of the honourable and learned member's books from the.Public Library and altered the statements he found there.,54
269,Mr DEAKIN,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,They have done worse. They have put into my mouth words which I have never uttered.,54
270,Mr JOHNSON,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,Is that' a justification for what has been done by the Age ?,54
271,Mr DEAKIN,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,It shows that there is np; difference between the people of Victoria and those of New South Wales.,54
272,Mr REID,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"I do not wish to suggest that there is any difference between the people of Victoria and those of New South Wales. These things are not done by the people of Victoria. If the honourable and learned member has been treated in the villainous way to which he refers, he,cannot denounce it more emphatically than I do. If such a thing has been done by any human being, on the press or off it, it was mean, wicked, and villainous, and the honourable and learned gentleman has my complete sympathy. Until today, I have not taken the trouble to verifv these quotations ; but the statement about the book being in the Public Library suggested to me that I should send for it. Having done so, I was horrified to discover that a forgery had been perpetrated. In the case of spoken utterances, all sorts of mistakes may occur through misreporting, without there being any deliberate intention to deceive. But no man can sit down in a public library, or elsewhere, and omit words from, or put words into, a passage which he is copying without a deliberate and wicked intention to injure some one. It remains to be seen whether these tactics will help the cause in which they are used. I shall very soon have an opportunity to visit a large number of centres in Victoria, and I shall then expose, as I have a right tb do,, the wicked means which have been usedby the Melbourne Age to discredit me. I hope that the tactics of that newspaper will have the same result as similar tactics had in regard to Senator Trenwith. tf the pamphlet, to which the honourable member for Dalley referred, has been issued by the Protectionist Association, the blame must fall upon the proper shoulders. These quotations have been made time after time in the Melbourne Age, and it it stated in that newspaper this morningAs to the .accuracy of the quotation made by Mr Haekeld, there is not the slightest doubt the passage appears in Mr Reid's volume of free trade essays, a copy of which any one can obtain in the Melbourne Public Library. It is there stated that the passage has been correctly quoted, and that the accuracy of the quotation can be verified on reference to the book in the Melbourne Library. That statement is absolutely false. It may have been made carelessly, the writer relying on the accuracy of some other publication ; but if it appears in any publication of the Melbourne Protectionist Association, and was not taken from the Melbourne Age-becaus e no one could blame the association for regarding the Age as accurate-if those responsible for sucb. publication have invented this wicked wrong, the blame will fall on them. That is a point which I hope will be cleared up. f ma$e the discovery to which I have referred only this evening, and I hope that honourable members will feel that I was therefore justified in saving what I. have said. I am much obliged to the honourable member for Herbert in kindly giving way to me.",54
273,Mr BAMFORD,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"Herbert) [9.34I - T should not have spoken to-night but for the speech of the honourable member for Wilmot. As a rule, the members of the Opposition who represent the Tasmanian electoral divisions, when they speak about the sugar duties, set up a wail as if Tasmania were paying an undue amount. They lose sight of the fact that, prior to Federation. Queensland paid practically no duties on sugar, the amount so paid in 1899 being only £ 9 2 , and in 1900 £ 1 0 6 . Last year, however, the people of that State paid over £80,000 in Excise and Customs duties, the amount paid in duty being very small; while this year it is estimated that they will pay about £ 8 r,ooo. In Tasmania, however, prior to Federation, the people were paying more in sugar duties than they are paying now, the amount so paid in 1899 being £46,200. and in 1900 £47,066, whereas last year the people of the State paid only £34,202 in Customs, Excise, and bounty, and their estimated payment for this year, is only £39,492, or £8,000 less than was paid prior to Federation.",55
274,Mr STORRER,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,The complaint made is. ' in regard to the loss by the Treasury.,55
275,Mr BAMFORD,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"No. Honourable members speak as though the people of Tasmania were paying more now in connection with the sugar industry than they were paying prior to Federation, whereas they are paying £8,000 a year less, the position of the people of Queensland being relatively worse than their position prior to Federation, and the position of the people of Tasmania being better. I do not think it fair that this wilful perversion of facts should be persisted in so continually. It has also been made to appear that no benefit has resulted from the payment of the sugar bounty ; but that is not so. The figures put before us by the Treasurer show that the position of the sugar industry is better now than it has been heretofore. Not only has the number of white farmers increased, but the acreage under white labour has also increased. It is estimated that, of 131,000 acres under sugar this year, 96,000 acres, or 70 per cent., are being cultivated by white labour; while about the same percentage of the sugar produced is being produced by white labour. Therefore, it is wrong to say that no benefit has accrued from the sugar bounty. I wish now to sav a word or two in regard to the proposed land tax. The honourable members for New England and Lang, who are professed single-taxers, condemn the proposal of the Labour Party as not extreme enough, although generally it is considered as too extreme. The honourable member for New England said the other night that it is silly to think that the proposed tax would break up the large estates, because it would be inefficient and abortive. leader of the Opposition, however, and some of his followers, have objected to our proposal on the ground that it is the introduction of the thin end of the wedge, and, as such, it should commend itself to the honourable members to whom I have referred. Only recently the Melbourne newspapers of two consecutive days contained two very remarkable statements. It was stated, in the first instance, in the Argus that the estates belonging to Sir .Rupert Clarke at Keilor Plains, Sunbury, and another the name of which I forget, comprising over 100,000 acres, had been offered to the Victorian Government, and these estates were valued' for taxation purposes at £ 9 8 , 0 0 0. Next day, ever, it was stated ir. the Age that the land in question is estimated to be worth something like £ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 . Those two - statements show, first, that land is being held im very large blocks, so that many who desire to settle upon it are unable to do so, and, secondly, that the country is being defrauded of legitimate revenue because taxation is not paid upon fair valuations. Some of this land is worth from £ j 5 to £ 2 0 per acre, and the whole of it is good land. The honourable member for Wilmot claims to be the son of a pioneerone of those men who, during the time that the blacks were very aggressive, carried their lives in their hands. No doubt they had to put up with many hardships, but they have had the advantage of a very good thing for a sufficiently long time, and should be content to let some one else have a. look in. The Labour Party have put forward their land taxation proposal, because the States Parliaments have not the courage to legislate in the desired direc, tion, or have not the power to do so. So long as the States Legislative Councils are representative of the propertied classes, it will be impossible to carry through a reasonable measure of land taxation, and it, therefore, rests upon this democratic Parliament to fill the breach. Thirty years ago there was a much larger population in some of the western counties of Victoria than is to be found there to-dav. In the interval, millions of pounds have been spent in building railways and affording' better means of communication and improved facilities for the carriage of produce. The honourable member for Wilmot says that if we need the land now held by private individuals, we should pay them the market price. I would point out, howThe ever, that the additional value has been given to the land by the construction of railways and other public works, and the people are asked to buy this land at a high price, the added value being created by the people themselves. For example, who created the City of Melbourne and the high values of property in that metropolitan centre today ? When the site of the city was first sold, the land realized £273,000. To-day it is valued at between £ 9 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 and £10,000,000. Who gave it that added value? Not the people living on the land, not the purchasers of the property, but the general public.",55
276,Mr REID,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,That does not justify a how- tax varying according to the area of land held- a progressive land tax is not justified from that point of view.,56
277,Mr BAMFORD,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,I fail to see how the honourable and learned member can take that view.,56
278,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,The honourable member is arguing for the nationalization of land.,56
279,Mr BAMFORD,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,The honourable member never heard me mention anything about nationalization of land.,56
280,Mr REID,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"The honourable member may not have said it, but that is what it meant.",56
281,Mr BAMFORD,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,The right honourable gentleman is now doing that which he strongly objects to on the part of others. He is putting words into the mouths of the Labour Party.,56
282,Mr REID,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"I was going to quote the New South Wales Labour platform, which has, as one of its special planks, the nationalization of land.",56
283,Mr BAMFORD,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"The Labour Party in this House is the Federal Labour Party, and we are responsible for our own platform, and for no other.",56
284,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,But the gun is a double-barrelled one all the same.,56
285,Mr BAMFORD,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"Yes ; and I think that it will go off. Now I wish to say a few words with regard to the right honourable member for East Sydney. He has been good enough to visit the electorates of Wide Bay and Capricornia, and has also done me the honour to visit my electorate.",56
286,Mr REID,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,Not on the honourable member's account. I wanted to see a little of Queensland.,57
287,Mr BAMFORD,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"The ostensible purpose of the right honourable gentleman was to arouse the people to the necessity of going to the poll. He besought them to go to the poll, and record their votes, whether they voted in!"" favour of his party or some other.",57
288,Mr REID,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,Was not that perfectly right?,57
289,Mr BAMFORD,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"-Yes , but I wish to point out that the right honourable gentleman ought to have stayed at home and aroused the electors of East Sydney. He went into the Wide Bay electorate, where 67.26 per cent, of the electors on the roll recorded their votes. This was the highest proportion in the Commonwealth. visited the electorate of Capricornia, where 59 per cent, of the electors on the roll recorded their votes. After having aroused the people there, he extended his travels to my electorate.",57
290,Mr REID,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,The honourable member will never forgive me for that.,57
291,Mr BAMFORD,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"I bear the right honourable member no enmity. If his visit has the effect of inducing a larger number of persons to vote, they will probably render my majority all the larger, and, therefore, I can freely give him my blessing. right honourable gentleman went up to North Queensland, where the climate is supposed to be so warm that the people have not sufficient energy to even take a drink, in order to beseech the electors to go to the poll. Although the electors in Herberthave no facilities such as exist in more populous localities for reaching the polling places, and have no trams or omnibuses to convey them place to place, the second average of votes was recorded-63.2 3 per cent, of the electors on the roll went to the poll. The third highest record was obtained in the Wentworth electorate, in which 62.62 per cent, of the electors voted. There, however, they have every facility for reaching the polling places. Now, I wish to point out how much more profitable it would have been for the right honourable gentleman to have remained in his own electorate to awaken the people there to the necessity of exercising the franchise. At the last election for East Svdney, only 38.76 per cent, of the electors recorded their votes.",57
292,Mr REID,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,I ran a bye-ther e was no serious opposition.,57
293,Mr BAMFORD,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,There was no bye about it.,57
294,Mr REID,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"The opposition was not good enough to ""extend"" me.",57
295,Mr BAMFORD,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"I'h e right honourable gentleman polled 6,191 votes, and Mr. Harry Foran polled 2,139 votes. There, were two other candidates named Cleary and Toomey. The right honourable gentleman, who is always complaining about representatives being returned to this House by minority votes, was supported on the occasion referred to by only 23.14 per cent, of the electors on the roll. TJnder these circumstances, I think that he would have spent his time to greater advantage by impressing upon the electors of East Sydney Then he the desirability of performing their duties as citizens.",57
296,Mr REID,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"I intend fo rouse them up, too. ' Mr BAMFORD - Honourable members may recollect when the right honourable gentleman approached the Speaker in the most dignified manner, and handed in his resignation, declaring that no longer would he put up with the gerrymandering operations of the Government, who were making such a hash of things that the elections could not be fought out upon a fair basis. The Then he went to East Sydney, and banged' the political drum for all it was worth. The honourable member for Macquarie was sent for to assist in bringing electors to the poll. And what was the result ? What had the Sydney Morning Herald to say about it? In their issue of the 25th August. 1903, these head-iines appeared in regard to the honourable member's opening meetingfrom Great Concourse of People : Tremendous Enlargest thusiasm : The Electorate's Bungling. Scathing Indictment of the Government. Then it was stated that the meeting was to start at eight o'clock, butby half-past seven the Town Hal! was more than crammed with humanity. From that time onwards the seemingly impossible task of compressing some hundreds of people into a space which was already strained to the utmost proceeded. Then the following phrases were used :Whole-hearted Electrifying Enthusiasm : Magic Power of Swaying Audiences. After the election, the Herald stated that a much larger vote had been expected, but explained that probably the deficiency was. accounted for to some extent by the fact that the polling day was not a holiday. Now, let us see what the results were. There were is,763 'electors on the roll, and after all the electoral drum-beating that had been going on, how many votes do honourable members think were polled?",57
297,Mr REID,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,I had no one worth mentioning against me.,58
298,Mr BAMFORD,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"The right honourable gentleman had two opponents^ one named Macguire, and another named Blake. The former polled 259 votes, and the latter 96 vqtes, whilst the right honourable gentleman had 1,697 votes cast in his favour. Yet he had the temerity to go into my electorate with a view to inducing the electors to take some interest in the elections.",58
299,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,He won by six votes to one.,58
300,Mr REID,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"Yes , and I was perfectly satisfied. The honourable member will not secure such a sweeping majority.",58
301,Mr BAMFORD,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"I would counsel the right honourable gentleman to give a"" little more attention to his own electorate, to leave alone those in which percentage of votes has been recorded.",58
302,Mr WILKS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"Dallev) [9.50] - The Treasurer has been complimented upon having brought in the rosiest Budget that has ever been, presented in Australia. It is all very well to say that the Budget is a marvel'of accountancy, but it is not very rosy when regarded from the stand-point of the general public. Fortunately, we are on the up-grade, and we can congratulate ourselves upon the signs of progress which are to^be found amongst us. Australia must be a great country when it can afford to maintain so many Parliaments as Not a single honourable member during the course of this debate has touched upon the economy which we were assured would be practised under Federation Instead of savings having been made in the cost of government, the expenditure in this direction has been vastly augmented'. the honourable member for Parramatta men:-tioned that fact the other day the Treasurer brushed it aside with the remark that the difference wa due to an increase in the cost of certain services. that there has been an all-round, increase so far as the governmental machine is concerned, and' I am not at all surprised that the States are closelv watching the actions of this Parliament. The more necessitous States naturally feel the nnancial pinch more acutely than do the other States of the Union. This evening the honourable member for Grey availed himself of the : opportunity presented by the Budget debate to deal with the question of land reform. I have no desire to be at all personal, but there are some honourable members who use the word "" finance"" very frequently during their speeches as if it had a magic ring about it. If they can only succeed in introducing the word "" national "" before it, they appear to think that other honourable members should be prepared to accept their dictum. I am not willing to do anything of the sort. In the course of his Budget, the Treasurer presented certain proposals in reference to taking over the States debts. I believe that the Government will father those proposals in due time, but so far they have not done so.",58
303,Sir JOHN FORREST,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,The honourable member was evidently not present when I delivered my Budget.,58
304,Mr WILKS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,Then I understand that and the Government do accept the scheme of a much higher the Treasurer? ,58
305,Sir JOHN FORREST,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,Certainly .,58
306,Mr WILKS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"Then I am justified in asking when they intend to submit those proposals to the House in a concrete form? In my judgment no honourable member has presented a .scheme for the transfer of the States debts which would be nearly as satisfactory as the Braddon section vvith some modification would prove. In this connection my remarks have special reference to Western Australia, South Australia, and Tasmania.",58
307,Mr DAVID THOMSON,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,How about it does. Queensland ?,58
308,Mr WILKS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"In New South Wales and Victoria old-age pensions systems already exist. The only States in which similar provision has not been made are Western Australia, South Australia, and 1 Tasmania. With a modification of the When Braddon section, I claim that their particular circumstances might be full y provided for. I cannot understand what is to be gained from the Commonwealth taks ing over the States debts. In the ordinary I maintain walks of life I have never discovered an individual who was anxious to shoulder another's obligations. Certainly I have never found anybody who was eager to relieve me of mine.",58
309,Mr THOMAS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,Can the honourable member understand the States objecting to the transfer of their debts?,58
310,Mr WILKS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"I cannot. When I am assured that the States debts can be converted by the Commonwealth at a profit, I am asked to believe that the brokers in London are so blind to the conditions of Australia that they will permit that to be done without receiving any consideration. I cannot believe that they will surrender their stocks merely for the purpose of pleasing the Treasurer.",59
311,Sir JOHN FORREST,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,We do not propose to ask them to convert their stocks until they are nearing maturity.,59
312,Mr WILKS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"Exactly . The honourable member for Mernda built his entire scheme upon the assumption that the Commonwealth would be able to borrow at 3 per cent, when these loans matured. But that is all a matter of pure speculation. At the same time, I cannot see why we require a High Commissioner in London if he is not to be vested with power to deal with the debts in Australia. The more honoured and capable he is, the more desirous will he be of obtaining powers the exercise of which are essential to his high office. His most important function will be to deal with the finances of Australia. But I rose chiefly for the purpose of referring to the Labour Party. The le?der of that party, in the course of his remarks upon the Budget, declared that a Federal progressive land tax was not intended to raise revenue, but was designed to burst up large estates, so that the landclared less Door might be afforded an opportunity of coming into their heritage. I am one of those who believe that the land question is at the root of the industrial troubles of Australia, but I am not prepared to accept a scheme of that character as a solution of the problem. The Labour Party propose to exempt all lands the unimproved value of which is less than £5,000. It seems 'to me that their proposal is merely a revival of the old scheme in reference to land values taxation, with evils which did not attach to it when its adoption was advocated in New South Wales. Upon estates the unimproved value of which is more than £.5,000, and less than £10,000, a tax of i d . in the £ 1 is fo be levied. Thus £10 8S. 4d. would have to be paid upon an estate the unimproved value of which was £10,000. The honourable member for Bland wishes the country to believe that the luckv holder of such an estate would relinquish his holding rather than pay that amount.",59
313,Mr BROWN,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,The honourable member's leader says that our proposal amounts to confiscation.,59
314,Mr WILKS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"The leader of the Labour Partv affirms that the effect of the operation of such a tax would be to burst up large estates. This afternoon the honourable member for Canobolas raised a pitiful wail on behalf of the landless poor of New South Wales.. I am endeavouring to show the absurdity of the idea that an annual tax of £ 1 0 8s. 4d. would compel the holder of £10,000 worth of unimproved land values to sacrifice his holding.",59
315,Mr THOMAS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,The honourable member does not think that that is confiscation?,59
316,Mr WILKS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,I do not. The Labour Party themselves admit that very little revenue will be derived from such a tax. In his Budget speech the Treasurer entirely ignored the subject of a Federal progressive land tax.,59
317,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,He does not agree with it.,59
318,Mr WILKS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"No ; but the Prime Minister, since the Budget speech was delivered, has intimated that He favours sucb a tax. He recited his own action in the Victorian Parliament in support of it.",59
319,Sir JOHN FORREST,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,I Have never read anything of such a statement.,59
320,Mr WILKS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,I would not wittingly make a statement which was not correct. I repeat that the Prime Minister Has dehimself in favour of a progressive land tax.,59
321,Sir JOHN FORREST,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,When ?,59
322,Mr WILKS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,Quite recently. The Labour Party have put before the country a proposal to levy a tax upon improved land values for Federal purposes.,59
323,Mr HUTCHISON,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,The honourable member is in favour of that?,59
324,Mr WILKS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"Does the honourable mem' ber wish the public to believe that a man holding £10,000 worth of unimproved land values would have his estate burst up if he were required to pay an annual tax amounting to £ 1 0 8s. 4d. ?",59
325,Mr HUTCHISON,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"In South Australia the very fact of an increased land tax being proposed caused some holders to part with their, lands.",59
326,Mr WILKS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"If the honourable member were the lucky owner of an estate the unimproved value of which was £10,000, would he burst it up rather than pay a tax* of £ 1 0 per annum?",59
327,Mr HUTCHISON,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,The honourable member is referring only to that part of the tax which is designed to provide for old age pensions.,60
328,Mr WILKS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"In the case of estates having, an unimproved value of £ 6 0 , 0 0 is proposed that a tax equal to 3d. in the £ 1 should be imposed.",60
329,Mr REID,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"That , would be equal to 5s. in the £ 1 on the annual income.",60
330,Mr WILKS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,On an estate' having an unimproved value of £ 6 0 . 0 0 0 the tax would amount to £ 5 7 2 8s. 46. per annum.,60
331,Mr FISHER,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,The statement as to the tax being equal to 3d. in the £ 1 is not accurate.,60
332,Mr WILKS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"I am prepared to back my own figures, and should like the leader of the Labour Party to say whether this tax is proposed for revenue or for reform.",60
333,Mr WATSON,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,I have answered that question times out of number.,60
334,Mr WILKS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"-Would the owner of an estate having an unimproved value of £ 6 0 , 0 0 0 burst it up rather than pay an annual tax of £ 5 7 2 ?",60
335,Mr WATSON,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,Will the honourable member explain our proposals to the farmers' unions ?,60
336,Mr WILKS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"Yes ; I could do so far better than the honourable member could. He has changed his - opinions with regard to this question on two or three different occasions. In the first place he favoured a substantial exemption; then he considered that there should be no exemption; and he now comes forward with a proposal that all estates, the unimproved value ofi which is £ 5 , 0 0 0 , and under, shall be exempt.",60
337,Mr WATSON,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,When did I change my views? The honourable member is romancing.,60
338,Mr REID,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"But the present scheme proposes a £ 5 , 0 0 0 exemption. ' Mr WATSON - That is so.",60
339,Mr WILKS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"I do not own even a sheet of bark, whereas most of the members of the Labour Party are fortunate enough to be landed proprietors. While they speak on behalf of many of the squatters of the community, I am putting forward a plea on behalf of the landless poor. I fail to see how such a tax as is proposed would lead to the breaking up of large estates.",60
340,Mr WATSON,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,Does the honourable ber suggest a more drastic tax?,60
341,Mr WILKS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"If it wore a tax proposed to be imposed by a State Parliament, I tainly should. I should say at once that all exemptions should be abolished. [in] honourable member for Bland is aware that, as a membet of the State Parliament of New South Wales, I was always opposed to exemptions of any kind. Land taxation is within the control of the States, and it 0 , it' would appear that the Labour Party are proposing a Federal land tax as a short cut to unification. They say that the States Parliaments will not pass a sound, progressive land tax.",60
342,Mr THOMAS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"The right honourable member for East Sydney, on the occasion of his great Sydney speech, ptomised to introduce direct taxation proposals in the Federal Parliament.",60
343,Mr REID,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,Neve r mind what he said.,60
344,Mr WILKS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"I could understand such a proposal on the part of a State Government, but I feel satisfied that the States Parliaments will resist the imposition of such a tax by the Federal Legislature. If the public of Australia considered that this was an attempt to secure unification, the proposed tax would certainly not meet with the approval' which the Labour Party anticipate. In New South Wales, we already have a land tax and a municipal tax, and we shall also have a shire tax.",60
345,Mr BROWN,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,The shire tax is handed over to the shire councils.,60
346,Mr WILKS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"I regard the progressive land tax proposed by the Labour Party as being unlikely to effect the purpose for which it is intended. It will be revenue producing, and certainly will not lead to the bursting up of large estates. The party have carefully provided for the exemption of all estates having an unimproved value of £5,000 and under, feeling sure, no doubt, that as the result of this, they will add largely to their voting strength. They believe, also, that the scheme will secure the support of thousands who do not own any land. As a-matter of fact, there is not a block of land in my electorate to which the exemption would not apply, so that . if I chose, I might safely pose as an advocate of the tax. But I aip prepared to accept the responsibility of refusing to follow the Labour Partv proposal.",60
347,Mr HUTCHISON,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,Does the honourable member complain that we do not propose memto tax land in his electorate?,60
348,Mr WILKS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,The honourable member will admit that it is something in the cernature of a novelty to find an honourable member resisting a tax which will net afThe fect his own electorate. No one knows better than I do what could be said in favour of such taxation by a candidate who was addressing those who would not be affected by it ; and no one knows better than I do that this proposed tax is a sham and a piece of political hypocrisy.,60
349,Mr HUTCHISON,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,On e of the biggest of the land monopolies exists in my electorate. How would the honourable member deal with it?,61
350,Mr WILKS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"If the proposal were introduced in the State Parliament of New South Wales, no one would more strongly support it than I should do. I have no desire to prolong my remarks. The present debate has been availed of by some honourable members fo make policy speeches, and I felt that the opportunity to discuss the land taxation proposals of the. Labour Party was an opportune one. The honourable Treasurer has been congratulated upon his Budget statement, but I find in it nothing which will be gratifying to the public. It contains no promise of reduced taxation. On the contrary, it intimates that increased' services and a consequent increase of expenditure must be provided for. If the expenditure of the Federation continues to increase, it will cause the electors of Australia to feel more convinced than ever that we have too many Governors, too many Governments, and too manv Parliaments.",61
351,Sir JOHN FORREST,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"Swan-Trea surer) [10.28] - I regret that I am called upon at this late hour to reply to the debate, but as it is the desire of the Government that the debate shall conclude tonight, I shall endeavour to so condense my remarks that I will occupy the attention of the Committee for only a very short time. I thank honourable members for the way in which they have criticised the Budget. I think that the statements which have been made as to increased expenditure, and in regard to supposed extravagance on the part of the Commonwealth, are not well founded. A great deal has been said about the estimated increase of £525,374 in the expenditure this year, but when honourable members analyze the figures, they will recognise that all the increases are justifiable. The estimated expenditure this year is £413,942 in excess of last year's estimate. We have to remember, however, that we saved last year £111,000, and that, as has been the case every year since the establishment of Federation, we mav find at the end of the Nnancial year that our estimate has not been reached. The estimated increase of £525,374 is made up as follows:-Suga r bounties, as provided by law, £130,394; defence-owin g to changes in the cadet system and increases in other directions£ 7 2 , 4 5 1; new works, defence material, & c, £16.0,004; elections and electoral expenses, which do not occur every year, £S5,9°o; repatriation of Kanakas, which is new expenditure, £25,000; increase in the estimates of the Post and Telegraph Department, set off by increase of revenue, £68,714; and difference between, sundry increases and decreases, £12,911. None of these items could have been avoided, and the charge of extravagance cannot be applied to anv of them. For my own part, I think that the more closely honourable members examine these figures, the more readily they will agree that the increase is what might have been expected. The debate has centered principally round the proposals of the Government in regard to penny postage and the taking over of the debts of the States. With regard to the former, it must be remembered that more than half the population of Australia already enjoys penny postage to a limited extent. Except in South Australia, where the rate is uniformly 2d., the people living in most of the cities and towns of the Commonwealth are charged only id. for. the delivery of letters within those centres of population, while the rate is only id. throughout Victoria. We have already made uniform and reduced our telegraph rates, with the result that the community has benefited, and the revenue has been increased. To those who say that we cannot afford penny postage, I would submit the following figures :c 3 c for V <a ci 33 enn y State h - a a Ol cs> - W rH -=1 g g 1=1 .1=1 rt g -43 T-* +1 £- +3 EH Sop £ 1 £ £ < £ NewSouthWales 1,014,000 1,075,000 --(-61,000 ssjooo Victoria Queensland . . 096,000 336,000 751,000 347,000 +55,000 +11,000 14.000 29,000 South Australia 276,000 2S4.000 +3,000 28,000 West Australia 247,000 245,000 -2,000 19,000 Tasmania 113,000 111,000 -2,000 14,000 Totals . . 2,CS2,000 2,813,000 131,000 157,006 Thus it will be seen that, after allowing £157,000 for possible loss of revenue by the adoption of penny postage, the estimated revenue for this year is .£131,000 more than the estimated revenue for last year, while the estimated expenditure for this year is only £ 8 8 , 6 8 7 more than the actual expenditure for last year. actual postal revenue received in 1905-6 was £ 2 , 8 2 4 , 1 8 2 , and the expenditure was £ ) 6 3 7 , 5 i 6 , leaving a profit on the year of 2 £186,666. For the financial year 1906-7 the estimated revenue is £2.81.3,000, and the estimated expenditure £ 2 , 7 2 6 , 2 0 3, an estimated profit of £ 8 6 , 7 9 7 , and this pro/it observed unless it is amended. is after allowing £157,00 0 as the loss of revenue due to the penny post.",61
352,Mr STORRER,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"The Deputy Postmaster General for Tasmania' has estimated the loss to that State at £ 2 2 , 0 0 0 .",62
353,Sir JOHN FORREST,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"My figures were obtained from the Postmaster-General. The proposal to establish penny postage was objected to for various reasons, but chiefly because the Governments of the various States want more money.",62
354,Mr DAVID THOMSON,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,There is already a loss on the working of the Postal Department in Queensland.,62
355,Sir JOHN FORREST,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"I have just shown that the estimated postal revenue of Queensland is £ 1 1 , 0 0 0 more this year than it was last year, notwithstanding an allowance of £ 2 9 , 0 0 0 for penny post, and our contention is that the expansion of revenue in all the States is a justification for our proposal. Moreover, it is a liberal and generous proposal to make, and will undoubtedly be acceptable to the people. It is not equality of treatment that the inhabitants of Victoria should enjoy pennv postage throughout their State, and the inhabitants of the various cities and towns in four of the other States should enjoy penny postage within certain areas, while the toilers, who are the backbone of the country, are not permitted to share those benefits.",62
356,Mr DAVID THOMSON,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,It better to raise the postage in the towns.,62
357,Sir JOHN FORREST,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"My desire is to take off burdens, not to impose additional ones. I wish I had more time in which to reply to the criticisms levelled against our proposals for taking over the debts of the States, and particularly to deal with the scheme of the honourable member for Mernda. In my opinion, he has, to a large extent, ignored the provisions of the Constitution. If we were the members of a Convention, engaged in devising a scheme for the taking over of the debts of the States by the Common[111]- 2 wealth, untrammelled by the provisions of the Constitution, we might be able to act on different lines from those proposed' to The be followed by the Government. But the Constitution will not allow us to take over all the debts of the States, and section 94 of the Constitution to which the honourable member for Mernda referred as being of a temporary character is of a permanent character, and will have to be Then, again, the honourable member proposed that we should at once arrange to return a fixed sum to the States; but that can only be done after the 31st December, 1910, because section 87, the Braddon section, meanwhile stands in the wav. Unless the Constitution is amended, that section must continue in operation until the date mentioned, and thereafter until Parliament otherwise provides. Then, again, the Constitution makes provision of the most definite character, in section 105, as well as in section 87, which the honourable member for Mernda seems to have ignored. It is there laid down in the most absolute terms that each State shall pay its own debts and the interest due upon them, and shall indemnify the Commonwealth for any payments made by it in respect to interest or principal in connection with such debts. The honourable member for Mernda seemed to infer that I wished to take over only £103,000,000 of the States debts - I have been misunderstood by him in this matter, and the press seem to have also misunderstood me-althoug h paragraph 8 of my memorandum reads as follows:I recommend that legislative provision be made for taking over by the Commonwealth of the whole of the existing State debts, why=h amounted in the aggregate on 30th June, 1905, to ^236,680,739; but, as by section 105 of the Constitution only the State debts "" as existing at the establishment of the Commonwealth,"" which on the same date amounted to would be ^201,983,386 (vide Tables D and F herewith), can be legally dealt with, and, as it must take some time to obtain an amendment of the Constitution, I advise that the legislation should provide for dealing with the ^201,983,386 at once, and that the balance of ^34.6g7.3S3 be d e a l t with so soon as the required amendment of the Constitution is obtained. By adopting this course the conversion or redemption of loans approaching maturity could be dealt with at once by the Commonwealth. Then I go on to say in sub-paragraph (1) of paragraph 8 that I recommendThat a law be passed enabling the whole of the State debts to be converted before maturity, or redeemed at maturity by the Commonwealth (subject in regard to debtsincurred since, ist January, 1901, lo the necessary amendment of the Constitution), by such successive operations as may be thought fit. It is also objected that the proposals of the Government are of a temporary, and not of a permanent, character. I am personally concerned, I am quite willing that they should be made to extend, if not indefinitely, at any rate for a long period; but I still think that it is unwise to make any such provision. It is not in the interests of the States that any permanent arrangement should be made now. The limitation as to time is in the interests of both parties, and especially in the interests of the States. I think that .fifteen years hence we shall be in a far better position than at present to finally deal with this matter. In the - meantime, we shall be working under the plan proposed, and shall have opportunities to judge as to its suitability or otherwise. My own opinion is that it will work well, and continue in operation for many years. At any rate, this Parliament will retain all its powers, and will be able to deal' with the whole question far more effectively, and, I believe, far more wisely at the end of 1920 than at the present time. The proposals of the honourable member for Mernda and of others who have been good enough to criticise the proposals of the Government, are that the Commonwealth should at once take over the whole of the States debts, and-become at once responsible for the payment of interest and the repayment of the principal. This proposal would confer upon the present holders of stock any profit that might arise from the transfer. In mv memorandum I expressed my matured opinion on this proposal, after having consulted eminent financial authorities in England, in the following terms:The financial authorities whom I consulted in London were unanimous in the opinion that it would be disadvantageous to place the Commonwealth brand on State stocks before conversion, as such action would prevent the possibility of any profitable conversion, and would be making to the existing holders a present of any in price caused by the additional Commonwealth security.",62
358,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"Of course, it might, but how could we obtain the profit?",63
359,Sir JOHN FORREST,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"We would be likely to derive a profit, because the holders of stock would come to us. It is always better to be sought after than to go seeking - If , when the existing State bonds are approaching maturity, or even when they are a long way off maturity, the bond-holders find that the Commonwealth stocks of the same denomination and currency are more negotiable, and are bringing a better price than similar Statesi So far as stocks, they will come to us and seek to exchange stock for stock, vide paragraph 6, sub-paragraph 6, of my memorandum. Should this occur, we shall then be in a position to indicate the terms on which we would be prepared to exchange Commonwealth stock for the State stock.",63
360,Mr HENRY WILLIS,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,Will they give £4 for £3?,63
361,Sir JOHN FORREST,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"I listened very attentively to the honourable member, but his observations, I regret to say, did not carry conviction to my mind. I think that the authorities whom I consulted may be relied upon in this matter., I have had in writing from the Secretary of the Imperial Treasury the very substance of the paragraph which I have last read, and I fully rely upon his great knowledge and experience on this matter. In my opinion until we convert the loans, we should not pay the interest, but should leave that responsibility on the shoulders of the States. That is a far better plan than for the Commonwealth to pay the interest and to look to the States for the money. Difficulties might arise if we attempted to do as has been suggested. When one person has to find the money for another, difficulty sometimes arises in procuring the necessary funds at the proper time. On the other hand, if persons have to find inoney for themselves they generally do it much more readily. It has been complained on several occasions during this debate that the proposals of the Government are too liberal to the States. I am glad that our proposals are considered liberal to the States, as I recognise most thoroughly that this is a time when we should treat the States as liberally as possible, and recognise also to the full the great obligations that rest upon them. They have to increase provide for the maintenance of law and order, and Courts of Justice, for the development of the land and mines, and for all kinds of settlement. They have to make roads, and construct tramways and raihvays and other means of transit; they have to provide for water supply and harbour works; and, in fact, for everything connected with the every-day life of the people. All these matters necessitate a large expenditure, and in these early days we must do our ibest to assist the States in every way that we can. A great deal has been said by the honourable member for Mernda and the honourable member for Bland regarding what would happen if, after the Commonwealth had guaranteed the return of a fixed sum to the States, the revenue declined so that we had not the funds to permit us to carry out our compact. I would like to ask them what all the States have to do-and they have obligations to meet amounting to hundreds of thousands of pounds-whe n bad times come upon them? They have to effect all sorts of economies, and to furnish funds for their needs. The Commonwealth will have to do the same. If hard times come upon us, we shall have to curtail our expenditure, and to provide other sources of income. The argument that having guaranteed the return of so many million pounds to the States we might not be able to pay it, has no weight with me. If we undertake to provide a certain amount we shall have to find it in the same way that the States have to face their obligations. Although I do not anticipate any difficulty in that direction, I say that we should occupy exactly the same position as is occupied by anybody else, whether a private citizen or a Government, who enters into an obligation. It seems to me that I put the position very clearly in paragraph 12, which readsThe effect of this plan would be that the Commonwealth, having arranged its taxation so as to provide sufficient funds to pay annually the required contribution to the States, and also cient to provide for all its own general and special expenditure, would then be free from any further financial obligation to the States. States, on the other hand, would be free from uncertainty as to the amount they were to annually receive from the Commonwealth, while both Commonwealth and States would know their exact financial positions and obligations, and would have the burden separately placed upon them, of making both ends meet. This is not the case at present, since any extra expenditure by the Commonwealth means a diminution of the amount returnable to the States. Some honourable members have asked, "" What is the object, of taking over the States debts? Why should we be in a hurry to take over their obligations, especially when the States themselves do not seem anxious for us to do so"" ? My reply is - that it was part of the understanding upon which the Federation was established. We believed then-and we still believe-that a great saving would result to the people of Australia if such an undertaking were properly managed. To my mind, the object which we should keep in view is that of affording relief to the States as soon as possible. That can best be done by applying any savings which we may make to a reduction of the annual payments by the States. The honourable member for Mernda is of opinion that any savings which we may effect should Le devoted to a sinking fund. My idea is that what the people of the States require is early relief. They desire that as a result of the taking over of the States debts they should pay less interest than they are at present paying. It must always be remembered in connection with this matter that the Commonwealth would derive no benefit from any such saving. Every single sixpence of profit which might be' made would be placed to the credit of the particular State concerned. That was the intention of the Constitution, and was the main reason why provision was made for the transfer of the States debts to the 'Commonwealth. The honourable member for Mernda, under his scheme, hopes to make a large profit, but instead of devoting that profit to the particular States concerned, he would hand it over to the other States. I submit that that is not only unfair, but is not in accordance with the iConstitution.",63
362,Mr FISHER,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,Where does he say that?,64
363,Sir JOHN FORREST,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,He says that ' the profit should be applied to paying off the debts of the other States.,64
364,Mr FISHER,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,Does he not calculate that suffi- their population will have greatly increased ?,64
365,Sir JOHN FORREST,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"After the The States debts have been paid he does not say what will happen, but the assumption is that nothing whatever from Customs and Excise revenue will be returned to the States. But he proposes that in the interval any piofits which might be made should be devoted to paving off the debts of the other States. In effect, his proposal broadly is that the Commonwealth should take over the whole of the Customs and Excise revenue for ever, and in return should assume responsibility for and pay off the States debts, amounting to £236,000,000. In fifty or sixty years after their taking over those debts would be liquidated, and then the Commonwealth would have all the Customs and Excise revenue, and return none of it to the States. I would point out that even in Canada the return to the States of a per capita amount is secured for ever, and that it was never intended that the whole of the Customs and Excise revenue should be retained by the Commonwealth.",64
366,Mr WATSON,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,The States would be very glad to forego their Customs and Excise revenue if they could get their debts paid.,65
367,Sir JOHN FORREST,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,Would they be prepared to forego it for ever?,65
368,Mr WATSON,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,Yes .,65
369,Sir JOHN FORREST,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"I am positive they would not think of agreeing to such a proposal. Speaking for my own State, I say that Western Australia would not look at such a proposal. have here a table which has been prepared by the Treasury officials, which shows that under the scheme of the honourable member for Mernda the people of New South Wales, Victoria, and Western Australia would contribute no less than £26,353,478 for the redemption of loans belonging to Queensland, South Australia, and Tasmania. The table readsDebtsofeach to be paid off - Suite (at by each State 30. as). under Mv. Har& £ N.S.W. 82,321,008 88,827 997 Vie. ..

371,Sir JOHN FORREST,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"It was prepared by the Acting-Secretary to the Treasury, and he assures me that it is absolutely accurate.",65
372,Mr FISHER,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,It is based upon the assumption that the population of the States will be the same sixty years hence as it is now.,65
373,Sir JOHN FORREST,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"I am quite sure that it is correct. If we are going to take over the debts of the States, and to ask each State to liquidate its own, why stop with taking over the present debts? It would be just as reasonable to ask one State to pay the debts of another State the future for all time as to State to pay the debts of another incurred in the past.",65
374,Mr WATSON,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,Does the right honourable gentleman contemplate that the States shall continue to borrow as they may desire?,65
375,Sir JOHN FORREST,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,I believe that the States will have to continue to borrow in order to develop their territories.,65
376,Mr WATSON,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,But without limitation ?,65
377,Sir JOHN FORREST,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"They will be limited by their power to pay interest and sinking fund. All I am saying is that the whole proposal is absolutely opposed to the bargain wihen Federation was established. It was clearly understood, and set forth in, section 105 of the I Constitution, that each State should pay its own debts and interest, and indemnify the Commonwealth for all moneys paid on its behalf. It is too late for me to add any more, though I am very glad to have had the opportunity to make these remarks. I wish to clearly state that, in my opinion, any attempt to sad'dle on one State the debt of another, will be regarded as a breach of faith under the Constitution, and any proposals which seek to interfere with the operation bf section 105 of the Approximate amount of debt Constitution would be regarded as most Loss to State. Saving to State. serious.",65

In dealing with all the matters to which I have referred, one has to keep in 26.358,47« view the provisions of the Constitution, with which I hope there will be no desire, for some time, at any rate, to interfere. Any interference, except in temporary or very small matters of convenience, would give rise to much dissatisfaction and trouble. I hope, therefore, that we shall all do our best to work out the problem as nearly as we can on the basis of she Constitution, though no doubt there will be difficulties. We cannot take over the whole of the debts unless there be an alteration of section 105, It would mean that instead of taking over the debts as they existed at the commencement of the Commonwealth, we would take them over as they exist now.",65
380,Mr WATSON,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,There is another alterain tion required to allow of debts as they expect one mature being taken over.,65
381,Sir JOHN FORREST,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"That is a legal matter, on which I am not called to give an opinion. I think, however, that section 105 sufficiently covers the ground.",65
382,Mr WATSON,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,I think the right honourable gentleman will find that he is mistaken.,66
383,Sir JOHN FORREST,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"The section is pretty wide, providing that the 'Commonwealth may taie over the debts.",66
384,Mr WATSON,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,In equal proportions.,66
385,Sir JOHN FORREST,TABLE SHOWING DISTRIBUTION,"The section says:The Parliament may take over from the States their public debts as existing at the establishment of the Commonwealth, or a proportion thereof And so forth.",66
