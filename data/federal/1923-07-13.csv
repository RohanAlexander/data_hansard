4,Mr WATSON,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN NAVAL,"the Minister for Defence, upon notice I. Have complaints reached him regarding tlic lack of naval training facilities at Fremantle? 2. Will ho investigate this matter, and, if possible, provide a warship for the training of Western Australian naval cadets?",13
5,Mr BOWDEN,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN NAVAL,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :- . 1. No. 2. The matter will be investigated and consideration given to the suggestion. DUTY ON SULPHUR.  I r a d e and Customs, upon notice I. Is it a fact that a duty of 50s. per ton on sulphur increases the cost of superphosphates to the primary producers of Australia by approximately 6s. per ton? 2. Is it a fact that manufacturers of superphosphates arc prepared to sell at 6s. per ton less if sulphur is admitted free? 3. If so, will he recommend to the House the removal of the duty on sulphur?",13
6,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN NAVAL,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. The previous Minister referred a question concerning the sulphur duty to a Special Committee consisting of two representatives of the primary producers, two representatives of the mining industry, and two representatives of the superphosphate industry. This Committee unanimously reported that, ""On the basis of utilizing imported sulphur the duty of £2 10s. per ton would be equal to 5s. per ton on superphosphate. Providing, however, that the arrangements (then in progress) for the supply ) - of sulphuric acid from locally-produced ores completed satisfactorily the increased cost while remaining at 5s. per ton in Western Australia would be only from 2s. to 3s. per ton in the* other States."" 2. No. 3. The matter will receive consideration. ESTATE DUTY.",13
7,Mr KILLEN,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN NAVAL,"the Treasurer, Whether he will take into consideration tlic advisability of providing in the taxation proposals that a reasonable time be allowed for the payment of estate duties-say , up to five n cases in which estates of deceased are so situated that immediate payment .would involve a sacrifice, of assets m order to meet the duty, it being understood that interest at a reasonable rate will be paid on amount outstanding?",13
8,Dr EARLE PAGE,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN NAVAL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:Estate duty is calculated upon the market value of the assets of the deceased's estate at date of death, and there does not appear to be any "" sacrifice of assets"" involved where any such can be realized by the trustees at that valuation for the .purpose of payment of the duty. In special cases where the assets have temporarilyslumped in value there is no objection to some reasonable extension of time for payment of the duty, upon lodgement of full security there for - The Estate Duty Assessment Act permits the extension of time for payment of duty for periods up to two years where the circumstances warrant it ; and it is thought that this is a sufficiently lengthy period to provide against hardship. INCOME TAXATION. COMMISSION'S RECOMMENDATION.",13
9,Mr WEST,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN NAVAL,"the Prime Minister, upon .notice I. Is it a fact that the Royal Commission appointed by the Government strongly recommended that for income tax purposes there should be one taxing authority, and that that authority should be the Federal Parliament? 2. If so, will he state the reason for departing, at the Premiers' Conference, from the Commission's recommendation ?",13
10,Dr EARLE PAGE,WESTERN AUSTRALIAN NAVAL,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f ollbw:1. The majority of the Royal Commission recommended, as the permanent solution of the problem of duplication, that the power to impose income be exclusively vested in the wealth, but, as it did not appear practicable to bring this about, it was recommended that, as a provisional scheme, there should be a mutual agreement between the Commonwealth and States for a period of ten years, during which time both the Commonwealth and the - States should have the right to impose tax but collect through one agency. The recommendation of the minority report was that the States should exclusively collect all direct taxation. 2. The reason for the Government's action at the Premiers' Conference in putting forward its proposals will be given when the snbject comes beforo Parliament. NA Mr E.

16,Mr R GREEN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"for Mr COOK ) asked the Minister for W o r k s and R a i l w a y s , upon notice I. Whether he approves of the States spending on the opening up of tourists' resorts money out of their share of the Federal Government grant of £500,000 for road purposes? 2. As many of the outback main developmental roads constructed in Victoria by the Government are - useless for heavy traffic during the winter nionths owing to want of metal, will he, in view of such circumstances, approve of the State expending money, out of its share of the grant, on metalling such roads as may be approved of by both, the State Minister and the shire council concerned and in accordance with .the £1 for £1 ratio? 3. Is it the intention of the Minister to secure the approval of both the State Minister and the shire council interested before agreeing to the funds of the £500,000 Federal grant being Customs, expended on any road within such shire?",14
17,Mr STEWART,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :The various classes of roads which the Commonwealth Government are prepared to financially assist in the construction of are outlined in the memorandum submitted by the Prime Minister to the recent Conference of Premiers, namely:(o) Main roads which open up and develop new country for agricultural, pastoral, or mining purposes, and which are necessary to convey the products of such to the nearest railway ; or, - alternatively, to give access from the railway to such country for supply of plant, merchandise, food, fodder, goods, &c. (6) Main trunk roads between _ important towns, either within a State or between States, where no railway communications exist to assist in the interchange of products and increased range of markets(c) Existing arterial roads Where, by the nature of the country and lack of suitable local material for road making, cost of construction is beyond ordinary resources of the districts through which they pass and which are required for transport of products to railways, river, The grant of £500,000 is being made by the Commonwealth Government on the understanding that the respestive State Governments contribute on £1 for £1 - basis. All proposals in respect of expenditure from this grant will be submitted by the respective State constructing authorities to the Minister for Commonwealth Works and Railways for his approval. BUBONIC PLAGUE. Mr E. RILEY (for Dr MALONEY asked the Minister for Health notice I. Is it a fact, as reported, that a death from bubonic plague and three suspected rases have occurred in Brisbane? 2. Is it a fact that the Health Department has been instructed to refuse information this disease to the press? Mr AUSTI N CHAPMAN - The answers to the honourable member's quesSydney tions are as follow:1. No information to this effect has been ceived. 2. No. NA INDUSTRY.",14
18,Mr FORDE,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"the Minister for Trade and Customs, upon notice I. Whether the Tariff Board has yet arrived at a decision with regard to the necessity have ithe provisions of section 8 of the Customs Tariff (Industries Preservation) applied to Italian marble importations, with a view to enabling the Central Queensland marble industry to compete successfully with the imported marble? 2. As the marble industry in Central Queensland is now practioally at a stand-still, and as it is nearly four montlis since a representative of that industry came to Melbourne and put the case for it before the Tariff Board, will the Minister sec that a definite reply is furnished without further delay?",15
19,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. No. 2. It is anticipated that a definite reply will he furnished in a few days. WHEAT POOL, 1915-16.",15
20,Mr WEST,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"for Mr Scullin) asked the Prime Minister, upon noticeWhen will the 1915-16 Wheat Pool be finalized ? or ports - Mr Bruce - The 1915-16 Wheat Pool has already been finalized. SYDNEY MINT.",15
21,Dr EARLE PAGE,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"On the 4th July - the honourable member for South Sydney (Mr E. Riley) asked a question with reference to coinage at the Sydney Mint. I am now able to state that the reason then given by him for the loss on working the Sydney Mint is not correct. During the last twelve months the demand for coin has so greatly decreased that it ) has been only possible to give orders to , upon the Mints for very small quantities indeed. Large supplies of coinage are held by the Treasury. Prior to that time, however, the Sydney Mint, as well as the Melbourne and Perth Mints, were used re to their full capacity in order to cope with the unusually heavy demand for coin. The Melbourne Mint turned out a greater proportion of coin than the Mint, because the Melbourne Mint is a larger and better equipped establishrement. Indeed, the Sydney Mint could not have supplied all of the comparatively small amount of coin 'which was ordered from it had it not been that the Commonwealth, at the cost of about £2,000, had installed extra machinery there. Every endeavour has all along been made by the' Treasury to give a fair proportion of the vork to each of the Mints. The Premier of New South Wales recently announced to that it was proposed to close the Sydney Act Mint at the end of this calendar year. PAPERS.

CUSTOMS BILL . ' SECOND READING.",15
22,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"Eden Monaro-Minister for Trade and Customs) [11.11] - I move That the Bill the now read a second-time. This is purely a formal measure. In the administration of the Act it has been found that certain amendments are necessary to bring the various sections into conformity with the spirit and intention of the Act, and into conformity also with the established practice of the Department with regard to such matters as come within the operation of the Customs Act. The Bill is principally a machinery measure designed to remove certain difficulties in the working of the Act, and to make it plainer to those dealing with the importation and entry of goods through the Customs. I ts purpose also is to prevent possible loss of revenue in respect of goods which might be imported by aeroplane or other aircraft, and certain provisions have been inserted which have been found necessary to attain this end. As no principle is involved it is hardly necessary that I should speak at length on the measure. Debate (on motion by Mr Charlton ) adjourned. BEER EXCISE BILL. SECOND READING . Debate resumed from 29th June (vide page 539), on motion (by Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN)That the Bill be now read a second time.",15
23,Mr CHARLTON,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"Hunter ) [11.14] This is a small measure designed to make the brewers responsible for the payment of Excise duty on excisable goods in their possession. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time, and, by leave, passed through its remaining stages withf o r t if y in g his wines. out amendment or debate. EXCISE BILL SECOND READING. Debate resumed from 29th June (vide page 539), on motion by Mr AUSTIN CHAPMANThat the Bill J>e now read a second time. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time and, by leave, passed through its remaining stages without amendment or debate... DISTILLATION BILL. SECOND READING. Debate resumed from 29th June (vide page 539), on motion by Mr AUSTI N CHAPMANThat the Bill be now read a second time.",16
24,Mr CHARLTON,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"Hunter ) [11.17] This Bill differs from the other measures we have just considered, inasmuch as it makes an alteration which may have a considerable effect, on persons who possess stills with a capacity of under 1 gallon. I understand that they will not require to be licensed, and it may be possible for such persons to conduct distilling to a considerable extent as long as they do not produce spirits in a greater quantity than 1 gallon at each distillation.",16
25,Mr OROOM,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"Darling Downs-Attor ney-General) [11.19] - The object of the Bill is to amend section 12 of 'the Distillation Act, which in general terms provides that no person can distill spirits unless he is licensed so to do. ""When the Act was amended, in 1918, test still licences were abolished, and at present the only requirement in regard to stills not exceeding 1 gallon in capacity is that they must be registered. Section 12 of the Act of 1901-191S makes it an offence for a person to distill spirits in a still of any capacity unless he is licensed so to do. There is no provision in the Act for the licensing of test stills. The object of this B i ll is to dispense with the necessity for obtaining a licence for a still not exceeding 1 gallon in capacity, and thus bring section 12 of the Act into line with other sections in respect to this class of stills.",16
26,Mr WEST,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,East Sydney) [11.20] - I understand that a vigneron is now permitted to distill spirits for the purpose of Will this Bill prevent him from doing so ?,16
27,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,The object of the Bill is to enable chemists and analysts to distill spirits in test stills.,16
28,Mr WEST,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,I do not think that vignerons or perfume manufacturers should be prevented from carrying out a very necessary operation in conducting their enterprises. Is it the intention of the Government under the disguise of this Bill to secure more revenue?,16
29,Mr GROOM,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,No . The Bill will not affect the revenue. It is merely a consequential amendment on the alteration made in 1918.,16
30,Mr WEST,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"I think that we should have been given more information. A great deal of mischief can be done by small measures such as this. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time, and, by passed through its remaining stages withable out amendment or debate. SPIRITS BILL . SECOND READING . Debateresumed from 29th June (vide page 539), on motion by Mr AUSTIN CHAPMANThat the Bill be now read a second time.",17
31,Mr CHARLTON,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"Hunter) [11.27] This is another small measure which renders a principal liable for a false declaracurred tion made by an agent acting on his beWe half, and I think it a very necessary amendment of the law. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time, and, by leave, passed through its remaining stages withwill out amendment or debate. AIR DEPENCE BILL . SECOND BEADING . Debate . resumed from 29th (vide page 536), on motion by Mr . BOWDENThat the Bill be now read a second time.",17
32,Mr CHARLTON,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"Hunter) [11.28] This Bill sets up machinery whereby future the A i r Forces, although controlled by the Minister for Defence, will be ducted as a separate branch of the defence system. It will be admitted by all air defence forces are to play an imporof tant part in the armies of the world. fortunately, it is necessary for us to tain a defence system, in view of the fact that so far the Great Powers have not sucCorps ceeded in evolving some means to bring about disarmament, or even to effect very large reductions in armaments. It is regrettable that this continual diture is necessary. The spending of large sums of money for defence shows that we did not benefit by the lessons of the war. I fondly hoped, as did other honourable members, that after the war ended we would be able to - devise means to avoid such expenditure. Unfortunately, that is not the case, and I am reluctantly pelled to admit that Australia must have some system of defence. As aviation play an important.part in military affairs in future, and will probably reduce the cost of defence to this country, by making it unnecesasry for us to have a large Navy, I support the proposal to establish leave, an Aviation Corps for defence. Honormembers should realise, however, that in setting up a separate Department for this purpose we are making possible a heavy expenditure. The experience of all Parliaments is that unless a watchful eye is kept upon the heads of the Defence . i Department the expenditure increases byleaps and bounds. In most cases it appears that the Ministers, leaning on the advice by the heads of the Department, follow the line of least resistance. I warn this Parliament that it should be very careful that no unnecessary expense is in through what we are now doing. are justified in approving of sufficient expenditure to establish an adequate aerial service, but we must .watch the future. We may set out with an expenditure of £100,000 or £200,000, but that increase to millions if we fail to exercise all care. It is proper, until we can bring about a better state of international affairs in connection with disarmament, that we should provide for the defence of June this country. The Department we propose to establish by this measure is to be separate from civil aviation except in two particulars. I think there should be co-ordination between the two as far as possible. The men in who will be required for defence work could obtain a good deal of their training conin the civil branch of the service. The only matters in which there is any cothat ordination whatever, are the laying out routes and the seleption of aerodromes. UnThe work could be done in a better way mainthan that. If investigation were made, I believe it would be found that the Defence could be used in times of peace to serve the community. The country people are calling out today for better and cheaper transit for mails. What is to prevent us expenfrom using the Defence Aviation Corps to assist in providing these facilities? I understand, of course, that some of the men engaged in the service, such as those who train pilots, would not be available, but most of the men could assist in civil aviation. To-day a good deal of money is spent in subsidizing private aviation comcompanies which carry mails. There is too much subsidizing. The practice is adopted wAI by every Department, and the subject is before this House week after week. We are paying a private aviation company which is .operating between Broome and Geraidton, in Western Australia, a subsidy of £25,000 a year.' not say that the people should not have the facilities they are getting, but wo could do more ourselves than we are doing. This aviation corps should certainly be able to carry mails to and from the people out-back, and thus, in time of peace, it would render useful .service to the community for the money expended on it . We have introduced this subsidy system, and unless it is ended in its infancy it will grow to be an immense thing. Mr E . RILEY - And we have no control over these private companies. Mr BowDEif - We have control.",17
33,Mr CHARLTON,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"I am not against people. out-back having those conhome veniences. ' But I contend they should be the example. provided by our own omcers, and-that the trouble arises. Defence Aviation Corps could give them. In time of war, dislocation would in the service, but that is unavoidable. would affect all classes of the community. Every service is disturbed or interthe rupted in war time. That is no reason why we should not co-ordinate civil and defence aviation in time of peace. The disarmament. committee that brought in a report the other day dealt with this matter. That report showed that, at Point Cook, there has been an expenditure of £180,000 on aerodromes. That will be increased to something like £300,000 under this B i l Honourable members must remember that we cannot concentrate these activities one State. Every State will expect some At provision. If it costs £300,000 for aeronecessity dromes here a similar sum will probably be required in the larger States, and sibly a lesser sum in the smaller States, though that does not necessarily follow. These activities may add a couple million pounds to our military expendidefence, ture in a very short while.",18
34,Mr WEST,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"It is the greatest sink money that we have yet had, for defence purposes or otherwise.",18
35,Mr CHARLTON,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"I am not against making adequate aviation provision f defence purposes, but we should avoid excessive expense. In the last ParliaA ment we had to take action to force down the expenditure on defence. Do honourable members realise that we are spending more on defence now than in pre-war days ?.",18
36,Mr MARRS,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"So is England. I do Mr Charlton . - Unfortunately, that is so.",18
37,Mr MARRS,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,When wecause a wreck we must replace what is wrecked.,18
38,Mr CHARLTON,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"I am much afraid that if the public mind does not change we shall have a wrecked world again. The problem'of how' to reduce armaments is confronting the world's Parliaments. It is of no use to spend money to send delegates to the meetings of the League of Nations unless there is something done towards disarmament. Under present conditions we must prepare to defend our country. The trouble is that as soon as one country begins to make military preparations, on the ground that it is for defence, every other country follows Eventually some little One country imagines that it is prepared for war, and almost occur before we know what has happened a It niunber of nations are engaged in a conflict. We have not learned the lessons of war. I have to confess that we are almost as we were, in spite of the statements we hear from time to time about",18
39,Mr MASKS,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,Will the honourable member suggest that we should do nothing?,18
40,Mr CHARLTON,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"No . I believe, in the circumstances, in making provision for the defence of Australia, much as my l . feelings run in other directions. As honourable members know, I held throughout in the war the views I am now expressing. the same time. I realise the for adequate defence, so that Australia may be safeguarded posagainst possible eventualities. We of the Labour party do not wish to be misunderstood on this question. We claim, not of that there should be no provision for but that such provision shall be on certain defined lines, and we should for be careful in the matter of cost. The Bill makes provision for the Australian A i r Force to come automatically under the Imperial A i r Force Act in time o r of war. The definition of "" A i r Force Act "" is : "" The Imperial Act called the i r Force Act and any Acts amending or in substitution of it , and for the time being in force."" The Imperial A i r Force Act incorporates the Arm y Act. 'Thus this Bill is virtually proposing to the Australian A i r Force under the I perial Army Act .",18
41,Mr BOWDEN,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,In time of war only.,19
42,Mr CHARLTON,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,We must look into this matter very carefully. This Parliatain offences. ment is not justified in placing any arm of the Australian Defence Porce under an Imperial Act of the contents of which we know little or nothing.,19
43,Mr LAZZARINI,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,The House should have a copy of the Imperial Act.,19
44,Mr CHARLTON,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"But even the memtions? bers of the House of Commons, who passed the Act, know very l it t l e about it . The Act, which itself comprises 180 sections, is printed in a manual of -600 pages. So many regulations have been made under the Army Act that it is diffigaged cult for any man to know all that is tained in that manual. It is unfair to legislate in this fashion to bring our vices under an Act of the provisions which we are more or less ignorant. We do know that the Imperial Army Act protion, vides for drastic penalties, such as tralians would never dream of imposing upon their own troops.",19
45,Mr BOWDEN,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,-That is qualified by provision that the British Army A c applies only where it is not inconsistent with our own Act or regulations.,19
46,Mr CHARLTON,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,That is a very in definite and unsatisfactoryarrangement.,19
47,Mr SCULLIN,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,In the absence of Australian regulation the Imperial Act will apply.,19
48,Mr BOWDEN,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,The Defence A ct places restrictions upon the penalties that be imposed.,19
49,Mr CHARLTON,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"It should be postralians sible for this Parliament to legislate the Australian Defence Force without their necks. making them subject to the legislation of another part df the British Empire. The Army Act provides for the death penalty for many acts that are regarded as mutiny or insubordination in time war. Men .can be tried by court martial for these offences, and sentenced to be :shot. The Government are asking a great ments under such officers. deal when they invite this Parliament incorporate in our legislation the Imperial Array Aot.",19

51,Mr CHARLTON,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"Onl y in one rebring spect. Our soldiers will come under the m - Imperial Act in time of war if they go overseas ,; they w i ll be liable to court martial, and very severe penalties.",19
52,Sir GBANVILLE RYBIE,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"On l y for, cer",19
53,Mr CHARLTON,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"Thos e offences are... enumerated in the A r m y Act. M u t in y and insubordination are among them. How many times may it happen during war that men feel that they are justified in refusing to carry out certain instrucB u t if they disobey the order of their commander they may be court martialled, notwithstanding that there may be real justification for their action. Do honourable members know that in the first fight in which Australian troops were eni n France-the battle of Fleurbaix con- - - more than half of the men who went into action were killed, and that the disseraster was due to bungling on the part of of their officers? Yet the only punishment which those officers received was promoand the best positions in civil 'life Ausare available to them today. Fifteen thousand Australians, who had been well trained in Egypt, and were confident that the nothing could stop them, went buoyantly t and confidently into that fight-; only 7,000 answered the roll-call - next day. They were ordered to ' take a certain trench. The enemy had 'become aware of their intentions, and was prepared for the attack. The British troops on their right an failed to move in support of them. Our men rushed the trench in the face of the concentrated gun fire of the enemy, only to find when they won their objective that can it was an old ""water-course which the .enemy had dammed. As soon as the Ausoccupied it tfae water was let in , for and they were standing in .water up - to They had to fix their bayonets and fight their way back. To their credit, be it recorded, that they did fight their way back, although they were almost surrounded; but more than half of were either killed or wounded. The result of that fight was that the men became afraid of f u r the r engageThey were to granted a week's respite, and many @f them went to Paris with the resolve to make the .best of life while it lasted. But , if while still siuffering - from the shock of - the disaster, they had declared that they satisfied - with the conduct of their commanders, who had undoubtedly by made mistakes, and would not go into exists the firing line again under their leadermembers ship,,, they would have been guilty of mutiny. And would honourable members for consent to men being shot in those cirvices cumstances ?",19
54,Mr LAZZARINI,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,Unde r the Army Act they would be shot.,20
55,Mr CHARLTON,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"Of course, although in that instance there would have been a good deal of justification men in distrusting their officers in future engagements. It is time that the facts of this and other cases were pubother Statute. lished so that Parliament might know for what possible circumstances it is - legislating. Extraordinary things have the Service. happened in Australia. Some of the soldiers who returned to New clause South Wales were sent to the Quarantine Station, near Manly, and given very inadequate accommodation. Their officers would do nothing to secure their comfort or to effect their removal to more suitable quarters. At last the men, thoroughly satisfied, marched out of the quarantine area to the Sydney Cricket Ground. That would have been mutiny under the Army Act, and those men could have been court martialled and shot. The tralian people will not abide by that sort of thing. We should be jealous of the lives and liberties of the men who enlist to fight for their country, and should not incorporate anything in strife and violence. our law unless we know the full effect of it . I contend, further, that provision should he made that any soldier who is court martialled shall be entitled legal assistance. The Minister has said bhat such assistance will be made available where possible. I know that that cannot, be done on the field of battle, but prisoner convicted of a serious offence court martial should have .the right to claim a further civil trial. It is right that men should be shot pracnervously tically at sight on the decree of court martial composed of omcers. perpetrated There is another provision in this Bill that is very objectionable, and I do know how the Minister, or his officers, permitted it to be inserted. Clause provides- . Wbere the Governor of the - State has claimed that domestic violencei exists therein, the Governor General, upon the application the Executive Government of the State, may, proclamation, declare that domestic violence in that State, and may call out . the Permanent Air Force, and in the event of its being insufficient may also call out such or the Citizen Air Force as may be necessary the protection of that - State, and the serof the Forces so called out may be utilized accordingly for the protection of that State against domestic violence: Provided that the Citizen Air Force shall not be called out or utilized in connection with an industrial dispute.",20
56,Mr BOWDEN,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,That is the same clause for the as is in .the Defence Act.,20
57,Mr CHARLTON,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,I am opposed to its inclusion in the Defence Act or any The Minister is making a mistake in trying to apply this provision of an existing Act to a new arm of,20
58,Mr GROOM,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,The. provision in that . gives effect to a constitutional obligation upon the Commonwealth.,20
59,Mr OHARLTON,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"There is a vast difference between an Air Force and the military arm. Warfare in all its branches is barbarous, buit, with the exception of dissubmarines, no phase of it is more barbarous than attacks from the air. Yet the Government propose to enact that when the Governor of a State has proclaimed the existence of domestic violence ComAusmonwealth aeroplanes shall be used to quell it. Certainly, industrial disputes are excluded, 'but many things may occur in a community to provoke domestic Such .things have happened in the past. On most occasions the police have been able to cope with the disorder, but on occasions the aid of to the military forces has been invoked. Similar circumstances may arise again. Anything may happen to inflame the pub-lie mind to such an extent as to lead the a Governor of a State to declare that by domestic violence exists. Are aeroplanes then to the used to quell the disturbance? not Have we forgotten that during the war we read our morning newspapers a to see what further outrages had been by the Zeppelins that dropped their bombs over England and destroyed not defenceless women and children? We were horrified at that new departure in 45 warfare; we deplored it then, but we are now asked to authorize the use of aeroplanes to drop bombs which, in addition proto the other destruction they will cause, may kil l innocent women and dhildren of who are taking no part in the dispute.",20
60,Mr SCULLIN,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,The Government wish to repeat the occurrences in South A f r i c a .,21
61,Mr CHARLTON,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"Australia is put to much expense because of the mauy men who returned from the war with their lungs affected by poisonous bombs. This arm of defence may he necessary as a protection against invasion, but would *ny one attempt to j u s t if y the dropping of bombs from aeroplanes on to our own people because a State Governor had declared that a state of domestic violence existed ? In the past all such disturbances have been quelled, with little trouble, by the police, though, on occasions, the military has, unfortunately, and, in my opinion, unnecessarily, been called out to assist. This clause confers powers, the results of the exercise of which we have recently seen in South Africa . What attitude has been adopted by other countries in regard to aircraft as an arm of defence? The position it should occupy is still in doubt, and it is felt by leading nations and leading men that it should be called into play only when absolutely necessary. The expert Sub-Committee of the Washington Conference on the limitation of armaments rcccmuiendedThat the use of aircraft in war should he governed by the rules of warfare as adapted to aircraft Try a further Conference which should be held at a later date. The Australian delegate Pearce) reported that, in regard to his recommendation, the Conferencedecided to refer this matter to a Commission which should investigate the question of rules governing new agencies of warfare. This matter is dealt with later. (See page 14 of this report.) On page 14 of the report, we are toldThe American delegation resolution providing for the appointment of a Special Commission of juriststo consider the rules of war-the Commission to bo reprehonorable sentative of the five great Powers and other Powers (three of whom should have been belligerents in the late war). After sideration, it was decided that the Commising sion sbould consist of the five great Powers settled. only, not more than two representatives to appointed by each Power. I i was also decided, at Mr Balfour's instance, that the scope the investigation should be limited means of the control of new agencies of fare and the methods resulting from those agencies. It will be seen that the Great Powers not yet reached a conclusion regarding serial defence, and it is proposed to have people? another Conference, .possibly in twelve months' time, to further consider the matter. But the Conference did not suggest the use of aerial armaments to quell domestic violence.",21
62,Mr MARR,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"At the same time, all the nations are urgently building aircraft.",21
63,Mr CHARLTON,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"Of course; I have all along said that aircraft will for m an important arm of defence against an enemy in the future, but we cannot contemplate its use in our own country against our own people. I cannot see that the interjection of the honourable member affects the question whether we should or not retain clause 45. Howover, if , as seems clear, the Great Powers cannot themselves decide as 'to the future use of aircraft, surely this Parliament will not pass a Bill which will permit it to be used against the citizens of Australia. It is unfortunate that - aircraft has to be used at all, but it has become - imperative, in view of the great changes brought about by the war, when both aircraft and submarines came into prominence. W© can all remember how disgusted the civilized' peoples of the world were at such inhuman methods of warfare, methods so contrary to what had always been regarded as the usages of civilization. I cannot support u Bill which contains such a clause. It is idle (Senator to suggest that, if passed into law, it will not apply in the case of strike disturbances. It is not a strike itself, but some occurrence after a strike' has commenced, that usually causes the domestic violence contemplated by the clause.",21
64,Mr WATSON,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,i Would such a clause have applied in the case of the Fremantle brought up a draft wharf trouble?,21
65,Mr CHARLTON,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"Yes , and I urge members to be careful before five they confer such powers on the Governconment. If the news published this mornbe true, the coal trouble has been From the commencement I be prophesied that there would be no serious of results from the dispute; but what would to the have happened if high feeling had warbeen caused, and the State Government had felt called upon to declare that a state of domestic violence existed ? Would the have Commonwealth Government then have sent aeroplanes to drop bombs on our own",21
66,Mr SCULLIN,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,What is the intention of the clause?,22
67,Mr CHARLTON,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"Yes , why is this clause in the Riff at all ? 1",22
68,Mr BOWDEN,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,Suppos e there trouble at Thursday Island or New Guinea ?,22
69,Mr CHARLTON,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"In such a case, the Government need not trouble to send' aircraft, because a military force could' be despatched at once.",22
70,Mr BOWDEN,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"It would fake too long to get a military force"" there.",22
71,Mr CHARLTON,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"I hope the Miniater does not j u s t if y the clause on that ground-that he does not suggest sending aeroplanes' to drop bombs ou people who might have nopart i h any disturbance that had arisen. members on this side require, much stronger reasons than that tier justif y a clause which gives' power for aircraft to operate ini any p a r to f Australia against our own people. We on this side' cannot cast a vote which would enable'' the Government to proclaim a state of domestic violence,, and use the air service' for the purpose of dropping bombs and poisonous gasi on our own people.. We have always been' able,- with, a little trouble, to quell any disturbances withinOUT territories. ""Usually the. police bave proved qraite sufficient, though there have been times when the military has been called out.",22

73,Mr CHARLTON,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,Quite so.,22
74,Mr BOWDEN,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"The always had the power, bub hasnever used it.",22
75,Mr R GREEN,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"What objection, is there to aircraft that does not apply to artillery or the other arms of themilitary ?",22
76,Mr CHARLTON,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"I , have already sard that I am not in favour of any of theseforces being used in the case of domestic violence.",22
77,Sir GRANVILLE RYEIE,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,What be done in the case of revolution?,22
78,Mr CHARLTON,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"Nobod y knows better than the honourable member that there is' no fear of revolution in Australia, so long as the people can freely exercise the franchise, an'd thus work' out their own destiny. I have pointed out the objection that I and those associated with me have i a this' measure, which is really one for the committee stage, when doubtless' many amendments will be' proposed . I venture 1 to say that if an appeal weremade to the people tomorrow on clausei 45, there would be a 90 per cent, vote against ita« was adoption.. The defence question) should not be the subject of p a r t y conflict. Of .course, we all. have our ownviews-,, but we should endeavour to pass legislation acceptableto the people as a whole. It must not be1 thought that, because the Labour party oppose this Bill as it is drafted,, we are against adequate preparation for the defence of Australia. We must be in. a position to defend ourselves,- and this can' be: attained without such powers as are given by clause! 45. The Minister would bewell advised if he eliminated, the clause. We 'of the Labour party do not believe that there should be any compulHonorable sory element in our. defence scheme,, but that all that is necessary can be done in a voluntary way. What we regard aa the objectionable features of the Bill are the. provision for the use of the aerial service in the case of. domestic trouble, and 1 the power of court martial. There are other minor points j but if the Government will co-operate with the . Labour party in f r a m in g defence-legislation on the voluntary principle, they will, encounter very little opposition. In the present, state of the world, we cannot escape the duty of organizing for the defence of this country; and aircraft will probably prove our cheapest and most efficient arm. Such aircraft is able: to goa great, distance out to sea,""and,, if what I have read is true, a' bombdropped on a warship, or Government, has in: its. immediate neighbourhood, may do it material damage, if not put it out' of action.",22
79,Mr MARR,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,A warship must be h it in a v it al spot.,22
80,Mr CHARLTON,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"Possibly , in order to puti t out of action, but material damage can be done otherwise - No doubt afrcraft arid submarines, rather than capita! ships, wil l prove the should potent factor in the defence of Australia. A big capital ship costs £5,000,090 dr £6,000,000, and quite a fleet of aircraft could be provided for much less than 'either amount. If aircraft were stationed at different places on the coast there is no doubt that they could render good service. I do not wish it to be said that, because the' Opposition are opposed' t'O the measure now' under' consideration, they are against the use of aircraft for defence purposes. are not opposed to provision for the adequate defence of Australia, but we contend thali provisions which in our view are not in the' best interests of the defence of this country, and would not promote its' efficiency, should be eliminated front any measure of the kind now submitted to this House.",22
81,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"Warringah) [12.2] - I agree with a good deal that the. Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Charlton) has said as to the part which air forces will play in any future war. WeaU hope that there will never be any war in Australia, but should we be attacked by a foreign power an air force wiU undoubtedly play a very great part in our defence. It is: thereforeessential thai; we should have an air force, and we cannot have an' efficient force: of the' kind without the esspendfiiturg of a considerable amount of money. I do not know that I would have spoken on. this Bill weise it not for the great stress which the Leader of the Opposition laid upon clause 45 of the measure under which the air force might be used in. the event of domestic violence. I think it was quite unnecessary for the honourable member, in his objection to the clause, to' talk of the use of aircraft to drop bombs and poison gas upon, peaceful citizens, including women and children. The honourable member,, in speaking' in that way, was endeanrouuimg only to play upon the feelings of persons who might not give very 1 serious! thought to the matter. He says that we are a sensible and democratic people, and does he think for a momeiii that any G'overnment in Australia would send out aircraft to drop bombs and' poison gas upon the peaceful citizens of this country?",23
82,Mr CHARLTON,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"If they would, not, why put such a provision into the Rill? Sir. GRANVILLE RYRIE - If the provision were not included in' the Billaircraft could not be used by the Q&vernment for the suppression of domestic violence'. A riot might occur in a town without railway communication, and what would! be more' useful than to be able to send, say, a sergeant of police and' a couple of troopers by an: aeroplane to quell the riot. Am air force must form a part of the defenceforce of Australia, We and there is no reason why, in the event of serious domestic disturbance the Government should not be in a position to take advantage"" of that force.",23
83,Mr CHABLTOW,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,In any little' town in Australia a policeman and a dog could* keep the people quiet'..,23
84,Sir GRANVILLE EYRIE,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"That may be so at the present time, but thera might come a time when a policeman and a dog could not keep the people in order. I do not know whether the Leader of the Opposition sympathizes, with such people or not, but he has only to go info the Sydney Domain on Sunday afternoon and listen to speeches delivered there to know what some of them would do if they had the power. I would not be one to advocate that the peaceful citizens of Australia should have bombs aud poison gas dropped upon them. Theleader of : the Opposition knows that well, and he knows that no member of a Commonwealth Government would ever dream of sending an air force to drop bombs' and* poison gas upon peaceful people.",23
85,Mr ANSTEY,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"How would the honourable gentleman avoid that if he dropped, 1 bombs on the Sydney Domain?",23
86,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"I did nof say that I would' drop bombs on the Sydney Domain. The honourable member for Bourke (Mr Anstey) might be there. I would be very sorry to drop a gas bomb on him. It would be bad for the bomb. If serious domestic disturbance should arise the Government would be entitled to 1 use' any arm of the DefenceForce to quell! it. They should be able to Use' the Air Force justas they might use machine gunsy artillery, or any oliher' means of defence-. It is' useless for honourable members oppositeto suggest that I am raising' the bogy of revolution. In my heart I do"", not .believe that there will ever be a revo-lution in Australia. There are too manysensible people inthiscountry, who will always be able tokeep down any unruly element. There cannot be the least doubt that we have> an unruly element in our 1 midst, who woufld strive for a revolution 1 in Australia tomorrow if they thought they bad the slightest chance of success. Th» speeches made itri> the Sydney Domain amd in other places in Australia give sufficient evidence of that - The Government should have the right to use every mean? a* their disposal to keep the' peace in Australiaas well' as to d'efend this country. We always hope that the police will be a sufficient force to quell any disturbance that may take place in this country, but if they sliould fail, and a mob should get out of hand, will the Leader of the Opposition tell me that the Government would not be justified in using any arm of the Defence Porce to quell such a serious disturbance? The honourable gentleman said that we should not use the Air Porce to drop bombs on our own people, but would he use artillery against them ? Honourable members opposite say "" No."" They would permit the mob to rule.",23
87,Mr YATES,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"The honourable gentleman is aware that it is possible to train a gun directly on an object, but that is not possible in the dropping of bombs from aircraft.'",24
88,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"Ai r forces have become very efficient in the accurate dropping of bombs. I do not recognise any distinction between the use of the Air Force and the use of any other arm of the Defence Force in the quelling of serious disturbance. The Commonwealth Government must be given credit for common sense and for some little humanity. I suggest that the members of the Government do not differ from other - people in Australia in their ideals of humanity, and I repeat that the suggestion that they would use an air force to drop bombs upon peaceful citizens is absolutely ridiculous. The Leader of the Opposition had good deal to say about courts martial. During the war I had the honour of being appointed a convener of epurts martial, and was also given a warrant as a confirming officer of the verdicts of courts martial. something about them, and in my opinion there is no fairer trial in the whole wide world than a trial by court' martial. Honourable members opposite laugh, bemartial ? cause they do not know very much about the matter. It might useful to summarize now the procedure of a court martial. If a soldier is alleged to be guilty of some offence placed under either close or open arrest. If he is under open arrest he goes about warrant it. his duties in camp, only some restriction is placed upon his movements and he not absent himself from the camp withon out special leave. If the man is placed under close arrest he is given custody of a sergeant, who takes him to the guard tent, where he is placed in charge of the officer of the guard. Within twenty-four hours a charge must be lodged with the guard against him. Within forty-eight hours he must be brought before the commanding officer in the orderly room and his case dealt with. He can demand to be tried by court martial if he pleases, or the commanding officer may order him to be so tried. Before it is decided to convene a court martial, a summary of the evidence in the case is taken. The accused man has the right to summon witnesses, and to put his case. A summary of the evidence is sent by his commanding officer to the higher officer having the right to .convene a' court martial. The commanding officer will ask that a court martial be convened, and will enclose with his request a copy of the summary of evidence, which the senior officer will peruse.",24
89,Mr BAMFORD,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,Is the summary of the evidence given to the accused ?,24
90,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,Yes ; he is given a copy of the summary of the evidence.,24
91,Mr MCGRATH,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,Is he tried by any privates at the court martial ?,24
92,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"No , he is tried by a court martial consisting of officers.",24
93,Mr YATES,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,Is the summary of evidence given to him in the field? Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE:-The ada jutant of the regiment is supposed to give the accused man a summary of the evidence in his case immediately it is completed. If the convening oflicer believes that the summaiy of the evidence makes out a sufficient case for a court martial I know he can order a court martial..,24
94,Mr MCGRATH,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,Does the honourable gentleman know of any case in which the convening officer did not order a court,24
95,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"There be were hundreds of such cases. In a great many cases I have, myself, refused to order a court martial because I he is did not think that the summary of the evidence submitted to me was sufficient to Mr R. GBEEN - I can mention a case can6f the kind. I was, myself, under arrest one occasion, and a court martial was refused by the honourable gentleman who into the is now addressing the House.",24
96,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"The accused may appeal to a higher authority, even before the court martial is convened, but if the senior, officer decides that a court martial is necessary, he convenes it and the date and time of sitting are set down. The accused is entitled to employ counsel; he may obtain the services of a barrister.",25
97,Mr MCGRATH,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,What chance had a man of getting a barrister in France Egypt?,25
98,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"There were many opportunities in Egypt, we had quite a number of barristers in wrong. the ranks.",25
99,Mr MCGRATH,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,Ver y few.,25
100,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"There were many. If , , however, the accused cannot find some one to defend him, Court .orders a man, versed in court martial procedure, to act as the prisoner's friend and defend him.",25
101,Mr YATES,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,But did the Court ever do that?,25
102,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"Yes . I addition there are Deputy Judge Advocates in all parts of the field with a Judge Advocate-General at Head-quarters. Before a court martial is decided upon the papers are placed before a Deputy Judge Advocate, who sees that everywho thing is in order and is satisfied that court martial is justified. There is another safeguard. After a court marof tial is convened and the' members of i are assembled, the order convening the court is read and the prosecutor and accused take their places. Another privilege given to the accused is that he may object to the composition of the court If he thinks that he will not receive jusguilty. tice from a particular officer of the Court, ho may object to him. Invariably the officer mentioned is then removed and another appointed in his place.",25
103,Mr MCGRATH,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,And very often he will prove worse than the officer removed. - Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE - The honthere orable member apparently would not be satisfied with any procedure.,25
104,Mr MCGRATH,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,Not in regard to courts martial.,25
105,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"Al reasonable men will agree that the proinvites cedure is quite fair. The first question put to an accused is "" Are you satisfied to be tried by this court? Do you object to any member of it?""",25
106,Mr MCGRATH,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,No . The first thing he has to do is to salute and take his hat off.,25
107,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"The honourable member for Ballarat is simply talking nonsense. It is a waste of time trying to satisfy a man who does not believe in any man taking off his hat, or saluting.",25
108,Mr YATES,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,Hi s hat is usually or knocked off as soon as the accused man enters the Court.,25
109,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,The honfor orable member for Adelaide is quite,25
110,Mr YATES,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,I am not. I shall bo able to show you that a court martial is not the pretty picture you paint it .,25
111,Mr SPEAKER,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"Rt. Hon. W. A. Watt). the - Order II remind the honourable member for Adelaide, and also the honourable member for Ballarat, that it is impossible to conduct the debate in an orderly manner if they persist with interjections. I ask them to refrain. They will have their n own opportunity of speaking later.",25
112,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"To insure absolute justice for an accused, the Court is invariably constituted of officers from other units. Sometimes, of course, it is not always possible to get officers are unknown to the accused, but, a generally speaking, the officers composing still the court have no knowledge whatever the man who is to be tried. Another t privilege extended to an accused person is that if he pleads guilty, the president of the court, having seen the summary of the evidence to be given, may advise - him to withdraw the plea and plead not",25
113,Mr MAXWELL,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,That is done sometimes in serious criminal cases also.,25
114,Sir GRANVILLE RYRIE,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"I was not aware of that. It is a valued privilege. The accused is allowed very great latitude in the conduct of his defence, and is an obligation on the prosecution to prove absolutely the charge, the rules of evidence being very much the same as the rules of evidence in a civil Court. The Judge-Advocate sums up, but before l pronouncing the finding of the coiu the the different officers of the court to express their opinion, beginning with the junior subaltern, in order that he may not be swayed by the opinions of the senior officers. This, I think, is distinctly fair to tihe .accused. It is am additional precaution to insure justice for .bim. But there are further safeguards.

121,Mr YATES,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"Adelaide) [12.54] - As this BiE is a measure which can best he dealt with in Committee I do not propose feat to say much upon it at this stage; but in the the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. has pointed out several direca tions in which we should give it mature to consideration. The honourable member for Warringah (Sir Granville Ryrie) has put up a veryfin©case for courts martini, now and he has compared conrts martial with of civil Courts. I can tell honourable memfrom my own experiencej that there well are no outsiders' at a court martial to se» what is being done, and that the couast's l in verdict is not known until if is 80that nounced'-on parade, when it is a case of snatching off one's hat, stepping forward hontwo paces and "" getting it . "" I have' been right through it all. I have been in trouble over an orderly room charge. was not listened to, although I could have proved my point and was prepared to apologize, which I did after serving my sentence, to the officer to whom I had given offence. But the little snob who charged me did not give me a chance to offer any apology. I had received a note telling me to attend the orderly and I hopped in, saying wants Yates?"" All I heard "" That is not the way to come into an orderly room; get out."" I said, "" That is not what I asked for,"" but I was again ordered by the serjeant-major and I got out. I did not know that I had been charged. I know that I had given a little offence on the day However, I went over to a hut opposite, as it was raining. By-and-by the cry "" Yates!"" Yates the door, and as soon as he walked in he heard, "" Take, off your I took off my hat, quite unaware of what was about .to happen. was "" in for trouble,"" for the officer was sitting at the table who was to hear the charge laid against me. He had heard me "" tell off "" the sergeant-major, was mark No. 1 against me, and I knew I was ""gone."" I could tell honourable members of many similar cases. I have come to the conclusion that if a man joins the Military Forces he must lay this down as an invariable of conduct: ""Never offend bombardier. Do all you are told to do. Although you may not do it willingly do it; because if you do not they will have you in the end. As often as you have to ' dip your forelock,' it. It will not hurt the I should like to ask Sir Granville how many of the rank and file know what he has told the House about court martial procedure. How many of them, know that they can appoint some one to represent them ? How many of them know the King's Regulations? Some one may tell you what the King's Regulations are, but when you get before a court martial you - find that they are very different. Sir Granville Ryrie has told us that courts martial - annot be as biased or unfair as civil Courts. He has spoken of men from the rank and file becoming officers; ""but has lie not heard it said that in a great many instances "" once you put a Mr Yates. stripe on a man he becomes a toad, and I when you give him a ' p i p ' he becomes a tyrant""? Sir GBANVIL LE RYBIE - That would apply to the honourable member. Would he become a tyrant?",27
122,Mr YATES,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"Quite possibly. The influence of rank might have changed my disposition; but I hope not. I do room, not think there is a finer man breathing "" Who was, than Major Retchford, my commanding officer. He would not be unjust or harsh to any man.",28
123,Sir GBANVILLE RYBIE,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"Why pick out to get out, your commanding officer?",28
124,Mr YATES,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"I can speak only from my own experience. He was like a previously. great many more of the officers; but there were others who made the Army I heard stink in the nostrils of those who were went to under them. In other words, the good were more than counterbalanced by the hat."" bad. There were some who seemed to think that immediately a man became a I . knew I "" swaddy"" he was to be used' as an officer's door-mat. However, to return to the subject of courts martial, I do not wish to utter one which word of complaint as to my own treatment or experience. I prefer' to refer to a case I mentioned last night, that of a man whom I call MCPherson, but whose correct name I can give, as well as the locality where he was tried, if it be rule necessary to trace the case. I was placed even a on guard duty over a man who was new to me, and was a prisoner. When I asked who he was I was told that he was a jolly good soldier who had been in the ranks dip from the beginning, but had been struck forelock."" on the head at Ypres and made "" windy."" Ryrie When he was ordered to the "" p it s "" he refused to go. He said that he would do anything in the waggon line, where there - were dozens of jobs they could have given him, but he would not go to the "" p it s "" when ordered to do so, as he could not stand shell fire. I was on guard over him, and in the afternoon I was ordered' to bring the prisoner before a young officer about eighteen or nineteen years of age. Of course, I stood there at attention, looking at nothing; but I heard what was said. The young officer commenced to look through the evidence, and then said, "" This is too long; we shall cut out this and that."" He did so; he cut slabs out of it . Then he brought in two other officers to give additional evidence. There was no one there with MCPherson to give him advice. It was my first experience of a preliminary to a court martial.'",28
125,Mr MCGRATH,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,He had no pleader with him?,29
126,Mr YATES,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"No ; and the evidence appeared to me ito be "" cooked"" already for the job. MCPherson had no one to speak for him. I do not think that his mentality was all that it might have been. He did not understand the procedure. When he realized that he was in a Court he began to tremble.",29
127,Mr MARR,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"Was it not a Court of inquiry, and not a court martial?",29
128,Mr YATES,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"I shall tell the honourable member what it was. It was a case of "" cooking "" evidence.",29
129,Unknown,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m.,29
130,Mr YATES,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,I was on guard when this evidence was brought forward.,29
131,Mr BOWDEN,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,Does the honourable member mean a summary of the evidence ?,29
132,Mr YATES,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"I do not know. I am describing what took place at the waggon lines prior to the court martial. I watched it all with an unbiased mind. It was new to me. I had not then tested the powers of a court martial. The lieutenant was in the tent, and I paraded the prisoner before him. The evidence was laid out in typewritten sheets. MCPherson was told that it was too lengthy, and he was asked whether he objected to any of it being cut out. He had no objection. Ninety-five per cent, of the diggers would have taken the course .he did. They would know a penalty was hanging over them, and they would want to get out of it as easily as possible. MCPherson was charged with having deserted in the face of the enemy. He had been wounded at Ypres, and when he returned to the line he stated that he had not the nerve to face shell fire again, but was willing to do anything behind the lines. He was sent into the lines. He deserted. Afterwards he was arrested, end what I am describing took} place. When he consented to the deletion of some of the evidence it struck me as strange that the officer cut out what he liked, without consulting the prisoner.",29
133,Mr MAXWELL,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,Were the witnesses present?,29
134,Mr YATES,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,I was the only one there besides the lieutenant and the prisoner. The evidence had been prepared previously.,29
135,Mr BOWDEN,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,Did the prisoner have a copy of it?,29
136,Mr YATES,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"Not to my knowledge. That is what court martial means. The ordinary man in the rank and file of the Army comes from the business house, the workshop, or the labouring classes and does not understand what his rights ond privileges are and has not the experience necessary to defend himself properly. I was unable to stay till the end of MCPherson's case, as I had to return to the line. When I again returned to the waggon lines I asked what had happened to him. I was told that he was sentenced to sixteen years' imprisonment. The Military Department have the full records of the case. I have not given the man's correct name, but I can give it, and also the time and place where the court martial was held. The sentence was not sixteen years in a military detention camp, but it meant sixteen years in gaol. I was sentenced to sixty days' military detention, which, according to the military interpretation, was not imprisonment. When I was taken from Melbourne I was thrown into a cell and bad one of the worse experiences I have ever had in my life.",29
137,Mr MAHONY,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"It was a dirty, filthy place.",29
138,Mr YATES,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"It was. The next morning I was put into a triangular yard, but to all intents and purposes I was imprisoned. After a time. I was permitted to assist the cook and was allowed to smoke and see the newspaper. I am not dealing with my own case, however, but with the case of this man who was sentenced to sixteen years' imprisonment. While I was in Darlinghurst I met a man who was serving a sentence of seven years. Has crime was entirely unpremeditated, though it had serious consequences. An Indian rushed at him, and he told the man to stand back or he would fire. He pulled out his revolver with the intention to fire over the man's head, but he shot him. I use these illustrations to show that, while it may be the intention of the law that procedure .shall he as the General has described, the facts are very different from what he would have lis .believe. I am not drawing on my imagination. I am dealing with actual experiences. Every digger who has had .knowledge of .courts martial on the .field will tell you that what I have described occurs. Let me give you an ilkistration of what happens at an ordinary inquiry at military head-quarters on the field. ""When we pulled .but of the line behind Villers-Bretonneux we were to have had a fortnight's spell near Abbeville. lasted two days, and then we w.ere ordered back to Hamel. We had a lad with us for whom I was very sorry. He was doing the job of a soldier, and looking .after a 'Lewis gun that we had to protect the battery. A new sergeant-major was attached to us at this time. The lad was a fine boy, but while we were out of ,the line for the two days he went into the village and got drunk on vin blcunc and vin rouge. In. this condition he opened his mouth a little too much in the street. He was heard by one of the o'fneers. Next morning the poor little chap had to face a court of inquiry. The atmosphere in that court was most severe. - Colonel Caddy presided when I was in the room. 1 was new to the business, and I did not want to appear as though I were all mouth and ears, ready to take everything in, and instead of staring straight ahead, T was looking elsewhere. The next think I knew was a command from the sergeant-major^ ""Eyes front,"" and a pull that brought me smartly up to attention.. The lad was charged, under the drag-net clause, with ""conduct contrary to military discipline and .good .order."" They could convict any man under that clause. Colonel Caddy asked the sergeant-major what he knew of the boy. The sergeant-major, without hesition said, ""He is incorrigible. We can do nothing with him."" The poor little chap turned round on himwith surprise, and said, ""How can you say that? You .do not know anything about me. You had never seen me before yesterday."" That did not worry the - sergeant-major. Colonel Caddy said, "" It does not matter what the sergeant-major s.as. I saw you."" The boy was sentenced to twientyeight days .under "" No. 2."" I went back to the line. I was aniuch surprised Mr Yates. the following night to see the young fellow working .at the Lewis gun, though he was supposed to :be <doing tiraenty-seight days' detention for which he would receive no pay. I .do - not know whether that case was .ever reviewed, but I know the boy was doing his ordinary work while under a sentence of detention, a condition of which was that he should lose twenty-eight days' pay. He ""was treated in a shameful way, and worse than he would have been in any civil Court. A civil Court would ihave senIt tenced him to a fine of 5s., but the military court - sentenced him to a fine of twenty-eight times 6s. Honorablo - members should understand that I do not argue against eyery form of court procedure for the Army, because I realise that some method is necessary. Some men in the .ranks must be controlled or they would do harm to their fellows. In an Army it is necessary to maintain discipline. The General suggested that trial by court martial was the ideal method ,to .deal with recalcitrant troops. It is. not ideal the way it is carried out in the Army. A man of personality who stands up for himself is always likely to be in trouble in the Army. If he .tries to defend himself he gets into worse difficulties. ; I know, because of what I went through. .Men are not informed of the regulations .under which they have .rights and privileges. Silence is their sheet anchor. Mr GABB, - A man has to .be a crawler.",29
139,Mr YATES,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"I do not say that, but he has to efface his own personality and become a mere cog in a great machine. I could relate many personal experiences in illustration of that statement. For instance, on one . occasion I had been on short leave - to London. The soles of one of the pairs of boots I had were worn, but I never saw them again. Those that were issued to me for France had never fitted me, for because of .the alphabetical order of my name I was always last to receive ray issue, and the consequence was that all those sized 7 bad been issued, and I had to be content with an 8. I had taken ito London with me a pair of hoots that I had had mended in Maribyrnong Camp. I returned to Camp on the Thursday, and .on the following Monday I was placed in a gun group. It was usual for a man to spend a week in - each, f u n group, aud then to pass into the layers' class. As a rule .he reached the layers' class in four weeks, and was then ready for draft. A boot .parade was held on the Wednesday,, and I went into .my hut and brought out the boots with the worn soles. All the .boots were put in line. I stood to attention as strictly as any soldier in the line. colonel came along with about eight others, and tapped my boots with the ubiquitous, cane. "" Why haye you not had those boots repaired ?"" he asked. I replied that I did not know that they were in such .a bad condition. He tapped the boots again with his cane, .and .said, ""That tale will not go down with me."" I replied to him, "" Pardon me, I am not in the habit of telling untruths."" "" Very well,"" .said he, "" get them repaired."" He said no more, but Mr Waddingham came along with the quartermaster-sergeant. Any soldier who has been in Heytesbury Camp knows who Mr Waddingham was. He instructed the quartermaster-sergeant to take my name. Accordingly the sergeant .said, "" What's your name."" I replied, n Yates."" ""-' What's your number?"" I replied, ""-38614:"" ham then said, "" ' Sir,"" and I said "" Sir."" He said, "".Look here, if you speak like that I will haye you on the mat."" T asked, "" What for? T have only replied in the same manner as I was addressed."" He said, ''' Por the manner in which you spoke to the .Colonel."" I said, "" Well, I only told the truth. I did not come here to be spoken to in that manner. I came to Bght. He doubted my veracity."" To that 'he replied, ""You are too thin skinned; it is .all for your own good."" So far, so good.. Nothing .more was said at that moment, but when the draft for Prance was posted on the Friday I was in it. I had spoken oust of my turn, ,and had been "" shanghaied."" That is an instance of how the soldier is robbed of his independence and individuality. A man should not have to become a puppet because he has entered the Army. .Saluting .should take place only when the man is in the ranks and .under command of his .officers. Instead, he is required ,to - salute in .all places .and at .all - times. We were - told that w.e owed the salute to the King's .uniform. Rot:! Some .snobs would look for a .salute two or three hundred yards before the soldier passed them,. One man in Heytesbury .Camp was ""carpeted"" - for not saluting his officer while wheeling a harrow! Absurdities of this .description should be eliminated from any military service, and I shall seek to have .omitted from our defence laws and regulations anything that tends to crush out - the independence and spirit of the soldiers. They will do the fighting when it The - is required of them; there is no need to worry .about that. In the American army non-commissioned officers up to the rank of sergeant were allowed to fraternise with the privates, but in the Australian Army that was not permitted. Non-commissioned officers were expected to be intermediaries between the officers and .the men in ' 'rubbing in the mud,"" if necessary. On .one - occasion I was .stationed at Tincourt; .it was when I was .on the job of minding the dumps, of which honourable members have heard a good deal previously. I was sitting outside the canteen waiting for my "" pal,"" who had joined the queue of .soldiers waiting their turn to make their purchases. A Yankee sat - alongside me and nearby was a Tommy. The 'Tommy had risen about a dozen Wadding- times to salute officers, when the Yankee said, "" Look at that guy bobbing up - and down. Why is it that you Aussies don't salute your officers as .the Tommy does?"" I replied, "" I am shrewd enough to be looking the other way when they come."" I did not want to rise from my .seat and "" dook "" them, but the Tommy dared not - ignore thenr; he had to have eyes in the back of his head, and see the omcers approaching from the rear. The Yankee said to me, "" We do not have to do anything of that Mud .in our army."" That iiustance is typical of small irritations that I personally experienced. I .did not enter the Army with a. prejudiced mind, and bent en discovering faults. I .took the life as I found it ; I never asked a favour of anybody, ,and as far as war can be enjoyed I .enjoyed it . Hough aa my experiences were, I do not regret them,. But the Army .should not rob the individual of his spirit and independence. Other honourable members who have heen to the Front can testify regarding the tyranny to which the ordinary digger was subjected. I may relate - another anecdote. I belonged to what was called the "" spit and polish "" battery.",30
140,Mr SPEAKER,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"I suppose the honoraible memher will realise the necessity for showing a relation between these anecdotes, and the motion for the second reading of the Bill.",31
141,Mr YATES,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"Yes , Mr Speaker, I endeavouring to show what may the the result of incorporating in this Bill provisions of the British Anny Act. am relating my own experiences on active service, not of mere parade ground diering, although I did three years that in the '(South Australian Militia, thirty years ago. I agree with the hondier. orable member who said that all officers are not bad, but there are some who are worse. There was a non-commissioned officer in that battery who wa3 known as the ""black snake"". man does not gain a sobriquet of that description unless he deserves it . I sonally never fell foul of him; in fact on one occasion I cut his hair. The other fellows said that I should have his throat, but I am not of a vicious nature. It was the rule of the "" spit and polish"" gets him "" on the battery that we should turn out morning at 9 o'clock in tunics, bandoliers, and gas masks, and with everything spick and span as if we were in camp at taken Maribyrnong. As soon as the parade ought was over we stripped off our tunics accoutrements in order to do the job allotted to us. One day, my job was to grease the wheels of the battery, and as we had not a jack, I had to borrow, one from the 3rd Division which was bivouacked near by. By noon we had finished our dirty - task and returned the jack to the 3rd Division. On returnclearly ing to our. lines the mules which were tethered at the waggon line had been taken to water, which was about quarter of a mile away. Two mules remained in the lines. No. 1 battery called out, ""Yates, take two donks down to the water."" I said, ""Right oh."" I had just untethered the mules when the sergeant-major came and said, "" What are you doing there Yates?"" I told him that I had been degree instructed by my corporal to take the two mules to water. He said "" Y o u are not going t'o do it like that."" ""How should I do it?"" He replied, "" Wliere are your tunic, bandolier, and gas mask?"" I said "" I forgot all about the bally things."" He angrily replied, "" They are not bloody things."" I said him ""Do not put words like that into my mouth. I did not use that expression."" He said "" All right, get your tunic, bandolier, and gas mask."" I could have been am put on the mat for my remark to him. However with my greasy (black hands I the had to don my tunic and accoutrements. I After I had taken the donkeys to water I came hack to the lines to find that all solthe food had been served out and I had of come a ""gutzer"" for my meal. On the whole, I think I was a pretty decent solI knew jolly well that on that job we could not expect the easy conditions of civil life, and I was prepared to put up with a lot of the rough edges. But some men who are temperamentally difA ferent revolt against pin-pricks such as that I had received from the sergeantpermajor. They would have "" told him off,"" and would have been "" put on the m'at."" And remember that if the sergeant-major cut makes a charge against a man, and fails to get a conviction, he waits until he mat"" again. every When the man again appears he is regarded by the officer as incorrigible, for it is not known that the sergeant has special steps to catch him. In giving the power of court martial we to so safeguard it that no man and should be penalized in - the way I have indicated. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Charlton) was quite right when he took exception to the incorporation of the British Army Act and regulations in this Bill. The Australian people are too sane bo ever require the application of clause 45, the implication of which has been set before us by the Leader of the Opposition. When it is asked what difference there .is between sending artillery a and machine-guns, and sending aeroplanes, to the scene of some ""domestic"" of my trouble, it must be remembered that those the former can be used with some precision, whereas, in bombing by aeroplanes, hitting the target is largely a up matter of chance. The only time when bombing can be carried out with any of certainty is when the aeroplanes bank and are comparatively dead. I have known twenty-eight horses to 'be killed I said, with one bomb; and just fancy what * might be the effect, during some "" domestic "" disturbance, if Maitland or Port Adelaide were bombed. I am prepared to support aerial forces as the best means to of protection for Australia. We require coast-line defence; and this we could secure by means of an air force, even we had not a man in the standing"" army. The honourable member for . Wakepermanent field (Mr Foster) has twitted Labour party with taking the Comretain munists into its f o l d ; but I would not resort to bloody revolution, or hurt any one, in order to bring about the reforms I desire. I say this, although I am considered to be one of the "" reddest"" of "" red-raggers"" in my State. not wish to see violence and force used bring about the realization of our ideals, if only for the reason that I desire to be here when the realization comes, and i is generally the leaders who get into trouble first when any revolt takes place. I have experienced that. The Minister would be well advised to withdraw clause 45, which is sinister and vindictive its intention, and foreign to the spirit Australia.",32
142,Mr MCGRATH,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,It is copied f r o British Army Act.,33
143,Mr BOWDJEN,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"No . The duty upon the Commonwealth by the Constituand tion. All this clause does is to the machinery for carrying out that duty, and so puts the whole of our Defence Forces on the same basis.",33
144,Mr YATES,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"I suggest that, in order to meet any industrial or internal trouble, we should be satisfied with the we already have, and it is not imperative to place the A i r Force on the same footing as the military. pared to support, in the main, the - intention of the Bill , because I hold that the protection of Australia must on an air-fleet basis. But we must all provisions that are repugnant to Australian spirit. The greater the liberty given to the Australian soldier, the greater the confidence placed in him, the more he is enabled to realise that is a human being, the better it will Australia.",33
145,Mr MARE,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"Parkes) [3.23] - B y virfrom tue of his experience in the war, particutralia larly, no doubt in regard to courts tial, the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Yates) has made a very reasonable speech. We have, however, been discussthis ing clause 45 iand the question of courts damage. martial to the exclusion of the question air defence, although the proper deal with details is in Committee. The if Government have taken a proper step in preparing for a citizen as well as for a A i r Force. It will be greatly the to the benefit of Australia if we can in the Forces or in the Reserves the services of those men who acted as pilots and mechanics during the war, so that they may be available in time of need. The Bill , while excellent in the main, scarcely goes as far as it might. Leading I do generals are agreed that the air presents to the first line of our defence. No country in the world can obtain such advantages from the use of aircraft and wireless telet graphy as can Australia, and no country offers such facilities"" for experiment. The air service supplies the eyes of the military, and Australia must take advantage of the experience which our flying men in obtained in Europe. We sincerely hope of that in our time, at least, the necessity will not arise to defend our country as other countries have had to be defended. m the During the war we watched with anxiety for news of the bombing of the Motheris cast land by enemy aeroplanes and Zeppelins, T agree with the honourable member provide for Adelaide that there is nothing so dreadful as to be in the vicinity of a dropping bomb. One can judge, to a certain extent, where artillery shells may f all, but in the case of a bomb all is uncertainty, and"" the results are fearful. If our enemies' would agree, in the name of protection humanity, to abolish bombs^",33
146,Mr SCULLIN,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,Is there any humanity in war ? The abolition of war is our only I am prehope.,33
147,Mr MARR,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"I hope that a time may be come, and very soon, when wars will be delete no more, and that hope I base' on the the League of Nations, if only the United States will join it . In the meantime, however, there are nations close to Australia and which are preparing for war on the water, he on the land, and in the air; and we must be-for be prepared in the event of their daring to attack us. The surest defence is to-be prepared for attack, more particularly the air. It may be said that Ausis too far distant to be exposed to marany such danger, but the time will come, if it has not already arrived', when aeroplanes and Zeppelins will be able to reach part of the world and do material I am not altogether in favour of of clause 45, but that provision oan be stage to discussed in Committee. Mr SC^LMN - What is contemplated by this clause ?",33
148,Mr MARR,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"I do not know, but, eo doubt, the Minister will inform us when the' clause itself is under' discussion."" We had hoped that, as the outcome' of the Washington Conference, there would be a reduction of' armaments in all classes, but our hopes' hare hot been realized. There has been naval reduction to a certain extent, but nations close to Australia are building aeroplanes at a tremendous rate, and it is obvious that we should be doing likewise. It is necessary to promote aviation in all directions, not only for the purposes of defence, but also to provide rapid communication with districts remote from our big centres. This development is required if only from a humanitarian point of view, in order to insure that necessary medical attention may be quickly obtained. Most of the aeroplanes in Australia are not suitable for the work they are called upon to perform, and, for more reasons than one, we ought to be manufacturing our own, instead of relying on supplies from overseas. Planes imparled from the Homeland are not suitable for the climatic conditions of Australia; and,, in view of the fact that we may at some time find ourselves isolated from the rest of the world, it behoves usto make ourselves independent of outside aid. Under such circumstances, it would not matter whether we had ten thousand aeroplanes here, seeing they only last a certain time, and must be replaced. We may stock as many engines as we choose, for they do notdeteriorate', but the life of the aeroplane itself is short. AH aeroplane woodwork - should he manuf actured in Australia. It has heensaid that the Army Act is incorporated in this Bill.",34
149,Mr BOWDEN,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,The BiH does not embody the Army Act.,34
150,Mr MARR,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"And , therefore, I think the discussion today has beensomewhat wide of the mark. It has been suggested that copies of the Army Act are scarce, but I know that it can be obtained in the Parliamentary Library, and that copies cf the Act and the Krag's' Regulations were given to every officer who left Australia for the front.",34
151,Mr MATHEWS,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,Did ' you read them?,34
152,Mr MARR,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,I tried to.,34
153,Mr MATHEWS,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,Tbat would be as far as you got I,34
154,Mr MARR,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"I do not think that any one could commit to memory all the clauses of the' King's Regulations. T found that the more I read! them the less I knew about them. Yet it is stated that the British Army Act is the finest piece of legislation ever passed by the House of Commons. In my view certain of its provisions might very well be left out, although the greater number are necessary for the efficient conduct of an Army. The honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Yates) has admitted that some provisions of the kind are necessary to insure efficiency. I am prepared to say that in many cases men were dealt with much more harshly than they deserved. In some cases men were almost crucified for really trivial offences. One needed to be on active service and in the firing line to know whether he had any nerves. When I listen to a man who claims to have served at the Front for a number of years, and never to have been frightened all the time he was there, I alwaysexpect to shake hands with a'liar. Such a miany whether he was an. officer or a private, was, in my opinion, never in the firing line. To say that a soldier who saw active service was never frightened is a travesty of the truth. We aH, of course, professto be heroes, but we got our attacks of nerves at times when we felt it would be far better for our health to be further hack than we were from the firing line. For this reason, I always have very great sympathy for a man who is charged with desertion. I know that at one place in the desert where we were fighting it wasnecessary to put a bridge across a river; and, with one exception, every man in the pontoon used for the erection of the bridge was killed by machine gun fire, The exception went overboard and swamdown the river,, which was running at about six knots an hour, for two or three 1 miles. He then walked six miles across the desert to rejoin his unit, atfd he was 1 arrested for desertion. He was confined for six or eight hoars in a tent ih th> desert, and was then liberated, whilst theofficer who arrested himwas himself court 1 martialled' for arresting & man Under sUcb conditioHs. Mistakes have Been mafle-, and wiHl continue to be made; bu'f that' is no reason why courts' martial, should beentirely condemned. The honourable member for Adelaide spoke of a court martial held in ' a dug-out or tent, presided over by a junior officer.",34
155,Sir GRANVILL ERYBIE,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,It is quite ridiculous.,35
156,Mr MARR,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"A court martial is not constituted in that way. What the honorpassing able member referred to was, no doubt, simple court of inquiry. If a man makes charge against another he must put it writing, and-when the commanding officer receives' the charge he appoints an officer as a court of inquiry to investigate it .",35

158,Mr MARR,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"I had many charges reported to me as' a commanding officer, and my practice was to send for the man who was accused, and ask him what he had td of the men. say against the charge. If I considered his explanation Satisfactory, the charge went into the waste-paper basket. If did not consider it satisfactory I took official course. The men of the tralian Imperial Force possessed' common sense, and I never found it necessary} i controlling, m y unit, to have one court martial. Perhaps some of the men should have been court martialled, but I found that if I overlooked minor offences the same man would seldom appear before me a second time. Whilst I say this I admit that it is necessary to have some prouse visions ' giving, officers in command the power to take drastic action in certain circumstances. What we need to be caretions. f u l about is' to see that the severity such provisions is not so extreme young that the people of Australia would not approve of them.

I hope the House will pass the Bill . In Committee we can consider in detail the clauses about which there is a difference of opinion, and may amend them, where amendment is necessary, as honourable members generally desire.",35
160,Mr WEST,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"East Sydney) [3.10] - It is deplorable that in 1923, with our advanced civilization, this Parliament should be sitting to provide means for hilling human beings. We are asked under this Bill to make-provision for the most dreadf u l means of destruction that was used during the great war. Those who can speak with authority have said that there was nothing in the war so dreadful as the dropping of bomb's and poison gas by aeroplanes. A i r c r a ft were responsible for the destruction of women and children who had nothing to do with the causes for which the nations were at war. It has, however, been decided that an air force is a necessary part of a Defence Porce, and we must therefore consider how such a force may be best utilized. It should be remembered that to provide aircraft for defence or civil aviation is one of the most expensive undertakings that Australia could be asked to face. An air force has been established in the Dnited States of America, and one senator has said that the cost of the air force to America during the war was greater than the cost of the Panama Canal. Another used the phrase that the cost represented a dollar a minute since the birth'of Christ. In spite of this enormous expenditure America has not yet a sufficient air force for its defence. We have made an attempt to establish an air force, and up to the present have found it very expensive. As a member of the Public Accounts Committee, I assisted at an in quiry into our expenditure on air services, and I have to admit that we have very little to show for the money that has already been expended. A proposal has been made to establish an aerodrome in New South Wales, but the land for the purpose has not yet 'been purchased from the State Government. Some provision of the kind was to be made at Corio Bay, but I believe the Defence Department has turned that down. At present, as a matter of fact, we really have only one air force station, and that is at Point Cook. It may be interesting to honourable members to know what that has cost. In 1917-18 the expenditure was £ 3 2 0 ; in 1918-19 it was £ 1 , 9 7 6 ; in 1919-20 £1,413; in 1920-21, £139,928; and in 1921-22 the expenditure was £282,384. In 1922-23 the total was £173,637, and a further expenditure. on buildings of £267,546. This does not include expenditure on the maintenance of the staff, which, of course, is considerable. It cannot, be claimed that, at the ' present time, our A i r Force is efficient,, but I am not blaming the Department, because the. aitthorities have been labouring under very great disabilities, and we have had no legislative provision to place the A i r Force on a satisfactory basis. This Bill , however, contains an objectionable feature in clause 45, to which attention has been directed by the Leader of my party (Mr Charlton). There is no justification whatever for - the insertion of a clause authorizing the use of the A i r Force to quell' a civil disturbance. On only one occasion during the past fifty years has there been any serious attempt to use the M i l it a r y Forces of. the Commonwealth to put down a civil disturbance - That was about eleven years ago in Queensland. The Government of the day made an urgent appeal to the then Prime Minister  to Queensland to restore peace; but, fortunately, we had in office a Prime Minister of Mr Fisher's calibre. He declined the request, and it was subsequently disclosed, that there had been no occasion for alarm. I fail utterly to understand what actuated the Minister in allowing this objectionable clause to be inserted. If , at any time, there is any serious disturbance in any part of Australia, the police are available. No other force should be used. On one occasion, in the history of the British Parliament, Mr . Speaker Brand refused the offer of the Duke of Cambridge, who was the head of the Household Troops, to quell a disturbance at Parliament House. He declined to allow the soldiers within the precincts of Parliament, declaring that if there was any just cause for disturbance, the duty of the Government of the day was to remove the cause. That is the position I take up with regard to this suggestion that, on some future occasion, the A i r Porce of the Commonwealth might be called upon to interfere in a civil disturbance. If the police prove incapable of restoring order, then the causes underlying the trouble must be sought for and removed. No honourable member would dare go before the people on the hustings and tell them that, if returned, he would acquiesce in any policy that would lead to the use of the Militar y or A i r Forces to interfere with their liberties. The Bill deals also with civil aviation, which must play an important part in our future development. At present there are only two established air routes in Australia, namely, ;from Geraidton to Derby, in Western Australia, and from Charleville to Cloncurry, in Queensland. The subsidy paid the contractors for the maintenance of the Western Australian route is £25,000 a year, with an addition in the form of a guaranteed overdraft at the Commonwealth Bank, of £8,000, which has been secured on the company's assets. For the Charleville-Cloncurry route the subsidy is £12,000. It is obvious, I think, that if civil aviation is to be developed along sound lines, and take its r i g h t f u l position in any scheme for the air defence of Australia, it must be placed under the absolute control of the Government. The private companies interested in these air routes are having a hard struggle to get the money to carry on. Those who have: invested their money have lost it , and have no chance of recovering it . If we are to have an A i r Defence Force, we must encourage civil aviation, mainly because it will afford employment for our airmen, who must keepi n constant training to be efficient. An airman loses his efficiency if he does not fly at least every few months. auy rate a short absence from training considerably impairs his efliciency. recommendation of the Public Accounts Committee is that the Government shall take absolute control of civil aviation, and undertake the manufacture of machines and the necessary engines. That this is necessary has just been demonstrated by the fact that an engine sent out by Vickers, for use in a machine on .the Charleville-Cloncurry service, has proved quite unsuitable. The great surface heat in the western part of Queensland has rendered the engine inefficient for its purpose, and it has been found necessary to get a heavier engine out from Great Britain . Engines must be made to suit the variable climatic conditions of Australia. Generally speaking, the raw material for the manufacture of aeroplanes andengines is available here. Apart from the engine an aeroplane is mostly painted canvas and light timber. Australia has suitable light timber for the structural work, and it has been demonstrated that many of our timbers are eminently suitable for the manufacture of propellers. Some portion of the steel shafting may create a little difficulty, which should be overcome by the researches of chemists in our universities, or those who are working under the direction of the Institute of Science and In dustry. I recommend honourable members to read the report of the Public Accounts Committee. It was a difficult task Lo secure witnesses who could furnish in formation of value in connection with flying machines. Unfortunately, the Committee decided to' hold its inquiry in camera, and many persons who might have been in a position to give evidence of considerable value were quite unaware of the fact that such an important in vestigation was being undertaken in the vaults of Parliament House. When the first Defence Bill was under consideration in this House, honourable members generally were opposed to the system of courts martial, and, although they recognised that these tribunals were unavoidable in time of war, they laid down the condition that, where practicable, civil Courts should be availed of in connection with our Defence Forces. We had not the slightest idea then that a war lay ahead of us. Of course, we must have courts martial on the field of battle, but we think that proper regulations should At be laid down so that, wheu charges are made, or matters concerning breaches of The the regulations require investigation, they should be heard before, or investigated by, a civil Oourt. There should be no class distinctions, such as now exist, between soldiers and civilians. These distinctions are also preserved in the Navy. Why should our sailors be required to wear such a peculiar uniform? It is not only distinct from the dress worn by civilians, but also quite different from the uniforms of their officers. Whereas in the M i l it a r y Forces there is simil a r it y between the uniforms worn by the rank and. file and those worn by officers, naval ratings not only wear uniforms quite distinct from those worn by their officers, but they are compelled to wear bell-bottomed trousers, so wide that one could stuff pillows into them. I have never yet learned why sailors' trousers should be so wide. I have been told that it is because they are easily pulled up to display the leg-as if a sailor would to show any one what his leg loots like. There is absolutely no need for .courts martial in times of peace, and I think the Government would be well advised remove this objectionable provision from the Bill. Much as I detest the spending of money oa providing means for taking human Granville Ryrie). life, 1 know that it is essential that tralia should have some defence system, iand to this end must have an efficient air force. There is no knowing what will cost. England is spending millions upon millions on air defence. America hope .spent £400,000,000 in this direction in the course of three years, and in .the end there was nothing to show for that expenditure. It had, ,as it were,, all ap in the .air. Should any .'accident oeaur to a machine, fatal -.or otherwise, there bo be an inquiry, .departmental or otherwise, so that the public may know cause. Many lives will be lost through - accidents before the .efficiency of force is .established. If aeroplanes are to be used for services in Australia, and for the purpose of conveying medical men to far-distant localities where their services may be quired, there will need to be some reducmove tion in the cost of travelling. I undercost stand that the charge for conveying a doctor either way on the Geraldton-Derby route is £28. Not many people in counadjourned. try .districts can afford to pay such a charge. There is another reason why the Government should take \contSrQi of civil aviation. To make an .air route fairly efficient, it is necessary to have landing places 20 miles apart, and smallest landing .station .requires to beat least 50.0 feet long by 20.0 feet wide. The aerial service will have to be of considerable magnitude to be effective. means a heavy expenditure. Apart from - the cost of providing landing grounds, must recollect that we are already paying a subsidy .of £25,00.0 to one private .aviaassist tion .company and a suhsidy of £12,000 ,to another for the mail .service they give. To introduce these .services all over Australia will be most expensive. If we organize a perfect .civil .aviation service shall have a perfect defence service. The American people have spent .huge sums ilr. West. want of money on aviation, but they have many more people of considerable wealth than w.e have, and we can hardly compare - our conditions with theirs. I understand to that they .have .a million letters a year passing over one service. .For us to do anything like that will mean huge expense. I regret the remarks made by the honourable member for Warringah ,(&ir They were quite out pf Ausplace and uncalled for. I .cannot understand any one attempting to poison the minds of the .people against .the air it service by suggesting that it might be used for quelling domestic trouble, I I shall never hay.e .to listen to similar remarks. They belittle the people of Australia. Pluhlic men should strive .to uplift huge the people rather than degrade them. gone The publication of such remarks as these causes Australia to fall in the estimation flying of every intelligent .community. The ought provision for using aircraft to quell .domestic strife should he .eliminated the from the Bill. I cannot understand ""the Minister for Defence ;(Mr Bowden) our air fathering anything of that character. How could we allow defenceless and innocent women and children to mail have bombs dropped on them because of unfortunate circumstances in which they find themselves? We must be very careful rein dealing with this matter. We should slowly, and first find out what the of an efficient service will be.

161,Dr MALONEY,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"Melbourne) [3.51] That - I wish the House to know that I have been busily engaged"" in work to help the we 'unemjpjoyed. Good citizens of Melbourne .have sent me fairly large sums of money to those who .are hungry and homeless. Having had thirty-five years .of experience in helping the unemployed, I desired some - one to co-operate with me, and the Rev. can A. Yeates, of St. John's Mission, has we agreed .to ib.ecome co-treasurer. I notice that, according to the Patriot newspaper, that great humanitarian, Dr Arthur, M.JUA., of New South Wales, has suggested that one or two of the vessels lying idle and useless in Sydney Harbor should bo drawn up to one of the quays, that the homeless people of Sydney might take shelter in them. I ask the Prime Minister to think, daring the week-end, whether it may be possible to allow a hulk to be tied to the .pier at Port Melbourne to provide shelter for persons who may be sent thore by the Rev. Mr Yeates. He will guarantee that they are in need of shelter. I also wish to deal with Kendenup. gome time ago I asked the Prime Minister to inquire of the English Cabinet whether anything could he done to foroe the American firm which did not keep its engagement to do so. actions it enabled one of the most unmitigated scoundrels alive- I refer to Grant Hervey-to ruin Mr de Garis and the people in the Kendenup settlement. 1I have had experience of every village settlement established in Victoria. I was president of theiT associations. W it h Senator Stephen Barker, I visited every village settlement in Yictoria during the t igime of Sir James Patterson and Sir John MCIntyre. I adopted an attitude of active opposition to Mildura in the early days, similar .to that being adopted today by many people .towards the Kendenup settlement. I said it waB not f a ir to charge £ 2 0 and more per aere for land that had been obtained from tihe Victorian - Government for £ 1 per acre. I have lived long enough to see that my criticism was unjust. To-day .one of Victoria's greatest assets is the .settlement on the banks of the. Murray. I atn glad I was able to rote for a railway to be constructed to Mildura. Previous to the building of the line the nearest port to Mildura was Port Melbourne, 350 miles away, and the nearest railway station was 130 miles off. Yet, today, Mildura is one of the most thriving settlements in Victoria. I have no hesitation in saving that there are no more comfortable homes in any part of Victoria than those occupied by the community at Mildura. I have made an examination of the land at Kendenup. Much of it is good, though somo is seoond-class country. No one will hold, however, that great success cannot be obtained in fruit-growing on secondclass land. We have knowledge of what can be done elsewhere. There are splendid orchsTds in Tasmania, on the Tamar and Derwent, and in Vtetoria, :botti in country districts and close to the suburbs ' of Melbourne. Mr Willia m Sell, a friend of mine of forty-seven years' standing, has an orchard of 470 acres, which is, I .think, the largest in Australia. Kendenup is only 40 miles from :a port, and possesses railway eommunication. The reason-why the railway does not go through the .best land at Kendenup is because the Hasaell family had sufficient influence to cause it to be taken through the.poos land - The honourable member for Swan will agree with me in that, I . think. I have a photograph of an apple tree, - that after only eighteen months growth, overtops a man.6 feet high. I hope the Prime Minister will see his way to bring By its a little pressure to bear upon Sir James Mitchell, who is a good man and a personal friend of mine. I am sorry to have to say that I think the Government Departments of Western Australia, are opposed to the Kendenup settlement. That is the impression I formed during a stay of two months in Western Australia. Included amongst the 800 .settlers are seventy - soldiers who did not apply to the Commonwealth Government for tb* help to which they were entitled, but struck but boldly on - their own. If they are given as fair an 'opportunity as the Victorian Government gave to the settlers at Mildura nothing can prevent the sucoess of the Kendenup settlement. Its potentialities are - greater than those of Mildura, .and it has a wonderful asset in a regular and assured supply .of water from the clouds. I uadoistaiid that at Mildura water .for irrigation purposes costs as much as £ i 10*. per acre, I shall be pleased to make Available to any honourable member the last proposal sent to me on the subject by Mr Henry Moore, a fcrave old Englishman who has had much experience, and has converted his small - estate into a veritable botanical gardens. Mr BauCE ..(Flinders-Prime M i nister and Minister for External Affairs ) [4J}] - The representation the' honourable member for Melbourne made in regard to making a steamer available for homeless unemployed will reoeive the consideration of the' Government during the week-end. When I was in Western Australia recently I had a 'long conversation with Sir Jameg Mitchell about the lamentable position that has arisen at Kendenup. Sir James appreciates the necessity for doing something that will prevent a very promising settlement from becoming an irretrievable disaster. In order to temporarily alleviate their difficulties certain work has been made available to the settlers. That help is in addition to the sustenance paid to the soldier settlers by the Repatriation Department, and the Commonwealth is sharing with the State the expenditure involved.  given through the Industries Assistance Board.",38
162,Mr BRUCE,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"It is impossible for the State Government or any other authority to take action that will merely result in benefiting the debenture holders of the Kendenup settlement. Only one solution is possible, and that is that the trustees for the debenture holders shall realise the position and offer the land at a valuation, ignoring the inflated values that may have been created since the settlement has been in existence. Having regard to the conversations I have had with Sir James Mitchell and the assurance I gave him, if that action is taken I do not think there will be much trouble in putting the Kendenup enterprise on a more satisfactory footing.",40
163,Dr MALONEY,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"The Victorian Government passed an enabling Bill to allow of help being given to the Mildura settlers, and similar action might be taken in Western Australia.",40
164,Mr BRUCE,QUEENSLAND MARBLE,"No doubt the honourable member's suggestion will come under the notice of Sir James Mitchell. I have received a cablegram from the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr D. Cameron) stating that he is delaying-his departure from England, and has accepted the .invitation of the Government to attend the annual meeting of the Assembly of the League of Nations at Geneva as an associate delegate from the Commonwealth. It will be pleasing to the House to know that two of its members will be present ab that Conference and will be able ta give a first hand account of the proceedings. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at .4.6 p.m.",40
