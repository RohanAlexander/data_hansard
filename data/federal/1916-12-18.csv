What, can honourable members do, when, on a test being taken on Friday-or Saturday, the honourable member was the one "" Mack sheep "" „ of the Corner who voted with the Government in favour of the 6d: impost?

59,Mr MCWILLIAM S,Unknown,"Franklin-) [11.7]. - I "" amsorry that the Treasurer has taken, the step he has. This matter was discussed very thoroughly at the last sitting, and a distinct majorit y decided that the tax proposed 'was a fair and legitimate one. There was, it is true, little division amongst members, the honourable member for Capricornia voting with the Government and the majority, and some five or six members of the listening Liberal party, voting with the Labour party. However, a distinct and decisive majority decided that the tax proposed was fair and legitimate. Now, for reason at all, the 'Treasurer announces they seek to reply. that the proposal is to be withdrawn. I do not regard the argument of orable member for Barrier as a good one, for I do not believe - that it represents motive which is actuating the Govern the ment. What may be decided in another place should not affect - this Chamber, in before us., doing what it believes to be right. The Senate has very decided' powers, much fore larger than the majority here seem to think ; but when we are framing our tion proposals, and a majority distinctly approves of a tax, it is not treating us fairl y to withdraw it without some reason being given. 0",7

73,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"If the motion is carried to recommit the Bill , the honourable member will have ample opportunity to discuss the matter.",9
74,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Unhappil y the Treasurer has not seen fit to tell the House why he desires a recommittal. My long parliamentary experience induces me to believe that it is better to take "" half a loaf ' ' than nothing, but I am afraid that, if the Bill gets back into Committee, we may get only a "" quarter of a loaf."" My proposal was for a "" whole loaf "" in this taxation measure, but it has been - cut down one-half, and I apprehend there may be an attempt to cut it down still further. I submit that it would be unwise to recommit the Bill ; that we ought to take it as it is rather than ru n any risks, in view of the necessity to obtain money from various sources. have to find £100,000,000 this year, and will, of course, have to borrow much of that. It cannot all be raised by taxation; and we ought to shoulder a portion of our current burden, and not place the whole on posterity. As I have said, sound principles of government indicate that the larger portion of this money will have to be borrowed at as low a rate of interest as possible, although I am inclined to think, from the state of the money market, that we shall not be able to get much more at 4^ per centum. The conditions df the money market is very serious from the point of view of those who wish to borrow, as I dare say any of us would find if we endeavoured to get an overdraft on the insufficient security which most of us could offer. That is a point which must surely appeal to the Treasurer. He must recognise that it would be extremely difficult to borrow money at 4£ per cent. present time, the Imperial Government is paying 6 per cent, interest on Exchequer bonds, in addition to exempting those bonds from taxation in the case of persons who are not ordinarily resident in the United JKingdom. Seeing that, in the future, we may have to pay a higher rate of interest on our borrowed money, we must obtain revenue from some source. The Treasurer is very backward in coming forward with his income tax proposals.  the cause of the honourable member's anxiety in respect to the income tax.",9
75,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,If I may mention that tax as a possible source of revenue ,9
76,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! The honourable member must confine himself to the question, "" That the Bill be recommitted.""",9
77,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Ver y well. Then I will advance reasons why the measure should not be recommitted. If that course be adopted, I venture to say that there will not be as much money collected from the entertainments tax as there will be if we refuse to recommit the ' Bill . There has been no agitation on the part of the public to avoid the payment of. this war tax of ^d. on every 6d., and, in my opinion, the theatrical proprietors, and others who provide amusement for the general public, will not be called upon to pay the impost. If the tax be levied, the public will pay it most readily. Consequently, I object to the recommittal of the Bill . We shall Question resolved in the affirmative. In Committee (Recommittal) : Clause 4 posedThe rates of the Entertainments Tax shall be as follows, namely :Payment for Admission {excluding the amount of tax), Rate of Tax. Not less than fivepence and not exceeding sixpence-^-Jd. Exceeding sixpence 'nnd not exceeding one shilling-ld . Exceeding one shilling-ld . for the first shilling, and one Jd. for every sixpence or part of sixpence by which the payment exceeds one shilling. That the words ""Not less than fivepence, and not exceeding sixpence, Jd."" be left out.",9
78,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,"Moreton) [11.20] - I very much regret that the Government have submitted a proposal to abolish the tax of a - Jd. on 6d. tickets. By agreeing to that proposal, we shall probably sacrifice £100,000 revenue per annum which At the will have to be made up in some other way. Personally, I have not heard one complaint from the public in regard to this proposed tax. It is true that we have received wires from the various pictureshow proprietors who object to it , but the general public has not raised its voice against it in any part of Australia. I quite agree with the view that haa been expressed by the honourable member for Capricornia, and if members of the party to which I belong are going to stick to the Government, the latter should certainly stand by their nnancial policy. The time bas arrived when Australia should be led by strong men who are prepared to nail their colours to the mast. To bend simply because somebody has suggested that the Senate w i ll reject this tax is a lamentable exhibition of weakness on the part of the Government.",9
79,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,Who said that?,10
80,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,I heard the honourable member for Brisbane say it . Mr 'FINLAYSON - The honourable member did not ,10
81,Mr HAMPSON,Unknown,I said it . The Government are afraid of the Senate.,10
82,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,"It strikes me that they are, and if the'honourable member for Capricornia presses this matter to a division, I shall be found voting with him.",10
83,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"West Sydney-Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [11.23] The original amendment in the d r a f t Bill was made as the result of representations by the deputation about which I spoke on Friday. I stated then that if that deputation was not representative of the industry, I had been assured that it was, and that I was prepared to listen most carefully to any deputation which was truly representative of it . On Saturday, a deputation waited on me, which represented the whole of the picture shows of Australia that are in associations, with the exception of those that were represented at the former deputation. The point which the different speakers made was the one which had weighed with the Government at the original deputation, namely, that there is a certain definite amount which the publio are prepared ,to spend on amusements. If we diminish that by means of taxation, we shall not get what is spent now plus the amount of the tax. In other words, only the same amoulnt will be spent under' the new system as under the old. I am unable to say wliether that is so or not, but the view was pressed with considerable force, and there is this much to be said in support of it-that in England, where the tax was"" very heavy, the experience of the Chancellor of the Exchequer has been that the number of shows which have been forced to has been very numerous indeed. As a result, he has now been compelled to revise his schedule. As we wish to ""get revenue, I submit that it is undesirable to impose a tax unless it will produce revenue. On the whole, I am inclined to think that we shall get as much revenue under the schedule as it is proposed to amend it as we would get under the original schedule, and for that reason I urge the Committee to accept it .",10
84,Mr BOYD,Unknown,"Henty) [11.26] - The argument put forward by the Prime M in ister, if it applies to revenue to .be derived from 6d. tickets, must also apply to all tickets in excess of 6d. Consequently the depreciation which will take place in the lower-priced tickets will also take place in the higher-priced ones. Personally, I share the view that has been expressed by the honourable member for Capricornia. In this discussion it is very evident that honourable members are expressing their own individual views untrammelled by party considerations. That is as it should be in connection with every matter which comes before this Chamber. I thoroughly agree with, the honourable member for Capricornia that the man who pays 6d. to visit a picture show will not object to a £d. tax being levied upon his ticket, knowing full well that the impost is for war purposes. What is the position today ? We have three States in the Commonwealth, taxing amusements. If we exempt the 6d. tickets from taxation, the State Parliaments will probably impose a tax on them, and will thus raise a portion of the additional revenue which they require so badly. They will argue that as this Parliament has put a tax on amusements, it is perfectly legitimate for them to levy an impost on what has been left untouched. Thus, instead of amusements escaping taxation, the revenue will find its way into the coffers of the State Treasuries, to be used, not for war purposes, but for entirely different purposes. Seeing the position that we occupy today, and recognising the increasing difficulty of raising money by means of loans, I am strongly of opinion that, wherever there is a legitimate source of taxation which can be exploited without oppression, we should take advantage of it . The> opposition to this tax does not proceed from the public. It comes from the proprietors of picture shows, who fear' to pass the tax on to their clientele. If it close be made mandatory that they shall do so, the Government will derive a large revenue from the tax, which otherwise it will sacrifice. I trust that the Committee will not agree to the proposal of, the Treasurer thereby sacrificing £100,000 of re.venue without a fight. "" Mr HAMPSON (Bendigo). [11.30] am opposed to the taxation of amusehonorable ments, especially of 6d. tickets, because think it is a miserable form of raising venue. Nevertheless I am astonished to find the Government, who declare that the | d . charge on 6d. tickets means £100,000 in revenue, should coolly pose to abandon the tax. I understood that they were imposing a tax which people would be asked to pay as a means of raising revenue for the war.",10

Mr HAMPSON I will not. am surprised that the Government, according to the Conservative (press, present the brains of the party which they have left , and who have a majority i this House, should run away from the position they took up. I believe the reataxes. son for their action is that they another knock from the Senate. It is pitiable and degrading that the business of the country should be conducted this fashion.",11
86,Mr SHARPE,Unknown,"Oxley) [11.32] - I rise to express my appreciation of the vernment's action. The lighter we can make taxation the happier the people pay. will be. The only reason for the recent * Conference of Premiers was that the States might make overtures to the ral Government in regard to the raising of additional money. We have been told by some honourable members that it w i be necessary for the States to impose taxation in whatever field is left open them by the Federal Parliament: We have a splendid opportunity to advocate Unification in order to prevent a duplibecause cation of taxation. Other honourable memhas bers view the position as I do, but they are not so ready to state their opinions. - It is - satisfactory to know that the Government will not impose this tax on the poorer classes of the people, who already <,bear the greater portion of the'burden taxation. To impose direct taxation on the amusements of the poor, would not a creditable action on-the part of this 'Parliament. .Therefore,.I am pleased that the .Government have taken-a liberal view, or have heen-.compelled-to recognise that of the - community? the majority .of .members are ..opposed -.to : the 'taxation *of .fid. .tickets.",11
87,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Maribyrnong) ;[11.35], - I : a m pleased tthat .the .Government have acceded to the' request to abandon the- I tax on the masses of the people. The member for Franklin said that I he could hardly conceive of a'Government rewho had already obtained a 'majority vote on this question asking for a recommittal"" of the clause in order to reverse the decision of the Committee. One of the prostrongest requests made for the reconsideration of this matter was preferred the by honourable members who previously had voted with the Government on this matter. The Leader of the .Liberal party strongly urged the Government to refrain to from, taxing 6d. tickets, and it is in response to the request of those who supB u t I ported the Government, as well as those who, who opposed them, that the Treasurer re has reconsidered the matter. My - main reason for opposing the taxation of 6d. n tickets is that the great masses of the people already pay practically all theTaxation is always passed on until fear it filters down to the masses.",11
88,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"The honourable member knew that when he supported the imposii n tion of all the existing taxation. Mr FENTO N We must have some form of taxation, but I am .opposed to a Godirect tax upon the poor people beingadded to that which they already have to",11
89,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Franklin) [11.38] - I join with those who have exFedepressed regret that the Government should, without the slightest explanation, have abandoned this tax. The question l l was fought out on its merits on Friday, and by twenty-five votes to eighteen theto Committee deliberately adopted the tax as fair and proper. What reason is given for the abandonment of the tax? Is it it is not fair, or because therebeen complaint from the people? No . The Prime Minister gives .as his reason the fact that certain proprietors of picture shows have complained to him. The tax will not be paid by both the. proprietors; of and the patrons. Every member has received correspondence from proprietors in be which they prove that they ""alone will be called upon to pay this levy. If they are:to pay, how can it be said that the tax iis an unfair Impost on the poorer classesA t - this - time - the.Commonwealth :requires - all '.the - revenue;obtainable. EFhe .Treasurer, -- when defendi n g Tfche ctax, said ithat :its > abandonment*. would: mean the surrender of. at least £100,000 per annum.. Is the financial position such, that we can afford to lose that money ?- In ordinary circumstances, this is a tax which should not be imposed by a. Federal. Parliament, but we know that in three States, already an amusements tax has been imposed, and other States will certainly soon put it into operation. I know that some of them have based their taxation proposals on the understanding that the Federal - Parliament would impose certain taxes. soonas it is known that we nave abandoned, certain, taxes, the States will impose not only theiroriginal taxes, but also those taxes which the Federal Government had intended to impose. Thus the people will, still have to pay the taxation,, but the proceeds will go to the States instead of to the. Commonwealth. the people of this Parliament thoroughly realise the. enormous financial responsibilities resting, upon us in connection with this war. We are in this fight for keeps, and Australia must provide - and I believe the people axe prepared to provide-the enormous amount of money necessary to carry on the war.' The ex-Treasurer in troduced an amusements tax, which would have yielded more than double the amount of the tax introduced by the present Trea surer. The honourable member for Capricornia showed conclusively that amount of revenue he estimated ought to be obtained from 'this source. The present Treasurer reduced the proposals of ""his. predecessor by more than. half. Now, after the Committee, by twenty-five votes toeighteen, have supported the Govern* mentis proposals, it is not fair to. honourable members, nor is it in the best in terests of the community,, that, simply becausepicture show proprietors have in terviewed the. Prime Minister, the Government should ask us-to completely alter the system of taxation. If the Treasurer wishes to get his taxation proposals through-- Parliament,, he will require to show more-backbone than he. has shown in regard to this, matter. He. cannot expect honourable members to; help - hira to. fight his proposals, through the. House, if,, at the first opposition from outside Parliament, . he abandons the measures.",11
90,Mr W ELLIOTJOHNSON,Unknown,Hav e we swallow-his-taxation proposals whether we believe them just-or not? ,12
91,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"T l i o s e boncrable members who-, like the honourable member forLang', did not considerthetaxwas necessary, were perfectly justified in voting against it . It is not treating the Committee fair l y , after they have thrashed the matter out thoroughly and endorsed the policy of the Government by twenty-five to eighteen, to ask us, for no reason except that two or three picture show proprietors have interviewed the Prime Minister, to throw all our p r in ciples overboard. The honourable memAs ber for M'aranoa laughs, but I hope that 'whenever the House deliberately passes taxation proposals it is acting on some principle. There is no. sounder principle in taxation in time, of war than to tax the amusements and pleasures of the people rather than their necessities. If a division is taken, I shall vote for reI do not think taining t i e tax which the Committee agreed to on Priday. Mr KELLY .(Wentworth) [11.47] The Treasurer has placed a number of his supporters in somewhat of a difficulty by the back-down of the Government. The Government fel l into an initia l error in agreeing to accept, at the hands of the amusement proprietors, a schedule upon . which taxation governing their industry sbould be based. If you are going to ; the make an inquiry, it should be made on some fuller and better ground than the mere ipse dixit of the man who is going; in the first place, to be taxed. We hear a lot about the people having to pay the tax, but it is quite possible that the in tense anxiety of the proprietors reflects their fear that they will have to bear the increase, and not be able to pass it on to the people. But, the Government having accepted a schedule based on the representations of the proprietors, that schedule is carried through Committee with the assistance of. those who are jupporters of the Government in a particularly difficult situation. Then we are told that the picture-show proprietors were not represented on. the first deputation, and. the Prime Minister says, "" if that is so, 'we shall reconsider our position."" I say, "" If that is so you have to reconsider the whole position, andi not a portion, of it . "" to If the-, ground has, been pirated by the theatrical companies, representing themselvesas: holding: the complete authority of the picture houses,, and so getting theatricalentertainments taxedi lighter as the result of the common movement, the whole thing is open to review. Otherwise the Government have shown themselves to be the most easily cajoled body of persons one could imagine in a responsible position. I wish the Treasurer well in his very difficult task, and am putting the case as mildly as I can, and without offence. If two sides of an industry are represented as coming together and agreeing upon a common basis of taxation, and you find you have been defrauded into believing that that is so, you are surely not bound to stand by your arrangement with the people who have deceived you. I was assured on Saturday by a gentleman connected with picture theatres that the people who told the Prime Minister that they represented the picture theatres were speaking absolutely without any author i ty whatever, and for their own ends. Having got their ends, they do not care now whether you exempt the picture theatres or not. Their tax has been halved. Is. the arrangement the Government came to on their false representation to stand so far as tliey* are concerned, and be wiped out entirely as far as all other proprietors are concerned? thing is absurd.",12

94,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Was that the putation on Saturday?,13
95,Mr KELLY,Unknown,No ; the one on which the whole schedule was based. whole schedule is in the nature of a compromise.,13
96,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Fro m which pictures have evidently been left out. The proposal today is an attempt to put the pictures on the same footing as the others.,13
97,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"B y no means. original proposal was to start on a basis of 3d. on picture-show tickets, and in crease by l d . for every 6d. right through the schedule. Owing to the representations of the theatrical managers, the tax was wholly taken off the 3d. tickets.  The reason it was altered was because of its effect with six different States operating. Our position is very different from England, where the one tax applies.",13
98,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I am only paraphrasing what the Prime Minister told us on Friday night, that he saw the deputation and it agreed to the common rate, as shown in the schedule. I am going to tell the Committee-and I say it in sadness-the reasons which L think have actuated this particular backdown. I do not think anybody in the Committee believes that the people will be any the worse o£E for having to pay this tax, but I believe that every man in the Committee knows full well that the picture theatre is a very fine means of propaganda work, and may possibly be used against persons who vote in favour of the imposition of the tax. In the past history of this Parliament, whenever an interest has been powerful, politically and electorally, that interest has avoided Commonwealth taxation. For many years in this Parliament newspapers got all their materials of industry free through the Tariff. Now, apparently, in tims of war we are going to exempt an industry, not because the people patronising it will object to pay, but because it is feared that the anger of the proprietors who really have to pay The will bear hardly upon the men whose sense of d u t y to their country has been higher than their fear of consequences. We have heard a great deal about the poor people having to pay the tax, and we have heard the common complaint that all taxation whereover imposed filters down until the de- whole community has to bear it . That is a fundamental truth . Then do the Committee want to impose taxation upon The necessaries, taxation .that will ultimately filter down until all have to bear it , or a direct tax upon people exercising the the ordinary pleasures of life? There can be no comparison between the fairness of such a tax as this, and the unfairness of taxing those carrying on legitimate reproductive industry to secure the means The of waging this war into which we are all plunged. The only argument in the minds of honourable members against this tax is the fear of the influences that they may have to face if they do not prostitute their positions. I take great interest in picture productions, and enjoy them more than I enjoy the theatre, so that I am in no way prejudiced against the picture industry, but it is, so far as money making is concerned, almost primarily and solely American. The films are almost all produced in America, where the topics are chosen. They are sent to us, and our people part up their spare cash, which-largely, in some way or other, goes back to the United States of America. The industry j n Australia, unless watched- I do not mean unfairly watched, . because as a patron of the pictures I should object to anything in the nature of unfair restriction of their activities-wil l have a tendency Americanize the place. We find American weaknesses portrayed, but nothing of British strength. The whole place is becoming Americanized in its symbols and ideals. This means of propaganda has since the war started been used by our enemies through American agencies operating by means of picture theatres in this country. I - became a little suspicious a considerable time ago of what German money might buy from the film producers in the United States of America, and spoke to the authorities. They introduced a war censorship over films. This has already disclosed that films have been imported here which by their nature could not fail, and no doubt were intended, to have the effect of causing disturbance and mutual jealousy between the Allies, and undermining our faith in our common cause. Films have also been imported apparently for the sole purpose of conveying the impression that the German is a much-maligned person, and in reality the only honest, straightforward, Christian being on the face of the globe. I do not say that all Germans are bad, but I 'recently saw an American film which passed the censor, because there was nothing offensive to the Allies in it , but whose subtle purpose was undiscovered. Every character in it was either shallow or cheap, with the exception of an old German photographer, and he was the finest and most benevolent old character that I have ever seen on a film. The character was treated by a truly sympathetic hand, and the production was magnificent. Every other character was shallow, cheap, and contemptible. And we have had films brought here from America that have been produced in order to cause trouble with the most loyal of our Allies. Men may be afraid of their places in this House, but they must stand to the count r y to which they belong, and see that thia agency is not used through America for the sapping of the faith of our people, or the sapping of our belief in our Allies. There are other sides of this matter that would get no sympathy from honourable members. The picture theatre is'a big opportunity for propaganda, and for t h a i reason, the country is to give up revenue to the extent of £100,000. The Government might have treated their friends more fairly. By standing to what the' House had decided, they would have to treated the country more fairly. I shall vote as I voted on Friday last, in sup-, port of the proposition originally put forward.",13
99,Mr DANKEL,Unknown,"Boothby) [12.2] - Las t week I voted with the Government on this question, and the reasons which actuated my doing so induce me to vote against them today. I am a frequent attendant at picture shows. Many of the subjects shown are instructive and educational, while some of the dramas depicted are of high moral value to the people who see them.. At the same time, we all know that picture shows are a form of amusement. If we were asked to tax the necessaries of life, I should be the last to vote in favour of the proposition, but this is a proposal to tax amusements, and I think that it should be retained as originally submitted. Some of the arguments brought forward in opposition to the im position to the tax of $d. on 6d. tickets verge on the ridiculous. The honourable member for Maranoa sought to make out that it would interfere detrimentally with recruiting. I refuse to believe that if the and tax were imposed it would affect recruiting, either detrimentally or beneficially. I should be sorry indeed to think that it would influence recruiting in any way. An amusements tax has been in operation in South Australia for a considerable time past-if I am not mistaken, the tax is even imposed on 3d. tickets-and I have not obser ved any diminution of the attendances at theatres and picture shows there. I believe that the public has not raised the slightest objection to the'tax. I shall vote for the retention of the tax on 6d. tickets.",14
100,Mr CORSER,Unknown,"Wide Bay) [12.5] - I had not the opportunity of voting on Friday. If I had been here, I would have voted against the Government. There are largo numbers of people in country districts to whom picture shows are the only medium of entertainment. It is all very well to look at this matter from the point of view of Sydney, Melbourne, or Brisbane,, where the pictureshows are runningall day, and practically all. night. Ifi t were a question of taxing them, I believe that they could well afford' to pay the tax. In outside districts, however, where-the population; is very scattered, and people are hundredsof miles from any large entertainments, pictures are exhibited at night only. The proprietors of"" the shows provide the very best entertainment they possibly can for a verysmall return - It is hardly fair that they should have to face the hardship of being further taxed-, or of having to increase rates, which would prevent many people from attending, thus causing the shows to be closed down altogether, depriving the people in small country districts of any means of entertainment. I shall support the amendment providing for the removal of the tax on sixpenny and lower-priced tickets.  gratulate the Ministry. Their only supporter has declared against the Government. If there is to be a wrecking at the very - first chance that comes along, honourable members of our party have great hopes indeed. I cannot understand why somany honourable members who support this reduction of. the tax are flogging the Treasurer for acceding to their request. They put me in mind of an. Irish woman who used to be on the central railway many years ago. One of her children was a bit of a rebel. Whenever she called the children this was usually the dialogue-: "" T e r r y ! "" ""Yes, mother; what is it ? "" ""Come in here."" "" I won't."" Then the mother would come to thedoor of the tent and let go-"".You won't? Whatever you do now, you come in and I ' l l bate you; an' if you stop out I bate you; whatever you do I ' l l bate you."" That is the position of many honourable members. They are anxious to see the Government, bring: about this reduction, and yet they flog: them for doing the right thing. I . was very pleased to hear the dissertation given' by the honourable member for Boothby as to. the art of the pictures shown, because my experience as whip was that I had the "" devil's own -"" job to keep himaway from the picture shows when the House was in session. Mr MASSYGREENE. - That is not playing the game..  the honourable* member - is an authority on these pictures, bufc I cannot for the life - of me see why he should oppose the Goo vernment when it proposes to do somer thing for the wives and familiesofthose who sent him here to represent them, in Parliament. Even though he knows that his knocker has been wrenched off the door, the least he can do is to be faithful to them in his last act, and relieve themi of some of the taxation' that honourable members in this. House wouldimpose on them no matter how heavily or hardly it might fall on them. I have told the Treasurer that there are ways and means of. getting, over the difficulty. He could impose a their direct tax on unimproved land' values,, which would bring in. a great deal more than the £100,000 that he proposed to take from t i e youngsters attending picture shows. I have no doubt that honourable members on going to picture shows ih country towns have seen numbers of youngsters outside who would have liked to go inside, but had not the means of doing so. I have often .given four or five of them 2s. or 2s. 6d. so that they might go in and get a little enj'oyment which I , as a youngster, never got. That is oneof the reasonsthat make me stand up for these youngsters. I never had a game of cricket, a gam© of football, or even a game of marbles, when I was a youngster, and I do not wish to seeany child s life in Australia any less bright than it is possible for it to be.",14
101,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"Some pretty old children attend the picture shows.  (honourable member for.Wannon talking as he does, because the picture shows are nothing to him; he looks for something bigger; he would, perhaps, rather go across to the Palace Theatre every night and see the leg show. Perhaps it would ' l l suit him better. If he only got the enjoyment out of life that the sound of the rippling laughter of children gives to me, he would not seek to put an extra tax on their mirth. I support the amendment.",15
102,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"Wannon) [12.12] - I am not in the position of most of the honourable members who have spoken today, because I was not in the chamberwhen the vote was taken on Priday. I was on the road to my - constituency. I look at the proposal and theintention to modify thei tax from the point of view of its application to. the Government's proposal's to raise money to finance the war. I must say that the attitude taken by the honourable member for Capricornia- I d'o not know anything' about the motives that prompted him-wa s in the.right-direction. Mr ..HIGGS -^Then why .question it ?",15
103,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"The .honourable member-si attitude of "" f r i e n d l in e s s"" towards the 'Government lately has made me almost doubt .him. H a d I been here on Friday, I would have voted with the Government, but I cannot support a Treasurer who is prepared to back and fill within a'day or two without giving a --better reason than .he.has given. He has not told us .how-much-money ;he is: going to lose, or by how.much his Estimates for the year will be reduced. . It . is all kum "" on ithe part , of the .honourable member for Maranoa to tell 'us that picture shows are attended by children only. .As to the-.class of. entertainment that he suggests I might attend, I.select my own form of entertainment, and my own time for attending. But I wisli to say that it might be well for the-House to review the whole question of picture shows. There is a side of them that is unclean. On the whole, I believe many of the pictures are instructive, but I would not let my kiddies go to them u n t i l I knew what they were going to see. In regard to the merits of the tax itself, it is not a.tax on the poor or the rich, as far as necessaries are concerned; it is a tax on the surplus money of the household. If , during the war time, all the picture shows in Australia were closed down, no one would be poorer, except, perhaps, the few who are running them, or hav© shares in them.",16
104,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Would the honourable member close ' everything-race-courses , football grounds, and so on ?",16
105,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"I am not proposing it , but I do say that honourable members in the Corner, who are so anxious about the welfare of picture-show proprietors are not moved by the same motives that influence me in this matter.

I snould like to know from Treasurer how much, he is prepared yield to the request from proprietors picture shows. DT . CARTY .SALMON"" (Grampians) [12.16] - There appears to be some amount of misapprehension with regard to the course adopted byrthe Government The - Prime .Minister told us on Frida that the original proposal of 'the surer was the result of a consultation which he bad had with those interested in thia form .of entertainment, but it was pointed :out during a discussion that the proprietors of certain picture shows were not represented'at that conference, and he then agreed to place the matter before their representatives. In the meantime, he asked this House to pass the measure and send it on to the Senate, where any neeessary alteration could be made. I in tervened at the time, and asked the Go-' vernment to make any alterations desired "" b u n - in this House, and not in another place.. Heconsented to that proposal. MT . SAMPSON - Tba t was with regard to the exemption of expenditure. Dr CAETY SALMON"" - No ; it was on the question of exempting the 6d. tickets, and that is the question"" we are dealing with now.

108,Mr EODGEBS,Unknown,That is too weak.,16
109,Dr CARTYSALMON,Unknown,"I agree with housethe action of the Government, and of the tbose honourable members who, on the in to "" formation which the Government tben of had, sunnorted the previous proposal. On the further information now available they will have just as much reason to support the Government in this amendment. Mr SAMPSON , (Wimmera ) [12.2.0;]. - I am.much disappointed that 'the .Goy vernment'.h ave reversed - their original. deTreacision. Wben this matter ,was last - before the House, an amendment was .moved to exempt from taxation all 6d'. tickets, including tickets of admission to football matches and every otber form of amusement, but that amendment was defeated, as was also a further amendment to exempt 6d, tickets of admission to picture shows. It appears to me that the Government are now attempting to flout a deliberatedecision of this Committee, given on two distinct occasions. Members declared that the tax should be imposed, and by their vote ibey indicated that they considered it a just tax. The proposed tax sbould not be withdrawn unless the Go/ernment can furnish unanswerable evidence that it is an unjust one. The proposals of the last Government were supposed to bring in £1,000,000, but they were reduced by two-thirds by the present Treasurer, who declared, however, that the money was required to help carry on the war. W it h that assurance to guide us, and believing the tax to be a just one, the Committee voted in favour of its imposition, and now the Government are recommitting the whole clause, with a view to the remission of the taxation on the 6d. tickets.",16
110,Mr EODGEBS,Unknown,The Prime Ministerwhole thinks that a - Jd. tax will decide whether a person will or will not go to a show.,17
111,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"So far as my recollection goes, this question of the entertainment tax was, prior to the war, regarded as a fair measure of taxation, as a very large amount of money changes hands i Australia in connection with outdoor indoor entertainments; and, so have escaped this form of taxation. In the press and on the public platform, we have vised by you. been urged to make some form of sacrifice - in accordance with the means of every individual person-to carry on the war. The proposed tax of Jd. on a 6d. entersources tainment ticket appears to me to be very modest one, and I am not quite sure that the Government were right i exempting the 3d - tickets, though I think because they had no money. that in the case of parents with families the children should be admitted at price and be exempted from the tax. tickets If the exemption were not made, it is possible, of course, that the proprietors entertainments would make a uniform charge of 4d - strikin g out all 3d. tickets - and thus escape the tax altogether. I common with every other member of Parterous liament, I received a number of telegrams from the management of various picture country shows dealing with this matter. pears we are expected, on such ex parte statements, to arrive at a proper decision without regard to the national exigencies. During the discussion of the Tariff, there were the same complaints about the practice of lobbying, and the presentation of ex parte statements to members of Parliament. I regret that the Government have not seen fit to stand to their guns. It was due to the Committee that the Government should' have presented honourable members with the whole of the information available before they asked them to reverse the vote given on a former occasion. We decided, by two separate divisions, that the tax was a just one. The Government should have abided by that, and sent the Bill on to another place, to allow that Chamber to take the responsibility of rejecting it . The Government declared on one day that the revenue to be obtained from this tax was necessary to carry on the war, and yet the next day they were prepared to sacrifice £120,000 or £130,000. This will create suspicion as to the reliability of the Government estimate in connection with the of the war expenditure. I regret the action of the Government, but I hope picture they may make some modification of the proposal, such as will enable this House to retain its hold on the finances.",17
112,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Capricornia) [12.28] I think the Treasurer, after having heard the arguments from the supporters on both n sides of the Chamber, might see fit to and withdraw his proposal to exempt the 6d. far, we tickets to picture shows. ",17
113,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I again draw his atten-, tion to the danger of neglecting all these of revenue. When the honourable a member for Maranoa was speaking this morning, he spoke about certain poor boys n not being able to go to a picture show Unfortu nately, "" The poor ye have always with halfyou,"" and even if we exempt the 6d. we will still have the unfortunate lads standing outside the doors of picture of theatres. I am afraid that if the Government surrender their trust to the Leader, of the Liberal party, as they will.have n to do before long-becaus e it is preposthat twenty-four men out of 111 should continue the Government of this It ap- The CHAIRMAN - Order !",17

115,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"That would bring in revenue, whereas this would not, because, if imposed, people would avoid, going to places of amusement.",18
116,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"The Treasurer has told us he is sacrificing £100,000 _per annum by giving way to those honourable members who have advocated the omission of the tax on 6d. tickets. My fear is that if we do not avail ourselves of this form of taxation, we shall have taxes upon the necessities of the people. No one can say that amusements are a necessity. people want entertainment, they heed not necessarily go to a picture show or a theatre. Following the advice of Buskin, they might sit on a h ill and watch the clouds on a beautiful afternoon, or spend the evening in watching the stars. If they prefer a theatre, what is to prevent their coming to this House, admission to which is free.",18
117,Mr COBSEB,Unknown,"It would be a long way for country people to come. , Mr HIGGS - I heard the honourable member speak of the difficulties of country people in respect to means of entertainment.

While we as a community are attending picture theatres and other entertainments the price of admission to which is 6d. or Is., there are men in"" the trenches in Europe who have to be provided for, arid we can provlcte for only by taxation. It was absurd, as a matter of fact, to propose a tax of only one half-penny. It was too small to begin with, and when we find the Government backing down on such a proposal, we must realise that there has not been that return to responsible government which the Prime Minister spoke of some time ago. "" We have returned at last to real responsible government,"" he said, when he proceeded to select his own Ministers. When the Treasurer, confronted with an expenditure of £100,000,000, and with the necessity for imposing taxation, backs down on a proposal to put a tax of Jd. on every 6d. amusement ticket, merely because a few honourable members demand its abandonment, then he certainly merits the adverse criticism that has fallen frpm the lips of the honourable member for Wimmera with respect to his backing and filling in the matter. „ Amendment agreed to.",18

122,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"West Sydney-Prime Ministei' and Attorney-General) [12.36]. - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. This is a Bill for an Act relating to unlawful associations. [Quorum formed.] It sets out in ""its preamble the purpose for which it is introduced, and is limited to the period of the war, and six months thereaftsr. Under clause 3, certain associations are declared to be unlawful, and the subsequent clauses deal with punishments for certain acts. This measure is introduced mainly to deal with an association known under the sonorous and imposing title of "" The In dustrial Workers of the W o r l d , "" the short title of which is "" The I . W . W . "" This organization like most big things in these later days, had its origin in the honUnited States of America. Those responsible for its genesis were probably theorists and philosophers rather than men who translated words into deeds; but at a comparatively early stage of its history it separated into two bodies, one known as them the Detroit association, and the other as the Chicago association. The Chicago in stitution is that which is particularly active in this country. T t cam© here some eight or ten years ago, and for a time attracted very little notice, finding its» earlier recruits mainly, if not entirely,! amongst, the revolutionary Socialists. Of i late years it has made some strides. It s influence, however, is not to be measured merely by its membership. It s constitution, to which I shall refer later, and its propaganda, have appealed to many peopl© - who have not joined' the associa1 tion, and-' it is not too much to say that the virus ofi its doctrines has poisoned a considerable portion of the body economic in this country. I "" shall not waste any words about the objects of.this organization, as stated in its preamble, but refer honourable members to the preamble itself, and in vite them to notice that the means by which the workers of the world are directed to cure their economic heritage is through the general strike. I want to remove/a misapprehension in the minds of many persons as to what the general strike here referred to means. It is not to be confused with strikes, no matter how widespread, of an ordinary character. It is not, for example, a strike for the purpose of increasing wages from Is. to Is. 6d an hour, or from Is. 6d. to 2s. an hour,, or for the remedying of a specific grievance in working conditions. It is* a strike for the purpose of effecting a permanent economic revolution. It does not pretend to spring from any particular grievance. It does not pretend to cure any particular grievance. It is immaterial for this purpose whether there is a good cause for a strike or not. The principle underlying the whole business is that it; is through a complete paralysis of in dustry alone that the economic salvation of the working classes can be effected. That is the basic principle, and the meansby which the general strike is to be brought about arer immaterial. cause will do, or none. Th© sympathetic strikeappears to offer the widest opportunities. A dispute, no matter how trivial to one section of an industry, is to be taken up by all, so that a sporadic outbreak in an industry employing, say, 150 hands would be a sufficient reasonand cause for a completecessation of work by every personengaged in all classes of in dustry throughout Australia-that is, a general' strike. A general strike is a weapon which, of course; is, in effect, an open declaration of war against society. The methods of thia* association are frankly those of open war. They are not confined to those methods which are sanctioned amongst civilized nations at war; but they also embracethose other methods which, in international warfare, would fallunderthe head of ex-plosive bullets, the poisoning ofwells, and' the. infecting of the enemy with loathsome diseases. Just as recourse-to these methodsi n interMr Hughes. national warfare is considered' to place the nations that practise them outside the pale of civilized nations, so these methods of the Industrial ""Workers of 'the ""World, sabotage and the like, must place tbose who practise them outside society. Though the methods of the association which, we bave under consideration are not confined to that passive' resistance through which a strike usually manifests itself, it is upon the general strike that it rests its case. Eight years ago, writing on "" The Case for Labour,"" I set out my views in regard to the Industrial Workers of the World and the general strike, and I am very glad to find that they are precisely the views which I hold' today. They were the views which the Labour party held at that time. I refer lionorable members curious in the matter to page 28 and following pages of the book The Case for Labour, but I only wish to quote a few lines, which I think directly bear on the present situation, so far as this association and the general strike are concerned. Having pointed out that the general strike is not practicable-and I think that the Industrial Workers of the World have found that o u t - I go on to sayThe general strike would not be effective even if it were practicable. Consider what would follow from a universal cessation of work. There would, within 24 hours or less, be no food,' no milk, no meat, no bread,. no fodder for stable-fed horses; our streets would Any be dark. Little children, the sick, and the aged would be the first to feel this, but aU would come before many hours-under the ban. The object of the general strike is to reduce the capitalist? to extremity, but its actual effects would I to reduce the workers to the verge of starvavion. If order were maintained and'-passive resistance-the merecessation, of production-were the order of the day, then the poor would suffer and the rich would only be inconvenienced. If riot stalked roughshod through the land, then the weak would suffer, and the strong escape; in either case it is hard to see how tha employer would be compelled to pay higher wages or the workers' lot be in any way ameliorated. The general strike is not practicable, and if it were practicable it would not be effective. It is but a nightmare which if by chance translated into actuality would meansocial suicide. It is the. wildest and most extravagant travesty of Trades Unionism, inevitably calculated not merely to prejudice but to actually destroy it, and bears to legitimate Trades Unionism the same relation aslicense does to liberty. In this-country, the people-can do, anything they please; have whomi they like as their leaders', make what laws they' please; have what industrial conditions they desire; and'get all these things.by methods safe; peaceful, and sanctioned - by our own experience and the teachings of history. What remains, then, but to educate the 'people to desire wisely. Thos© were my views in 1908. I have not changed them. I venture to say that they are such as will he endorsed by reasonable men of every section of the community. I have - referred in my articles only to the general strike. That weapon was then their only one, or, at all events, their only avowed one. But the Indust r i a l ""Workers of the World has since found it an impracticable, if not hopeless, one, and they have taken a short cut to the .goal they desire to .reach. The short cut is known .generally as sabotage. I will quote the definition of the term. Sabotage as defined in the Chunks of I . W . W - is m - I suppose it means Industrial 'Workers of the World wisdom-pub lished in Auckland, New Zealand, as follows: The term "" sabotage"" is used to describe "" all those tactics, save the boycott and the strike proper, which are used by workers to wring concessions from their employers by inflicting losses upon them through the stopping or slowing down of industry, turning out poor products, &c."" It means nothing mors tbnn the adoption on a large scale of dodges already invariably ""practised by the disgruntled indi-' vidual .worker. - That form of sabotage known as "" going slowlyon the job "" takes the starvationweapon out of the bosses' hands. It has the effect of a - strike, and it is well known how the boss loves a strike. Instead of leaving work, 'the rebels stay on, but 'work slowly, reduce 'the output, and thus hit the boss where he feels it worse-in the pocket-book. Tbis is sabotage' at its best. really means is pointed out by Emile Pouget in Sabotage, a work circulated by the Industrial Workers 'of the World in AustraliaIs a strike .contemplated by the most indispensable workers-thos e of"" the alimentary trades? A quart of kerosene or other greasy and malodorous matter poured or smeared on the level of an oven . . . and welcome the scabs and scabby soldiers who come to - bake the bread ! The bread will be uneatable because the stones will give the bread for at least a month the foul odour of the substance they have absorbed. Results : a useless oven. work. Is a strike coming in the iron, steel, or any other mineral industry? A little sand or emery powder in the those machines, which, like fabulous monsters, mark'the exploitation of the workers, and they of this country. will become - palsied and useless. The iron ogre will become as helpless as nurslingand with it the scab. To be sure' of success in case all workersNow they speak of a specific thing- a railroad strike, and as it is clear - Unlawful [18 DECEMBEB, 1916..] Associations Bill. 10099 their own experience that railroad 'workers sometimes do not leave their work at the word of command of even such men as these. It is pointed out how those who do may effect their purposeTo be sure of success in case all rail road workers do not quit their work at once it is indispensable that a stratagem of which it is useless to give here the definition be instantaneously and simultaneously applied in all important centres as soon as the strike is declared. This stratagem is a stratagem which is by no means new. The sending wires from one centre to the other stating that at the centre from which the wire comes everybody has. come out is not a new device, ""and as these wires cross one another, everybody is under the impression that ""everybody everywhere else has come out, and so that it is about time that they '-ame out also. That is don© to get them out. When you hav© got them out,- this is what you do with themFor this it would be necessary that pickets of comrades determined to prevent at any cost the circulation of trains be posted in every important centre and locality. It would be well to choose those workers amongst the most skilled and experienced, such as could find the weak points off-hand without committing acts of stupid destruction, who by their open eyes, cautious and intelligent action as well as energetic and efficacious skill, would by a single stroke disable and render useless for some days the material necessary to the regular performance of the service and the movement of the trains. It is necessary to do this seriously. It is well to reckon beforehand with the scabs and the military. What it If the workers disable the machines it is neither for a whim, nor for dilettantism or evil mind, biit solely in obedience to an imperious necessity. If they do not paralyse the machines they surely go on to unavoidable defeat, to the wreck of all their hopes. In fine, we can say of sabotage what has been said of all tactics and all weapons : "" The end justifies the means."" It is just in obedience to this, irresistible necessity that the carmen of Lyons some years ago poured cement into the tracks of the switches, thus preventing the cir' culation of the tramways manned by scabs. This is Sabotage: that is Destruction at Sabotage is war upon society. copper Now br sadly the position is, that the gear of Industrial Workers of the World has declared war upon - society; upon the people I have said that its weapons are not limited to those which are 'a permissible between civilized .nations,- and railroad that the evidences of their handiwork - are manifest in our 'midst. I do not speak of 'these outward and visible signs from of crime to which public attention has _ been lately directed. But I mean to say that their agents have poisoned the - well spring from which some of the workers of this country drink, and made them believe that it is by setting all law at defiance, by destroying machinery, by retarding the wheels of production, their salvation alone can be The Industrial Workers of the World doctrines are a grave menace to It is not too much to say these men are anarchists. I have been all my life a Socialist. The Labour of Australia is supposed to be a Socialist party. Anarchy and Socialism are the negation of one another. One puts the State above everything, and the other makes war on the State in order to destroy it. I say deliberately that this organization holds a dagger heart of society, and we should recreant to the social order if we did not accept the challenge it holds out to us. As it seeks to destroy us, we must in self defence destroy it.",18

124,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I have shown that the objective, methods, and propaganda of the Industrial Workers of the World are, in fact, a declaration of war against society. No peace is possible with such an adversary, because its members do not recognise the sanctity of any agreement. It is most important to note this fact, .because of its application, not only to the war between the association and society in general, but also because of its application to industrial troubles. It is one of the axioms of the association that no agreement between employer and employee is to be regarded as binding on the employee. The association, in fact, sets up two codes of morality - that to be observed towards its members and those who think with it , and that to be observed towards all persons who do not think with it . In theory, the association professes to sucb a distinction to the workers as opposed to the capitalists; but, in practice, it distinguishes only between those who think with it and those who do not. This code is analogous with the old tribal morality which made it wrong to commit murder or the f t within the tribe, but perfectly right and proper to do so outside it . All acts are'moral that may serve the purpose of the association. Thus, "" going slow "" is moral, sabotage is moral, arson is mora], and murder is moral, provided that these crimes are committed in the cause of the worker. As those who speak for the association declare that all that they do is for the benefit of the worker, it follows that their every act that is, from their point of view, moral. achieved. Broadly, it may be said that the methods of the association are incompatible with society. representative government, that is, gothat vernment by representatives of the people; with political action, because they resort party to direct action, and .regard political methods with contempt; and with democratic government, which rests on the rule of the majority, and the obedience of the whole community to the laws made and the orders issued at the behest of that majority. From this position there is no escape. The association' is incomat the patible with society as we know it , its ' be purpose being to overturn society. I am not here as an apologist for society; but I am a believer in Democracy, and regard the welfare of the State as the supreme' good. The association does not believe in Democracy. Whenever the majority differs from it , it endeavours to .coerce the majority to its purpose. It does not/believe that the welfare of the State is the supreme good. It does not recognise the State as such at all, nor does it recognise the Nation. Indeed, it rests on the negation of nationality, denying that the spirit of nationality is a good thing. The effect of its teaching is seen in its attitude towards this war. I wish to link up Syndicalism in general with the attitude of the Industrial Workers of the World towards the war, so that honourable members may see that it is not only those who call themselves members of the In dustrial Workers of the World who have adopted most, if not all, the principles of the association. Syndicalism does not recognise that the welfare of the State is the supreme law. It demands that the apply control of an industry should be vested in the workers in that industry. Co-ordination between the groups of workers controlling the various industries is not postulated, and there is certainly no recognition of the welfare of the State, as distinct from and superior to that of the various groups. Syndicalism"" does not, in fact, recognise nationality. I might add that a very large number of those who control the Industrial Workers of the World are foreigners. They are, not to put too fine a point on it , the scourings of Europe and America. Many of them have been driven out of the latter country, and some possess a criminal record, so that they not return to it.. Let me, by way of preface, draw a clear line of distinction between mere membership of the association and the offences and criminal acts which the Bill has been introduced to press. Many persons have "" joined the association, moved thereto by a sincere desire to Benefit their fellows. They are wellhead-quarters meaning though mistaken enthusiasts. Against them. I have nothing to say, though I disagree with them entirely, and consider them misguided. The Industrial Workers of the World however, is controlled, not by a majority of its members, but by an inner council, which recruits are never permitted to enter, and about which they have little, if any, practical knowledge. This inner council is composed of reckless, desperate men, many of whom have criminal records. I do not say that without ample proof of the fact. Let us now look at the present situation in ita relation to the association of which I have been speaking, and in particular to the doctrines and acts to which I have referred. The Empire is at war. is vitally important that Australia should play its part in the struggle, and this part is not limited the sending abroad of men to fight; it is equally necessary, both in our own interest and in that of the Empire, that we should send abroad to Great Britain and the Allies as much of our produce as we can. Without Australian foodstuffs and metals, Great Britain and her Allies would be seriously, if not fatally, hampered. follows, therefore, that when men openly advocate the destruction of wheat in the field and in the stacks, of farming machinery,' and of mines, they aim a blow not merely at the Allies on the battlefield, but also at the producers and the workers of Australia. Evidence taken by the Courts discloses that men have openly declared that this destruction of Australian produce is a good and a moral thing. When we consider that we are at war, that our livelihood depends very largely on the £100,000,000 or so that we shall get from the sale of our products;-of which wheat, wool, and metals form the overwhelmingly greater part-and that there is an association in our midst whose avowed purpose it is to destroy that wealth, or as much of it as possible; it is obvious that society must protect itself.. These are our present circumstances. The Industrial Workers of the World and can- its propaganda are alike well known, but it may be as well to remind honourable members of some quite recent acts. The criminal charges brought against members of the organization include murdersupin cold blood^-of a policeman in Sydney last September. Forgery and uttering of bank notes of the Commonwealth. The of the conspiracy in regard to the forgeries were the head-quarters of the organization, and some of the leading conspiratcrs of the association. Arson. The bunch of cases, which may be grouped together, of incendiarism, resulting from efforts on the part of members of the organization to get Mr Barker, editor of Direct Action, out of gaol. Some fires took place and destroyed a great deal of property. Providentially, they did not destroy human life, though there might easily have been a holocaust, for some of the property destroyed consisted of great buildings, which, had they caught fire in the day-time, might well have involved the lives of hundreds of young women. Here then isMurder, Arson, Forgery, It aiding and abetting Sabotage in its attack upon the life of the nation. But the activities of the Industrial Workers of the to World do not even end here. The electric plant on the Brisbane was damaged, and one of the agents of the Government was shot.",21
125,Mr KELLV,Unknown,Where 1,22
126,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I sha"" not enter into any further details; you must accept the It facts as beyond all question. Government agents have attended the meetings of the organization, at which every man was armed with an automatic pistol, and raids have disclosed a similar state, of things at head-quarters. I mention quite casually a, fact perfectly well known, and mentioned in the House the other day, that at a recent meeting; in Sydney the King's name was hooted. If this were an isolated instance, not correlated with this determined and systematic attack on society, it might pass; but it is not-it is all of a piece. When we add to the fact that a. large number of the members of this association ,are foreigners- I do not mean Englishmen, Scotchmen, or Irishmen, but persons other than of British origin-and that a fair number of names in - the list of membership are .Germans, we .can .read anto the operations of this association a meaning which - suggests, if it does not do more, that it is being used for a purpose against the Allies in this war Thisis one of the methods to which Germany and her agents resort everywherethe preaching of denationalism to every nation but herself. That is to say, they teach that national sentiment is bad in the Frenchman or the Britisher, but is a glorious thing in the German: At any rate; here is this organization our midst. Ifc is a hot bed- a pest-house, to put it plainly-breedin g disease in the social and economic body, and threatening even our national welfare. We must take notice of it . We must deal with it . It will be admitted by every one who looks afc the thing fairl y that there is a time when to take no notice is good, but there is also a time when to take no notice is a sign of weakness. When this organization was in its infancy, and confined self to mere words, we could laugh at its preamble and at its propaganda. We could afford to be tolerant. B ut circumstances have changed. These men have grown audacious-mistakin g toleration tor weakness. I say deliberately that we have now an unscrupulous body, which advocates the destruction of property, and which has the power to destroy millions ' of pounds worth of wheat by incendiarism. Does any one deny that? Does any one deny that a member of the organization, only the other week, advocated this by expatiating upon the properties of a burningglass for the purpose ? No one. Does any one deny that there is an attempt to show that the, men sentenced the other day are martyrs-that the evidence was trumped up ? I do not know whether the evidence was trumped up or not; I know nothing at all about it . I neither condemn nor defend the sentences. I know nothing about the evidence; all I know is that these men have preached the doctrine, of which these crimes the outward manifestation for years. As they now say themselves, their work is beginning to bear f r u it s ! In their newspaper, fchey advertised for men and women recruits, and asked for unscrupulous agents who - were not afraid of gaol or death. For what purpose? For such' purposes as I have spoken about-for arson, for sabotage, - for 'disseminating Mr Hughes. these vile doctrines amongst the credulous, the weak, and the vicious, in our midst. Let me tell my . fellow .workers throughout Australia that tbese doctrines are the - vilest of the vile. The workers are told - that .salvation is to be found by diminishing .production, in destroying .machinery, - in the destruction - of property., in endless - industrial upheavals. In countries where the people do - not rule, where all - other means of redressing grievances, of obtaining justice, are denied the worker, something might perhaps be said for such in methods. But in this country, where the workers rule, and wheretbey have had the Government under their control for years, and where fhey have means of passing any law they please, and where they can, and do, control-throug h their socialistic enterprises-grea t amounts of capital, "" g o in g s l o w "" and ""sabotage "" are grave economic and social crimes, and treason itself against the State. I have been as much as any man in it - the country a worker; the doctrine of "" slowing down "" is repugnant to me. Any man who is worth his salt will not "" go slow."" If a man does 'not get ' enough wages, I can not only understand him asking for his full share but approve - his doing so. ""Slowing d o w n "" is individual and national economic suicide. Let him go fast and ask for a bigger share - ther e is sense in that. I have nothing to say against it and everything for it . But to "" g o s l o w "" ; to make the ovens unsuitable, so that tliose'who eat the bread may be poisoned; to put emery powder in machinery; to set fire to buildings; to destroy wheat stacks; or to drop a fork in a reaping machine-al l these are preached as though they were part of some great and noble gospel. They are the litanies of economic devils. How are we going to deal with such an organization? This Bill does not penalize a man for his opinion; and this I wish honourable members to notice. Opinion is free, and thought is free; let a man believe what he likes. But he are must not incite others to commit crimes or to do anything against the welfare of the State. This Bill penalizes those who incite others to commit crimes. Surely it is a crime at all times, but now in particular, to incite men to destroy property, to destroy wheat, and to destroy machinery engaged in the vitally important work of productionvitally important to the welfare of every - worker in - Australia, and of Australia as .a nation; and' vitally important to the conduct of the war by Great Britain: and her Allies.? A r e men< to be allowed, to ' .advocate murder wholesale, and crime generally, and no law be provided to deal with them?' There-is-no such law now. If so,- where, is it ? What is it ? The hon-oratile member for ' Capricornia asked a question in this connection' this morning-; and I have to say that there-is no State Is w that meets such cases, except the law passed in New South. Wales the other day. It is' not. crimes themselves with, which we are dealing, but inciting others to commit - them. These crimes can be-dealt with under existing State laws, though members of the organization object to the antiquated laws under which they are triedi I offer no. objection to that criticism. should object to be tried under laws, passed -500 or 600 years ago. But here we-have a Bill to which this Legislature, isasked to assent. Let us give statutory, form, in dorsed by a living Parliament, to our opinion as to. what is proper in the present circumstances to deal with such offences against the body politic. I do not wish to detain the House at any great length There are. only two criticisms which can be directed against the Bill ! One is that it is too moderate, and the other is that it proposes to proceed, by way of summary - jurisdiction, to deal summarily with these - offences. As to its moderation, all I.have to say is that a moderate Taw effectively - applied is better than a severe law, which, by its severity, would, nerhaps, invite that martyrdom, these gentlemen are seeking. To those who do not criticise it for that reason, but object to. its summary operation, I offer an alternative. If they prefer that these offenders shall be proceeded against by w a y of indictment, then punishment for three years may be substituted for that of six months under the Bill : Or, alternatively, the At torney-General may decide whether he shall proceed by way of indictment or summarily, according, to the-nature of the offence, reservingindictment for therelatively ""serious offences-, and for minor offences summary proceedings. 6 provides a new punishment in addition to. any that has been known in State or Federal law. It provides that a person, not being;- aBritish, subject born in. Australia j who is'guilty of any-of-the offences, may, in addition to a n y punishment imposed! under-the Bill ; bedeported:. We do not propose to deport an Australian, but: we> do. thin k that this country ought not to be the. dumping-ground for the. refuse' of the earth. There are .men; here who have been' driven out of America, that; home of the free. They have been swept out of that tumbledown building in Chicago which is the head-quarters of this glorious organization, and they have come to Australia, where they are giving usthe benefit of those poisonous emanations which were not permitted to be exuded in America. It is more than high time they were sent back to America, and this measure provides for that being, done. I commend the Bill to the House, and I hope that it will receive the unanimous approval of honourable members. I invite them to note that no man is punished because of I his opinions, or because of his.membership of this organization. I am not saying that he should not be, but only that the Bill does not propose to do so. Provided he does not incite his fellowcitizens to - commit crimes, the Bill leaves him alone. But let him commit such an offence, and the Bill deals with him. I say that the Bill is the minimum . of what is required to meet the present circumstances. For - thatreason, I invite all sections of the House to approve of it without delay. Mr TUDOR ' (Yarra)' [3.2] - Is the Prime Minister willing to grantanadjournment of the debate either to a later hour of the day or to the next day of sitting ?",22

At the outset, I wish to say that this Bill has been brought - forward for the express purpose of trying to. get some members, particuClause larly of the Labour party, to say somer thing that may. be used in evidence against them at the election.

130,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I am showing what is the position of the Minister and his colleagues.

' The press will select a sentence from a speech of some honourable member, and say, "" Tudor said this, "" or "" Some other member said that.""",25

I amabsolutely opposed to all four of those policies. I am not in favour of slowing down; the organization to which I belong has always fought for piece-work. I am not in favour of sabotage, arson, or murder. I have not the slightest doubt that the "" rags"" in Collins-street, which are keeping the Prime Minister in power, will say, as they have said during the past few weeks, that the members of the Labour party have never expressed themselves as opposed to the Industrial Workers of the World. I took care during the referendum campaign to absolutely oppose that organization, and the crimes with which its members were charged, but I also said that it was an unheard of crime to pronounce men guilty before they had been tried, and that it was not fair to prejudice their trial by bandying them and their crimes on the political platforms.",25
145,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The honourable member said just now that he knew very little about the organization, and now he says that he defended those men.",25
146,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I did not defend them. The legal gentlemen on the front bench will admit that it is not right to assume a man's guilt while his case is sub judice. What has been said about the Industrial Workers of the World has been said about other organizations, notablv that with which the Vice-President of the Executice Council has been so long associated. The same action as is contemplated by the Bill was suggested in 1901 by the Queensland Government in regard to the Australian Workers Union. The Prime Minister pointed out that certain members of the Industrial Workers of the World have been found guilty of murder and have suffered the extreme penalty. Those men have been dealt with. said that some others have been found guilty of conspiracy, and sentenced to long terms of imprisonment. They have been dealt with. Those who have been convicted of the forgery of Commonwealth notes, and the men charged in Western Australia also have been dealt with. They have been tried and found guilty under the existing law without the aid of this measure. In what, then, consists the i m mediate need for this Bill? Will the Prime. Minister say that those men who have been convicted did not receive trial under a State law ? If tney were tried under State laws, were those iaws strained in New South Wale's and Western Australia? No one knows better than the Prime Minister that there is ample power in existing laws to deal with these men, and that they have been dealt with.",25
147,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,There is not power under any law except the. recently-passed law i h New South Wales.,26
148,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,Is there power to deport them under existing laws ?,26
149,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,The honourable member for Yarra is confusing the crime itself with the incitement to commit the crime.,26
150,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"T he Minister for the Navy said that the power required is for deportation. According to the sworn testimony of the police at the Sydney trial the accused comprised three Australasians, (two being Australians, one a New Zealander), three Englishmen, two Scotchmen, two Irishmen, one Canadian, and one Russian. Assuming that the power to deport the men had existed, tnefe was only one alien amongst them to whom the law could have applied. The manner in which the Prime Minister made use of the trial of those men during the referendum campaign was something of which he' had no right to be proud, for he tried to influence the public mind by saying that those men were opposed to the policy that he was placing before the country. Prime Minister gave to the House a statement of the aims and objects of this organization. I know only one of the men concerned, and I saw him twice, once at the Prime Minister's meeting in the Melbourne Town H all , and on the second occasion at a Trades H all conference which I attended as a visitor. [361] He came, there, as published in the 'press, for the purpose of protesting against the sentence on Barker, but I did not sit near him, nor did I speak to him. I He have never spoken to any of these persons. This Bill is brought forward for the purpose of trying to entrap some members of the Labour party. No one knows it better than the Prime Minister.",26
151,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,rTha t is absolutely wrong.,26
152,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I have not the slightest doubt that it is absolutely true - The Prime Minister said that the majority of these persons were aliens, and that there were among them a fair number of Germans. If 'chat is the case, why are they not interned ? There is plenty of power to intern all these Germans. If there is the slightest suspicion about a German, he can be put inside.",26
153,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,The honourable member knows very well that Germany works through other agents than her own people.,26
154,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Does the Prime Minister withdraw from the statement that he made ?,26
155,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,I do not withdraw from it.,26
156,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Accordin g to the Prime Minister, there is a fair number of Germans among the members of the Industrial Workers of the World . Let us assume that the proportion is 5, 10, or 20 per cent.",26
157,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,I did not say that those Germans were at large. The honourable member may be quite easy in his mind that those persons who could be interned have been interned.,26
158,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I hope that they are, and I hope that they will be kept there, but if they are interned, they can do no harm.",26
159,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I would not like to say that they can do no harm, but at any rate they cannot do as much harm as if they were not interned.",26
160,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"If they are not at large, their power in this organization must be considerably curtailed. We are told that there is no power to deal with The any of these men, or deal with any organization. I have with me the Crimes Act, which was introduced by the Prime Minister when he was Attorney-General, in 1914. I . have also the War Precau* tions Act, but it is so well known that the Government can do practically anything under that Act that there is no need to quote it . Under that Act they could pass a regulation, and could take all these ' men and intern them, if they so desired. I wish to draw attention to eight sections in the Crimes A ct dealing with this point. Section 5 provides- Any person who aids, abets, counsels, or procures, or by act or omission is in any way directly or indirectly knowingly' concerned in, or party to, the commission of any offence against this Act or' any other Act, whether passed before or after the commencement of this Act, shall be deemed to have committed that offence, and shall be punishable accordingly.",26
161,Mr GROOM,Unknown,That merely supplements this Bill .,27
162,Mr KELLY,Unknown,But the crime has first be established.,27
163,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"T he following sections read: 6. Any person who receives or assists another person, who is to his knowledge guilty of any offence, in order to enable him to escape punishment or to dispose of the proceeds of the offence, shall be guilty of an offence. 7. Any person who attempts to commit any offence against this Act or any other Act, whether passed before or after the commencement of this Act, shall be guilty of an offence, and shall be punishable as if the attempted offence had been committed. Then we come to section 10, which makes the justice of the peace all-powerful. I take it that the punishment is limited to six months' imprisonment, in order that the cases may be dealt with by justices of the peace. Later on I shall show what some justices of the peace have been doing lately in the State of Victoria. Section '10 readsIf a Justice of the Peace is satisfied by information on oath that there is reasonable ground for suspecting that ""there is in any House, - vessel, or place(o) anything, with respect to which any indictable offence against this Act has been or is suspected on reasonable grounds to have been committed; 1 (b) anything as to which there are reasonable grounds _ for believing that it will afford evidence as to the commission of any such offence; (c) anything as to which there is reasonable ground for believing that it is intended to be used for the purpose of committing any such offence, he may grant - a search warrant authorizing any constable named therein, with such assistance as he thinks necessary, to enter at any time, any house, vessel, or place named or described in the warrant, if necessary by force, and to seize any such thing which he may find in the house, vessel, or place. Later on we come, to section 28, which is headed "" Interference with political liberty."" It readsAny person who by violence or by threats - or intimidation of any kind hinders or interferes with the free exercise or performance by any other person, of any political right or duty, shall be guilty of an offence.",27
164,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,What has that section to do with the Bill before us?,27
165,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Directl y I bring up a provision under which these persons could be tried we are told that it has nothing to do with the matter.,27
166,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,They could not be tried under that section.,27
167,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,There is no law in the country to punish incitement to murder.,27
168,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Is it claimed that the laws under which men were recently to sentenced to periods of - imprisonment, extending fro m five years to fifteen .years, do not exist ?",27
169,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,There is no law in existence which deals with incitement to crime in general.,27
170,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I feel sure that the Prime Minister, with that ready w it of his, could draw up a regulation that would easily meet the case. Sir ROBERT BEST;-Doe a the honourable member advocate doing so ?",27
171,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,No ; but I point out that greater power is given under the Crimes Act than is proposed to be taken under this Bill .,27
172,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,No .,27
173,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The next provision in the Crimes Act deals with the destruction of property belonging to the Commonwealth, and I presume that those persons who were guilty of destroying the property of the Crown on the cruiser M bane could have been prosecuted under it .",27
174,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Will the honourable member allow me to point out that the actual crimes can be dealt with under that Act, but. not the incitement to the crimes ?",27
175,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I am afraid of, what the righ t honourable member would have been afraid of, if such a law had been in existence in earlier years, that is, the possibility that men may be gaoled under the slightest pretext. T have not the slightest doubt that if these provisions had been the law years ago, the right honourable gentleman and the ex-President of the Australian Workers Union would have been in gaol many times.",27
176,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,I am sure no one would have put the honourable member for Darling in gaol.,27
177,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The Prime Minister can take his memory back to the time when the honourable member for Darling would, have been put in gaol had the power existed such as was proposed in Queensland at the time of the shearers' strike. The MCHwraith Government pro-' posed to gaol men, and men have been gaoled in this country before now under the slightest pretext. In my opinion such action will not cure the disease that is now present in the body politic.",27
178,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,The honourable member admits that it is a disease?,28
179,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I do. ' I said at the outset that I am absolutely opposed to all the methods of these people.,28
180,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,Then why does the honourable member object to our dealing with them ?,28
181,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Because the Government have now the power to do so.,28
182,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,We have not the power.,28
183,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I listened in silence to the Prime Minister when he was making his speech.,28
184,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,The honourable member has already objected to one regulation. Does he wish the Government to draw up. another ?,28
185,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Greate r power will be taken by the Government under this Bill, and it will probably be used for.the purpose of dealing with trade unions as well as the Industrial Workers of the World ",28
186,Sir EOBEBT BEST,Unknown,"Why not, if they offend ? Several honourable members interjecting,",28
187,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The proceedings are becoming disgraceful. I cannot follow the remarks of the honourable member because of the repeated interjections. I have warned the House a number of times. If I take drastic action, it will be thought that I am very harsh, but some honourable member will find himself dealt with if this disorder is continued.",28
188,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I do not wish to delay the House very much longer. I shall not worry to read any further provisions of the Crimes Act.,28
189,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Is the honourable member for or against the Bill ?,28
190,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I shall let the honourable member know in very good time whether I am in favour of it or opposed to it.,28
191,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,Has not the honourable member made up his mind yet ?,28
192,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Yes . I am not like some honourable members who have the habit of sitting on a political rail and [361]- 2 slipping down from it so gently that there is not the slightest danger of their spraining an ankle.  referring to the honourable member for Capricornia ?,28
193,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I am not. We are told that these cases are to be left to justices of the peace. In Victoria, we recently had two cases before justices of the peace., In the Katamatite District, in the Echuca electorate, and close to the Indi electorate, some youths attacked a person who had been addressing a meeting. The scene of the attack was close by a bridge, and as the person attacked was driving in the dark, if the horses hadshied the lives of those ' in the vehicle were endangered. These youths were brought before a Court, and pleaded guilty; but the justice.of the peace considered the crime so trivial that he let them off on their putting' a donation in the poor box. In another case, at Daylesford, some men were prosecuted for interrupting a speaker at a publio meeting, and were heavily fined by the presiding justices. In yet another case, at Colac, justices of the peace fined some men for the same offence. If the offence of inciting to murder, or to the destruction of property, is so dangerous, then it ought to be made an indictable offence.",28
194,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,Then the honourable member is prepared to increase the penalty from six months to three years' imprisonment?,28
195,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I am prepared to give all persons - charged with this offence the right of trial by jury. If I .were being prosecuted for any offence I should prefer that my ease be tried by a Judge rather than.by a justice of the peace. I believe that at the hands of a Judge a man would be more likely to meet with the treatment he deserved.,28
196,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,I have no faith in justices of the peace.,28
197,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,No r have I .,28
198,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,The honourable member said just now that there was power under the War Precautions Act to deal with all these cases.,28
199,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"We are told that there is no power at present to deal with the offence of inciting to murder or the destruction of property. Eorgery is an offence punishable under the Crimes Act, and that was the offence of which one of the Sydney men, as the Prime Minister said, was convicted. I nope that inciting to these acts will be made an indictable offence, if , as the Prime Minister bas said, it cannot be dealt with under the law as it stands. I recognise that under the Acts Interpretation Act the penalty provided in this Bill is the maximum, and that men who are convicted under it may be sentenced to less than six months' imprisonment. But m y contention is that persons charged with these offences are entitled to a fair trial. The community is in such a ferment of excitement as the result of the war that we are not able to see and think as clearly as we d id before, and there might be a tendency to prosecute men unfairly under this Bill . It is not right for the Prime Minister to bring this proposal forward as a political placard, intended first of all to connect the Labour party with the Industrial Workers of the World. We bave not, and have never had, any connection with that organization. Members of the Industrial Workers of the Worl d have opposed us more bitterly than they have opposed any other party.",28
200,Mr CORSER,Unknown,Oh !,29
201,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The honourable member for Wide Bay professes to know all about it . Does he not know that when .the present Prime Minister was Leader of the Labour party he was constantly denounced by members of the Industrial Workers of the World , speaking on street corners and in the Sydney Domain, that the Leader of the Liberal party was Conciliation and Arbitration not?",29
202,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,It is only fair to that I have always attacked them. That cannot be said of every Labour man.,29
203,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The right honourable gentleman said this afternoon that Industrial Workers of the Worl d favoured direct action and the principle of general strike. The platform Labour party is the direct antithesis that. Did we not fight, for the principle of conciliation and arbitration and get it I do not for one moment defend. Then placed on the statute-book, despite opposition of the present Liberal party? Who opposed us when we sought an amendment of the Constitution, so that the principle of conciliation tion might be made more effective? The Liberal party.",29
204,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"The honourable member will say, I suppose, that the Labour party framed the section in the Constitution providing for conciliation and arbitration.",29
205,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,No . we had no representatives at the Convention.,29
206,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"No , but they have been "" f r a m in g "" ever since, and that is why we have had 824 strikes in war time.",29
207,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,If unionists are breaking the law,29
208,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The honourable member knows that they are.,29
209,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I do not. I am opposed to law breakers, no matter fro m what section of the community they come. I am opposed to them whether they come from the ranks of the workers or the shirkers-the men who work the workers. I am opposed to those who place every obstacle in the way of men reaching the Arbitration Court, and who, after they have reached that tribunal, carry them on to the Privy Council.",29
210,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"What about those who go to the Court, and then will not obey its awards?",29
211,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"They should obey the awards of the Court. But the real law. breakers are those employers who put obstacles in the way of men reaching the Arbitration Court. What is to be said for those employees who take advantage of every technicality-employin g highly'paid barristers, like the honourable member for Plinders, to discover some loopand hole of escape from a decision of the Court'* What is to be said of the employers who say compelled the Builders' Labourers Union, after it had secured a decision of the Conciliation and Arbitration; Court, to go to the Privy Council? The employers did not say .that the decision of the the Court was wrong. Their contention was that the Court had no right to make the the award. Men who are faced with law of the breakers at the other end of the social of scale have perhaps in some instances taken the law into their own hands. That s the we are told that workers have destroyed property. Has no other section of the community destroyed property for the purpose of getting a better price for what and arbitrathey have to sell ?",29
212,Mr BURNS,Unknown,What about the dumping of fish overboard?,29
213,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Yes ; fish have been dumped overboard so as to keep up prices. A deliberate limitation or the catch has been imposed so that better prices may be secured, i . Mr Rodgers--Will the member denounce those unionists of his?",30
214,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"It is not the fishermen, but the middlemen. The middlemen compel the fishermen to l i m it the supply. The same course has been followed in regard to f r u it and other products. F r u it has - been allowed to rot on the ground rather than that it should be brought to the market and prices reduced. Will the Fruit-growers Association and the Fishermen's Association-whic h employs its own auctioneers-as well as others guilty of such conduct come - under this Bill ?",30
215,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The member wants all those men to be branded with th© Industrial Workers of the World .,30
216,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"If it is wrong for the Industrial Workers of the World to destroy property, it is wrong for other peopl© to do so.",30
217,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,In making suggestion the honourable member is in sulting these people.,30
218,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"A m I ? I am anxious . to bring in the Employers Federation. We are told that men who incite others ' to do unlawful acts should be punished. It is not so long since th© Victorian Employers Federation employed an organizer, named Walpole, who used to preach that marriage was a luxury for the workers. Would Walpole be gaoied under this Bill ? The Employers Federation have advocated things in opposition to the law. Will they, too, come under this measure?",30
219,Mr WATT,Unknown,"If you were to brand Walpole "" I . W . W . "" on th© lef t side, would it not b© worse than deporting him ?",30
220,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I do not know; I have never seen the man. This Bill was conceived at the Premiers' Conference last week. There we had exactly the same combination that we had to fight in the conscription campaign. During th© last referendum we had to fight six Ministries and five Opposition parties. The six Ministries were represented at the Conference last week and gave the Prime Minister notice to bring in this Bill . According to th© press, the Premier of Queensland alone stood out, because he objected to these offences being dealt with summarily.",30
221,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,Thre e Labour Ministries were represented at the Conference.,30
222,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Not at all. Mr Vaughan was the only Labour Premier who supported the Bill . Mr Ryan is a Labour honourable man, but he was opposed to it . There was fishermen an anti-Labour Premier from Tasmania as well as from Western Australia and Victoria present at the Conference, whilst New South Wales was represented by a member of the Fusion Government. These Premiers said, in effect, to th© Prim© Minister, "" Bring along this Bill and see if you cannot put the Labour party in a hole. You know that you have not a hope of hanging on or of getting a double dissolution. W© know that the Cook party will desert you at the first opportunity. Bring this Bill forward so as to make the people dissatisfied with the Labour party honourable See if you cannot induce members of the Labour party to say something that may be used against them at the next general election. We have two morning newspapers in Victoria, two in New South Wales, and two in South Australia which will be prepared to twist anything the Labour men may say during the , that discussion. We will use them for all they are worth, just as we have always used them against Labour. Bring this Bill forward and try to place the Labour party in a false position."" That was their attitude, and today we see the result of their action. I have made my position clear'. I have absolutely no sympathy with the Industrial Workers of the World. If , as we have been told this afternoon, they stand for direct action, for the principle of the general strike, for going slow, for sabotage, for murder and arson, I am absolutely opposed to them. - I have no sympathy with the taking of life or the destruction of property.",30
223,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,Then the honourable member ought to support this Bill .,30
224,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"I do not want any advice or assistance from the leading counsel appearing at the Home Affairs Inquiry as to what I ought to do. I notice, by the way, that they are going to close down on the honourable member, so that he will not have a fair run before the Commission. . No doubt if th© opportunity offered he would sum up in a speech longer than the record address he delivered in this House on on© occasion- a speech extending over a week.",30
225,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"The honourable member cannot make a speech. Mr.TTJDOR - If the honourable member means a speech of about nine hours' duration, and very little in it , like the one he made here on a certain occasion, I cannot. I am absolutely out of sympathy with the Industrial Workers of the World, or any organization standing for what it is said to stand for. But the Government, under the law as it stands, can deal with the offences that haye been spoken of. It bas introduced the Bill only to stir up trouble, and to improve its chance at the next election. Were there not an election looming in May next, we should not have heard of the Bill. We were told that these meetings of Parliament were for the passing of Supply and the imposition of taxation. The Entertainments Tax Bill was so badly mangled during its consideration in this House that its author would not know it . It is said that the Treasurer lost £100,000 of revenue in consequence. The Entertainments Tax Assessment Bill has not been proceeded with.",30
226,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member must confine himself to the question.,31
227,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,That and other Bills have been set aside to enable this Bill to be brought forward. No one knows better^ than the members of the Ministry that this has been' done to accentuate the split made in the Labour party when they and their supporters walked out of the Caucus room.,31
228,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Parramatta) [3.46] - The honourable member for Yarra has made one of the most remarkable speeches that I have ever heard in this Chamber.,31
229,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I thought that the honourable member was not going to speak. He came to me and said so.,31
230,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I said nothing of the kind. No doubt, if the honourable member tried hard, he could make a truthful interjection. He knows very well what I told him. I am not sure that I should have spoken had it not been for his speech. One reason for my rising is that I may give him some information about the organization of which he appears to know nothing. If , as he alleges, he knows nothing of it and its ramifications he is not qualified for the position which he holds. I cannot conceive of a man who pretends to lead the Labour forces of this country being ignorant of this parasitic growth on the Labour unions of Australia and elsewhere. I cannotsthink that the honourable member is as innocent as he professes to .be. He must know more about this organization than he 'has cared to tell the House, and his air of injured innocence must be a cloak for some other design. Methinks he doth protest too much.  public to know what a farce the Bill is.",31
231,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The honourable member thinks that the Bill is a farce? ,31
232,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Then I shall expect him to vote against it. If he thinks that it is a farce he has no right to enact it. If , on the other hand, he thinks that the Bill will be of use, he should vote for it without abusing it. We shall see when the division is taken what his action will be. The Bill, so far as I understand it , meets with my approval, and J cannot understand how any one who desires the orderly, peaceful - development of true unionism can vote against it. It is in the interests of trade unionism that this parasitic growth upon it-o r I should say; this cancerous growth, developing witliin it-be excised. The sooner honourable members of the Corner party set about this the better it will be for themselves and for the organizations which' they represent. The honourable member for Yarra began by saying that he had nothing to do with the Industrial Workers of the World, and knew nothing about it . Yet he denounced the Bill as unnecessary, farcical, unfair, unjust, and everything that was bad and vile. I do not understand such argument. He was at pains to prove that there are not many Germans connected with the Industrial Workers of the World, and not many other foreigners; that the Bill was a trap for the Labour party; that it covered a devilish design; that its object was electioneering; and that it had no legitimate excuse.",31
233,Mr HANNAN,Unknown,I endorse that up to the Hit.,31
234,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"No doubt. If my honourable friends believe these things,' it is their clear duty to vote against the Bill. They know well enough, however, that it is not the Liberal party for which the Industrial Workers of the World vote.  trial Workers of the World is against all parties.",31
235,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,It certainly ' does not vote for the Liberal party.,32
236,Mr HANNAN,Unknown,It does not command a .sufficient number of votes to be able to - make a difference to one State election.,32
237,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I am afraid that my honourable friend is not aware of the ramifications of this organization, and does not know how its influence is extending into the trade organizations which he represents, or, rather, I believe that he knows a little of what is taking place, because there is plenty of evidence of the influence of the Industrial Workers of the World on some of the unions. The poison is there. The doctrine of ""go slow,"" and the other vicious ideas of the Industrial Workers of the World, are creeping into the unions, and I should expect my honourable friend to be one of the first to wish to drive them out. He should be glad of any measure to help crush this viper, which is rearing its ugly head, and threatening the very existence of our peaceful social organizations. Yet from the Leader of his party we have had an attempt to put the fruit growers and fishermen of Australia into the same category with the Industrial Workers of the World. By so doing, he insults these men, who are doing their best to build society upon a peaceful and prosperous basis. What did his argument amount to, if it was not that the Industrial Workers of the World is no better and no worse than the associations of which he spoke? He mentioned Mr Walpole's organization-the Employers Association. Because it has sought an interpretation of the law which he himself helped to pass, he puts them on a par with the Industrial Workers of the World. He likened also to that association the fruit-growers of - Australia. He says they are the victims of designing middlemen, though I have not known the stealing which has been spoken of, although I know something of the business of growing fruit. It is those who know nothing about a business who are most glib in speaking of it. To put the fruit growers on the same level as the Industrial Workers of the World is the .deepest insult that the honourable member could have offered to tbem. Whether he meant it or not, I do not know.",32
238,Mr HANNAN,Unknown,The right honourable member knows that he did not mean it.,32
239,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I can only accept his own language. I say that the honourable member put tbose whom I have spoken of on the same plane as the Industrial Workers of the World. He said plainly that if we were going to interfere with the Industrial Workers of the World, we should deal similarly withthese others. Then he said that the Bill had been introduced in the hope that it would apply to trade unions. If the trade unions are committing the offences with which it deals, I hope that they will come within its provisions. They have no right to consideration if they are doing these things. If they incite to and instigate the taking and endangering of human life, - let the Bill fall - on them with all its weight. I do not, however, believe that they are doing these things, and the Bill will not affect them. The honourable member for Yarra insulted trade unionists by suggesting that it was aimed at them. It is aimed at criminality. I know of no sneak thievery as mean as the doctrines of the Industrial Workers of the World, which is one of the meanest organizations on earth. It tells the workers to destroy the property which produces their wages and the employers' profits. They are to do this by underhand, despicable, and clandestine methods.",32
240,Mr TUBOE,Unknown,2T o one defends the In dustrial Workers of the World.,32
241,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I cannot conceive of an Industrial Workers of the World member making a better defence for the association than the lionorable member did.  able member was hoping-that the honourable member for Yarra would defend the Industrial Workers of the World.,32
242,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I , should be # sorry to hear him defend that association. But he did nothing but condemn a Bill, which is aimed at the suppression of thecriminality for which the association is responsible. He had not the courage to condemn it straight out on its merits. What he said was that if we were going to pass this kind of law it should embrace such people as the fruit-growers, the fishermen who tip fish overboard, and all who,, acting under the law, seek to get for themselves a certain interpretation of the law. But such people .cannot be put into the same category as the Industrial Workers of the World , and every case ought to be treated on its merits. Tbis the Bill does; it indicts no organization » and no individual, except the organization or individual who, in turn , incites to. crime, tries to overturn society, or endeavours to stop the war from being waged with proper effectiveness. If a man is in nocent; this Bill cannot touch him, and, therefore, it is idle for the honourable member to trump up all these statements as to its motives and intentions. The terms of the Bill are on the face of it , and if a man commits any of the offences there set forth he should come within the law. There is not one who denounces the Government for trying to visit such acts with consequences-non e dare say that such offenders should not be tried and punished. Why , then, this subterfuge ? Either honourable members are in favour of the Bill or they are not. ",32
243,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The honourable member's leader made a speech this afternoon which he should have been ashamed tp make in connection with a Bill of this kind. To try to drag every other section of the community into the same category with these criminals,33
244,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"There are some other sections just as bad, who rob the people day after day.",33
245,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Who are,33
246,Mr FENTON,Unknown,I shall tell you. when I get up.,33
247,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"If there are such persons, they ought to be dealt with ; but - I know of no sections of the community quite like the Industrial Workers of the World .",33
248,Mr FENTON,Unknown,G o down Collins-street!,33
249,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Are they to be found in Collins-street?,33
250,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"And in Sydney, too!",33
251,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,As bad as the Industrial Workers of the World?,33
252,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Yes ; and they are poli- . fcical supporters of yours.,33
253,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Politica l supporters of mine? I tell the honourable member that he is insulting both the men of whom he speaks and me. The honourable member for Yarra offered one criticism with which I have, perhaps, a little sympathy. In his these offenders should be indicted and dealt with by a jury . Personally, I am not sure that it would not be the better course; but would that satisfy anybody in this organization ? Has the honourable member for Yarra read his own organ, the Sydney Worker, which is the most influential Labour newspaper in. Australia ? In a recent publication, some comments are. made on Judges and juries, and, in case that, by some chance, the honourable member and his colleagues have not read this issue-thoug h it is extremely unlikely, seeing that it is practically their Bible- I should like to read an extract or two. Here is what that journal says about Judges and juries, speaking of the recent trials in SydneyAnd only a Judge as insolent as he was bitterly biased could have handed out fifteen years for that, and pretended he was dealing lightly with the prisoner at the Bar. At the conclusion'of the article, which is a very powerful one, we find the followingIt is horrible to think that fifteen years of his. valuable life should be wasted in gaol while that brainless and brutal jury goes about pluming itself on what it has done, and that class-biased and bitter Judge sits in the seat of justice with loaded scales. Is that the kind of jury to which the honourable member referred ?",33
254,Mr HANNAN,Unknown,To what particular p r i soner does that article refer?,33
255,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"To Donald Grant, who received a sentence, of fifteen years. I am not saying whether Grant's sentence was right or wrong, but merely they? dealing with an attack made on a Judge and j u r y of our fellow-countrymen. WV. are told that the jury were ""brainless and brutal,"" and go about "" p l u m in g themselves "" on what they had done. Does the honourable member for Yarra say that this jury , selected after the right of"" challenge had been exhausted, was brainless and brutal, and went about gloating over the fact that they had done an injustice to somebody? Does he really believe that kind of thing goes on ? We all know Judge Pring, and I cannot believe him to be either class-biased or bitter. He is firm, stern,, and inflexible in his uprightness, and I know of no Judge actuated more by a sense of justice and duty to the humblest individual in the community. Yet we have that gentleman thus bitterly denounced. The mere submission of such cases to a jury will not satisfy some of the ablest and most influential propaopinion, gandists who support my honourable friends in the corner. As for the organization itself, I do not think very much need be said; its own works and doings in Australia are quite sufficient. We all know that this association came from overseasthat it has hatched in villany, and conceived by men whose minds seem to be poisoned entirely against society; who throw overboard all the things for which we have been fighting all our lives, and discard all our ideas of peaceful social progress. They say, in a word, that right should be turned into wrong; that a new ethic should be set up which doesi not trouble about whether an action is right or wrong, so long as it accomplishes the object in view. This, they say, is the test of whether an action is right or wrong. Here let me quote from a recent book, American Syndicalism, by John Graham Brooks.",33
256,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,He is an anti-Labour writer in America.,34
257,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I do not think so; my reading of the book leads me to suppose that he is the other way of thinking, if anything, and believes in all that trade unionism, properly conducted, stands for.",34
258,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"Pro,perl y conducted !",34
259,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Yes , properly conducted.",34
260,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"We all believe in that. Mr JOSE PH COOK - The author quotes two veterans in the Syndicalists' organization, and he says that with them the main thing is to try to bring society upstanding-to paralyze the arm of society-and that this is the way in which it ought to be doneThe electrical industry is one of the most important industries, as an interruption in the current means a lack of light and power in factories; it also means a reduction in the means of transportation and a stoppage of the telegraph and telephone systems. How. can the power be cut off? By curtailing in the mine the output of the coal necessary for feeding the machinery or stopping the coal cars on their way to the electrical plants. If the fuel reaches its destination, what is simpler than to set the pockets on fire and have the coal burn in the yards instead of the furnaces. It is child's play to' put out of work the elevators and other automatic devices which carry coal to the flreTOom. To put boilers out of order use explosives or silicates or a' plain glass bottle which, thrown on the, glowing coals, hinders the combustion and clogs up the smoke exhausts. You can also use acids to corrode boiler tubes; - acid fumes will ruin cylinders and piston rods. 'A. small quantity of some corrosive substance, a handful of emery, will be the end of oil cups. When it comes to dynamos or transformers, short circuits and inversions of poles can"" be easily managed. Underground cables can be destroyed by fire, jvater, plyers, or - explosives,' &c. Further on, under the heading of "" Sabotage,"" there are still further in structions as to how this kind of thing can be done. The Prime Minister referred to the way in which petroleum has been placed in ovens where bread is baked, and. the author from which I am' quoting goes on to sayIn recent strikes among bakers, the bread in its early stages has been spoiled by some unappetizing addition (like castor oil or petroleum) to the dough. Though it cannot be eaten, the eater is reassured by M. Pouget that in no case is it poisoned-unpalatable , yes, "" but not injurious to health."" There is any amount of that kind of thin g in this book, showing the devilish machinations of these clever, capable, men; but their cleverness is only the measure of their criminality, and they, ought to be prevented from putting their ability to such, ignoble uses as the destruction of the basis of society under which we live. As to the ethic of it , here is what is said of industrial unionistsThe industrial unionist, however, holds that there can be no agreement with the employers of labour, which the workers have to consider sacred and inviolable. Industrial unionists will, therefore, sign any pledge, and renounce even their organization, at times when they are not well prepared to a give battle, or when market conditions render it advisable i;o lay low, but they will do just the reverse of what they had to agree to under duress, when occasion arises to gain advantages to the worker. To disobey court injunctions is a "" duty."" Mr KING O'MALLEY - Why not deport these men ?",34
261,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I hope the honourable member will assist in passing a law under which such men may be hunted out, as I understand they have been from America with some success.",34
262,Mr BURNS,Unknown,This Bill will notenable us to deport the men who were sentenced the other day.,34
263,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"They , are already punished, I suppose. .",34
264,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"There is only one of them who could be deported, namely, the Eussian, for the others are all British - citizens.",34
265,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"We may be able to do something else .with them, I hope. If the Bill is not strong enough, honourable members ought not to denounce it , but to make it stronger. The general secretary of the Industrial Workers of the World in Chicago, Mr St. John, writes as follows: As a revolutionary organization the I.W.W. aims to use any and all tactics that will ^ t e the result sought with the least expenditure of time and energy. The tactics used are determined solely by the power of the organization to make good in their use. The question of "" right"" and "" wrong "" does not concern us. That is a fine industrial ethic to lay down. The sooner we deal with those gentlemen the better. No quarter can be given t them. They violate every law, and do it , with impunity . Indeed, their minds seem to be so perverted that they deem themadvantage. selves to be doing the right thing when they are doing that which is absolutely wrong. And the reason for it all is out in the same book in these wordsThe I.W.W. has now come to the knowledge that justice, liberties, rights, & c , are empty words, and power alone is real. Refusing to even try to delegate its powers, stands committed to the policy of direct action. . The general strike becomes, Griffuehle's words, the conscious exposure labour's efforts to free itself. . . The fellows we send to legislatures, to mayors' chairs, or to ministries lose their heads. Not unionism. one of tbem' breathes that atmosphere two years,, but comes back to us a changed man. It is a crooked road that makes crooked men. We have found now a road that leads straight Liberal party stated that I . W . W where we want to go. That road is direct action. ' That direct action haa the disadvantage, that it leads directly to the subversion of society as we know it , and to"" all sorts of criminal practices. It leads to murder, arson, and crime of every description, and in so far as this little Bill , comparatively meek and mild in its terms when placed alongside the heinousness of these crimes, lends itself to the extermination of this kind of conduct in Australia, it should receive the unanimous and cordial support of every man in this chamber and elsewhere.",34
266,Mr HANNAN,Unknown,"Fawkner} T4.181 - I understand from other honourable members who have had a great deal more experience than I in comparing Bills introduced into this House with existing laws of the Commonwealth' and State, that there already exists greater power to deal with unlawful associations than is asked for by the Government in this Bill . The measure provides for a penalty of im> prisonment for six months, and yet a few days ago, under the State law of New South Wales, men were sent to gaol for fifteen years.  conspiracy. The penalty of six months is for inciting.",35
267,Mr HANNAN,Unknown,"The States have power to deal more drastically with any' citizen who has been guilty of inciting anr individual or an organization to commit an offence against existing law than the Commonwealth will have if approval is given to this measure. They have also o the right to deport undesirable persons from our midst if they are satisfied that their presence in the country is not to its I interjected to the Leader of the Liberal party that behind the introduction of this measure was the motive i>f set making political capital. I believe that to be so. Both the Leader of the Liberal party and the Prime Minister, in justifi cation of the Bill , have referred to the but growth and expansion of the Industrial it Workers of the World in America, and"" have quoted from American writers the in doctrine of that organization. W h i 1st of doing that they have continually dragged best into their remarks Australian trade",35

271,Mr HANNAN,Unknown,And the right honourable member further stated that I . W . W ism was a cancer which was already in the Australian trade union movement.,35
272,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I did say that.,35
273,Mr HANNAN,Unknown,"In support of that statement, the right honourable gentleman, quoted from the work of John Graham Brooks in regard to the doctrines preached by the Industrial Workers of the W o r l d in America, and, like the Prime Minister, tried in a subtle way to attach to the recognised Labour movement in Australia the odium attaching to the works, deeds, and professions of those individuals in. America.",35
274,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The honourable member has not the slightest justificationfor making that incorrect statement.,35
275,Mr HANNAN,Unknown,"What has .been said' in that way by the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Liberal party, and members of the Government and the Liberal parties, is nothing less than contemptible. Those honourable gentlemen have in theirminds the fact that, in the very near future, there is to be an appeal to the people, and that it is essential for their success' at the polls that they should in some way lower in the estimation of the> general public the Labour movement, and those who represent it in this Parliament. To succeed in this attempt to degrade the Labour movement and its representatives, they are cunningly endeavouring to connect that movement with the crimes committed in New South Wales and elsewhere by the Industrial Workers of the W o r l d . I recollect the Prime Minister replying, about two years ago, to the honourable member for Flinders, who had said that Syndicalism and the Industrial Workers of the World had the sympathy of the rank and file of the Labour movement. The Prime Minister indignantly repudiated that statement. He carefully traced the growth of the Industrial Workers of the World, whjch, .he said, was an outcome of the great trusts and combines of America, where the employers, controlling all industries, were oppressing the wage-earners, who, not having the power which we in Australia have through the ballot-box, had, after exhausting every legitimate means to fight their enemies, turned to these unlawful methods, including the destruction of the employers' property. Therefore, he said, this organization was the product of the illegal trusts and combines that were crushing the lifeblood out of the people of America. At that time, the Hon. W . M . Hughes was L-ader of the official Labour party, but today we heard him encouraging, and even making, the statement that the official Labour movement in Australia is. practically controlled by the influence of the Industrial Workers of the World .",35
276,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I did not hear him make that statement.,36
277,Mr HANNAN,Unknown,"If the Prime Ministhe ter and the Leader of the Liberal party wished to prove a connection between the official Labour movement of Australia and the Industrial Workers of the World, why did he not turn to the records of the statement. Trades and Labour Council, and of the recognised trade unions, in order to cover resolutions in which those bodies have expressed sympathy with the works and doctrines of the Industrial Workers of the World? They do not do so; they cannot do so. In their imagination draw false pictures of this organization, and they try to play on the feeling sentiment of the community, and at same time place the responsibility Labour movement of Australia.",36
278,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The ' honourable member spends hours every day in preindustrial, paring imaginary attacks on himself.",36
279,Mr HANNAN,Unknown,"So far as the Leader of the Opposition is concerned, and his attack on the recognised trade and labour movement of Australia, tha',. is not imaginary . Day by day the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition are wilfully trying to place the odium of the actions of the Industrial Workers of the World on the recognised trade union and political Labour movement of Australia.",36
280,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,That statement is simply untrue.,36
281,Mr HANNAN,Unknown,"R e a d the Age, the Argus, the Sydney Morning Herald, or the ,Sydney Telegraph. An y person reading the speeches of the Prime Minister during the referendum campaign who would say that the right honourable gentleman meant no harm to the Labour movement of Australia must be very simple minded. It is recognised that the attack is made' for one purpose only. These gentlemen have in mind the near approach of a general . election. The .Prime Minister and the Leader, of the Opposition would be doing themselves more justice if they found out authoritatively what connection, if any, there is between the Industrial Workers of the World and the Trades and Labour Councils of Australia instead of quoting from works written in other parts of the world.",36
282,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I admit that there is no official alliance. Why does the honourable member thrash that bogy?,36
283,Mr HANNAN,Unknown,"Is the right honourable gentleman satisfied that there is no connection whatever, official or otherwise?",36
284,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I am satisfied that Industrial Workers of the World's in fluence is trying its best to get control of the unions. That is all I have ever said.,36
285,Mr HANNAN,Unknown,"The Leader of the Opposition has no justification for that As has been explained by the Prime Minister, the Industrial Workdisers of the World stand for bringing about reforms by a certain mode of procedureby direct action, the general strike, the destruction of public property, and, if necessary, crime. They do not believe in they sending men into Parliament, because they say openly and fearlessly that every and Parliamentarian is a parasite. No distincthe tion is ma.de in this regard between on the Labour and Liberal candidates.

287,Mr HANNAN,Unknown,"B y a method that is altogether different; by the method which sent the honourable member for Hindmarsh into this Parliament-that is, by constitutional means.  by direct action.",37
288,Mr HANNAN,Unknown,"That is the difference between the two organizations, and it has always been maintained. I do not think that there is any member in our community today-excep t a few, who are perhaps, not altogether responsible mentally for their actions-at any rate, there is no sane person in our community, Labourite or Liberal, who would support a policy of the destruction of public property, or justify the action of these men in taking life.",37
289,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I believe that there is not a great number who would do that, but the poison is still there. Let the honourable member help us to extract it.",37
290,Mr HANNAN,Unknown,"I will support the Bill because no right-thinking person in our community will have anything to fear from it. If any person desires to advovate the taking of life he must be prepared to put up with the penalty; if any person desires to incite people to do things that they sbould not do that person must be prepared to put up with the penalty. Apart from a time of war, any person guilty of these things should be liable to punishment. I have no objection whatever to the Bill.",37
291,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Then why the imputation of all these motives?,37
292,Mr HANNAN,Unknown,"I wish to show that I do not believe in the necessity for the introduction of the Bill, or the powers that are sought to be given by it. We have had demonstrations that if the Government so desire they can practically control this country by regulation. A l ready they have done almost everything by regulation. Furthermore, we know that the State authorities in New South Wales have full powers to punish these persons if they so desire. In fact, when all is said and done, the responsibility will have to be taken by the States. Police constables in the pay of the States will attend the outdoor meetings. Even if the Government believe that the measure is essential-whic h I do not-it is but the crowning act to a lot of statements by the Prime Minister on public platforms, and appearing in every paper in circulation in Australia. At a later stage no doubt the Prime Minister will be able to turn round and say to the people, "" As an indication that I was perfectly sincere in what I said on the public platform, did I not introduce a Bill into the Federal Parliament for the purpose of dealing with these people effectively?"" We know that things are said in this House with a smile and a twinkle' of the eye, and often with the tongue in the cheek, which bear quite a different interpretation when read in cold print. Then again, like the constant drop of water, we have had statement after statement from the Prime Minister, the honourable member for Balaclava, and others at various meetings such as "" The Industrial Workers of the World have the Labour movement under their control,"" and "" These people are controlling the Labour movement."" When honourable members are asked to explain these statements they say, in conversational tone across the benches, "" We did not mean that at all. We admit that they have no connection with the Labour party. We admit that they have no influence with the Labour party;"" but when they are addressing the House officially or addressing electors outside this Chamber we hear quite a different tale. I wish to say, in conclusion, that I see no harm in the Bill. I do not think that it was intended to have a sting-othe r than a political one which could be used at a later date, and I believe that the States can deal effectively with these people as they have dealt with men in Sydney during the last two or three months, and as they have dealt with them in Western Australia, and no doubt as they would deal with them in Victoria if these people had any influence here. But they have no influence in Victoria, and as far as numbers are concerned, they have no influence in New South Wales. The Leader of the Opposition has said, "" What you people want, and what the Labour party and the Leader of the Labour party know, is that when it comes to an election you will obtain their votes."" But in New South Wales, which is supposed to be the stronghold of the Industrial Workers of the World in Australia, Mr Holman, in a statement made in the Legislative Assembly of that State, said that in a population of nearly 2,000,000, the total membership of the Industrial Workers of the World did not exceed 500 scattered through the State. Leader of the Opposition says that the Leader of the Labour his speech was endeavouring to make an appeal for the sympathy of those people. Fancy the members of the Labour party appealing for the sympathy and support of an organization with a membership of only 500 in the principal State, while knowing that such an appeal must deprive them of the support and influence of tens of thousands of other' voters. The proposition is too stupid.",37
293,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,The results do not show it .,38
294,Mr HANNAN,Unknown,"What is uppermost in the minds of Ministers is that recently certain proposals that were placed before the electors were defeated. They believe over one-half of the voting population of Australia-ove r one-half of those who went to the ballot-box-were so weak and so foolish as to be influenced by an organization, controlled by criminals, to vote against the proposals of the Government. I say, fearlessly, that the influence of the Industrial Workers of the World , in so far as the "" No "" vote was concerned, was infinitesimal.",38
295,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,I deny that assertion.,38
296,Mr HANNAN,Unknown,"I repeat it as one who urged the electors to vote "" No . "" Three weeks before the vote was takenat a time when the question was Being fought on its merits- I had a conversation with two representatives of the press in New South Wales, and one told me that he believed the "" No "" majority in that State would be 250,000, while the other went so far as to predict a "" No "" majority of at least 150,000., The same gentlemen, speaking to me a few days before the voting, said they thought that after al l there might be a majority i h favour of conscription. They had been led to change tlieir view because of the trump card played by the Prime Minister in referring to the destruction of public property and the taking of human life by members of the Industrial Workers of the WorM, and his^attempt to show that supporters of the "" No "" s i d e , both inside this Parliament and outside of it , were under the influence of this unlawful, life-taking, property-destroying organization. I do not hesitate to say that, without that weapon in the hands of the Prime Minister, the majority for the "" No "" vote would have been '300,000 or 350,000. Y e t the Mr Webster - I did not meet a member of the Industrial Workers of the party in World who was supporting the' ' ' Yea' side.",38
297,Mr HANNAN,Unknown,"The Postmaster-General says that he never met a member of the Industrial Workers of the World during the campaign who was in favour of compulsory military service. I shall not contradict him. The members of the In dustrial Workers of the World were opposed, not only to conscription, b ut to one volunteer going out of the country. The Industrial Workers of the World in this, as i u every country, are anti-militarist, and the Postmaster-General,- as one who is supposed to have taken an in terest in Labour politics, for the last thirty years, ought to know that a member of the Industrial Workers of the World cannot advocate conscription.",38
298,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,That is all r i g h t.,38
299,Mr HANNAN,Unknown,"So that the honourable gentleman, in saying that he did not meet with a member of the Industrial Workers of the World who was in favour of conscription, merely stated something that practically every one in the community ought to know. Certain organizations were opposed to conscription. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The Water Lilies opposed it .",38
300,Mr HANNAN,Unknown,"E v e n the members of the Water L i l y Church were opposed to it . The official Labour movement, in all the States save one, also opposed conscription, but the Labour movement in Australia is not opposed to the voluntary system. The late Government, of which the Postmaster-General was a member, was responsible for ' the policy which sent 300,000 men out of this country, under the voluntary system, to figfit the E m pire's battles. It was the members of our party who, by their votes, enabled the late Government to carry on their war policy u n t il conscription was proposed. When the Postmaster-General tells m e that members of the Industrial Workers of the World supported the "" No "" campaign, and that, because of their opposition, the Government proposal was defeated, I can only reply that, as an advocate of the ' No "" side, T should have r preferred to see the advocacy of the In dustrial Workers of the World on the "" Yes "" side of the campaign. I shall vote for tflis Bill , although I believe' it to be unnecessary. There is no necessity in this country for the adoption of the methods at which it is aimed. If there is an oppressive law in this country, the humblest individual has the same right as the wealthiest to go to the ballot-box, and vote for an alteration of the representation in Parliament. If we do not use the constitutional means at our disposal to bring about reforms it is pur own fault; and not the f a u lt of our system of government. While there might be some justification in some countries, where the people have not the rights and privileges that we possess, there is absolutely no justification in our country for the adoption of the methods against which this Bill is directed.",38
301,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Darlin g Downs) [4.53]. - The object of this Bill , as set out in the preamble, is to deal with the advocacy and the incitement to the commission of diverse crimes and offences, and it declares certain associations unlawful. The association known as the Industrial Workers of the World is declared to be an unlawfu l organization, and alsoany association which, by its constitution or propaganda, advocates or encourages, or incites or instigates to the taking or endangering of human life, or the destruction or injury of property.  laws deal with'such, offences?",39
302,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I shall come to them presently. A f t e r that declaration the proceeds to make provision for the attainment of its object. We find, in clause 4, a general declaration thatWhoever advocates or encourages, or incites or instigates to the taking or endangering of human life, or the destruction or injury of property shall be guilty of an offence. That provision is not confined to the member of an organization or association lawful or unlawful. It is a general enactment that any person who incites or instigates to, . or advocates, the taking or endangering of human life or the destruction or in j u r y of property shall be liable to be prosecuted, and, on conviction, to be sentenced to six months' imprisonment. The next clause deals with members of unlawfu l associations. It provides that any person whobeing a member of an unlawful association, advocates or encourages, or incites or instigates to any action intended or calculated to prevent or hinder the production, manufacture, or transport, for purposes connected with the war, of troops, arms, munitions, or warlike material, including foodstuffs, shall be guilty of an offence. In order to prove a charge brought against an individual under that clause, it would be necessary, first of all, to prove that he was a member of an unlawfu l association-a n association which, by its constitution or propaganda, advocated or encouraged or incited or instigated the taking or endangering of human l if e or the destruction or in j u r y of ' property. Having proved his membership, it would tben be necessary for the prosecution to establish that the person charged with an incitement to, say, hinder the production, for purposes connected with the war, of arms, was guilty of such offence.. In that case, a penalty would be imposed. A further penalty provided in the case of ' foreigners is deportation. An additional method of enforcing the general principle is that of penalizingany .person who prints or publishes any writing advocating or encouraging, or inciting or instigating to, the taking or endangering of human' life or 'the destruction or injury of property. When we analyze this Bill , we find it is aimed at those who incite or instigate to, or advocate the commission of, two classes of offences; the one relating to life, and the other to property. There is not a member of this House who does not in his heart approve of the condemnation of persons who incite to Bill the commission of these offences. Those who commit specified offences in relation to l if e or property may today be prosecuted and convicted under the law of the States. Laws to protect life and property are not new. They lie at the Very foundation of our society. If there was no protection for l if e and property, .then the very foundation of our society would disappear. But this Bill goes still further than the State laws. TJnder the Queensland criminal code, for instance, any person who counsels or procures any other person to commit an offence is liable to a penalty;, but there the prosecution has to prove that the offence has actually been committed-that another person has been counselled or procure I to commit the offence. In various States the law follows along the same line. But in this Bill there is an extension of the lawa new offence is being enacted-and that is that persons who, in their propaganda work, advocate, encourage, incite, or in stigate, others to destroy or endanger l if e or property shall be liable to a penalty. It is because the State laws do not adequately deal with that phase that the Prime Minister has found it necessary to introduce this measure for the period of' the war and six months thereafter.",39
303,Mr RILEY,Unknown,Hav e not the States the power to deport? Is not this an additional power that is being provided for ?,40
304,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"It is an additional power. It has been held by. the Privy Council and by the H i gh Court that there is the power under the Constitution to authorize deportation from Australia. The Government aims now at the punishment of persons who go through the country inciting to or instigating acts of violence against human beings or property, inciting to general acts of violence. The Commonwealth is taking this power because it is, to quote from the preamble to the Billexpedient for the effective prosecution of the present war that laws shall be enacted for the suppression of such practices. The intention of the Bill is to permit of the whole energy of the nation being directed to the carrying on of the war, and to provide means for the punishment of certain offences committed by members of unlawful organizations which might impede the carrying on of the war. Naturally there can be no objection to the Bill in principle ; the only question arises as to its necessity. The ' Prime Minister has shown clearly that there is in this country an association known as the Industrial Workers of the World , that it is carrying out propaganda work, as the result of which in j u ry has been done to property, and lives have been endangered and lost. Some members have said, "" Cannot the States deal with this evil?"" The States are punishing crimes as they occur, but the object of the Bill is to strike at the evil at its source by preventing the spread of a propaganda which incites to the commission of crime. On the 1st December, the honourable member for Wakefield brought under the notice of the House a speech delivered at Broken Hill , at a meeting of the Labour Volunteer A r m y, in which, according to the Prime Minister, there were references to sabotage, directions for destroying haystacks, straw stacks, farming machinery, and other property, blasphemous remarks about the Deity, and some doggerel rhymes. In Queensland, according to a newspaper, similar propaganda work has been going on- . Everybody is familiar with these "" stickers,"" which may be seen adorning walls and windows in almost every part of the city. Sometimes the wording varies, and white lettering on a red background tells the public at large"" Sabotage ""-the Bosses' Nightmare. The matter was brought under the notice of the Treasurer of Queensland, who, at the time, was acting for the Premier of the State. He saidIt has been brought under my notice that there hav3 been posted in various places of employment in towns single "" stickers"" counselling workers to "" slow down."" This is evidently part of the malicious propaganda of the Industrial Workers of the World. This bodythe Industrial Workers of the World-is a body of irreconcilables, who stand for "" direct action"" and sabotage in industrial matters. They will have nothing to do with industrial arbitration or any kind pf legislation for the betterment of the conditions of the workers. . . . It would be nothing short of rank lunacy ,for the workers to discard these advantages and adopt the illogical unreasoning statements of the Industrial Workers of the World. I believe that any person in Queensland who exhorts his fellow workers to adopt any of the phrases of sabotage is an enemy to unionism. He should be treated as an industrial pariah, and not admitted to the ranks of the intelligent unions. The Labour movement has fought too long and suffered too much to permit its present position to be jeopardized by irresponsible adventurers who, I fear, are endeavouring to implant in Australia the seeds of hurtful propaganda calculated to divert industrial unionism from its true objective, and bring disruption to its ranks. The honourable member for Parramatta has spoken of the Industrial Workers of the World doctrines as threatening to become a cancer on unionism, and the statement of the Queensland Treasurer, himself a Labour man, is an admission that its seeds are germinating here, and are calculated to disrupt the ranks of union' ism. No one can seriously dispute the existence of the Industrial Workers of the World in Australia. The New Unionism is described in a book written by Andre Tridon, an exponent of Industrial Workers of the World methods. He says The New Unionist idea is permeating very rapidly the Australasian-English colonies. Following the Chicago Convention, at which the Industrial Workers of the World was launched, the Socialist Labour party of Australia conducted, through its weekly paper the People, an energetic propaganda for industrialism. Industrial Workers of the World clubs were organized in several industrial centres. The Sydney club adopted the 1905 preamble. When the preamble, however, was amended, the State Labour party refused to . ratify the amendments. Many of its members, headed by George Graham Reeve, a miner, who is at present the leader of the Australian Industrial Workers of the World, seceded. Thus we find in Australia Industrial Workers of the World clubs affiliated with the parliamentary Industrial Workers of the World of Detroit and Industrial Workers of the World locals pledged to direct action and affiliated with theChicago Industrial Workers of the World.",40

310,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"We have it in the literature which is circulated by the asarticle sociation. It occurs in its propaganda, and in the speeches of its members. Let fare. me read some of the extracts indicative of the methods of the alleged "" n e w train unionism."" I take this from page of the book to. which I have just ferredResolved, That whenever there arises between employers and workers a conflict, due either to the emplovers' exactions or to the workers' initiative, and a strike does not produce results satisfactory to the workers, the workers use boycott or sabotage, or both, according the rules laid down in this report. AgainWe may distinguish three forms of sabotage- (1) Active sabotage, which consists of The damaging goods or machinery. (2) Open mouth sabotage, beneficial to the of ultimate consumer; and which consists in exposing or defeating lent commercial practices. (3) Obstructionism or passive sabotage, which consists of carrying, out literally regardless of consequences. In a bulletin quoted in this book as --\by the Montpellier Labour Exchange for 1900, the different forms of sabotage are thus set forth If you are an engineer you qan, with 2 cents worth of powdered stone .or a pinch of sand, stall your. machine, cause a loss of time, or make expensive repairs necessary. If you are a joiner or woodworker, what is simpler than to ruin furniture without' your boss knowing it, and thereby drive his customers away? A garment worker can easily spoil a suit or a bolt of cloth; if you are working in a department store, a few spots on a fabric cause it to be sold for next to nothing; a grocery clerk, by packing up goods carelessly, bring about a smash up; in the woollen or haberdashery trade a few drqps of acid on the goods you are wrapping will make a customer furious; an agricultural labourer may sow bad seed in the wheat fields, &c. The writer of the book from which I am quoting gives an extract from a pamphlet on Syndicalism and the Railroads, by A . RenaultWe must select among the expert workers a few comrades who, knowing every detail of the machinery, will find the weak spots where an effective blow can be struck while avoiding all into stupid destruction of material. is, As an illustration of that form of sabotDoes the age called obstructionism, we have this description of what took place in a Rome According to regulations, ticket windows be open thirty minutes and closed five before the departure of a train. The wicket is opened; a gentleman offers a tenlire piece in payment for a ticket worth fourlire-fifty. The ticket agent reads to him an of the regulations, which requests passengers to present the exact amount of their As no change is made, hardly thirty tickets have been sold within the regulation time. The wicket is closed five minutes before time, with a mob of would be passengers, 42 who cannot pass the gates for lack of tickets. reDon't imagine, however, that those who secured transportation are much better off. They are within the cars, but that train does not move. According to regulations, a lot of switching has been done, which has stalled several trains 500 metres away. Some passengers, furious, leave the cars and start to shall walk to the station. Employees, in strict to obedience of regulations, proffer formal charges against them. We are now in Milan; a train has been ' assembled after an hour and a half's work. inspector notices in the middle of the train a ramshackle car. "" Car out of order,"" and the train is cut in two, so as to permit the removal of the objectionable vehicle. frauduBy this third method, known as obstruc-. tionism, the whole of a railway service can orders be rendered futile . The Bill deals with the form of sabotage the object of issued which is the taking and endangering of human life and in j u r y to property. Clause 5 deals with, members of an unlawful association who instigate the actions therein prohibited. The idea underlying sabotage is set out in an extract on page 55, and there we find what purports to be a justification of the doctrine. We are toldSabotage' is a direct application of the idea that property has no rights that its creators are boundto respect. Especially is this true when the creators of the wealth of the world are in hunger and want amid the abundance they have produced, while the idle few have all the good things of life. 'The open advocacy of sabotage and its widespread use is a true reflection of economic conditions. The current ethical code, with all existing laws and .institutions, is based upon private property in production. Why expect those who have no stake in society, as it is now constituted, to continue to contribute to its support? Such an association as the one under discussion strikes at the very foundations of our existing society, and aims at nothing less than a complete revolution. methods of sabotage are such that, if tolerated, l if e and property in this community would be rendered absolutely insecure. It has been properly described as a most dangerous growth, and it ought to be checked at the earliest possible stage. This Bill does not interfere with the free discussion of political, social, or economic questions, and associations formed f b r the purpose of such discussion and criticising will be absolutely unaffected by it ; there will be just as much liberty to express the most extraordinary opinions in this, connection as there is today, for the measure deals only with persons who go so far as to advocate or encourage the taking and endangering of life and in j u r y to property. This Bill is introduced because the State laws deal chiefly with specified crimes relating to life and property, and not with the general propaganda of incitement to the commission of crime. It is now sought to supply that deficiency; and I dare say that the States will adopt similar legislation. It is perfectly true, as already pointed out, that when this measure is passed, its administration will be mainly in the hands of the States, which have the necessary police, judiciary, and other in strumentalities. On the whole, I regard the Bill as a reasonable one. The honourable member for Yarra was under the im pression that all the offences contemplated are covered by the Crimes Act ; but that is a total misconception. In support of his view, he read section 5 of that Act, as follows5. Any person who aids, abets, counsels, or procures, or by act or omission is in any way directly' or indirectly knowingly concerned in, or party - to, the commission of any offence against this Act, or any other Act, whether passed before or after, the commencement of this Act, shall be deemed to have committed that offence, and shall be punishable accordingly. The honourable member overlooked the fact that that section applies only to persons aiding or abetting in the commission of an offence. When, the law declares what is an offence, then the section operates, there must first be an offence created by Statute before any one can be charged with aiding and abetting in its commission. In regard to one section he mentioned, the honourable member was perfectly right. Where there has been actual destruction of Commonwealth property, as in the case of the Brisbane, there is a law Its to deal with it ; but tliere is no Commonwealth law as yet under which a person may be punished who incites persons to the commission of such crimes generally. It is to meet such cases that we are asked to pass this Bill .",41
311,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"What about the War Precautions Act l Mr GB.OOM - No doubt there are the widest powers under that Act ; but I think that, except in urgent-cases, the duties of the community ought to be defined by Statute-that when we create new offences, it ought to be by Act rather than by regulation. Nothing that has been said by any honourable member has inferred in the slightest degree that trade unions are in any way associated with the crimes which are the object of this measure. As a matter of fact, this Bill is for the protection of trade unionism, and punishes those who might otherwise bring discredit on that movement. The aims and objects of legitimate unionism' are clearly set out in every trade union Act of the States, and the Conciliation and Arbitration Act of the Commonwealth. Legitimate unionism is full y protected by law; but here we have an association, which alleges that it seeks to benefit societv and proposes to do so by destructive methods. That, of course, is a danger to society. The members declare that they are out for the reform of society and the improvement of the well-being of the worker, and that, of course, has a very fair sound. An association which existed for these purposes only, and sought to attain them hy legitimate methods, would not come within the scope of this Bill . The measure aims at the suppression of an . association which seeks to carry out its objects by propaganda work, involving an incitement to a breach of those laws .relating to .life and property, which are the foundation of society itself. On the whole, I think the Bill will not meet with any serious opposition in this House, and, if put into operation, can do nothing but tend to promote the well-being of the Commonwealth.",42
312,Mr HAMPSON,Unknown,"Bendigo) [5.25] Under the circumstances, I do not know that the Government have any right to either introduce legislation or govern the country by regulation. If the reasons mentioned by the Prime Minister for the ' introduction of this Bill represent the truth , it is utterly absurd that it should be put forward as a temporary measure. If the danger is as great as the Prime M in ister has tried to indicate, there is every necessity to make it permanent. We are told by the right honourable gentleman that the members of this association have been charged with murder, forgery and uttering, arson, cutting the electric wires on the Brisbane, shooting a Government agent, arming themselves with automatic pistols at their meeting, and hooting the - King's name. Further, we are informed that the association is largely composed of foreigners, with a fair number of Germans, who use their influence against the Allies in this war; that they are a pesthouse of social infection; that they advocate the ""go-slow"" doctrine, believe in sabotage and the general strike, and have no belief in nationality. It seems to me that the only thing the Prime Minister forgot t q mention was that the members of the association are wreckers of the marriage tie and of the home- a gibe that used to be cast at the party to which he recently belonged. I suppose, however, that he has left that part of the business for the Women's National League when we have the elections. The Leader of the Liberal party was very indignant this afternoon at the idea that fruit-growers and fish merchants should be in any way associated with the Industrial Workers of the W o r l d ; but the right honourable gentleman must have a very short memory if he has forgotten so soon that during the recent campaign",43

Does the right honourable member forget the insult that was then hurled against more than half the people in the community? The' charge that was then made, against them still rankles in their hearts. , One would have thought that an association charged with all the* crimes enumerated by the Prime Minister would have something like a record throughout Australia.

327,Mr HAMPSON,Unknown,"And will the.honorGoable member try to link up the Industrial Workers of the World with the trade union movement?- The preamble says The trade unions foster a state of affairs which allows one set of workers to be pitted against another set ofworkers in the same industry, thereby helping to defeat one another in wage wars. Moreover, the trade unions aid the employing class to mislead the workers into the belief that the working class have interests in common with their employers. These conditions can be changed, and the interests of the working class upheld only by an organization formed in such a way that all its members in any one industry, or in all industries if necessary, cease work whenever a strike or lock-out is on in any department thereof, thus making an injury to one 'an injury to all. Instead of the Conservative motto "" A fair day's wages for a fair day's work,"" we must inscribe, on our banner the revolutionary watchword, "" Abolition of the wage system."" l t is the historic mission of the working class to do away with capitalism. The army of production must be organized, not only 'for the every-day struggle with capitalism, but also to carry on production when capitalism shall have been overthrown. We see that they propose to carry on production and industry after they have .overthrown capitalism. Therefore, these statements about their being anarchical in< their views do not hold good-so far as their preamble is concerned. The preamble concludesBy organizing industrially we are forming the structure of the new society within the shell of the old. The Prime - Minister has said that this association is undemocratic, but from its rules I find it-is essentially democratic in its working. It is certainly sounder in its Democracy than a Government which is representing a minority, and endeavours to bring in this legislation with the idea of bolstering it up afterwards by regulations. A convention of the Industrial Workers of the World was held in 1906, and its work was ratified by a referendum in the same year. The same was done in 1907, and each year following. No matter how wrong we may 'think their methods are, and no matter how much we may condemn some of their actions, we must regard the organization itself on its merits and on what it preaches, and not on what a few of its members may have done. We might just as well say what was said and done in times of excitement and stress in days gone by by a few members of the union of which the honourable member for Darling was so prominent a member applied to the whole of the union.

When Parliament ,gets into a state of panic, and rushes legislation through with the object of saving society from some great calamity that is supposed to be menacing it , my experience is that the legislation has a worse effect than its authors anticipate. I believe that the Prime Minister is resentful about the hard things that some of these men have said about him, but these men . were taken before the Court, and sentenced, though their sentences have been suspended. No man can agree with what was done in Sydney.

The very fact that these three men stood for the Senate in opposition to Labour candidates shows that the Industrial Workers of the Worl d cannot be associated with the Labour party. I have a lively recollection of the vigorous language they used in denouncing, not the Liberal nor the Fusion party, but the Labour movement Their choicest epithets were reserved for our party. Between the Labour party and the extreme* Socialists 'and the Industrial Workers of the World today there is a wider breach than ever. In this article Mr Hughes went on to sayOf those who hold these opinions some call themselves the Industrial Workers of the World, others declare themselves to be Socialists, qualified by some prefix. Generally, they are anything but Socialists-being , in fact, communists or anarchists.

351,Mr BOYD,Unknown,"Member s of unions can be compelled, under the Arbitratio n Act , to pay all levies'. - Mr Fenton - That is only in relation to industrial matters. The Prime Minister went on to say-in this articleI t was the minority-wh o oppose the Labour. party, and with whom, politically or economically, the majority has nothing in common save the fact of their unionism-fro m whose opinions we most strongly dissent. Some of these were' so distinctly hostile to the political party with which the vast majority of unionists is affiliated that we notice, with some surprise, that their expression was per-: mitted . to be made without effective protest. Quite apart from this; and considered on their merits, most of these appear to be ill-considered and illogical. There is one point which has been effectively put by the Leader of t'he Liberal party, and also by the honourable member is for Darling Downs, which I desire to emsysphasize, and that is that this Bill ought is to be so amended as to provide for persons charged with offences under this Act being and economic tried by jury.",47

353,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"As a rule, most serious offences under both Federal and State laws must be tried before a jury. A man charged with the vilest of murders is provided by the State with counsel for his the defence, and must be tried by jury. I that this Bill will be amended to provide for tria l by jury.",47

355,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"There may be some truth in that statement. Many intelligent men would prefer, in the event of contheir committing a breach of the law, either by intent or accident, to have their case tried by a Judge rather than by a Whilst I do not wish to say anytbing derogatory of those who preside over our Courts, I think there are refew men who, no matter what their lives may be, are normal in these stressful There are few who are not suffering from nerves, or some other trouble, and there is something in the contention raised by the honourable member for Bendigo that, even in trying deto prevent the commission of offences which we all deplore, we must be careful that we do not give way to panic, and pass legislation that we shall have to amend. Such an experience has happened in connection with our State legislation. I have a lively recollection of drastic legislation passed by the Victorian Parliament on the occasion of the railway strike. So panicky did the' State Parliament become that it went so far as to deprive public servants and railway employees of their votes. predicted at the time that the Parliament would be ashamed of its action, and that the law would be repealed. Parliament did repeal it , and gave back to those men that of which they should have never been robbed. A public servant is a citizen and a taxpayer, and is entitled to all the privileges of citizenship.",47
356,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,Were all the instated after the strike?,48
357,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Some did not go back. A-few were in a slightly more fortunate position than some of their fellows, and did not return to the railway service. There may be. a few who are not enjoying all the privileges they had before the strike. Then, again,' there are many in this community who favour the abolition of capital punishment. I do not share that view. But i there are some people who say that men who publicly advocate the abolition of capital punishment are actually offering a premium to the committal of murder and other capital offences.",48
358,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,The Legislative Assembly has passed a Bill abolishing capital punishment.,48
359,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"There are many quite honest in the conviction that capital punishment should be abolished, yet there are well-meaning people in our community who accuse such men of offering a premium for the committal of murder and other capital offences. Such is not the case. We have to be careful in order that we may do the right thing. I have not the slightest doubt that all the offences against which this Bill is directed can be punished under the Crimes Act, the War Precautions Act, or State legislation.",48
360,Mr BOYD,Unknown,"Non e of those measures deal with the offence of "" inciting.""",48

364,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Perhaps so; but the point I am making is that, even if this Bill were not passed, those who commit the crimes with which it deals could not escape. Men have already been brought to book for such offences.",48
365,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Every case cited by the Prime Minister has been dealt with. I Mr JENSEN - But only after the commission of the crime.,48
366,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I am merely showing A future that we have power already to deal with men who commit these crimes. If we have not, then it is singular that action has not previously been, taken. If it be true that we have not this power, the legal members of the House must have known of it . Why this sudden spasm of virtue ? I remen re- peat that I believe that any offence could be punished under the War Precautions Act. . Mr GrEEENE - No one denies that these offences could be. dealt with under, the War Precautions Act, but why deal with them by regulation ?",48
367,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"It is strange > that, while some of the most important problems that could await a Parliament yet remain to be solved by us, this measure is brought forward as if it were absolutely essential to the successful prosecution of the war, and to the preservation of our community from crime. I may be out of order in referring to some matters that are specially deserving of our attention at the present Queensland time. Reference was made to one of them in the House last week-repatria tion. That is the kind of legislation that we ought to be considering this afternoon in the interest of onr soldiers.",48
368,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,And does not the T a r i ff need amendment?,48
369,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Yes . There are several things that have been awaiting attention for a long time. The Ministry, however, assisted by the Liberals, have suddenly brought in this Bill , and other matters must be held over u n t i l we reassemble 'at the end of January or 'the beginning of February.",48

371,Mr FENTON,Unknown,No . I understand that the second reading will be carried on the voices.,48
372,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,Then let us carry it .,48
373,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I feel bound to draw be attention, first, to the other important A much more important matter is the amelioration of the conditions of our returned soldiers, and the providing of employment for them. In tomorrow's newspapers the speeches of the Prime Minister and of the Leader of the Liberal party will be reported almost verbatim, but little space will be allowed for the remarks of the members of the party to which I belong. We sbould be regardless of our duty, therefore, if we did not avail ourselves of what opportunity we have to express our opinions. Are the members of the Industrial Workers of the World the only persons in Australia whose crimes should be punished ?' What did the Prime Minister tell the electors in 1915? He said then that Australia - was suffering because the National Parliament had not the power to deal with the thieves and vagabonds who were robbing the poor of the community. In the pamphlet which he wrote in advocacy of the amendment of the Constitution, he dealt in picturesque language with many of these vile crimes. What he wrote then is true today. He pointed out that the people were being exploited by trusts and monopolies. I wish to show that there are others in the community besides the members of the Industrial Workers of the World who should be dealt with stringently. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - If they are members of unlawful associations, they will come within the scope of this measure.",48
374,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"This measure cannot be applied to them. In the pamphlet to which I refer, the Prime Minister saidAre the people now exploited by trusts and monopolies to wait for years for relief? Are the labour organizations, which have been urged to abandon the strike and seek relief in the Arbitration Courts, but have time and again, after protracted and expensive efforts to obtain justice, seen the fruits, of their labours snatched from them by legal technicalities, by injunctions, prohibititons, ' and other devices by which capital contrives to defraud labour of its just rights, to wait for years ? Those who have taken .advantage of technicalities to deny justice to the workers, and who have levied high prices on the necessaries of life, are as much the enemies of society as are the members of any illegal association aimed at by the Bill. The Prime Minister askedIs not industrial peace absolutely essential to a successful prosecution of this war? Did not the strike' on the South Wales coal-fields gravely imperil the Empire and threaten it with imminent disaster? But.how can industrial peace be insured when employers have the means of setting awards of the Arbitration Courts aside by recourse to technicalities and expensive and protracted litigation? The conditions of America cannot be compared with those of Australia. Even some of those on the Ministerial bencha peaceful man like the Vice-President of the Executive Council-would , if living under American laws and conditions, be ready to join the Industrial Workers of the World.",49
375,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"Certainl y not. The Industrial Workers of the Worl£, it has been proved, has been associated with strike-breaking, and has been in the pay of capitalists. v ",49
376,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Then how can the Labour party be associated with it? We are opposed to strike-breaking. There are things which the honourable member would have done in the early days of the Australian Workers Union that he would not do now, and there were offences committed then which he has condoned, but which he would not condone if committed now. He knows that in the'early days of unionism scores of men had to seek employment under assumed names. Men who have figured conspicuously in the battles of the Empire were forced to resort then to all sorts of tactics to which they would not resort now. So, under American conditions, things are tolerated which we cannot tolerate here. ""In a country where every adult bas a vote, we should be able to secure what we want by constitutional methods, though I am afraid that even with an elaborate amendment of our Constitution we shall hardly be in a position to do many of the things that ought to be done* The robbery of the people, which, causes the high cost of living, bears very hardly upon women and children particularly, and many of them are relatives of soldiers, but little is being done by the Government to relieve them. There can be no greater crime than to gamble in foodstuffs.",49
377,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,Is that a justification of the actions of the Industrial Workers of the World?,49
378,Mr FENTON,Unknown,No; ' but the Government has power to deal with others who at present violatethe law. What need is there for this measure when more important matters await considerationmatters such as the amendment of the Constitution ?,49

381,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I repeat that, in my opinion, there are measures and problems of more urgency upon which we might be engaged, and there is sufficient power under the law as it exists to deal with the offences contemplated by the Bill . Twelve months ago the Prime Minister described certain individuals in the community as profit-mongers, exploiters of the people, and makers of huge fortunes out of the war, and told us that profits were higher than before hostilities broke out, and that excessive interest and rents were being charged-in short, that there were many unscrupulous people in the community with whom he sought power to deal, and yet today his voice is silent regarding them. As a party, we have nothing to do with the Industrial Workers of the World , and, both inside and out-, side this Parliament, the voice of Labour has been raised against it . At the recent Inter-State Conference, one of the resolutions-carried , I believe, unanimouslyrepudiated any connection between the Labour party and the Industrial Workers of the. World . I presume, however, that the measure will pass, though I regard it as only a piece of window dressing and advertisement in view of the elections in the near future. . ' Mr MATHEWS (Melbourne Ports) [8.2] - I am rather afraid that the Prime Minister is up to his tricks again. I do not think it is the Industrial Workers of the World he is after, but rather poor "" Jimrnie."" I am one who believes that there is legislation enough to deal with the offences which have called forth the Bill . Some may remember that a little while ago I was rather afraid of the War Precautions Act , and subsequent events have proved that my fears were well founded, seeing that it has been used for purposes never intended. The .harmless Bill before us, intendedJ!or the Industrial Workers of the World , has a sting in its tail, as represented by clause 8, which gives the Governor General power to make any regulations, not .inconsistent with the Bill , that the Government may choose. The Prime Minister commenced by saying that the Industrial Workers of the World here is founded on the lines of the Chicago organization. That - may be so, but I know members of the organization here whose object is quite an innocent one, and represents the original idea of combination, namely, one big union. Thai the organization has become permeated with persons whom Australia could well do without, we all know; and I do not think there is a parliamentary representative who has not a very strong opinion so far as these people are concerned. There are many members of the Industrial Workers of the World who, like our friend Fleming, on the Y a r r a Bank, would not k ill a fly.",50
382,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"It is only t a l k ! - Mr MATHEWS - They talk "" direct action,"" but their idea is not shooting policementhrough a window, making £ 1 notes, and firing buildings, but rather that, instead of wasting time on legislative enactment, they should, by means of the strike, bring about that which they desire. While sectional strikes have always been, and still will be, very effective in attaining the ends of the workers, all the talk about the world-wide strike is of no use so far as they are concerned. If the worker is prepared to keep his wife and family from starving for seven days, the other side, which is well represented in this Chamber, can do so for eight days, and, to my mind, the idea of a universal strike is useless. The trouble is that one is somewhat fearful of trusting a Prime Minister with a measure of this character. The Prime Minister tells us that tliere are some of the Chicago members of the In dustrial Workers of the World in Australia, but I may say that there are very few in my electorate. One of these, while he talks pretty loudly, would not"", I am sure, have \ho pluck to k ill anybody, and he says that he belongs to those who call themselves revolutionary Socialists. A revolutionary Socialist. does not mean a person who would burn down buildings if he could not get his own way, or who would engage in any for m of sabotage; all the revolutionary Socialist talks about is his intention tb revolutionize society in a - proper, peaceful, legislative manner. When we hear the Prime Minister try in g to connect all sorts of organizations with the Industrial Workers of the World , it does not need any great stretch of the imagination to see that he might , spread his net and get a few of us in .",50
383,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,He m i g ht get himself in !,50
384,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"I remember the time when the Prime Minister would have certainly come under the condemnation which he is voicing today, and when I listened open-mouthed, with my hair on end, because I was regarded as a very namby-pamby kind of Socialist.. The trouble is to prevent the form of sabotage as we know it, and as it is supposed to be carried out in Australia; but, unfortunately, when we give a Government certain powers, they are often used in a direction never intended. The men who were recently tried in Sydney, like all men charged with crime, pleaded not guilty, but they were found guilty and sentenced; and if they committed the acts alleged they deserved all they got. The objection is that these men were found guilty before they were tried by the Court; and in this connection the Prime Minister and the newspapers of Australia were the principal transgressors.",51
385,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Not against these particular men.,51
386,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Yes , against these particular men.",51
387,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Nobod y could deny the fact that fires and incendiarism were rife in New South Wales.,51
388,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"We agree that something of the sort took place, but we must remember that one man said that he thought it would be a fine thing to 'burn down some place and thus do' his father a good turn, and then lay the charge against the Industrial Workers of the World - Industrial Workers of the World for all",51
389,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I am sure the individual faults of the men tried were not discussed at all, because the Court would not have permitted it.",51
390,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"We all know that the newspapers of Australia and the Prime Minister found - these men guilty before they were tried by the Court. I do not like to say harsh things of the Prime Minister, because I know that, like the rest of us, he has his troubles; but I am afraid of handing my liberty over to him. I am quite willing to assist in passing an enactment to prevent sabotage, which is a form of action most repugnant to any Australian. If I lived in a country where I did not have a vote-wher e the suffrage was not as it is in Australia- I do not know what I might .do. I . might go in for sabotage,, or I might even agree to shoot landlords from behind a hedge. In Australia, however, the man who resorts to .any other method of bringing about reform except that provided by the ballot-box and the Legislature, is a danger to the country. True, the franchise is rather restricted in some of the States, but the Federal franchise is so wide that no man has a right to resort to any other means than those I have mentioned. I was one who helped to return the honourable member for Fawkner to Parliament, and I listened to him with admiration one day when he attacked the Industrial Workers of the World, and told some of the members of it that they ought to go back to America, where they came from. That, I think, is the opinion of every member of the party to which I belong. If we felt that the - Prime Minister could be trusted not to do anything under the Bill more than is now intended, I do not think much could be said against it ; but the right honourable gentleman does very peculiar things when he thinks it necessary. . For instance, he uses the War Precautions Act as a man in a foundry might use a steam hammer to drive in a tack, though, when he could use it for the benefit of the country, he refrained from doing so. For instance, the great coal strike might have been stopped by the Prime Minister, but it was not; and it makes one a bit afraid when we find a man so using the law to suit himself or his own particular party. There is no doubt that the Prime Minister used the it was worth during the conscription campaign. Many men forcibly condemned him for this, and, though I was ashamed of him, I refrained from comment as long as possible, but at length I had to join in the protests, because I saw that he .was - using his powers in a way he had no right to do. Of course, the Prime Minister is what some people demand. The honourable member for Moreton, for instance, says that we require a "" good, strong man"" in power; but, of course, we only like the' ""good, strong man"" on our own side, and not on the other. It happens now that the honourable member for Moreton is on the same side as the Prime Minister, and he feels safe. I do not. The Prime Minister is game to. use all his powers. In Committee we ought to attempt to alter several of the clauses, particularly the last one, which deals with the) making of regulations. Under that clause the Prime Minister can do as be likes.",51
391,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Mb , he cannot.",52
392,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"When the War Precautions Bill was before the House we were told that it was quite harmless, and necessary for use against the enemies of the country, and a majority of honourable members believed that. But I knew at the time that it would be used for purposes other than those for which it was intended. The idea of Parliament was that the B j l l should be used against the country's enemies. Instead of that being done, dunder-headed justices of the peace were allowed to sentence men to imprisonment for six months and twelve months, and if those same gentlemen could get hold of me they would send me to gaol for twelve years, if they could. I am certain of that. As a matter .of fact, the actions of the Indust r i a l Workers of the World in New South Wales were used as an excuse for the imprisonment of Barker. The maximum penalty that should have been i m posed upon Barker was a fine of 2s., in stead of which he was sent to prison for twelve months. Articles were publishedi n the press every day, compared with which Barker's writings were as nothing, but he happened to be opposed to the Prime' Minister. We are quite willing to enact any measure that will be used to suppress men who incite to k ill and to the destruction of property, but we wish to be assured that innocent men cannot be imprisoned as'they were under the W a r Precautions Act. If that safeguard can be provided, I do not think the Bill will do much harm. But I desire the insertion of a provision to insure that the Bill shall not be used against persons other than those against whom it is primarily directed. However, I suppose the numbers are up. The Government have said to the Leader of the Liberal party, "" Will you have this Bill ? "" and he has replied, "" Yes . "" Therefore, the passing of the Bill is settled.  somewhat surprised to listen to the honourable member for Melbourne Ports when he expressed concern lest he might be i mprisoned under this proposed law. The honourable member could not have spoken for such a length of time in regard to that danger if he had read the Bill , because I do not believe for a moment that he is a gentleman who entertains any idea of encouraging or inciting any one to take action that would endanger human l if e or lead to the destruction of property. I give him credit for being a much better man than that. Therefore, I was sorry to hear him express concern that he might be enmeshed by this Bill if it should become law, having regard to the fact that unless he were guilty of such incftation he could not be affected by this measure.",52
393,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"I would not like to be on t r i a l if the honourable member was on the bench.  orable member justice tempered with mercy. We have listened to many disclaimers from members of the Labour Opposition, who dread the thought of the political Labour unions being identified in ,any way with the Industrial Workers of the W o r l d. I congratulate them upon those declarations, but it^is a great pity, indeed, that the political Labour unions are not equally careful of their reputations. We have only to Scan the columns of the daily press from time to time to discover, that a number of branches of political Labour bodies have carried resolutions sympathizing with the Industrial Workers of the World in a most practical way by voting money for their support and assistance. Perhaps the sting in the Bill consists.in the fact that under clause 5 any branch of a political labour union which carries a resolution condemning the Courts of law which have adjudged these men to be guilty, or which carries resolutions by which they vote sums of money for the support of the Industrial Workers of the World, will bring themselves with in the meshes of the.law.",52
394,Mr HANNAN,Unknown,Will that not apply to the' Liberal party also ?  anybody who falls into that sin.,52
395,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Clause 5 relates only to unlawful associations.  arises as to what is an illegal association, and whether associations are by their constitutions illegal, or, by the acts they perpetrate, doing illegal things. That, seems to be an immaterial point. The very fact that organizations carry resolutions to encourage sedition, murder, arson, and other offences ought to bring them at once within the meshes of the law; and as clause 5 does not meet such cases, another clause ought to be added to the Bill by which any person or body of persons inciting these men to maintain efforts in defiance of the law should punis'hable. I would silence every man or body of men who carried a resolution or publicly essayed to assist men who in open defiance of this law; and I cannot conceive how honourable members in the the Labour Opposition corner can maintain their own self-respect and at the same time ' refrain from condemning those things which have led to the destruction of so much valuable property, and the murder of at least one man, and which are calculated to upset the whole social World. fabric and the constitutional conditions under which we are governed. I should not have risen to speak but for the speech of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, who raised a bogus difficulty, suggested that there was a possibility this Bill of innocent persons being engame perfectly well. trapped.

However, the honourable member is so well known that people will be able to judge exactly the worth of his remarks. One almost hesitates to treat this Bill so seriously as to even speak upon it at all. Those who have been longer in politics than I agree with me that seldom has such a farce as this Bill been perpetrated in any Legislature. Others have pointed out that means are already at hand to deal with individuals who commit the crimes that have been attributed to the Industrial Workers of the World . I wish to emphatically, with others sitting in corner, that none of us have the slightest sympathy with the members of any assotion. ciation that is guilty of the crimes which have been mentioned today. It is almost unnecessary to give that assurance. have seldom heard the Prime Minister to worse advantage than when moving the second reading of this Bill . In most matters, be can work up a little enthusiasm, be but his speech today was absolutely devoid of enthusiasm. He knew that he was merely doing something for a political are purpose. He made no attempt to identify any honourable member of the House with organization at which the Bill is principally directed, but by innuendo the im pression was conveyed that in some mysterious way some members of the Labour party, or some members of the organizations to which we belong, are connected with the Industrial Workers of the",52
396,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"The Prime Minister did not say that.  and dared not say that; but the imputation in was there all the same.

I do not think so. Such a penalty will not wipe out the wrongdoings of any organization. It is clear to me that the say, Prime Minister does not seek to wipe out (this the Industrial Workers of the World . ' Mr JENSEN - There is also deporta foreigners who come here. But let us I deal with the person born in Australia who incites to murder. It is apparent to me that the Prime Minister has not brought in the Bill with the object wiping out this, organization. He simply wishes to use it as a stalking-horse; if the Industrial ""Workers of the World ment that pervades the people of Aus do assume serious dimensions in Austratralia. lia the blame must rest with the Prime Minister for giving it the best advertisemake ment it could ever have. Mr Holman, the Premier of New South Wales, who has taken all the benefits that the Labour movement could give him, and, I regret to say, has lately gone the way of a many others, has said that the member the ship of this organization does not 400. In fact, he has referred to it as being infinitesimal in point of numbers. Yet now, because he has gone to the other side, this organization is made to loom largely for purely political purposes. there was anything more pitiful look of the Prime Minister when he was trying to infuse a little bit of fire into his speech, it was the look on the face of the Leader of the Opposition when he found that no one in the corner, or elseall where, would say one word that would these prove' him to be. in sympathy with the Industrial Workers of the World, or near an organization of the character referred to in the Bill. That is the trouble. There is no one in the chamber, or among the organizations from which the members of the party in the corner come, who beof lieves in the Industrial Workers of.the World. One of the objects in introducwin ing the Bill was the vain hope that some one in this corner would say something that would implicate him one way or anBill, other with this outside association; but as that is not likely to occur, the Prime Minister has missed one of the principal objects he had in view. The Bill simply a new bogy, which will serve the honourable member for Echuca and others when they get out in the back country. Eor years there have been men in this outlined Parliament who have endeavoured stem the progress of the Labour party all kinds of imputations as to Socialism, Syndicalism, confiscation, and phrases of years ? that sort; and now, when all these have died out, there is a fresh"" bogy, that ofgo further than that. sabotage, the terrifying word that they are about to drag round the country as stalking-horse for the purpose of intimi-' dating people.

Mr KI NG O'MALLEY (Darwin) [8.42] - This measure looks very simple, but I invariably look to the source of a Billin order to see whether the stream runs true, and whether it rises in the mountains and gathers power as it rushes to the sea. What I am frightened about is that it is liable tq affect ex-Prime ters, and I would like to add a clause to protect them. I could have been a very rich man in Sydney many years >ago, but the speeches that I heard frightened me. They said that everything was to be confiscated, and so I came to Melbourne, and did not make a quarter of what I would have made in Sydney. Bills such as these are boomerangs. In my travels in the United States of America I saw the effect of several of such Bills. They hit the very men who passed them. That is the _ danger. I will not say anything about the honourable member for Echuca. He gets very, excited. We have heard a lot about "" Seeing the light."" It' is not the light that they see in this Bill ; a case of feeling the heat occasioned by it . I may be mistaken, but I think that the Industrial Workers of the World have been magnified into a mighty mountain of importance, and that we are making martyrs of its members.",54
401,Mr COESEH,Unknown,"They would have burned down Sydney if action had not been taken against them. Mr KI NG O'MALLEY - I am glad the .honourable member has said that because I did not speak about heavy insurances. I do not know whether the honourable member has heard about a gentleman in the Western States who made a fortune by getting his - place burnt down. A friend said to his son, '' Why do you not get rich like Appleheimer?"" and when the .son answered, "" I do not know how to,"" his rejoinder was, "" Why don't you get well insured?""",55
402,Mr CORSER,Unknown,"That 4s a nasty insinuation regarding Sydney business people. Mr KI NG O'MALLEY - My honourable friend is not the only business man in God's green earth. It was a regular business among unsuccessful men in Western America-of course, such a thing would not be heard of in Australia-to I pay high premiums, and get well insuredA little later on '' she turned over and burnt out."" I have known for a long time that business has not been too good in Australia, except in one line, and that is in supplying'the Army and the Navy. We had in Western America an association which every one used to blame for burning down houses. It was known, not as the Industrial Workers of the World, but as the "" D a n Murphy,"" because a famous gambler of that name was in the business. Every one attacks Tammany, but I have seen things in Australia inMinis- finitely more degrading than anything Tammany ever did. I am not going to defend these men, but I want the House to look at the other side of the question. If there were four or five Masons down Collins-street - who were considered not too good, the whole Masonic Lodge, under this Bill, might be held up. Yet we have some splendid men among the Masons. Supposing an attack were made on the Presbyterian Church because of four or five elders whose conduct was disapproved of, or on the Roman Catholic Church because of the actions of four or five roosters in it-supposin g on that ground either of those religious organizations was declared an illegal association, what would be said ? it is This is the beginning of the destruction of liberty. It is a serious matter to attack an association. Before the last general election the Liberal party tried to make a slogan of "" preference to unionists."" My sorrow is that I did not get the thousand that I arranged should be held by a friend, for today it would have been earning me £45 a year for life. I warn my friends of the Liberal party with all Christian fortitude; I have no ill-feeling against them. At the last general election they tried to make a slogan of preference to unionists, and I was the target. But Lord! How did she tumble? Thirty-one Labour candidates were returned to the Senate, and we got a majority in this House. This dog will not fight. It is only a rat terrier, whereas you want a, bull-dog with 40,000 teeth. This - is a mistake. One never gains anything in this world by taking advantage of others-by resort to cunning, subtlety, or any kind of tricks. It is far better to come out into the open, and be honest in the fight. Then if you are beaten on your merits all is well - In the United States of America recently, President Wilson provided for the legal recognition of the principle of eight hours, and Mr Hughes, instead of fighting the Presidential campaign on a straight-out issue, attacked the eiehthours principle. And , oh, Charlie 1 Where are you? It was the same with the other Hughes in Canada. He took up a certain attitude. Where is he? We ought not to play these little tricks. They cut no ice. It is a bad policy to make martyrs of people. Why has the great Irish question never been settled? Because every now and again a few fools rise up and are shot by the British Government. The result is that they become martyrs, and the whole nation is seething with sorrow, and weeping, and wailing. That is what happened quite recently over there. Instead of these men being shot, they ought to have been put where they could get a good feed and be well clothed-wher e they could be made Christians. In Australia, one can already hear expressions of sympathy with the Industrial Workers of the World who were recently sentenced to fifteen years' imprisonment. I do not know the rights and the wrongs of the case, but all this damnable persecution should be no more amongst Christian men. I cannot understand the honourable member for Echuca.",55
403,Mr RILEY,Unknown,He is not saved yet.,56
404,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"He has never found salvation. He needs sionary. Listening to him to-night, one would imagine that he was the sole survivor of the pre-neocene era of human degeneration. I "" fel t sad as I heard him talking. If God gives one man a bushel of brains, and another only a thimbleful, how can the thimbleful man be expected to know as much as the man with a bushel of brains? These men, instead of burning down houses, would be building them, if they had brains.",56
405,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,Does member say that all burglars are without (brains?,56
406,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"I do. How is it that a burglar has never been able to take me down? It is because I think better than the burglar before he reaches m:. I am the better thinker. looking for him, and he is looking for me. Why should' the Government come down with a Bill of this kind when we ought to be considering financial measures, and trying to evolve mighty schemes for financing this country, instead of talking about Industrial Workers of the World lunatics? We take these poor, unfortunate, ignorant fellows, and shove them into gaol for fifteen years. And why? Because they are condemned before they are tried. We talk about British justice, but for 200 years the name of Judge Jeffreys has stunk, in England. He was paid a high price to serve his K in g , and he sent 350 people to the gallows at one Assizes. I hope we are not going to have a Jeffreys in Australia. I trust that Australia's 'liberty is to live for all time. Why should the' time of a great Parliament be taken up in this way ? Why should every little tin-pot thing be brought in here? We ought'to be dealing with great issues. We should be dealing now with the Tariff. We ought to have a Tariff as high as the Himalaya Mountains. Then, again, we ought to be evolving a scheme' for the proper settlement of the soldiers on the land. We talk of putting them on little farms, but many of them know as much about farming as the skunk knows about Edison's invention of the electric light. They will waste the little they receive in a few years, and will come back to our cities. . We hear a lot about sabotage. I remember a man in Western America who sent his son Hermann to college, and who told me when I asked how he was getting on, "" He is a great master of the languages. He 'called me a double-dyed a mis- sea-horse this morning.. That must be Latin."" Then, again, ' there was the nigger woman Winch, who, in response to a call at a camp meeting for those who were prepared to come up to the Cross and be saved stepped forward, and was immediately greeted with the cry, fro m another negro, "" Here, Lizzie, I caught you stealing my chickens last n i g h t ! """,56
407,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Does the honourable member intend to connect these remarks with the question before the Chair? the honourable Mr KING OMALLEY - I do, sir. Lizzie said, "" Do you think I am going to let a few rotten chickens stand between me and my L o r d ? "" And are our friends of the Liberal party, in combination with the Government, going to allow the In dustrial Workers of the World to stand I am between them and the selection of a slogan for the next election ? Nothing will save them. The handwriting is on the wall. I can already almost smell the corpse. My friends of the Liberal party cannot save themselves. Damnation awaits them. I warn my honourable friends that they must fight, this battle decently and honestly. I have never said an unkind word about an opponent, and I never in tend to do so, for I may have to meet that man, some time, in Heaven, and I want to be able to say, "" I gave him a square deal."" Mr r SINCLAIR (Moreton) [8.59] We cannot afford to treat this question in the light and airy fashion with which the honourable member for Darwin would have us dismiss it . Rightly or wrongly, the public mind of Australia is agitated, and something is necessary to allay the fears of the people. Thismeasure, if it does nothing else, will restore public confidence. The honourable member for Bendigo has asked what is the record of the Industrial Workers of the World in Victoria. Whatever may be its Police Court record, the people of Australia feel that only firm, strong action by the powers that be will satisfy them regarding it . Speaking to me the other day, the head of a large firm said, "" We have had to employ seven additional watchmen to prevent depredations on our premises.""",56
408,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Was that in Melbourne?,57
409,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,"No ; but I believe that in Melbourne the number of watchmen has had to be increased considerably. Another gentleman, from the country, when I asked him how he was getting on, said, "" We have decided to shoot the first man that we catch setting fire to our premises."" The head of the firm to which I have alluded also told me that every watchman on his premises was armed with an automatic pistol. have made up their minds to take the law into their own hands, and there is a state of public excitement, serious results may happen at any moment. The Bill at least will do no harm. I am surprised to find in the Corner party those who are prepared to defend the actions of an association which, to use the words of the Prime Minister; is a collection of outlaws and anarchists.  bers does the honourable member refer?",57
410,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,"I shall make that plain presently. I take it that the Sydney Worker is the mouth-piece of the Labour party. No doubt the referendum brought bad blood, and, perhaps, foreign blood, into the conduct of that organ. But before there was any talk of a referendum-o n the 13th July-that paper published the following statement with 1 regard to the Industrial Workers of the World and their gospel of "" go slow "" : - , In an organization-so all-embracing as the Labour movement, there are certain to be different schools of thought, with different theories of action. Sometimes these schools may seem to be very wide apart; their tactics may present no features' in common. But these are merely surface appearances. Probe a little deeper, and you will find that nothing essential divides them. The various sections of the Labour movement are bound together by the great principle of resistance to an exploitation of which all are equally the victims. They claim the Industrial Workers of the Wlorld, those who are in the "" go-slow"" movement, as their comrades-in-arais against the pernicious capitalistic system which they denounceTo our mind, the great objections to the I.W.W. way of doing things is not its theoretical depravity, but its practical futility. It does not get there. It fails to deliver the goods. The go slow"" weapon does not hurt enough. It is a clumsy instrument; one that is wielded with difficulty, and is apt to snap off at the handle when you try to hit hard with it.",57
411,Mr BURNS,Unknown,The Vice-President of the Executive Council was at that time connected with that newspaper.,57
412,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,"The extract that I have read shows the connection between the Labour organizations and the Indust r i a l Workers of the World. Then, in a letter published in the Sydney Daily Telegraph of the 25th July, there is an ^ account of a meeting of members of the In When men dustrial Workers of the World in the Domain, where the following resolution was carried, with only three dissentients :That this meeting pledges itself to resist the introduction of conscription by every possible means, and calls upon the Labour organizations to organize for a general strike throughout Australia in the event of a Conscription Bill being introduced. A movement for a general strike was started by the Industrial Workers of the W o r l d ; but it is to the credit of quite a number ,of unions that they refused to take part in it. The executive in, I think, three out of the six States, ordered a general strike.",57

417,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,"Nearl y 15,000 men for any of the fires? stopped work in Melbourne; but when they went to the Trades Hall to, hold a meeting, they could not get in, because .those in charge of the building were cele^ brating a stop-work day too. The strike was organized, but, to the credit of rank and file be it said, they did not obey their leaders concerning it. I have read the last extract to identify with the movement Mr T. Glynn, who signed the resolution as secretary. I shall again to him later. Some six or eight weeks ago I attended a meeting at South Melbourne to hear Mr Tom Barker speak. He and a number of Industrial Workers of the World members addressed the meeting. All of them audience to acts of violence, or told them to go slow, and gave other advice which was against the interests of the commuBarker. nity. I made the following note of what Mr Barker Said:I have been sentenced to four different of imprisonment of twelve months each since last January. ' I have been let out each time. The last to let me out was Senator Pearce. They dare not keep me in .gaol, as there are too many mysterious fires while I there. Inflammatory speeches were made by sent to Barkerothers, who said that they were members of the Industrial Workers of the World. The honourable member for Dalley, writr.ood luck to you. ing to Mr T. Glynn, of whom I have spoken, saidDear Glynn, I am glad to have your letter re Tom I am writing the Minister for Defence in matter, and shall also see him personally, [362] do everything possible to have Tom Barker out again. I think the jailing of men for speaking that which is within - them is most unjust, and should not be allowed in a free country.",58
418,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,"What is the matter with that? file - Mr SINCLAIR - Barke r has conthe fessed that he was sentenced four times into imprisonment for a term of twelve 1 months on each occasion for various serious offences; and he has boasted that he released on each occasion because the authorities were afraid to keep him in gaol' because too many mysterious fires took place while he was there. The man was justly sentenced, and yet the honourable member for Dalley says that he was",58
419,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,Does the honourable member suggest that I was responsible,58

422,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,"If the honourable member is responsible for any fire, perthe haps he will own up, and tell the House about it when I have finished my speech. I have not accused him of responsibility for a fire, but I accuse him of having tried to secure the release of a criminal who refer has caused a great deal of trouble,, and who shirks personal responsibility. The twelve men who were recently sentenced in Sydney to long terms of imprisonment bave suffered for putting the vicious doctrines of the Industrial Workers of the incited the World into practice.",58

424,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,"It was not this Government that released him; but,^if it terms were, two wrongs do not make a right. The time has arrived when disorder must be put down, with a strong hand. If the Prime Minister is not strong enough, I am hope that some one who is will take the matter in hand. This is another message I am with you right up to the hilt. I wish you could send me a copy of tliose posters, .ANSTEY. I do not know what the posters referred to were; but we have the honourable memBarker. ber for Bourke congratulating a conthis fessed criminal, saying that he is with and him "" right up to the hilt.""",58

432,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,"I do not wish to create any excitement. If the honourable member for Bourke can explain the letter I have read, I shall be pleased to hear the explanation. I do not wish to cast a slur upon any member; but when one member after another rises to defend the actions of the Industrial Workers of the World, I begin to suspect that they have some purpose in doing so. To show that at least some of the unions are in sympathy with this movement, I shall conclude by'reading a resolution that was passed by the East Woollahra Labour League only a few nights ago. This is the newspaper report of the proceedingsThe East Woollahra Labour League has unanimously carried two resolutions with regard to the recently-sentenced Industrial Workers of ' the World murderers at Tottenham, and the twelve men who were sent to gaol on Saturday. The first resolution pro- tested against the hanging of the two men I do not object to that, because, personally, I think we might, at least, let these men off without paying the extreme penalty. There are some who do not believe in capital punishment, and it would only be in extreme cases that I should resort to it , though, of course, crime should be punishedand the second urged the Political Labour League executive and sympathizers to take immediate action toexpress its opposition to the men being imprisoned. There we have sympathy expressed with men who have been punished for crimes attempted or committed on the . peaceful citizens of Australia. thing goes on, and is not checked by the authorities, we shall experience in Australia what was seen in America some time ago, when the citizens took the law into their own hands. Mob rule is at all times dangerous rule, and we must put on the statute-book measures to suppress this sort of thing, and not leave it to a few exasperated people, to shoot down their fellows because they think them guilty of crimes.",59
433,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,"Bourke) [9.191- I had not the slightest intention to speak because, whatever I may think on the question before us, I did not regard this an opportune time to discuss it generally. What brings me to my feet is the last portion of the speech of the honourable member who has just resumed his seat. That honourable gentleman has thought f it to interpolate on a Bill , and i h a debate of this character, a personal reference to myself- a reference that has no bearing, directly or indirectly, on the subject under discussion, which is that of unlawf u l associations and a method of dealing with them. But the honourable member has seen seen f it to introduce a letter which I wrote to, another person some time ago; and for what purpose is this done ? It has no bearing on the justification of or opposition to the measure. The only object he has in view is to seek to identify me as a public man with certain crimes which have been committed, or are alleged to have been committed. .Does the honourable member allege that I am identified with these crimes? If so, let him have the manhood to say so. Let him stand on his hind le,gs_and justify his cowardly and dastardly insinuation, which is unworthy of any one who desires to assume to himself the character of a man. Of course, a man may do an in j u r y to another unintentionally; but the honourable member cannot claim to have acted in ignorance. This imputation has been made before; but so clear and definite has been the denial that no one, even on the honourable member's own side, is unaware that the impression he wishes to convey is absolutely without foundation. Some two years ago this Parliament thought fit to pass a War Precautions Bill . Along with the honourable member for Ballarat, I saw fit to oppose many of the clauses on the ground that they were tyrannical. I said that under this pretence of defending the national interests, and protecting ourselves fro m enemies within our own If this borders, we were going to pass a Bill which would be utilized for the suppression of liberty of speech and the freedom of the press. The Prime Minister made a definite statement that the Bill would never be used for such purposes, and in his absence, the Minister for the Navy gave an equally clear and definite assurance to the same effect. On those statements, the majority of honourable members of the party then behind the Government were induced to support the measure. But as soon as it was brought into operation it was used throughout Australia for the suppression of free speech and the freedom of the press, and hardly any one of us who took a radical view on the question of the war was not subjected to it . Amongst the victims was a man named Thomas Barker. W it h what Barker was associated I knew nothing at the time; but he made a statement in the press to the effect that the capitalists ought to go to the war, and the working men would follow. That was his crime; he did no more. He was convicted, but he appealed to the High Court, and was set at liberty. There was a second charge, and again he was set at liberty by the Court. Who was the criminal? Was it not the H i gh Court? If I defended this man Barker, did not the High Court just if y my action ? My language and my sympathy were justified by the Courts of the country to which he appealed, and which set him free. What was the next offence that this man was""supposed to have committed ? He issue.d a cartoon of a soldier being crucified on a cannon wheel, and got twelve months for that. other day there appeared in the English newspapers complaints that Australian soldiers in England were being subjected to the ordeal of crucifixion. Was that not a justification of what Tom Barker did ? When the matter was brought UP in the House of Commons, Mr Lloyd George answered the question, not by a denial, but by a justification on the ground that this crucifixion of Australian soldiers by English officers was necessary, and not a cruelty. This man Barker committed three offences against the War Precautions Act ; and in regard to the last, so strong was the protest made, even by the daily press of the country, that the Government again set him free in response to the outcry. At that time. I had no knowledge that the Industrial Workers of the World was such an iniquitous organization. Until I was involved, and, for political purposes, identified with the [362]- 2 organization, I had hardly any knowledge of its existence j and even now I understand there are comparatively few members here. Indeed, had I been asked what was the difference between the Industrial Workers of the World and Syndicalism I could not have said. But the literature that has been quoted in this Chamber during this discussion will do more to raise in our young people an intense curiosity, and clo more propaganda work for the Industrial Workers of the World than anything else could. I am going to support this: Bill heartily. What else can I do? We are told clearly and distinctly that there is a crowd of criminals abroad in this country,' and that this organization has been in existence for ten years in New South Wales. Here, it appears, there is a band of murderers and crimwials. When did they start? It is said that their organization, their constitution, and their propaganda make them criminals. But they have been here ten years, and must haveTieen criminals from their introduction; and yet neither the Commonwealth nor the States have ever seen fit to take any action until it suited their political books. I have been in t i mately associated with the honourable gentlemen now behind the Government; and I know that the Prime Minister until he went to England to save the Empire, never exhibited any knowledge of, or raised any question in connection with the In dustrial Workers of the World . I hope however, to know something about this organization. I think it Is going to be a The boomerang, so far as my information goes; and that it will demonstrate one of the most odious conspiracies ever worked in this country, This is the greatest farce, and piece o:r political "" f l y - p a p e r"" ever put before a Parliament; there is nothing; in it . There are none of the crimes denounced that are not capable of being covered by the ordinary operation of the War Precautions Act. The Government do not propose to deal with the crimes under that measure, but, as they say, to do so openly. Why? As an advertisement, in the hope that somebody will be foolish enough to oppose it . We are told that the ordinary processes of the Courts are not sufficient to cover in citements to crime. What stuff-wha t piffle-to put before children! We are asked to believe that, after seventy years of constitutional government in the Australian States a man may go to another and offer him £ 5 0 or £ 1 0 0 to commit a murder, and that the ordinary processes of the Courts of the States are not suffiand cient to cover the crime. The thing is an absurdity. To murder is a crime, and incite to murder is a crime; and there is power to punish both acts in the ordinary Criminal Courts of the States; and so with the crime of inciting; to destroy perty by fire or otherwise, whether the incitement be by money or threats. a mere bogy and sham to say otherwise, in the community. and it demonstrates the Government's sincerity in the objects they have in'view. It is, as I say, absurd to suggest that public have no power to protect selves against such crimes. And, for how long is this Bill to be in operation We are told, as I say, that these criminals have been in the country, for,ten without discovery until now; and, if be so, ought not the community guarded against Jthem for ever. how long, I ask, it is to be guarded? Until the war finishes? No. Until the elections are over. If the, elections next year, or if the war finishes, as we told by the Prime Minister that it is to against them. finish, next June, that will close operation of this measure. be the final stages of it. Australia to be protected ? The States have no means to protect themselves, we are told. This Bill is the only means by which we can protect them, and it is only going to protect the community till next June, till the end of the war; and after that the community is to be left more afc the mercy of this group of assassins. We ore asked that unless this Federal takes the action indicated in this Bill, the community will have no power to protect itself. There is not one but knows very well that it is within sovereign power of the States that community is able to protect itself only from crime but from incitement crime, and that this Bill is pure piffle. We are told that the Government will dewith these charges. port people, and that the Workers of the World are murderers and criminals. They may be; therefore let exterminate them. They committed sorts of offences. They cut some of wires on HMAS. Brisbane. other day that there was another fire Sydney. The only unfortunate thing that the fire was too late to serve the vernment's purpose, and the boys caused it were caught. Papa's was not too good, and the boys were Mr Anstey. anxious to help papa, so they laid at r a p ; when they were taken into court they, , said that they thought the fire would be to attributed to the Industrial Workers of the World.' There are periods in the history of every organization in every country when it becomes judicious and advisproable in the interests of the governing class to allege against that organization It is every crime and every offence committed Another business inbuilding went up by fire the other day. It was a "" b r u m m y "" business. The the shares had dropped from 19s. to 9s. The thempremises went up in flames. 'Again the then, Industrial Workers, of the World were ? ' accused. We were told that a Government agent was shot, and the honourable years member for .Flinders asked where this that had happened. The reply was, "" Never to be mind where. Yours not to reason why, But yours but to believe it . "" We were told that these Industrial Workers of the World are walking abroad in the comare munity with automatic revolvers in their are pockets, and nobody is taking any action Despite the unlimited the powers conferred by the War Precautions That will Act, and the fact that this organization How is has been in existence for ten years, and that its crime is established, not in its offences but in its propaganda, and in the preamble to its constitution, nothing was done to suppress it . If it was a criminal organization, action should have been taken years ago, but no action was taken once until there was a political end to be served. Every State has the power to preto believe serve itself against crime, and the instigaParliament tion to crime; but this Bill has no other purpose but to serve a political end. It is a trap set to catch flies. Let no man of us enter up his judgment too rashly in this the mattei'. The day is coming when men the in this Chamber, when the daily press, not and the community generally will come to round to an entirely different opinion as to what .were the operations in connection They will come to Industrial recognise to what extent the prosecution of these men was an organized crime for us the purpose of serving political ends. The all use of telegraphs and telephones, and the the ringing up of the officials to "" hurry I read the up with the trial "" are happenings which in have yet to be disclosed. We shall yet was hear more' of the instruction, "" WhatsoGoever these men do, let it be given pubwho licity and charged up to this Departbusiness ment."" Here are facts which all men and women who are unbiased and desire only justice must face: A number of men-the e Australians, two Englishmen, two Scotchmen, two Irishmen, one Canadian, and one Russian-were charged with various offences. What is the f u n damental principle of British justice? Is it not that nothing shall be said against accused persons while their case is before the Courts of the country ? . Do you, Mr . Speaker, know of' any case in the history of Australia in which a body of men were charged with an offence, when justice, moved, apparently without anybody pushing it from behind, with such rapid feet from the time of the commission of the crime, to the display of the evidence for the prosecution ? Do you know of a case, sir, in which, the accused men had so littl e of the evidence in their defence furnished to the daily press? Do you know of any case since the war started in which the censorship was so rigidly exercised to prevent the public mind forming any belief that the men had a defence at all? Contemplate the spectacle of four men, witnessses for the prosecution, walking into court and taking a solemn oath that on a certain date they saw a certain man in a certain place; and it was proved that on the day when he was alleged to have been in this place . in association with other men, it was absolutely a physical impossibility for him to have been there, ' because the evidence showed that he ' Long Bay gaol on another And when it was proved that those four witnesses for the Crown had conspired to commit perjury, the Judee, this fountain-head of justice, permitted them to sit down in Court and change the date from the day in respect of which an alibi had been proved to another day. Can you call that a Court of justice? Think of the case of the man MCPherson, who was working in a ship's hold. MCAlister, a police agent, a mere phizgig, comes along and says to MCPherson, "" I have become a convert to the gospel of the Industrial Workers of the World."" "" Have you?""- says MCPherson; ""come along to our ofiice, and I will give you a dose of fire dope."" "" What will I do with it?"" "" B u r n something, or somebody; anything, anybody."" And all the time detectives are watching. MCPherson does not hide his actions from anybody. But after getting the fire dope, stands in the open street and there discloses, under the view of the detectives, how to use the material. Under cross-examination, the witnesses were asked, "" What was the date, and what was the time?"" They mentioned the date.and the time. Then the wharfinger and the time-sheets were produced, and they proved that on the day and at the time stated MCPherson was working in the ship's hold. When the evidence for the prosecution could no longer stand, when even the Judge could not escape from the alibi, he said, "" Anybody is liable to make a mistake,"" and allowed the prosecution to change the date. That is but typical of many features in connection with the evidence. Goldstein was another man who, the Court was told, went into the office to get fire dope, and operated it in the public street. In the lower Court the evidence of witnesses under cross-examination proved them to be in conflict with one another, and the censorship was used to prevent the men's defence being given' to the public. On top of that, we had the crowning crime of crimes, a thing unknown in the history of this country or of Great Britain , when the man who represented the Government of the country was walking up and down the Commonwealth while these men were on trial, and speaking of them as criminals condemned by. a Court of law. Do you, Mr Speaker, know of any such parallel case? I say was in there never was such a case in this councharge. try. The Prime Minister, who held in himself the agency of justice, who controlled the reins of government, who, by his belief in a God, by his oath to his K in g, by his obligation to the country, by his pledge to hold the scales of justice evenly, and by every sense of honour and obligation which a man in his position should respect, was bound to be silent while those men were yet to be heard and condemned, was attacking the in on every platform. What man can endorse conduct and procedure of that kind ? . How could any man expect justice from tha Courts of the country? How could he be sure that the j u r y would walk into the Court unbiased? What is the reason for silence in regard to the case of a man undergoing trial? Why .is it that the Courts and the law of the country, and rhe. common principles of honour and decency, demand that we shall be silent, and by no public speech or writin g prejudge any man unheard ? It is that the j u r y shall walk into the box with an open - : mind. The press are not allowed to comment on a case, and if a newspaper does do so it is immediately brought to book before the Judge for contempt of Court. There are few men in this who would descend to the tactics adopted by the Prime Minister, and very few men who would be permitted to do so. His actions were without parallel. not go into the.case.in detail; but I say, deliberately, that for the deepest-dyed scoundrel amongst those men, dissatisfied as they were with their economic condition, suffering from poverty of mind and body, and possessed of a warped some excuse may be found, but what excuse can there be for a man, able-bodied, excellent in intellect, and in a position to hold evenly the scales of justice, who would so abuse the trust reposed in him as did the Prime Minister during the referendum campaign?' His was the greatest crime of crimes, and whatever the crime those other men committed, it sinks into insignificance alongside violation of the principles of British law, under which alone our Courts can give a guarantee of justice. I had not the slightest intention of saying a word on this Bill had it not been that the honourable member for Moreton dragged in a reference to me. I need not defend myself in any shape or form, but let me say finally, "" Where stands this organization ?"" Somebody mentioned that one of the. reasons for the Independent Workers' ob-. jection to political action ,was that so many workmen go into politics and then become conceited. Against the natural conservatism of certain factions, wealthy and the opulent, the squattocraey on the one hand and the moneyocracy on the other, there stands a class of men who, drawn out of the ranks of the working classes, elevated tions and given honour, place, and pay, grow careless and and the world looks brighter, they become more indifferent the days .when they battled So there begins a policy of protest and penetration in the different unions, which, 'after all, are being used as mere instruments to satisfy the political ambitions of myself or some other person. tical purposes, we say that we have no objection to these political organizations. How long are they to continue to be lifted up, only to be thrown down and cursed Mr Anstey. i : 1 after serving our ends? So it is that, in these organizations, there grow up bodies of dissatisfied men, who draw themselves together by their dissatisfaction and comcommunity mon faith. The honourable member for Darling Downs brought forward to-night a book entitled New Unionism. The phrase "" New Unionism "" is not new. I I shall heard it applied twenty-five and t h i r t y years ago. What did it mean in those days? It meant a little group of men who believed, not in direct action as accepted by the organization referred to so much to-night, but in political action, and in the utilization of the old powers of intellect, unionism in order that their aims and objectives might be realized. In those days we experienced the same hostility and heard the same denunciations. There is hardly anything said in connection with the Industrial Workers of the World today that, was not said about many of ustwenty-five or thirty years ago. In the "" middle ages "" of unionism in Australia, I was associated with the Seamen's ISnion this in Queensland, and with the wharf labourers and coal lumpers in New South Wales, and I was associated with the waterside workers in Victoria in the nineties. I know the position then; how we set to work to penetrate the old forms of organization; how we denounced the old section of the unions as fossils; and how they denounced us as extremists; and how the press, in the very language of the right honourable member for Parramatta today, talked of "" properly conducted unionism."" Twenty-five years ago, properly conducted unions were those which went the same old way, never advancing, never progressing, and included those who were opposed to the political activity in any form. In thismovement today there is growing up a party of protest, probably seen to its greatest extent in America, but existing also in Australia. We think that we can into posi- annihilate it . We may annihilate institutions, but we cannot annihilate ideals. We indifferent, may exterminate the particular form of and the organization, but the ideals of the than in organization will develop, in some form or another, as a protest against the inactivity outside. of those who stand here today elevated by the ranks of the working classes, and drawn from the working classes. God knows what many of us would have been but for this opportunity. We pride ourselves on For poli- what we could have done if we had not been pushed into our positions through the support of the organizations and their members; yet here we stay, year after year; and how far do we endeavour to utilize our powers for the purpose of realizing for the masses of those things we profess on the public plat- form'(It is the same old thing as was .said of the Whigs and Tories. "" Alike in baseness, when out of power both professing that which they never attempted to do when in power."" And so, as there arose against both Whigs and Tories a cry of protestation from the working classes, there arises today against all political parties, Labour or Liberal, Radical or Conservaing tive, a cry of protest from a very earnest - section of the community. Whether i be right or wrong in its methods-ver often it is wrong, and very often violent in its activities-the protest is that men who have come to be dissatisfied those whom they havelifted to high places, and fro m whom they have got little - or no return. The Bill before us can nothing. It can avail nothing, because is a mere political sham. And so there no sound reason for objecting to it.. I achieve nothing. What it professes - achieve can be achieved by the War cautions Act. I do not say that the Government should not use the War Precautions Act for that purpose. Let it not be - said that I object to that course, for I say blind as those who will not see. that it can be done, and that the Governbriefly, ment have ample power to deal with this matter. I rose first of all for the purpose - of dealing with the speech of the honorin able member for Moreton, and secondly, in order to point out that the Bill mere farce. It is a sham, brought ward merely for political purposes; it js a £100. trap for catching flies, if there are foolish enough to be caught by it ; i - brought forward in the hope that honorthan able members sitting in the Corner would denounce it , and thus be. identified i certain way, as the honourable member for Moreton has attempted to identify me, of imprisonment was reduced to three with a man who committed an honest months, crime. Just a last word to the honourable members of the Opposition, with whom have nothing in common. Let them not 'be too ready to assume that everything - on the surface as it appears in Sydney; let them keep their minds open to the touch of ' justice,"" which, after all, rises above all differences, whether of creeds of political controversies. That is have to'say on this particular matter.",59
434,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,"Dalley) [9.51] I have but one or two words to say, and results. they have been occasioned by the most - contemptible action of the honourable member for Moreton: in reading a letter of the people mine in this Chamber.",64
435,Mr SPE AKER,Unknown,"The lionorable member must withdraw that remark. Mr MAHONY' - Ver y well, Mr . Speaker, I withdraw it ; but it is a matter . for extreme regret that, - when certain men were placed on their trial for an offence, letters which were used in the preliminary proceedings, and had absolutely no bearon the proceedings before the Court, were afterwards published broadcast, as t was done during the referendum campaign y by men of the type of mentality of the honourable member for Moreton, whereas of those who mentioned the matter on public with platforms did not have the ordinary honesty, not to talk of decency, to make any reference to my reply to the letter do the honourable member read, which was it published in all the Sydney morning is newspapers. And to-night the honourable t can member for Moreton has read my letter, to but very cunningly and very subtly has Prerefrained from giving the reply.",64
436,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,I never saw it .,64
437,Mr MAHONY,Unknown,"There are none so This, was the nature of my reply: I had received a communication in reference to a parson named Barker, who was gaol for having committed an offence which, in my opinion, did not warrant is a the sentence imposed, namely, twelve formonths' imprisonment, with a fine of The offence was the issuing of a any pamphlet. At election times I have seen t is pamphlets issued a thousand times worse this, and, showing that I was not singular in the opinion I held that the ofn a fence did not warrant the extraordinary penalty imposed, I may say that the term k and the fine to £ 2 5 - not by myself, but by the 'Government led by the I Hon. W . M . Hughes., That was my reply. I know none of the members of the is Industrial Workers of the World . I have had no connection with them or with their organization, and I do not propose to have any connection with their class of thought. or The difference between the principles of all I the Industrial Workers of the Worldand those of the Labour party as we know it in politics today is fundamental. The Labour party believes in political action - and the evolutionary process for achieving The Industrial Workers of the World discards political action, and believes in direct action. I cannot accept that school of thought, nor follow it in any way. I trust that public men will at least endeavour not to try to take away the characters of other public men merely to gain for themselves some little political advantage. I regard as a direct reflection on my personal character this attempt to connect me with the Industrial Workers of the World , and I invite the honourable member for Moreton, and any one else who shares the views he expressed, to speak in the same way outside, and see what will happen. grading that we, the elected representatives of the people in the National Parliament, cannot carry on our discussions without getting down to the level of endeavouring in an insidious way to connect, each other with some criminal act that may be committed outside. same attempt was made in my own electorate during the recent referendum. Those who resorted to it , however, found 'that it was a dog that would not bite. The people in my electorate gave a majority of about. 10,000 votes for the side which I advocated. That was their reply, and tliey will give the same answer at the next general election-it is immaterial to me when it comes-to any f u r ther attempt to resort to such' tactics. . Mr HUGHES (Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [9.57] - I do not wish to detain the House at any length, but I should like to reply to one or two observations made by the honourable member for Bourke in reference to this Bill . I pass by all those allusions to members of the Industrial Workers of the World , the in justice that has been meted out to them, and the suggestion-it was more than a suggestion-that those men were the victims, of a plot-that , in effect, they did not set fire to any buildings in Sydney'; that they were merely the innocent, although strangely pliant tools of paid agents of the Government, police, or some other; that they, poor, innocent fools, placed this phosphorus, or whatever it was, where they did at the bidding of these agent provocateurs, and were amazed at the result! I pass all these things by. I confess I cannot swallow the story. It is too great a d r a f t upon .my credulity. Certainly it will not explain away the death of that unfortunate man who was foully murdered. Was that, too, a plot? Were they egged on by the police to k ill a member of the police force? Did they think that by blowing out his brains-givin g him not as much chance as one would give to a clay pigeon-the y were furthering the great interests that they professed to have at heart? Is it by such means that the Labour movement has been raised, and that the workers in this country have come to great power ? Emphatically no! I am very sorry to have listened to my impressionable friend advocating, if not the cause, the claims of these men. It is It is de- his heart that speaks, not his head; in this matter he is carried away on the wings of his emotion. I am sorry for it . As far as his reference to the welfare of the people is concerned, I am. perfectly content to point to one fact which will bear - criticism. It is this: That of the The two methods which are available to ameliorate the conditions of men, the one I have steadily followed throughout the whole of my public life, that of political action, is infinitely the better. It is not only compatible with democratic and lawf u l government, but it produces infinitely better results. Erom it I have never deviated. I do not believe in "" direct a c t i o n "" ; that is to say, in "" for c e , "" as a means of improving the lot of the people in a country like this, where the laws are made by the whole' people, and where political action is more effective than anything else. I have never once since I first came into public l if e led a union into a strike. I have endeavoured in every way to prevent, not only direct action such as is here spoken of, but direct action of any sort or kind. As to the advantages of that policy there are the organizations to speak for themselves. I come now to this Bill . The honourable member said, "" It effects no purpose. It is a political placard, and is unnecessary."" The honourable member does not understand what he is speaking about. There is no law now to deal with men who incite to crime generally. There is a law to deal with men who incite to crime particularly. If I shall get on a stump and incite some one to murder a particular man, or some particular men, then I am liable. If I shall incite'a man to - injure some particular man or men, then I am liable. But I may incite men with absolute impunity to injure mankind generally. If I shall incite men to commit arson with respect to any parfcicular building, I am liable. But I may incite men to commit arson generally, and except for some antiquated under which I may be indicted for treason against the Government, or for sedition, no law can touch me. This Bill deals with circumstances as they now exist. It deals with propaganda, with doctrines, with acts, for which there is no effective remedy to our hands. It deals with the trouble before it reaches the magnitude of a crime. It nips it in the bud. It says that any man who shall incite another to destroy or injur e human l if e, or to destroy or injur e property, shall be guilty of an offence. It does not penalize him for mere membership of an association, for his beliefs, for his opinions, but only for his acts. It cannot be said of this Bill that it errs on the side of severity. It proposes as a penalty for any of these offences six months' imprisonment. That is the maximum. I do not deny that we might have taken action under the War Precautions Act. We might have dealt with the matter by regulation. Will any man say-th' e honourable member for Bourke did not-that that would be the better way ? It is the worse way. Such a regulation could have been disallowed. In all human possibility, at all events, it would have evoked as much discussion .as this measure has done. The Bill deals in a straightforward way with a menace to society, whose gravity cannot be exaggerated. All this that we have listened to is by the way. If this association began and ended with these men who have been convicted, whether rightly or wrongly, it would be' a small matter. But I say deliberately that the virus that has emanated from that source has spread among the body politic until now we are confronted with a condition not unlike that which would befall a country in the grip of a great epidemic. We are dealing with it in the only possible way. Although there is much provocation, I shall refrain from saying anything furthe r except to add that the Bill deals with a real and a grave menace. It deals with it in a direct fashion, . in a manner which challenges criticism. It is a measure which should commend itself to every section of the House, and I hope and believe that it will receive the support of every honourable member. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Statute In Committee:",64
438,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"Is it the pleasure of the Committee that I put the Bill as a whole? HONOBAB.LE MEMBEBS - Hear , hear! The Bill . . Mr BURNS (Illawarra ) [ 1 0 . 7 ] - I should like an explanation of clause 5. There are' members of the Industrial Workers of the World who have distributed themselves among certain unions. I wish to know whether, if a member of the Industrial Workers of the Worl d was also a member of a trade union, and did any of the things set out in this clause, would that union be an unlawful association ?",66
439,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"West Sydney-Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [10.9]. - I would refer the honourable member to clause 3, which providesThe following are hereby declared to be unlawful associations, namely:(a) The association known as the Industrial Workers of the World; and (6) any association, which, by its constitution or propaganda, advocates or. encourages, or incites or instigates to the taking or endangering of human life, or the destruction or injury of property. Now, clause 5 says ""whoever, being a member^ of an unlawful association."" It does not say ""whoever being a member of any association."" If the honourable member will turn to the Bill , he will find that before clause 5 can operate a man must first come within the provisions of clause-3. Take the case of a trade union. Is there any union of which the honourable member knows, which by its constitution or propaganda, does any of the things set out in clause 3? I do not know of any. Sub-clause (b) of that clause was in serted in order to meet a possible case in which the Industrial Workers of the World might change its name. . That is all. If the honourable member will look at it in that light he will see that if Jones were a member of the Waterside Workers and also a member of the Industrial Workers of the World, the mere fact of his membership with the latter would not affect the Waterside Workers Federation.",66
440,Mr BOYD,Unknown,Henty) [10.11] - Will the Prime Minister be good enough to explain the reason for providing in clause 2 that this Act shall continue in operation for six months after the war ancl no longer?,66
441,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"""West Sydney-Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [10.12]. - That provision was put in the Bill because, practically, all legislation since the commencement of the war has contained a similar provision. But I have not the slightest objection to knocking it out. Mr. JOSEPH COOK; -""What would be the effect of knocking it out?",67
442,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,The Act would then last for ever and ever.,67

445,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"It is so long since the question of our constitutional limitations arose, that, for the moment, I am not prepared to say. There was a time 1 in this chamber when we were accustomed to ask whether we had the power to do certain things. Now we merely ask if we are going to do them. It is very probable that the honourable member for Darling Downs is right, and if so, that would be a sufficient answer to the honourable member for Henty. Apart from the preamble, I think that our general powers would be sufficient to enable us to pass such a Bill as this in ordinary times.",67

449,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"West Sydney-Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [10.14]. - I hope that the honourable member will not press his proposal. It may happen that the Bill will require amendment. I would not be the first Bill of that kind, and, in any case, any Parliament can we re-enact it.

450,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Hunter) ri0.161 To my mind, a Bill dealing with offences, so serious as those against which this provides should make them indictable, so that offenders might be tried before juries of their own countrymen. It is a seriousthing to permit the crimes herein provided against to be dealt with by summary jurisdiction, because it will allow men, some of whom are not capable cf.dealing with such cases, to adjudicate upon them. I say that without wishing to reflect in any way upon the justices of the peace.",67
451,Mr WISE,Unknown,An ordinary justice of the* peace cannot try the offences provided against.,67
452,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"In any case, I think that offenders should be tried before juries of their own countrymen.' It is the basic principle of British jurisprudence that every man must be tried by his peers. This legislation takes away that right. Very often, when offences of the kind provided against occur, public opinion is* in a state of fever, and this is likelv to prejudice an offender before his trial. The only hop© for liim under such circumstances is trial before a jury. Bill agreed to, and reported without amendment; report adopted. Standing Orders suspended, and Bill .read a third time.

The day will commence an hour earlier from the passing of the Act u n t i l the last Sunday in March, when we shall go back to the present standard time. But at 2 o'clock in the morning of the first Sunday in October our clock time will again be an hour in advance of standard time.

Clause 12 is the most i m portant. It shows what class of entertainments are exempt. Clause 13 provides for tihe refund of the tax in certain cases. Part 3 deals with offences, and gives power to enter places of entertainment. The penalties for offences against that section and the next are money penalties. Clause 16 defines certain other offences, amongst them being that of forging a die or stamp,' or printing or making any impression with a forged die, or fraudulently printing or making any impression from a genuine die. The penalty under that clause is imprisonment for fourteen years. Clause 17 deals with the seriou» offence of making paper in imitation of stamp paper, the penalty being seven years. Clause 18 deals also with - an indictable offence-the unlawful possession of stamp paper. Part 4 gives power i o search premises and issue regulations.

465,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The trouble is that not enough men are employed to tend to the people. Instead of paying an extra staff to handle the people, just the ordinary staff is employed, with the result that women have to stand around for hours before they get their allotment money. I urge the Minister to give his attention to the Sydney office, where the same trouble obtains. This state of affairs does not reflect any credit on the Department. Mr TUDOR, (Yarra) [10.46] -- I am not sure whether this matter is in the hands of the Assistant Minister of Defence or the Treasurer, but I fancy it is under the Treasurer. The pensions, I know, are under the Treasury, and I brought it under the notice, not only of the honourable member for Capricornia, but also of the former member for Wide Bay. I visited the offices, and found out the position for myself. At Richmond post-office over 2,000 persons receive allotment money or pensions on account of the war. The other three offices do not do anything like the same amount of business. I fancy , that the actual payments are not made at the Richmond post-office, but the people go up to a hall for their money, and I am not sure whether they are all paid on one particular day. suggest, however, that the Treasurer or the Assistant Minister should go to some of the places in the larger suburbs, such as Brunswick, Rich mond, or South Melbourne, where big payments are made. In regard to the old age pensioners, I know there is a difficulty, because, unfortunately, the old people will wait on the doorsteps of the post offices for two hours before the post-office is opened. If some structural alterations could be made in the offices by providing better exits, a l o t of the crushing that at presents exists would be done away K avy with. The honourable member for Parrai m - matta and the honourable member - for f a w k n e r will agree that if the Minister will only visit M e or two of the offices on a busy day, when the old-age pensions, or soldiers' allotment money is being paid, will realise the urgency for some i m stand around provement being made. Mr Laird SMITH . (Denison-Assist a ant Minister for Defence) [10.481 - I thank honourable members for the in for sysmation fhey have conveyed to me to night, and I promise them. I shall l o o t into the matter, with a view to remedying at the complaint as early as .possible. Question resolved in the affirmative. ' Honse adjourned at 10.49. v I",70
