I have been approached by a person who is a quadriplegic. In approaching me, this client-and I will give his name: it is a Mr In 1991 he was awarded a lump sum to pay institution. He does not want to go into environment. Mr Sinibaldi is a quadriplegic. He has no arms and hands. He is immobile, other than wheelchair. He relies totally on carers for his and out of bed, drinking, turning over. As values his independence. He likes to be at home; he recognises and accepts that he has care care for 24 hours, but he simply cannot afford it. There are two issues at stake which I want look at these issues and perhaps at some later back to me. If he cannot come back to me appreciate the minister's views on the things whether Mr Sinibaldi should be entitled to a or whether he should only receive the current over and above expenditure of about $1,250 a issue is that the cost of providing amenities nor an allowable tax deduction. I simply ask perhaps he might be able to take them on board. But in developing the argument about the first tax deductible, I will just say this: Mr Sinibaldi's sufficient income to meet his expenses, and these wages are $75,000 per annum. Costs for carers' annum. His personal living costs are about annum. The generation of this income means that marginal rate of 49.6 per cent, which is inclusive his income. The income generated goes, in the income and, in turn, the carers pay tax on their claim a rebate of 20c against his medical costs. income tax liability on the bulk of his income. liability of about $35,000 each year. He has that liability because he is a quadriplegic generate a lot of income to cover those costs-something MAIN COMMITTEE 4127 real problems and some of the people that government's neglect in this area. those raised by others. I want to refer to parts minor technical amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. In my view, these go through them and explain why I am saying provides some financial support to a person who person has outlined to me how this particular Dario Sinibaldi-requires care around the clock. for his cost of living independently from an an institution; he prefers to stay in a home use of his feet or legs and very little use of his through the use of an electronically controlled every requirement: feeding, bathing, getting into I said, my constituent chooses to live alone. He he does not want to be in an institution. But for about 18 out of 24 hours. He probably needs to develop. I simply ask the minister to have a stage of this debate he might be able to come today, I would accept that, but I would really that I am about to outline. The first issue is tax deduction for his cost of employing carers, available rebate, which is 20 cents in the dollar year-I am not certain of that figure. The other for carers is currently subject to neither a rebate that the minister have a look at these issues and issue, which is that carers' wages should be funds are carefully invested, so as to produce expenses are quite considerable. His carers' amenities are in the vicinity of $2,340 per $20,000 per annum. That amounts of $97,340 per my constituent is liable to pay tax at the top of the Medicare levy on nearly $50,000 of main, to pay his carers. He pays tax on that earnings. As I understand it, he is entitled to That only partly defrays the 49.6 per cent He is left with a situation where he has a tax who requires care.

Going back to the rebate, it seems that the compensating people for medical costs without probably also implemented without thought for but with bracket creep affecting tax on earnings clearly the rebate does not fairly compensate medical expenses. As my constituent was awarded his lump sum only fair that he be given an opportunity to those funds largely being absorbed in taxes. Speaker, and it seems that in the foreseeable the sort of income that he requires to live independently to happen is that he is going to find himself, relying on some other public monies to enable That is why I am saying that parts 2, technical amendments to the Income Tax Assessment is why I want to take this opportunity during a look at the issues that I am raising. We negate a whole lot of problems further down the track. In relation to my constituent, carers come are in the house for four hours in the morning. for 24 hours but it is just not something he can related to the cost of his carers. More depreciated would relate to use and wear and The expenses attached to the day-today requirements of his medical carer costs. While this is generated to pay these costs attracts the top expenses are purely the result of his need for to either the medical rebate or treated as a tax would not be incurred. I will give you an itemisation of these costs the house overnight, every night, which means of carers. Each carer requires freshly laundered meal and a morning shower. Expenses relating are: laundry goods; wear and tear on the washing and fruit et cetera; and cooking utensils He goes on to tell me that there needs months, for example, three sets of sheets and and other bedroom items require replacement require replacement probably on a 10-year or Tuesday, 23 March 1999 I spoke. Of course, he also needs to generate personal living expenses. I might say that while lives quite frugally. I have actually visited him he simply has to. You, Mr Deputy Speaker, would economic environment to generate that sort rebate was conceived as being a fair method of encouraging unnecessary spending. It was people in my particular constituent's situation, and with the continually rising cost of living, people with higher incomes required to meet to enable him to live independently, it seems use his funds for that purpose rather than seeing He is currently eating into his capital, Mr Deputy future he is going to find it harder to generate and to pay his carers. What is going if he is not cautious, back in an institution or him to ha""e the sort of care that he wants. 3 and 4 of schedule 1, which make these minor Acts do not really go far enough. That this debate to get the minister to perhaps have all know that five minutes prevention can often in for 18 of the 24 hours per day, and two carers As I said, he would really like to have care afford. The cost of running his home is largely than half of all household items consumed and tear by carers for their own reasonable amenity. of the carers are simply an extension only $2,340 per annum, the income that must be marginal tax rate, as I have explained. As these care, perhaps this item should also be subject deductible item because without carers the costs as they were presented to me.

Mr Fahey-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The above land was transferred to the State of Western Australia for the sum of 21,905 pounds, by an Instrument of Transfer dated 21 July 1964. (2) (a) The initial agreement, by exchange of letters, set out the condition 'that the said land be set aside for all time for use as an ""A"" Class Reserve for public open space and police purposes'. The Instrument of Transfer is less emphatic and states that 'the land was to be set aside for the purposes of public open space and for Police purposes'. Neither the exchange of correspondence nor the Instrument of Transfer requires Commonwealth agreement should the use of the land be varied. (b) Yes. (i) In October 1997 the Western Australian Government asked for the cooperation of the Commonwealth to waive the 'perpetual reserve' condition over the Police Academy site that was included in the original exchange of letters. In July 1998 the Commonwealth agreed on condition that any rezoning/redevelopment proposal for the site will be subject to the normal processes of community consultation and environmental assessment, and the approval of all relevant authorities. (ii) State Governments have statutory responsibilities for determining land use.

The following VIews were recorded in the minutes of the 24 July 1997 meeting. Issues to be considered for virus-resistant transgenic plants include: (i) recombination, potentially resulting in new virus types with increased host range or virulence. As a general principle, only the minimum viral sequence necessary to produce viral resistance should be inserted. . (ii) tran-capsidation (the possibility that a dIfferent VIruS could encapsulate itself in the transgenic coat protein); (iii) spread of trans genes by sap sucking insects acting as virus vectors; and (iv) transfer of plant viruses via seeds. (b) These views do not conflict with the conclusions of the GMAC Scientific Subcommittee made at their r August 1997 meeting reported in part (3) of the.answer to question No. 2918.

Tasmania: Mining (Question No. 324) Mr Sidebottom asked the Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, upon notice, on 9 December 1998: Following the Government's provision of a $40 million package of incentives for the Tumut pulp mill in southern New South Wales, will the Minister communicate directly with the Tasmanian Government and Crest Resources to offer a similar support pacI(age to allow a proposed magnesite mining and processing proposal in Tasmania to proceed. Mr Moore-The Minister for Industry, Science and Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: The Government in its industry policy statement Investing for Growth released in December 1997 stated that it was not disposed towards providing across the board investment incentives for major projects or establishing a dedicated fund for that purpose. The Government did acknowledge however, that in particular limited and special circumstances which meet established criteria there may be a need for some specific assistance. The criteria for investment incentives were published in Investing for Growth. The Government also established the position of the Strategic Investment Coordinator to coordinate case by case assessment of projects to determine any need for investment incentives. I am aware that there are a number of investment proposals seeking to establish magnesite mining and processing operations in Australia-two in Tasmania and a number of others throughout Australia. All of these projects, including Crest Resources, are entitled to seek assistance under current government programs. I understand that the Deputy Premier of Tasmania has met with my colleague the Minister for Transport and Regional Services to ascertain what assistance may be available to this project under current government programs. The Government encourages this approach before a company formally applies for an investment incentive. The honourable member will recall that the majority of the investment incentive package provided to Visy was from existing programs. In the event that assistance cannot be provided through existing Government programs the company is entitled to submit a proposal for investment incentives to the Strategic Investment Coordinator. All proposals will be considered on their merits and against the published investment incentives criteria.

Mr Reith-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I have intervened in various proceedings related to the dispute at the Hunter Valley No.1 mine to put submissions on behalf of the Commonwealth about the proper construction of the termination of bargaining period provisions of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (the Act). (2) The unions and the NSW Government argued before the Australian Industrial Relations Comrnission (AIRC) that the bargaining periods should be terminated under S.170MW(3) (b) of the Act in that it was alleged that the industrial action was threatening significant damage to the economy. (3) Justice Boulton concluded that the industrial action at the mine was threatening to cause significant damage to an important part of the Australian economy. (4) The ground in s.170MW(3) of the Act relating to damage to the economy as a ground for terminating a bargaining period is an exception to the policy intent of the Act. This is to ensure that the primary responsibility for determining employment matters rests with employers and employees at the workplace level. The public interest is served by ensuring that there are only limited exceptions to employers and employees being able to determine their own employment arrangements. (5) The consequence of Justice Boulton's decision to terminate the bargaining periods under s.170MW(3) of the Act is that the Commission must exercise conciliation powers. If the conciliation is not successful in resolving matters between the parties then a Full Bench of the AIRC must exercise arbitration powers. Arbitration has not occurred because the matter has been subject to appeal to the Full Bench of the AIRC and has been subject to prerogative writs issued by the Federal Court of Australia. (6) I exercised my statutory right of intervention in appeals before the Full Bench of the AIRC. (7) Yes. I find the inference contained in this question and its relationship to previous and subsequent questions offensive and insulting to the AIRC and its office holders. (8) A Full Bench of the AIRC constituted by Justice Giudice, Justice Munro and Commissioner Larkin unanimously quashed Justice Boulton's decision. (9) Justice Giudice's decision in overturning Justice Boulton's decision was made on the basis of a finding that Justice Boulton's interpretation of S.170MW(3) involved error in the construction and application of the section. (10)The Federal Court issued a writ of certiorari to the Full Bench of the AIRC and in so doing quashed its decision. The Federal Court also issued a writ of mandamus to the Full Bench of the AIRC directing them to proceed to deal with the appeal in accordance with law. That appeal is continuing. (11 ) Yes. I exercised a statutory right for a review under s.109 of the Act for a review of Justice Boulton's decision. This application was made on the basis that the decision was contrary to the public interest. An application was also made to the AIRC to extend time to enable the application to be brought, as the application had been lodged out of time. On 18 February 1999, the AIRC Full Bench refused the application to extend time. (12) Yes. (Question No. 413) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 11 February 1999: (1) Has his attention been drawn to the statement in the National Competition Council's report entitled Some impacts on society and the economy that groups who become exposed to competition after previously being sheltered are often very vocal about explaining, and in some cases exaggerating, the potential costs to them about the loss of privileges. (2) Is it a fact that operators of newsagencies are exaggerating the costs of reform to them and that existing arrangements are simply a privilege.",135
11,Mr HOWARD,CSIRO,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. (2) The ACCC is consulting stakeholders about the recent decision of the Australian Competition Tribunal on newsagents. It will report to the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation on the outcome of these consultations by the end of March 1999. This report· will be carefully considered by the Government in the light of its commitment to ensure the maintenance of an efficient, low cost home delivery system for newspapers. Multilateral Agreement on Investment (Question No. 423) Mr Sidebottom asked the Minister representing the Assistant Treasurer upon notice, on 15 February 1999: (1) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to an article in the Australian Financial Review of 3 November 1998 entitled ""Multilateral investment pact on ice"" in which it is claimed that the Government hoped that the Multilateral Agreement on Investment (MAl) would be revived. (2) Is it a fact that Australian OECD negotiators in Paris sought the paring back of the MAl to its core elements; if so, what are the core elements. (3) Did the OECD, in a press release dated 3 December 1998, confirm that negotiations on the MAl were no longer taking place but that OECD officials agreed on the importance of multidisciplinary work on the desirability of establishing international rules for investment. (4) Has the Minister undertaken to carefully consider the Government's approach to further agreement on international investment rules; if so, what criteria would apply to the consideration. Mr Costello-The answer to the honourNewsagencies able member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. The Government's position on the discontinued MAl negotiations remains as stated in the Assistant Treasurer's press statement of 2 November 1998. That is, the Government had indicated for some time that it had a number of serious concerns with the draft text of the treaty as it stood. The Government will not sign any treaty unless it was demonstrably in Australia's interest to do so. (2) Yes. These core elements were: National Treatment; Most Favoured Nation Treatment; Investment Protection; and Dispute Settlement. (3) Yes. (4) As noted above, the Government will not sign any agreement unless it is demonstrably in Australia's interest to do so. Visitor Visa Program (Question No-. 426) Dr Theophanous asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 16 February 1999: (1) Has his attention been drawn to (a) serious problems in the administration of the visitors visa program publicised in recent cases, (b) complaints of many ethnic groups, other community organisations and members of parliament about arbitrary actions by immigration officers towards visitors visas and (c) rejection rates of applications from some countries for visitors visas including persons wishing to visit their families in Australia having reached levels of up to 46 per cent. (2) Will he initiate an inquiry into the administration of the visitors visa program especially as applied to Lebanon, Turkey, the People's Republic of China and Vietnam. Mr Ruddock-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) I am aware of recent interest in the visitor visa program, and receive letters from members of the public alluding to problems with the decision making processes in overseas posts. Allegations of impropriety in the administration of the visitor visa program are taken very seriously and are fully investigated by the Internal Investigations Section of my Department. Generally such allegations have proven to be unfounded. All applications for visitor visas are assessed on their merit. Local staff make decisions on visas in accordance with the Migration Regulations and under the supervision of trained, A-Based officers. Complex decisions are referred to the A-Based staff for decision. Where the applicant wishes to enter Australia to visit a close family relative an adverse decision is open to review by the Migration Internal Review Office (MIRO). In all cases where there is new information that will support an applicant, they may submit fresh applications, which are given fresh consideration. (b) My officers do not make arbitrary decisions when assessing applications. The Migration Regulations and supporting procedural documentation clearly define the role and responsibilities of decision-makers and the factors to be assessed. In assessing an application, decision-makers overseas have no option other than to comply with these instructions. If they are not convinced that the applicant intends a genuine visit to Australia decision-makers cannot, by law, issue a visa. (c) It is true that the rejection rate for visitor visas in some countries is as high as 46%, whereas the global average rejection rate was just 3% in 1 998. For some groups of applicants in some countries there is a higher degree of scrutiny to ensure that those applicants are, in fact, genuine visitors. The honourable member is aware of Public Interest Criteria 4011, also known as the 'Risk Factor Criterion'. The Risk Factor is a creation of the former Labor Government and is derived from legitimate, objective data. The data identifies applicants in certain countries by age and sex where that group is significantly over-represented in overstay and non-return rates (by these terms I mean those people who overstay the term of their visa, and those people who did not leave Australia under the terms they agreed to at the time their initial visa was granted) . (2) I have confidence in my Department and its efforts to facilitate the entry of bona fide visitors and in maintaining the integrity of the migration program. I see no reason to initiate an inquiry into the administration of the visitor visa program as it is applied in Lebanon, Turkey, the People's Republic of China and Vietnam. I announced on 2 March 1999 a review on visa compliance of visitors and temporary entrants. This review will look at a range of issues in relation to compliance with visa conditions, including: Options to reduce employers hiring illegal workers Effectiveness of the Employer Awareness Campaign . The possible introduction of bonds for medium risk visitors. There will be extensive consultation in the conduct of this review. Immigration: Intake Planning (Question No. 427) Dr Theophanous asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 16 February 1999: (1) During the program of consultations on the next planning year of the immigration intake, will he give due weight to submissions from groups in the community who favour increasing the immigration intake. (2) Will he extend the closing date for submissions from organisations wishing to present a detailed case in relation to immigration intake. Mr Ruddock-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) During the annual program of consultations, I encounter a wide cross-section of views on the Migration and Humanitarian programs. All of these views will help to shape the 1999-2000 Migration and Humanitarian Programs. (2) The formulation of the Migration and Humanitarian Programs is linked closely to the Budget process. As the submissions feed into the process of formulating my submission to Cabinet, it is important that the deadlines are met. Where a minor extension of time has been sought, eg for a few days, such requests have been accommodated. Office of Employment Advocate: New Position (Question No. 454) Mr Bevis asked the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Busip.ess, upon notice, on 18 February 1999: (1) Did the Office of the Employment Advocate advertise a senior executive position tasked with increasing the recognition and take-up rates of Australian Workplace Agreements (AWAs) by employers; if so, (a) what are the duty statement and selection criteria for the position, (b) is funding for the position provided within the $3 million awareness campaign budget; if not, how is the position funded and (c) will the position attract performance pay; if so, what criteria will be used to determine performance pay. (2) Have targets been set for the take-up rate of AWAs; if so, what are they. (3) Do the advertisement and other publicity measures indicate a failure of the AW A process, in particular, and the Government's industrial relations initiatives, in general. Mr Reith-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes (a) The duty statement and selection criteria for the position have been forwarded to the Table Office. (b) No; funding is provided from the Office of the Employment Advocate's running costs. (c) A Performance Agreement will be developed when the position is filled. The occupant of the position will be eligible for performance pay if their performance against the Performance Agreement is assessed as good or better. (2) No. (3) No.",151
