30,Mr FAIRBAIRN,WIRELESS LICENCES AND," by leave-Although , by refraining from critical questions, honourable members have shown a most gratifying confidence in the ability of the Royal Australian Air Force to carry through its colossal task, I feel it to be my duty to reassure the House and the public, in view of the fact that certain suggestions of delay and failure have been made outside the House. I shall reply as dispassionately as possible, because I certainly do not wish to continue a controversy which is both harmful to recruiting and discouraging to the Australian Air Force personnel. I express regret that, by my slightly provocative reply to questions last week, I unintentionally added a little fuel to the fires of controversy. I did not realise that those who had criticized so inconsiderately would themselves be so very sensitive to my mild reproof. First, there has been some criticism because the Government did not accept the offer of a certain firm to import from Great Britain, or even to manufacture in this country, a certain type of elementary trainer. This offer was much appreciated, but the reason for not accepting it was that there was already in Australia an established and proved firm which had undertaken to manufacture all of the elementary trainers that would be required for the air training scheme with the exception of 100 which were ordered to fill in the gap before production could commence. Production commenced by the due date, and I have been reassured by the an Director-General of Supply and Production in my department that the statement for of the managing director of De Havilwill he land Aircraft Proprietary Limited (Australia) that he can keep right up to the programme is well founded. We should be proud, of this further proof of the capacity of Australian industry to meet any emergency. The question may be asked: Why are additional elementary trainers not acquired if more can be obtained from any other source? The answer is tiiat there is no merit in pushing elementary training ahead of intermediate and advanced training. The pace of our intermediate and advanced training is set by the available supply of intermediate and advanced training aircraft. The three types of aircraft to be used in intermediate and advanced training under the Empire air training scheme are the Anson, the Battle, and the Australian-^! ilt Wirraway. I am pleased to say that, although our Wirraway production has had "" teething"" troubles, which no aircraft production in any part of the world in my knowledge has ever managed to escape, the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation is not only equal to supplying the Wirraways required under the Empire air training scheme, but is capable also, we are confident, of producing a considerable surplus to make up for deficiencies that may arise through difficulty in the deliveries of the aircraft promised from the United Kingdom. This is a further proof of the capacity of Australian industry, and of the - wisdom, of the policy of developing. our own aircraft, production in Australia. I do not intend to make any statement regarding deliveries from the United Kingdom, because, for quite obvious reasons, it is not desirable, particularly at the prrjscut juncture, to give any information concerning the aircraft production of the United Kingdom or of its disposal. Nevertheless, with the United Kingdom fighting with its back to the wall for very existence, it must be apparent to all that difficulties may well arise in delivering promised aircraft to Australia. Such difficulties of that description as may arise will not mean the collapse of the air training scheme. Wirraway production, as progressing at. present, will supply more aircraft than are needed for single-engine advanced instruction, thus leaving surplus capacity to moot other deficiencies. The Aircraft Production Commission is also at present in conference with the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation, and it is hoped still further to increase the rate of production. It would, moreover, be possible to meet deficiencies by drawing upon civil aviation craft. Nothing will be done to disrupt air transport unless such action is considered to be absolutely necessary, but if it becomes necessary, there will be no hesitation. I shall content myself with saying that, although difficulties in deliveries from the United Kingdom may arise, there are ways in which they can be overcome. The possibility of obtaining twin-engined trainers from the United States of America has not been overlooked. It is obviously wrong, in present circumstances, to make statements concorning the armament of any of our defence forces - It is, likewise, most undesirable to advertise to the enemy any temporary armament difficulties which may arise from time to time. Still more is it undesirable at this juncture to refer to non-deliveries of armament from the United Kingdom. However, as certain deficiencies have unfortunately been mentioned in the press I think it is advisable to tell the public the exact position so that it may not be exaggerated. It is true that certain armament ordered from the United Kingdom for our Hudson aircraft was held up owing to - Britain's efforts to prepare for the onslaught which it is at present withstanding, but I am pleased to be able to announce that - the Australian genius for improvisation has come to the rescue and that very shortly the armament, delivery of which has been delayed, will be replaced by armament improvised in our own works in Australia. It has always been realized that one of the great difficulties in implementing this scheme would be to obtain sufficient trained fitters and men of some mechanical knowledge and aptitude to be trained as fitters and flight mechanics. To overcome this problem a big engineering school has been established with an ultimate capacity for nearly 3,000 trainees. Technical schools have also been established in Canberra, Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide, and others are being established in other capitals. My colleague, the Minister for the Interior, has given instructions - for overtime to be worked aiKl'for everythmg possible to be done ;: expedite,the provision and expansion .accommodation at these schools. The House, will bo pleased to hear that recently there has been a considerable increase of .the number of trained fitters coming forward. There has also been a helpful, very great, increase of the number of men with some mechanical experience who are offering themselves for training. hope this afternoon to confer with trade union leaders on the .subject of the guarding o.f the apprenticeship system, difficulties in relation to which are preconsidered venting a number of young men from offering their services to the country. Right from the conception of this scheme, I have realized and. stressed very grave difficulty of getting .young men of action of the type we want, to their, turn to train, and \. have lost opportunityto emphasize that it is the duty of young men who have the qualifito cations and the inclination to servo in air to wait their turn to train for this service rather than rush off with other units. No one can have more sympathy with the feelings of these young men than I have, for I had to undergo a similar, though shorter, period of waiting when I applied to join up with the Plying Coips in the last war. I fully vealize the danger of the young men being literally unable' to restrain their patience. To overcome this difficulty has . .been suggested that all air - crew day. trainees shall, as they are selected, called up and put into, a - disciplinary ramp, to be trained physically, and in discipline,, and to. receive lectures on theory, of,..w.hat they will, later have leave during the course proper. .There are .definite merits in this proposal, it. .^v'6'ujd..certainly be beneficial to '|.rfi^s*ijq'ne''of /the . trainees and : ensure,', that' they would commence 1 ;tlteTr./.''irai'iuri'g.'..' with' ""is0me"" knowledge' .'of, what . .they ha'd.'...t9_ absdrb during J.heir trainto be trained. : ing 'cpur'sp. proper. It would .also give thcm,'.h feeling of action, and do a way with'the horrible suspense of waitscheme, ing, although, i after some, months they might .well become.impatient also of drill, discipline, arid theoretical „lectures, ouf'.ijiiy actual flying': training., Mr Fuirhnirri, There are, however, stronger points to against such a proposal. Many of those of on the waiting list are students doing courses which it would seem better that they should complete in order to prepare themselves for post-war life, rather than ; be in camp doing training, which, thoughis not, strictly speaking, esscnfci.il. Many others are in jobs in which they are gaining experience and doing valuable I work in relation to Australia's general war effort. It is undesirable to take safethem away from such work until they are definitely needed. Another point to be is that the air training scheme, as already planned, places a tremendous strain upon our material resources and also upon our supply of instructors. the Therefore, serious consideration must be given to any proposal, the adoption of wait which may considerably and unnecesno sarily increase this strain. On the other hand, it may well prove to be essential take steps along these lines, and I have the given instructions that the whole position be examined immediately and most careto serve fully by the Air Board.",15
31,Mr FKANOIS,WIRELESS LICENCES AND,"The Minister promised to provide the men who are waiting with a badge, a facsimile of which was published in the press. Will that be done? Mr EAIRBAIR.N - At .the present time, applicants are accepted on the day imon which they are examined. They are it given a badge, and are sworn in on that Applicants accepted before it is be possible to do that, are sworn in as soon as possible by local magistrates, and, immediately afterwards, a badge is supthe posed to be forwarded to them. . If the to honourable member can inform me of the names of applicants who have not for received a badge, I shall be pleased to the look into the matter. In the meantime, wouldI repeat my appeal to those who feel that they can best serve their country in ,wel.l 'disciplined and the aii , to make application for service in that capacity, and to await-their turn A good deal has been said about the necessity for speeding up the air training or recasting it. This problem is being well considered, but it has to be remembered that our capacity to speed up with the scheme, or even to maintain the programme, is dependent upon the supply of aircraft, which is partly beyond our control. Nevertheless, I can assure the House that we are in touch with the United Kingdom Government and the British Air Ministry, and have expressed our willingness to recast the programme in any way that can be suggested that would better meet the present situation. Up to date, the opinions expressed by the governments of both the United Kingdoiri and Canada, are that there should be no change in the scope or time-table of the air training programme. The work is being pushed ahead at full capacity. If the .production of aircraft can' be increased, I can assure the House that we shall avail ourselves of the additional output, and that the Australian programme will be speeded up. I have endeavoured to reassure the House that suggestions of failure and delay on the part of the Royal Australian Air Force are unfounded, and I have explained that everything that is within the control of the Royal Australian Air Force is proceeding according to programme. I have also pointed out that, ihe speeding-up of the programme is dependent upon the supply of aircraft, and that consideration is being given to every possible way, within our control, in which we can speed up production. 1 do not want honourable members to think that I am in any way complacent, nor do I suggest that no mistakes of any sort have been made. Certain mistakes arc bound to be made from time to time in an undertaking of this kind and of those dimensions. People who have seen Australia's greatest industry, the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, say that i i is little short of a miracle that such an organization should have been built up in approximately a quarter of a century. I would like to remind the House, and critics outside the House, that the Royal Australian Air Force is endeavouring to set up a bigger production organization than that of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, in less than eighteen months. A great majority of the men engaged in this colossal undertaking have come in the last few months from civil life, with little or no previous experience. Our recruiting staff, which now numbers 397, with an additional 200 voluntary helpers, is almost entirely' comprised of : civilians who have offered their services since the outbreak of war!""'It-would ""be ridiculous to expect that an 'o'rgan-iziftion ! of this size, staffed' bymer* with ' great ;S enthusiasm' butlittle experience,'' would make no mistakes in the colossal-' and intricate job of dealing with over '80,000 -: applications from young inenwishing to be examined as to their suitability to serve as pilots, observers, >. air gunners, educationalists, electricians, fitters, air riggers, flight mechanics, clerks, and cooks, and in a dozen other occupations. Mistakes have undoubtedly been made, but every week the personnel is getting experience, and our recruiting system is running more smoothly. Where mistakes have occurred, I . have admitted them freely, without any attempt to cover thani up or make excuses, and I have readily accepted the blame, without endeavouring to pass it on in any way. Therefore, I feel that I can, with confidence, ask the people of Australia to believe me when I say that the suggestions of failure and delay in carrying out the air training scheme by the Royal Australian Air Force are unjustified. The circulation of rumours of delay is most undesirable, as nothing could be more calculated to discourage those who are going through the purgatory of awaiting their turn to serve. LIFE ASSURANCE COMPANIES, AERONAUTICAL RISKS .",17
32,Mr GREGORY,WIRELESS LICENCES AND,"Some time ago, at my request, the Prime Minister made representations to the various life assurance companies in Australia asking thern, in the interests of men who enlist in the Royal Australian A'ir Force, to cancel the clause in life assurance policies relieving the companies of aeronautical risks. I understand 'that' most of the companies' have agreed' to'do''this, and have given to men who have enlisted'.in the Air Force the benefit of the' cancellation ; but I have information that one company, at least-and I 'shall 'announce its name, later, if necessary - refuse d only last month to cancel this clause.!' Will the Government make representations to all of the assurance companies, asking them, in view of the risks that our airmen are taking, to cancel the clause which protects the companies?",18
33,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,WIRELESS LICENCES AND,"I have no knowledge of the stage reached in regard to that matter, but I shall bring it under the notice of the Prime Minister, and see that a reply to the honourable member's question is obtained. WAR IN EUROPE. SITUATION IN BELGIUM.",19
34,Mr BEASLEY,WIRELESS LICENCES AND,"Is the Minister for External Affairs in a position to inform the House as to the latest developments in Europe; and particularly Belgium? exaggerated. Has the report that the King of the Belgians has capitulated been confirmed? Has the advice which he has tendered been accepted by the Belgian forces; have they retired entirely from the field, has the direction of the king with regard to those forces been overridden?",19
35,Mr MCEWEN,WIRELESS LICENCES AND,"I made a brief stateto ment last night, on the adjournment, the point raised by the honourable member. The position with regard to the fighting in northern France at the moment, and the incidents of successes and reverses to the British and French forces, have, of course, been completely overshadowed by the capitulation of the entire Belgian army at the direction of the king, who the Commander-in-Chief in the field. Belgian army had fought gallantly and well. The reports in the possession of production ? the Government are that, during the 24 hours prior to the capitulation, that army was broken by the intense mechanized attacks of the German forces and by continuous and dreadful air attacks. It is not the intention British Government, nor, I am sure, review, would it be the intention of the Commontion wealth Government, to encourage, or a party to, any recriminations as between the Allies in respect of any incident may occur under the dreadful stress the present military activities in France. The Belgian Government, which Allies still regard as the legal government, and which is, in fact, the only legal government of Belgium, has, subsequent to the capitulation of the army in the field, at the direction of the king, declared Supply its intention of maintaining a state of war with Germany, and of marshalling such forces as it is possible for that government to marshal and again place in the field. The British and French forces are continuing their fight, with their morale unimpaired by this capitulation. Nevertheless, it is not to be denied that the complete exposure of the left flank of the Allied forces in Flanders by the capitulation of the Belgian army, and the exposure thus made to German attacks on Dunkirk, and the lines of communication of these Allied armies from Dunkirk, place the British and French forces in that sector in a position of peril, the gravity of which cannot be NA GREAT BRITAIN .  and sittings of the House are concluded will a statement be made indicating the intentions of the Government with regard the wheat industry, as to both the queson tion of an advance and any form of stabilization to be adopted for the coming year? Will a statement also be made as to whether there will be a review of the sales contract entered into last year with the British Government with regard to our exports of primary products, such as wool and butter? Will a statement be is made, further, as to whether the wool The purchase agreement will be reviewed, having regard to the increased cost of",19
36,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,"As far as wheat is concerned, if I can make any useful statement before the conclusion of of the present sittings I shall do so. The sales contract with the Government of the of the United Kingdom is under constant but, at the present time, the posiin London is such that it would be be asking rather too much to expect the Imperial Government to apply itself to which matters of that description. As soon of as the conditions clear, no doubt these problems will again receive the attention the of the Commonwealth Government. ALUMINIUM PLANT.",19
37,Mr CLARK,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,"Will the Minister for and Development state what foundation there is for the statement that has been made regarding the plant required for the manufacture in Australia of aluminium, the export of which has been banned?",19
38,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,"It is true that, in consonance with the declared policy of the Commonwealth Government, arrangements were made for the retention in Great Britain of certain plant intended for the aluminium industry in Australia. That was done because it was demonstrated that the retention of the plant in Great Britain would be eminently in the interests of the Empire as a whole. COAL STRIKE.",20
39,Mr JAMES,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,"Will the Attorney General state whether the report is correct that R. W. Miller, a coal-mine proprietor, operating on the Rothbury Estate near Maitland., has repudiated the terms of the settlement of the recent coal dispute by refusing to re-engage some of his employees who made common cause with the Miners Federation, despite the fact that the terms of settlement which the Government agreed to with the coal owners and miners definitely stated that there would he no victimization of any former employees, and that any free labourers who were engaged by Miller would be compensated by being found other employment? If this be a fact, what does the Government propose to do with Miller to force him to honour the agreement made with the men ?",20
40,Mr HUGHES,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,"To reply to the honourable member at length would not be possible for me without my having the agreement before me. I understand quite well what he is speaking about, and I shall ascertain the facts. The agreement that was made between the Government and the executive of the mining unions and the Australasian Council of Trade Unions will be honoured in the letter and in the spirit. NETHERLANDS EAST INDIES .",20
41,Mr JENNINGS,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,Has the Minister for External Affairs any later information regarding the Netherlands East Indies and Dutch New Guinea?,20
42,Mr MCEWEN,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,"I have nothing to add to the statement which I have previously made regarding the Netherlands East Indies, nor does the Government expect that there will be any further developments necessitating further statements. FITTERS INAIR FORCE.",20
43,Mr HOLLOWAY,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,"Seeing that during the early stages of the organization of the Royal Australian Air Force there was a surplus of first-class engineering labour available, will the Minister for Air consider whether it is possible to release some of the first-class fitters from air force depots for service in the munitions branch, where they are so urgently needed ?",20
44,Mr FAIRBAIRN,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,"I shall consider the honourable member's suggestion, but the shortage of highly-skilled fitters in the Air Force today is so grave that we must be very careful before permitting any of them to leave the service. RAILWA Y WAR COUNCIL.",20
45,Mr DRAKEFORD,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,"Will the Minister for the Army state whether the Railway War Council is still in existence? If so, how long is it since it last met? Has it prepared any transport plans to meet a possible state of emergency in Australia? If it has, can any information be given to the House regarding the character and extent of its plans ? If not, can the Minister assure the House that effective preparations have been made?",20
46,Mr STREET,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,"Yes , the Railway War Council is still in existence. I cannot say offhand when it last met. It has, of course, as the object of its existence, the preparation of plans to meet any emergency that may arise. It would not be in the public interests to disclose the nature of those plans. So far as my information goes, I believe that the plans drawn up provide for .any emergency that may arise. MUNITIONS SUPPLY.",20
47,Mr GREGORY,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,"Has the attention of the Minister for Supply been drawn to the statement of the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) last night regarding the extraordinary delays that have taken place in the supply of munitions in New South Wales, and the waste of public money involved?",20
48,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,"My attention has been drawn to the statement. There is an effective reply, and that reply will be made.",21
49,Mr ROSEVEAR,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,When may the House expect this very important statement in denial of the charges made against the Department of Supply and Development regarding production delays?,21
50,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,"But for the unfortunate occurrences in France last week, that statement would have been already made. It will be agreed that, what is happening in France and Flanders just now is even more important than the impatience of some honourable members. AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS' REPATRIATION BILL 1940.

We feel that the anomalies which it is now proposed to remove should have been removed long ago. In particular, the vexatious border rate for telegrams should never have been allowed to persist so long, seeing that it constituted such a grave injustice to people living in districts along the State borders. It appears that the advantages under the bill to people living in border districts are to be even greater, than was indicated by the Postmaster-General (Mr. Thorby) yesterday. It now costs Is. 4d. to send a telegram of sixteen words from one side of a State border to the other, say, from Albury to Wodonga. That special interstate rate is to be abolished, and such a telegram could, I presume, be despatched for 9d., which is the rate for telegrams that are to be delivered within a 15-mile radius of the point of despatch. I believe that the Minister should grant a further concession to persona living in districts where the local telegraph office closes at 6 o'clock. Where there is an all-night telephone service, it. should be made possible to despatch a telegram at any time during the night- particularly if the telegram be urgent.",21
52,Mr THOKBY,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,"That is provided for. If it is possible to ring through to the nearest all-night office, telegrams nm^ \n-. despatched by telephone.",21
53,Mr MAKIN,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,Without penalty?,21
54,Mr THORBY,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,"There is no penalty, except that trunk line charges must be paid.",21
55,Mr MAKIN,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,"That does not cover the point I am making. In the cities, where the telegraph office is open day and with night, a person may send a telegram at any time during the day or night without extra, cost, but in the country, where the telegraph office closes at 6 o'clock, a person has to pay trunk line charges to BILL 1940. have his telegram telephoned to the nearest telegraph office. People living in the more remote parts of the Commonwealth should receive benefits at least equal to those in the more closely-populated areas. Although I represent a city constituency, I am not unmindful of the requirements of those living in the outback portions of Australia, and it is essential that those who do not enjoy the conveniences available to city dwellers should receive greater consideration in this respect. I trust that the Minister will remedy the anomalous position in which some persons are to be placed by having to incur an additional cost, in transmitting telegrams after hours to the nearest all-night telegraph office. I am also pleased to note that the bill provides that news telegrams sent by representatives of broadcasting stations are to be despatched at the rates charged for press telegrams. It is surprising that hitherto news messages despatched to the Australian Broadcasting Commission, which is indirectly controlled by the Government, have been charged a rale higher than that charged on press telegrams. The Minister admitted that, notwithstanding the concessions granted, additional revenue will be obtained. That is a striking admission of the benefit, of government control, particularly of instrumentalities such as the Postal Department. It is pleasing to realise that, during the war when restrictions have to be placed upon governmental services in order to effect economies this Government' instrumentality is able to grant concessions to the public and at the same time to increase the revenue. The Minister's statement supports the policy of public ownership which has always been advocated by honourable members on this side of the chamber. In a national emergency the efficacy of such a policy should become more apparent, and we should provide an even greater measure of government control, and in that way add to the efficiency of the service rendered to the public.",21
56,Mr HARRISON,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,"Wenhvorth) [3 8.6.]. - Althoug h I welcome the introduction of this measure, I am inclined to think that many honourable members would not have supported it but for the fact that we are in the throes of war, and it is necessary to obtain as much revenue as possible through the various departments in order to prosecute the conflict to a successful conclusion. standing the remarks made by the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr . Makin) to the effect that the bill confers certain concessions in the matter of telegraph rates to those residing in border are as , ' I hope to be able to convince honourable members that it would have been quite possible at a minimum loss of revenue to have given a definite advantage to those living in such areas without the disadvantages which they will suffer under this, measure. I agree with fho honourable member for Hindniaibh that ' l l measure such as this should have been .introduced earlier; but there are reasons why that was not done. Three successive Postmaster-Generals endeavoured to"" afford some relief from the extraordinary anomaly of border rate telegrams. The telegraphic section is not the only section which can be accused of charging unnecessarily high rates. The Minister (Mr Thorby) has said that, although the word rate for telegrams into be Australia is lower than that in almost any other country, the profit in the telegraphic section, in 1935-36 was £65,000; in 1936-37. £S0,000; in 1937-3S, £73,000; and in 3 938-39, £53,COO. The reduced profit for this financial year is clue largely to the obligations into which we have entered with respect to overseas services and not to any internal cause.",22
57,Mr THOKUY,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,"Prio r to the periods mentioned there was a loss of £2,500,000 on the operations of the branch.",22
58,Mr HARRISON,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,"In 1934-35 there was a profit of £15,000, but before that there was a. definite loss over a number of years. No big business concern would single out the loss on one section, and say that it must show a profit when the whole business was making an extraordinary profit. The honourable member for Hindmarsh drew attention to the application of press telegram rates to broadcasting stations. I only want to say that this amendment would have been introduced long ago only that it was thought desirable to await a decision with regard to border rate telegrams and so include both amendments in the one bill.",22
59,Mr MAKIN,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,There were many opportunities to introduce it .,22
60,Mr HARRISON,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,"In consequence of Notwith- the outbreak of war its introduction was delayed. In September, 193S, the then Postmaster-General decided to provide a 9d. rate for telegraphic messages of sixteen words within a radius of 15 miles, which would have been of greater a,dvan : tage to those concerned than the present suggestion. Some time later the present Minister for Commerce,. who was Postmaster-General in the Lyons Government, recommended a rate of sixteen words for Is. outside a 35-mile, radius, thereby abolishing State boundaries. That would have been, o.f definite benefit to all using the service. I realized the advantage of such an ' innovation but before the then Minister had an opportunity 'tp givc effect to it . the Ministry was reconstructed and 1 was appointed Postmaster-General. mediately had the recommendation explained that point. re-affirmed by Cabinet, and stated that effect would be given to it as soon as the bill could be drafted. Unfortunately, the war occurred, involving the maintenthat ance of revenue wherever possible, as the concession proposed would resulted in a definite loss of £63,000, which would have absorbed almost completely . the amount of profit made annually, honourable members will under15-mile stand why the measure was not introexisting duced. It was desired to obtain as much revenue as possible and in that way avoid increasing direct taxation by that amount. The Minister anticipates that under these proposals an additional £25,000 of revenue will be obtained. Honourable members must recognize that while tain benefits will be conferred upon transmitting border telegrams, indirectly the cost will be higher. The estimated additional revenue of £25,000 is very conservative, and I say without hesitation that the amount is likely to be considerundue ably over £40,000.",22
61,Mr THOKBY,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,The honourable member is not making any allowance for the cessions to be made under another bill.,23
62,Mr HARRISON,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,"I am not peramounting mitted to discuss that measure at this juncture; but the Minister will admit that his estimate is conservative. When i was suggested that the interstate rate should be reduced from Is. 4d. to Is. for sixteen words, the department grant estimated the loss would be £63,000. The proposed rate is Is. for fourteen words plus Id. a word for each additional word, or sixteen words for Is. 2d., or 2d. more than the original suggestion of sixteen words for Is., which on a conservative estimate would reduce the £63,000 menCommunist) tioned to £32,000. In other words, the departmental figures, there will saving to the revenue of £32,000, not, £25,000, as the Minister estimated Taking into account the fact that ithe average number of words in a telegram is not fourteen or sixteen but eighteen, the average cost, under the existing rate sixteen words for Is. 4d. is Is. 6d. At the new rate of Is. for fourteen words, the sender will have to pay Is. 4Jd. for eighteen words, and consequently will save only 2d. instead of 4d. I im- Mr MAKIN - The Postmaster-Genera!",23
63,Mr HARRISON,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,"It is clear. Within a 15-mile radius, the number of words may be sent for 9d. will be fourteen, and compared with sixteen at present; conhave sequently on an average telegram of eighteen words, the sender will have to pay Is. Id. for eighteen words, or 2d. more than the present rate for a radius, and I d . less than the interstate rate. This will not confer very much benefit on the sender. Nevertheless, I support the bill because I believe that, in time of war, we arc fortunate in that our essential services are not more heavily taxed. During the last war, the postage rate had to be cerincreased. That is not contemplated at those the moment. We should not delude ourselves inito the belief that a permanent adjustment of rates has been made. When the war calms down, further benefits should be given to the public out of the profits that are being made. I am glad that ithe Postmaster-General bus agreed to reduce the charges in conrespect of broadcasting telegrams. The press has received a definite concession, to 5S per cent, on interstate telegrams and 80 per cenit, in respect of intra-state telegrams, on the ground that t it is rendering an essential service. The conference held at Cairo a few years ago agreed to suspend all rates and to concessions ito broadcasting as from the 1st January, 1939; consequently, the bill merely gives effect to the terms' of a convention, and in no greater degree than has been observed by other nations.",23
64,Mr BEASLEY,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,"West Sydney-Leade r of the Australian Labour party-non [12.2.1] - The analysis of on the bill by the honourable member for be a Wentworth (Mr Harrison) has con- firmed what I gathered from the speech of the Postmaster-General (Mr Thorby). The proposed concessions are not so great, as itlio Government would have the public of believe; consequently I am not altogether satisfied with them. The restoration of the number of words to sixteen, in conjunction with the proposed concessions, would tend to establish the claim of the Government, The information that the revenue is not. likely to suffer is interesting. On itlie contrary., additional revenue to an amount of £25,000 will be obtained. The profits of the Postal Department have been very high in recent years, although the general belief is that it should not be regarded as revenue-producing institution. The principle orginally laid down in the postal organization, was that any profits should be returned to the public in the form of lower rates for telegraphic, telephonic and postal services. For the last few years, there been very strong agitation in the business world, and among the general public, against the use of the department for a purpose not originally intended, and in favour of the granting of concessions to the public out of the increased revenue obtained. principle is followed in other national undertakings. I speak with intimate knowledge of the supply of electricity and other services by governmental and semi-governmental bodies. The argument can be sustained that, as the number of users increases, the cost proportionately reduced, and that therefore there is scope for the improvement of facilities. In the United States of America, telephony is regarded as being as essential as water, light and gas. That view should be adopted in this country. The facilities offered by the telegraph branch should be placed within the reach of all. The Minister justified the reduction of the number of words from sixteen to fourteen by saying that messages could be condensed, because people employ unnecessary words only because they can be used up to sixteen for no additional charge. A large proportion of the total number of words is represented by the address. A little whileago I read that the Government had in mind the granting of the concession of not. charging for the full number of words in an address. We have all had the experience of telegrams being undelivered when an effort has been made to abbreviate the address. That aspect must be considered. Up to six words may be U3cd in an address, and in such a case it would be difficult to say in the remaining eight words allowed for 9d. what one wished to convey. Those who are not accustomed to sending letters or telegrams are not, competent to express themselves briefly as are persons engaged in parliamentary duties, press activities, or business generally, of whose daily routine it is a part. Condensation is difficult for the man who a toils in the fields all day, or is engaged solely in hard manual labour. In committee, I shall move to raise the number of words to the sixteen at present allowed. With the altered rates, this would be a real concession to the public.",23
65,Mr SCHOLFIELD,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,"Wannon) [12.29]. has - At a time like the present, the Government may be excused for making slightly more profit on the operations of the postal department, although generally speaking, that institution should not be used as a taxing medium. As the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Harrison) has That suggested, the matter can be adjusted at, the termination of the war. In the circumstances, I congratulate the Postmaster-General (Mr Thorby) on the removal of certain anomalies that have become manifest in the telegraphic service. The elimination of the disability is caused by the rate for interstate messages is a step in the right direction. The cancellation of double rates on holidays and Sundays will relieve the congestion in ordinary business hours. My criticism of the measure concerns the effect of these proposals on country services. The limitation of the reduced rate of 9d. for telegrams to a distance up to 15 miles gives to residents of populous areas a great advantage over people living in sparsely populated districts. The centres at which most people in country areas do their business are usually more than 15 miles distant, and in. areas where mail services are infrequent residents are often obliged to rely on telegraphic communication.",24
66,Mr HARRISON,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,The concession in respect of the 15-miles radius will apply to country districts as well as metropolitan areas.,24
67,Mr SCHOLFIELD,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,But country people rarely send telegrams to places less than fifteen miles distant. . Mr THORBY - They can use the trunkline telephone system at a cost of about 4d.,24
68,Mr SCHOLFIELD,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,"That may be so. However, a telephone may not be availso able. At the same time, such facilities arc not likely to be readily provided cause it is the policy of the department to refuse to install a line unless it first obtains a guarantee that the line will a payable proposition. Another anomaly, which was mentioned by the honourable member for Wcntworth, arises in respect of all-night services in country districts. The Postmaster-General explained that whore all-night telephonic services provided in the country, a person can use such facilities for the despatch telegrams provided he also ipays the charge for the telephone call.",24
69,Mr THORBY,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,That is the phonogram method.,25
70,Mr SCHOLFIELD,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,But those faciliby ties already exist.,25
71,Mr THORBY,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,"In future the double rate will not apply after certain hours. Mr SCHOLFIELD.'- I did not know I hat. However, as the honourable memmainly ber for Wentworth has indicated, that concession will not be so great if people must pay the charge for the telephone call as well as for the telegram.",25
72,Mr THORBY,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,But in future the night telephone rate will also be reduced.,25
73,Mr SCHOLFIELD,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,"I suggest that some concession should be allowed in reprovided spect of the addresses on telegrams. Mr THORBY,-Provisio n for such charges is made in the international vention. That is why no alteration that respect has been proposed.",25
74,Mr SCHOLFIELD,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,"As the Postefficient master-General has effectively answered nil of the points which I have raised, congratulate him upon having introduced this measure. I again urge him to grant concessions to residents in country disment tricts wherever possible.",25
75,Mr LAZZARINI,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,"Werriwa) [12.85]. - 1I have always approached consideraPostal tion of facilities provided by the Postal .Department .from the point of view not of profit but. of service. The department, apparently, invariably prefers to make concessions which will benefit, big comhandy mercial interests, and pays little regard to the just claims of country resito dents. For instance, the abolition of double rates - in respect of night sera vices benefits mostly the, man who is in business in populous centres, and of l.ostows very little benefit upon the beordinary users of the telephonic and telegraphic services. Events which make it expedient, or necessary, for residents in be remote centres to use telephonic or telegraphic facilities late at night are usually of such a nature to preclude a person from worrying to reduce the cost to the minimum. In times of emergency caused by death or sudden illness in the home, are or when some unusual event, such as a marriage or birth, takes place, people of are inclined to act rather hurriedly in despatching telegrams or making tele* phone calls. On the other hand, big business has reduced the cost of these facilities to a minimum. For instance the use of codes, big business houses are enabled to cut out every unnecessary word from a telegram. It is also apparent that reduction of rates in respect of postal facilities generally are mado in the interests of the commercial section of the community. I have no objection to extending to broadcasting stations the concessions now enjoyed by newspapers. However, I contend that commercial interests should not be given any further concessions by the department until much-needed facilities are in sparsely .populated areas, or until the present charges in the country - are reduced. The present rates in popuconlous centres are quite low enough, and in any revenue which the department has to spare should be used for the purpose of providing greater facilities and more services in rural areas. I commend the Pos-tma.ster-Gener.al (Mr. I Thorby) for abolishing the border telegram anomaly. I again urge the Governto approach the subject of the improvement of postal, telegraphic and telephonic facilities from the point of view of service rather than of profit. The Department has done a wonderful job. I have no complaint to make about its administration. It is all very .well for the Postmaster-General to - say that residents in country areas who are not to a telegraph office can use the telephone, but that procedure is costly a lot. of people. In addition, thousands of settlers in outback .areas are not near telephone. These people will receive no benefit whatsoever from the. reduction night rates for telegrams ,and telephone calls. In any ca.?c, why should people in. country areas be obliged to pay for a telegram which costs people livin in populous centres only 9d.? Postmaster-General knows that a phone is not available to every body.",25

I raise one anomaly that occurs at present, and I put it before the Minister the hope that he will be able to correct It occurs in this way: Many continuous telephone services operate in p.m. fair-sized country towns, but, because limited service exchanges, sometimes connected to only two or three subscribers, or to the actual telephone exchange itself, are closer to an intending subscriber than in is the all-night service, that intending is prevented, unless he pays exorbitant charges, from being connected this with the continuous service.

In urging this reform on various Postmaster-Generals, I have often said that a telegram from Southport to Tweed Heads, a distance of 20 West Sydney (Mr Beasley) miles, costs Is. 4d., whereas a telegram from Southport to Cairns, a distance of 2,100 miles, costs only Is. That was never the intention of the General framers of the Constitution and I regret possible, accept the amendment. that 40 years had to elapse before change was made. I am glad that reform can be made without loss revenue, because we are passing through extraordinary times, in which the revenue must be maintained. I understand that had the Postmaster-General decided merely to do away with the penalty rate of 4d. on interstate telegrams without action to safeguard the revenue, the annual loss would have been £63,000.

87,Mr SCULLY,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,"Gwydir) [2.25] - I the abolition of the differentiation between ordinary and interstate I telegrams, especially on behalf of of border towns, who, up to now, have really had to suffer a penalty of 7d. on a telegram sent only a short distance, but from one State to another. The extra 3d. penalty arises from the fact that in metropolitan areas telegrams for delivery within a 15-mile radius can be sent for a flat rate of 9d. This is concession, and we look for concessions such a profitable undertaking as the post office. The objection that I have this bill is the proposal to decrease from sixteen to fourteen words the message on which the minimum charge is payable. The honourable member for has announced that he will move in committee for the continuance of the 16-word charge basis, and I ask the Postmasterto reconsider the matter and, if I the also welcome the decision to do the away with the double charge for of telegrams despatched on Sundays and holidays, such as Christmas Day and Good Friday, but, so that the country districts might benefit from that provision, the hours of business at country post offices will have to be extended. Having been reared in country districts, the Postmaster-General would naturally appreciate the countryman's viewpoint, and he should be sympathetic to their aspirations, but the Postal Department is too conservative, in considering applifor an extension of country telephone services. It is inclined to increase restrictions rather than facilities. The present Postmaster-General is the only occupant of that office who has shown to any Courage. His predecessors were always ready with an excuse for not abolishing the penalty rate on interstate telegrams, but no excuse could really stand the test.",27

That would not be in order, and I ask honourable members to confine their remarks to the bill",28
89,Mr GREEN,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,"Kalgoorlie) [2.31] Although the bill does not consist solely of benefits to the public, like the curate's egg, it is undoubtedly good in parts. For instance, the reductions of telegram charges are not as beneficial as they would at first appear to be. I have no desire to be unfair, but I think it is necessary to draw attention to certain objections. The first is that the number of words allowed in an ordinary telegram has been reduced from sixteen to fourteen. According to information supplied by the Postal Department, the average telegram contains eighteen words, so that the reduction by two words will represent an average loss >to the sender of approximately 2d.",28
90,Mr THOKBY,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,The average of eighteen words a telegram includes the nine penny telegrams.,28
91,Mr GREEN,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,"That is so; the reduction of the maximum from sixteen to fourteen also applies to telegrams sent within a radius of 15 miles which were previously sent for 9d., so that there is a loss to the public there. In view of the fact that double rates after hours have been cancelled. I should like to know whether or not it will still be possible to send urgent telegrams?",28
92,Mr THOKBY,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,"Urgen t telegrams may still be forwarded at double rates. At present where double rates apply for ordinary telegrams, double double rates apply for urgent telegrams.",28
93,Mr GREEN,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,"I am glad of that explanation because in my opinion there should be provision for urgent telegrams, which are very often necessary in cases of accident or illness. Apart from the objeotions which I have raised, it appears that the bill is a great boon to the public. The Postal Department will in future be regarded as a Commonwealth-wide utility, and no differentiation in charges will be made between the various parts of the Qommonwealth. .We should be proud of. the fact that, under ithe efficient administration of the Postal Department, our telegraph services are the cheapest in the world. That has been rendered possible only through government ownership of this great public utility - a principle for which we on this side of the House stand. As the Post*master-General (Mr Thorby) has pointed out, telegraph charges in this country are much cheaper than they are in many other parts of ithe world. In Australia a 16-word telegram may be sent at a charge of .18d. a word; in the United Kingdom, which is about the same size as Victoria, the corresponding charge is .83d. a word; in New Zealand, which is somewhat larger than Victoria, it is l . l l d . a word; and in ithe United States of America, which has a population nineteen times greater than that of Australia, the charge varies from 1.05d. a word to 4.05d. a word. That means that whereas it is possible to send a telegram in Australia from Gape York to Cape Leeuwin for less than Id . a word, in the United States of America the cost might be as high as 4.05d. a word for the same distance. It is not that the Western Union Company, which operates telegraphic and telephonic services in the United States of America, is not as efficient as our Postal Department, but it means that the service is being run for the company instead of for the benefit of the people. The bill is a short one, but it provides much-needed reforms at small cost to the department. If we were permitted by the Chair to mention matters apart from those contained in this bill, the debate would be interminable, and so I shall not suggest on this occasion that part of the revenue to be raised by this bill should be given to employees of the Postal Department in distant parts, in the forai of larger district allowances. ,*",28

96,Mr SPURR,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,"Wilmot) [2.36] - I supto pout the bill, but I should like to drawhonorable attention to the disadvantages suffered country people with regard to telegraphic services. The country districts of electorate cover about one-third of mania, and to the best of my knowledge in that area there is not one all-night telegraph office, and therefore people living in these areas are at a big advantage. I suggest tp the Postmasterrural General (Mr Thorby) that the cost telephoning a telegram from a country post office to a central telegraphic office - should not be charged to the sender. am speaking particularly of offices which are open all night, or at least for much longer than normal hours.

Whereas a telegram containing the present maximum of teen words may he sent from an ordinary telegraph office at almost any time the day or night for Is., if the message is to be sent on a Saturday afternoon from a country post office it is first all necessary to pay an opening fee of Is. 6d.; then there is a charge of Is. for telephoning the message to the nearest telegraph office; and, on top of that, for a distance of 60 miles there is the cost of the telegram itself, those making a total of 3s. 6d. discrepancy would be overcome if the hill were amended to provide that telegrams he accepted at the basic rate, no matter from what office they be sent. Even if country subscribers were only required to pay an opening fee, they would receive a considerable reduction of the total charge.",29
97,Mr THOKBY,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,"If telegrams are lodged at any post office which has a telephone, no charge is imposed. A charge is only imposed if the office is a contract post office, and the telephone is not run the Postal Department. Mr SPURR,- I thank the Minister emfor his explanation. I was under the impression that a telephone call had to be paid for on all occasions when an office is closed for ordinary telegraphic business.",29
98,Mr THORBY,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,"Calare-Postmaster General) [2.42],-in reply-There are several points which have been raised in the course of the second-reading debate which I should like to reply. Several members stated that this billby gave concessions to big commercial interests. Others said that the people were my being definitely penalized. Whilst I Tasappreciate the complimentary remarks made in support of the bill, I point out that it is entirely wrong to say that sectional interests are being considered. As disone who takes just as much interest in areas as any other honourable ox member, I say that an examination of the bill proves that the concessions which it contains definitely apply to a large proportion of country people. Eor inI stance, the abolition of border rates applies entirely to country people. At present, if a telegram is sent across a boundary, even though it be only a point two or three miles away, the charge is Is. 4d. for sixteen words. This sixbill amends that rate to 9d. for fourteen words. As I said in my of second-reading speech, many telegrams which now contain sixteen words could easily be reduced to fourteen words of without any disadvantage to any one. [ repeat that the bulk of the people who will benefit by reduced border rates are country people. Further, the reduction of the rate for interstate telegrams will affect country people just as much as living in the cities. For one thing, This it will be a great concession to the people living in the south-west of Queensland, all most of whom deal with business interests in Sydney. The concession will also benefit residents of outback areas in the Northern Territory, and particularly in Tasmania, because people of that State have extensive telegraphic communication with Melbourne, and at present are obliged to pay Is. 4d. for sixteen words. I make this explanation because some speakers have created the impression that this bill takes away more than it gives. I have never sugby gested that the purpose of this bill is merely to give concessions. Its object is to eliminate anomalies and, without any great loss of revenue, to give a reasonable service at a reasonable cost to all people of. the Commonwealth, without any discrimination. I am personally responsible for the provision which' reduces the normal number of words in a telegram from sixteen to fourteen, but as I have explained, that reduction should not be a great inconvenience. Had [ attempted to introduce a bill giving concessions such as those suggested by the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) the chances are that it would not have been passed by Parliament, because of the additional heavy cost which it would have imposed upon (he Commonwealth at a time when revenue must be devoted to defence purposes. Mr BEASI.KY - There will be no loss of revenue.",29
99,Mr THORBY,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,"Not under the bill. Indeed, we shall probably obtain in creased revenue, because the number of interstate telegrams will undoubtedly increase as the result of the reduced charges. Similarly, border telegrams w i ll become more numerous when it is known that a message which previously cost Is. 4d. can be sent for 9d. That is an important concession, because a good many telegrams pass between such border towns as Murwillumbah and Coolangatta, Albury and Wodonga, and at many other places where there is a considerable population on each side of the border. . Mr GANDER - What is the distance for which a border telegram can be sent for Od.?",30
100,Mr THORBY,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,"So long as the sendrates ing and the receiving offices are not more than 15 miles apart, a telegram may. be rent anywhere within the Commonin an ordinary telegram? wealth for 9d.'; the fact that it may have to. cross a - border makes no difference. The 15-mile radius applies to places like Hungerford a3 to Sydney or between Melbourne. The honourable member for West Sydney will appreciate the position when I tell him that I could get these consmall cessions only by avoiding .any loss revenue; in fact, the revenue of the partment will probably increase slightly as the result of these concessions.",30
101,Mr BEASLEY,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,That is my point.,30
102,Mr THORBY,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,"In my second-reading speech I said that another bill would deal with concessions to members of the Australian Defence Forces. I realise that that bill is not now before the House, but I mention it in passing because it also provides for a reduction of telegraph rates. It would have been difficult to introduce all of the concessions covered by this bill unless .1 could show that the revenues of (he Postal Department would not be reduced by them. The bill is designed to eliminate existing anomalies and to grant as many concessions as possible. I contend that a reduction of the number of words in a telegram from sixteen to fourteen will not impose any increased burden on the public, because it will still be possible to keep most telegrams within a l i m it of fourteen words. It is true that, the previous Postmaster-General, the honourable member for Went/worth (Mr . Harrison), told us that the average number of words in a. telegram is eighteen, but I submit that that average will fall immediately this amending bill becomes law, and the number of words in a normal telegram is reduced to four-, teen.",30
103,Mr BLACKBUHN,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,Will there not be an increase of the number of telegrams tent on Sundays?,30
104,Mr THORBY,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,"I have no doubt that the number of telegrams despatched or. Sundays and such holidays as Christmas Day and Good Friday will increase. That will mean additional revenue to the department. I ask honourable members, however, not to confure telegraph with telephonic communications.",30
105,Mr MAKIN,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,What would be the extra cost of conceding an additional two-words ',30
106,Mr THORBY,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,"It is impossible to give an accurate estimate, but the official view is that it would represent a loss of £30,000 and £40,000 a year. The Government believes that it is justified in asking the community to accept the sacrifice involved in the reduction of of the number of words in an ordinary detelegram, in view of the elimination of many existing anomalies and the granting of valuable concessions. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In committee: Clauses 1 to 4 agreed to. Clause 5The second schedule to the principal act is repealed and the following schedule inserted in its stead:"" SECOND SCHEDULE. PAST I - OEDINAB Y TELEGRAMS. - arc not more are more than Including address and signatureNot exceeding fourteen words Ninepenco Each additional word One penny",30
107,Mr BEASLEY,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,"""West Sydney-Leade r of the Australian Labour party-non Communist) [2.50] - I move That the word "" fourteen"" proposed new second schedule, Part I - be omitted with a. view to insert in lieu thereof the word "" sixteen "". If agreed to, my amendment would mean that an ordinary telegram containing sixteen words could be sent for the rates which the Government proposes shall apply to telegrams consisting of not more than fourteen words. The Postmaster General (Mr Thorby) has told us that he was personally responsible for reducing the number of words in an ordinary telegram from sixteen to fourteen, and gave as his reason that he could not obtain the approval of his colleagues to a measure which would result in a reduction of the revenue of the Post Office. The Minister has destroyed his own argument by telling us that the concessions contained in this bill will increase the revenue of the department by as much as £25,000. His predecessor, the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Harrison) said that the increased revenue would be at least £32,000. He regarded that as a conservative estimate.",31
108,Mr THORBY,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,"The £25,000 will result from hot only slight increases of revenue resulting from a reduction of the number of words in ordinary telegrams, but also increased traffic in border and interstate telegrams. There is a compensating arrangement.",31
109,Mr BEASLEY,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,"The general principle should be the granting of facilities to the public at the lowest possible costOverhead charges go on all the time. The department must have its trunk lines, and sufficient equipment to carry a full load for 24 hours a day. It is much more profitable to have the staff and equipment Between Between in f u ll use throughout the day than to offices which offices which have slack, or off-peak, periods. If the than fifteen fifteen miles gap represented by those off-peak periods miles apart. apart. can be filled, the business becomes more profitable. That is the reason why these facilities should be placed at the disposal of the public at such rates as will induce One shilling people to make the fullest use of them. The greater use made of the facilities proOne penny vided, the greater the revenue of the department. That argument can be applied to my proposal. As the Minister himself admitted, this bill will not reduce, but rather will increase, the revenue of the department.",31
110,Mr THORBY,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,"The revenue will increase, but the increase will not be so great as the loss would be if there were no compensating clauses in the bill.",31
111,Mr BEASLEY,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,"The result of this legislation must be either an increase or a.decrease of revenue and that, in turn, will be determined by how the business is conducted and the degree to which the 1 public makes use of the facilities provided. The Minister's statement - that ordinary telegrams - can be confined to fourteen ""words is not borne out by the facts. I point out that, in many instances, the address will occupy six or seven words. In respect of telegrams sent to suburban addresses, the address includes the name of the addressee, the street, and the nuinher in the street, as well as the suburb. These words, together with the name of the sender, will represent seven or eight words in a telegram of fourteen words, leaving only about six words for the message. A telegram sent to me at my home would require six words for the address. The Post Office is not intended to be a taxing machine. It should be sufficient if it provides the community with facilities without incurring losses. Any profits earned by the department, should be returned to the public in the form of concessions, thereby making the facilities more within the reach of all. recent years that has been the principle which has guided the postal authorities.",31
112,Mr THOKBY,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,"The consolidated debt of the telegraph section of the department is about £2,500,000.",32
113,Mr BEASLEY,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,"The profits shown in the general account amounted to over £3,000,000 last year.",32
114,Mr THOKBY,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,That was for the whole Post Office system.,32
115,Mr BEASLEY,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,"The telegraph section showed a profit of £65,000 in 1935-36; £80,000 in 1936-37; £73,000 in 1937-38, and £51,000 in 1938-39.",32
116,Mr THOKBY,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,"Altogethe r in the last five years, the total profits have amounted Io £284,000. The losses in the previous twelve years totalled £2,490,000.",32
117,Mr BEASLEY,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,I intend to test the committee on the proposal to allow sixteen words in an ordinary telegram. I understand that the schedule will also affect the Australian Broadcasting Commission.,32
118,Mr THOKBY,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,The commission will be entitled to ordinary press rates.,32
119,Mr BEASLEY,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,"That being so, I trust that it will make the greatest possible use of its facilities in order to provide ful l and complete news services for every part of the Commonwealth.",32
120,Mr SHEEHAN,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,"Cook) [8.1] - I ask ihe"" Postmaster-General to clarify the position in relation to the use in telegrams of the names of the various States. When the name of New South Wales appears in the address of a telegram, it is eojunted as one word, but when it appears in the body of a message, it counted as three words. This is an anomaly which should be corrected. A States should be on the same basis this regard, and if the name of New word. South Wales can be counted as one word in an address, it should also be counted as one word in the message itself.",32
121,Mr THORBY,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,"Calare-Postmaster General) [3.2] - For reasons which 1I have given in previous remarks, I canalso, not accept the amendment. I have had provide for the concessions set out in bill in such a way as to ensure department shall not lose revenue. DurUntil ing the last four or five years, the Telegraph Branch of the Postmaster General's Department has returned a profit aggregating about £250,000; but in the previous ten or twelve years, it accumulated a loss of about £2,500,000. The department is required, continually, to provide extensions and improvements of its services, and it cannot do so i i it is operating at a loss. It is, moreover, impossible to levy the charges in such a way as to ensure that the accounts will actually balance, with neither profit nor loss, at the end of each year. The Government has gone as far as it possibly can go in granting concessions. In reply to the honourable member for Cook (Mr Sheehan) respecting the counting of the number of words in the name of a State, I point out that the practice is to regard, the name of a State as one word whether it contains one word, as in the case of Victoria, or three words, as in the case of New South Wales, if it appears in the address of the telegram; but if it appears in the body of the message, the actual number of words is counted which, in the case of New South Wales, would be three words. Regulation 26, relating to Commonwealth telegrams, readsThe following shall be counted as one word in plain language, code and cipher telegrams:(«) in the address (not in the text or signature of the telegram). (i) the name of the telegraph office of destination; and (i i ) in the case of a telegram addresed to a telegraph offico in the State of New South Wales, South Australia, or Western Australia, the name of such State. is That means that in the address on a telegram the name of the office and l l also of the State to which it is to in be sent are each counted as one East Maitland, for example, would be one word, and New South Wales would be one word. But if the names appear in the body of the telegram they are counted according to the number of words they actually contain. I point out that street numbers appearing in the to address of the telegram are counted as this one word, even though they may contain that the three figures as, say, 471.",32
122,Mr GANDER,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,"Reid) [3.6] - I direct intention to the position that arises in relation to telegrams containing, say, the results of interstate cricket matches. If New South Wales and South Australia lire playing a match, and a telegram with the scores is sent to Queensland, the words in the body of the telegram ""N.S.W. all out 480"" are counted as eight words, whereas they should he counted as only four words. That is not fair. As the names of Victoria, Tasmania., or Queensland are always despatched, in any circumstances, as single words, the names of - the other States should be so regarded. I ask the Postmaster-General (Mr Thorby) to remedy this anomaly. If he is not prepared to do so, I shall move an amendment to test ithe feeling of the committee on the subject.",33
123,Mr HARRISON,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,"Wentworth) [3.10]. The case put to the Postmaster-General (Mr Thorby) by the honourable member for Reid (Mr Gander) is sound, and I ask the Minister to give it favourable consideration. The matter could be dealt with by an amendment of the regulations; there is no need to amend the bill.",33
124,Mr THOKBY,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,The complaint cannot be remedied in the bill. It may be remedied by an alteration of the regulations.,33
125,Mr HARRISON,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,"Obviousl y the people who wish to use the names of New South Wales, South Australia and Western Australia in the body of telegraphic messages are penalized under the existing regulation. Speaking now to the amendment of the honourable member for West .Sydney (Mr Beasley), I consider that we are very fortunate, at this juncture, in being granted the concessions set out in the bill, particularly in relation ito border telegram rates. Honourable members will recollect, that during the last war postal rates were substantially increased. I have no doubt that if this war is protracted the Government will have to increase the charges for the services rendered by the Postmaster-General's Department, even though it may hold the view that the department should not be regarded as a taxing machine, for it will become necessary to obtain as much revenue as possible from all available sources. We can hardly expect, in such circumstances, that the charges levied by the Postmaster-General's Department will be allowed to remain where they are. If times were normal, I should gladly have supported the amendment, but at a time like this, when it is necessary to maintain and even increase our revenues, I shall have to vote against it.",33
126,Mr JAMES,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,"Hunter) [3.12] - The justice of the request of the honourable member for Cook (Mr Sheehan) has been emphasized by the remarks of the honourable member for Reid (Mr Gander), and I urge the Postmaster-General (Mr Thorby) to rectify the position. The .press is required to pay considerably higher amounts in relation to the despatch of sporting results., because in ithe body of telegrams the names of the Staites of New South Wales, South Australia and Western Australia have to be counted as three, two, and two words, respectively. I urge the Minister to give us an undertaking that he will amend the regulations to correct this inequity.",33
127,Mr GANDEK,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,"If he does not do so, I shall move an amendment of the bill.",33
128,Mr THOKBY,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,"It is not a matter that may properly be dealt with in this bill, for it relates to the regulations. I am prepared to consider the representations that have been made.",33
129,Mr COLLINS,SALE OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS TO,"Hume) [3.15] - I congratulate the Postmaster-General (Mr. Thorby) upon having introduced this measure which provides, among other things, for the abolition of the surcharge on interstate telegrams.

132,Mr CURTIN,MOTOR VEHICLES AGREEMENT,"Eremantle-Leade r of the Opposition) [3.31] - The genesis of this bill is an agreement between the Commonwealth Government and Australian Consolidated Industries Limited, in respect of the manufacture in Australia of motor vehicle engines. That agreement was made subsequent to the passage by this Parliament of an act, the purpose of which was to provide a bounty in connection with the manufacture of motor vehicle engines. That bounty was £30 an engine on the first 20,000 engines, £25 an engine on the second 20,000 engines, and £20 an engine on the third 20,000 engines. That was the decision of this Parliament in connection with the establishment of an industry for the manufacture in Australia of motor vehicle engines. But the matter did not begin there, so far as this Parliament is concerned. Without indulging in even an amplification of the historical side of the matter, which was well stated in the speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies), I can state that proposals were brought down by the present Acting Minister for Information (Sir Henry Gullett), which had for their purpose the imposition of an excise duty on the poundage of engines imported into Australia, the object being to provide a fund which would be used to subsidize the Australian manufacture of motor vehicle engines. The Parliament agreed to that course being followed. It will be recalled that the Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties, as the honourable member for Henty then was, ceased to be a member of the Lyons Government, and on several occasions subsequently, interested himself, as a private member, in an endeavour to push the Government, assent"". of which he had ceased to be a member, into what he held would be a more vigorous prosecution of the purpose for which Parliament had been moved to act. It appears, from such sources of information as have been made available to meI have had an opportunity to scrutinize BILL .1.940. the file-that the Lyons Government had before it about fourteen submissions, none of which it regarded as acceptable. So far as I am able to say, from the somewhat hurried examination that I could make of these proposals, I rather agree with the view that not one of them was put forward in such a way as would meet the request of the Lyons Government. That Government had rejected the report of the Tariff Board, which contemplated a step-by-step progression in respect of the development of this industry. So the matter remained until the right honourable member for Kooyong became Prime Minister. So far as I have been able to ascertain-and the speech of the right honourable gentleman supports my construction of the matter-the Prime Minister interested himself in an endeavour to have the industry established. Prior to the presentation to this Parliament of the Motor Vehicle Engine Bounty Bill, all that happened was that the Department of Trade and Customs, and its then Minister, the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr John Lawson), had endeavoured to get something done. I think it.is fair to say that, when the bill for the payment of a bounty was introduced into this Parliament, it appeared to the Minister for Trade and Customs, and to the Government, that no positive proposal of a practical nature was before them for consideration. Even the proposal which Australian Consolidated Industries Limited had been encouraged to make in general outline, in a form which it believed would be most acceptable to the Government, was one which at that stage the Government did not feel disposed to accept; because the files indicate that, on the Saturday prior to the introduction of the measure, the then Minister for Trade and Customs saw the general manager of Australian Consolidated. Industries Limited, and conveyed to him a proposal of a type which represented what the Cabinet then considered would be more acceptable than that contained in the letter which Mr. W. J. Smith had written to the Government, dated the 22nd November. What that proposal of different type might represent, I have no means of knowing. I can only say that, because of the discussion which the Minister had with the general manager on that Saturday, Mr. Smith on the Monday wrote to him a letter in which, in effect, he withdrew from further participation in the discussions, and the general proposal which had been made from the point of view of Australian Consolidated Industries Limited proved abortive, the Cabinet's proposal not being acceptable to Mr. Smith, and his proposal not being acceptable to the Government. Thus the slate was wiped clean when the Minister brought down the Motor Vehicle Engine Bounty Bill for the consideration of this Parliament. Therefore, I say, it was perfectly reasonable that, in the course of the debate on the Motor Vehicle Engine Bounty Bill, there was no obligation on the Minister for Trade and Customs-unles s he felt so disposed, which apparently he did not to occupy the time of the Parliament in discussing various proposals, not one of which, at that stage at all events, indicated that there was any possibility of practical development to the point of warranting an agreement being made between the Government and any one or other of the proponents. So this Parliament assembled to discuss a straight out proposal which would represent what the Government and the Parliament was ready to do in order to encourage the manufacture of motor vehicle engines in Australia. It is true that, for many years, the general practice of this Parliaparties ment in respect of the encouragement of Australian industries, and particularly of new industries, has been associated with certain general principles. The Parliament has the choice of greatly increasing the existing duties on goods imported, in order to give to the Australian manufacturer protection against competition by importers. As a matter of fact, on occasions the Parliament has ratified what are described as "" deferred duties "" ; that is to say, it has intimated that, after a given period, the duty imposed on a particular import will be increased. This has usually been 'associated with a proposal for the payment of a bounty. In this case, however, the Government decided to encourage Australian manufacturers, by means of a bounty, to engage in the manufacture of motor vehicle engines. The bill passed both Houses of Parliament. The Parliament then had no means of knowing whether or not any potential manufacturer would receive assistance in respect of the manufacture of motor vehicle engines in a form supplementary or additional to that prescribed in the Motor Vehicle Engine Bounty Act. Not even Mr Smith could have bad such knowledge at that time. Although he had made the proposal that he should be given assistance additional to the hoimty, ihe negotiations in respect of it had been terminated; they had not arrived anywhere, but, on the contrary, had ended. No other entrepreneur in Australia was in a position to know that an agreement of the type subsequently made with Australian Consolidated Industries Limited was open for negotiation. The Parliament takes the view: "" If we increase the duties on imports, we shall raise local costs to users of the commodity in Australia; therefore it is unwise, until we get the industry going and have a local source of supply, to increase the price that the user has to pay for an article which, for a period at least, must be imported, at the commencement in total and, as the industry in Australia becomes developed, probably in less volume, but during the whole of the time imported in competition with the growing output of the article manufactured in Australia "". So the principle of a bounty, as applied to the motor vehicle engine-whic h all in this House more or less agreed was a reasonable venture for Australia to embark upon-receive d overwhelming approval. During the course of the debate, indications were given as to what was expected of this industry. My Deputy Leader (Mr Eorde), who was in charge of the debate for the Opposition. made it - plum that we should welcome and assist the establishment, of this industry, that we approved of the principle of the bounty, but that there was one stipulation which we felt ought to be indicated, namely, that no monopoly should be established in connection with the manufacture of motor vehicle engines. Outside that point of major importance, the Opposition had no cavil against what the Government proposed to do. The extraordinary feature of the matter, in my view, is that, immediately the bill was passed by both Houses, and before the rest of the community who might be interested were in a position to know the terms of the Motor Vehicle Engine Bounty Act-as it had then becomenegotiations were apparently resumed with the General Manager of Australian Consolidated Industries Limited, with the result that certain matters moved rather quickly. I do not know the character of the discussions which took place at the resumed negotiations between whoever represented the Government-I understand from the speech of the Prime Minister that it' was the then Minister for Trade and Customs-and the General Manager of Australian Consolidated Industries Limited, or when those discussions took place, but I do know that, on the Wednesday following the passage of the legislation through both Houses of this Parliament, an officer of the Department of Trade and Customs wrote to an inquirer, indicating that the department bad no knowledge of any person who was likely to engage in the manufacture of motor-vehicle engines in Australia. That was on the 12th December, but on the Friday of that very week urgent telegrams were despatched by the Department of Trade and Oustoms to four companies in Australia asking them were they still interested in the proposals, is to say, in discussing how to manufacture motor-vehicle engines in Australia. At that stage the Motor Vehicle Engine Bounty Bill had become an act. That act limited the payment of the bounty in respect of the manufacture of motorvehicle engines to companies that were predominantly Australian in their capita] subscription and control. Quite clearly those four telegrams were despatched to Mr Curtin. companies which, without precise knowledge of their organizations, I venture to say, could regard themselves as being doubtfully qualified to engage further in discussing with the Government the manufacture of motor-vehicle engines. But ithe truth is that those urgent telegrams gave to those companies only 48 hours in which to communicate what their stand would be. The telegrams were despatched late on the Friday evening to executives that may or may not do business on Saturday morning. The replies were expected to be on hand on the Monday, because Cabinet was meeting on that day in Sydney. So, on the 15th December, those telegrams were despatched with requests for replies that were to be considered by a government which was to assemble within 48 hours and did so assemble. It would appear to me ithat at that Cabinet meeting on the 17th and ISth December, the Government made with a company an agreement in respect of the manufacture of motorvehicle engines which greatly extended the aid which ithis nation contemplated giving in respect of that manufacture, so far as the Parliament was taken into the confidence of the Government. So I felt, when I learned this, that, whatever be the arrangements that this Parliament approves in respect of the initiation of a new industry, those arrangements should be identical in character for the whole industrial community of this nation, and that there should not be available to any representative of a .company or group of companies knowledge that was withheld from the Parliament and from those who might enter into competition with that company or ithose companies.",35
133,Mr ROSEVEAII,MOTOR VEHICLES AGREEMENT,'The honourable member means that he objects to monopolies.,37
134,Mr CURTIN,MOTOR VEHICLES AGREEMENT,"I mean that nobody in this Parliament knew that it was that intended to invoke the provisions of the National Security Act in order to assist a particular company to withstand competition in Australia. Nobody knew that the Government in addition to paying the bounty would be willing to consider a .proposal to increase greatly the customs duties against competitive products as further protection. That is the point that I make and it seems to me to be germane; to be the very heart of this matter. It is said that this agreement with the Australian Consolidated Industries Limited is imperative if the Australian control of this mo tor-vehicle engine industry is to be secured. The answer to that is that the Motor Vehicle Engine Bounty Act provided for the Australian company protection against a foreign company that would manufacture within Australia. It provided for it in this way: If any company, which was not Australian predominantly-and there are such companies in Australia-engage d in the manufacture of motor-vehicle engines, it would he entitled to do so under the terms of the Motor Vehicle Engine Bounty Act, hut would not he paid the bounty. The Australian company that engaged in the manufacture of the engines would he paid ithe bounty. Thus the protection to the completely or predominantly controlled Australian company, as against a company predominantly controlled from outside Australia, was agreed to hy this Parliament. Parliament decided that the degree of the protection should be the payment of a bounty to Australian companies and the withholding of a bounty from foreign companies which manufactured engines in Australia.",37
135,Mr RANKIN,MOTOR VEHICLES AGREEMENT,Did the honourable member tell the people at Corio those facts?,38
136,Mr CURTIN,MOTOR VEHICLES AGREEMENT,"Yes , not the Ford company, but the electors of Corio, and no doubt that is when the knowledge of this matter, insofar as I was able to submit it, happened to become somewhat of a stalking horse in the by-election. That represents the position. The Government said, "" We will use the powers that were given to us as the result of the war in order to prevent any possible Australian competitor, who is able to get the requisite capital to engage in the manufacture of motor-car engines, from engaging in such manufacture"". That is more than this Parliament authorized when it passed the Motor Vehicle Engine Bounty Bill, and it is a departure from what I believe to be the essential principles of the initiation of a new industry in Australia. I and my party are willing to do our utmost to give protection to Australian industry as against external competitors by way of bounty because, not only can a bounty be supplementary to duties, but also it can be made subject to specific provision that, while foreign companies might manufacture in Australia in order to control and ultimately squeeze out of existence the Australian-owned enterprise, they may not enjoy the bounty. Provision for the payment of the bounty to one and not the other in those circumstances is a proper exercise of the powers of this Parliament to discriminate, as I hope it will always discriminate, in the interests of the Australian-owned enterprises. The Government did more than that, because, if it desired that Australian Consolidated Industries Limited should have protection only as against foreign competitors, the Motor Vehicle Engine Bounty Act provided that protection. But the agreement was made and the whole purpose and the only necessity for that agreement are the protection of Australian Consolidated Industries Limited, not against foreign companies that might manufacture in Australia, but against a rival group of Australian manufacturers that might seek to compete against it.",38
137,Sir HENRY GULLETT,MOTOR VEHICLES AGREEMENT,I cannot understand that point of view.,38
138,Mr CURTIN,MOTOR VEHICLES AGREEMENT,"Le t me put it to you then. The protection given to the Australian company as against the foreign company, both of them manufacturing in Australia, is set out in the bounty act. The Australian manufacturer manufacturing here will get the bounty, but the foreign manufacturer manufacturing in Australia will not get it.",38
139,Sir HENRY GULLETT,MOTOR VEHICLES AGREEMENT,Unde r the agreement ?,38
140,Mr CURTIN,MOTOR VEHICLES AGREEMENT,"No , under the law.",38
141,Sir HENRY GULLETT,MOTOR VEHICLES AGREEMENT,To what extent?,38
142,Mr CURTIN,MOTOR VEHICLES AGREEMENT,"The bounty act makes it contrary to the law for the bounty to be paid to the company whose share capital is not, and control is not, predominantly Australian.",38
143,Mr BEASLEY,MOTOR VEHICLES AGREEMENT,Sixty-si x per cent. Australian.,38
144,Mr CURTIN,MOTOR VEHICLES AGREEMENT,"I used the word "" predominantly "" because two-thirds is predominantly. That is clear. The Australian manufacturer alone will get the bounty. We agreed in this Parliament to that being the case and I am not one bit abating my support for that principle. I stand for it today. If there were no agreement, any group of manufacturers in Australia would be free to start the manufacture of engines and to get the bounty-an y number of them, any two of them, any four of them. The only impediment to that being done is the conelusion of this agreement with Australian Consolidated Industries Limited. I believe Australian Consolidated Industries Limited has been sincerely desirous of helping the establishment of this industry - it has been most energetic in the matter - bu t I see no reason why it should be assured of a monopoly in this industry as against fellow Australians.",38
145,Mr ROSEVEAR,MOTOR VEHICLES AGREEMENT,Is there any suggestion that there was an Australian group in opposition to Australian Consolidated Industries Limited?,39
146,Mr CURTIN,MOTOR VEHICLES AGREEMENT,"If there were no other company likely to engage in the enterprise, why the necessity for the agreement ?",39
147,Mr BEASLEY,MOTOR VEHICLES AGREEMENT,Anothe r company would have to put up the proposition and show that it could carry it through.,39
148,Mr CURTIN,MOTOR VEHICLES AGREEMENT,"It would have to get its capital. If it could not produce engines, its business would fail and its capital would be lost. This Parliament does not pay a bounty only because a company starts. It pays the bounty if engines are produced according to specifications as to iiorse power. This Parliament left the field open to Australian enterprises to manufacture motor engines; but the agreement closes the field to all Australian enterprises with the exception of Australian Consolidated Industries Limited.",39
149,Sir HENEV GULLETT,MOTOR VEHICLES AGREEMENT,That was the purpose of the agreement.,39
150,Mr CURTIN,MOTOR VEHICLES AGREEMENT,"Whether that be so or not, that is the result it achieves. Solely because of that result I am opposed to the ratification of this agreement. If the Government really felt that the only practical and economic way in which to manufacture motor-vehicle engines in Australia was through the instrumentality of a monopoly, it should have said so when the whole business was before Parliament; but no hint was given to Parliament, when we were dealing with the bounty bill, that, that was so. Parliament should have been told. We know that Ministers had been engaged in looking at the matter from that aspect. The Prime; Minister said that he put it to State premiers and they would not agree. He could not have done it but for the outbreak of war and the powers vested in the Government by the National Security Act. The position of the Opposition is clear. It is in favour of the establishment of this industry, but it believes that the field should not be restricted to one company. It believes that: what has occurred in connection with the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited may occur again; the magnitude of the company's operations may give to it a much greater field thana smaller company could hope to obtain. That is the inevitable result of competition being overcome, not without the authority of Parliament, but in the absence of any direction by Parliament. Whatever this Parliament does, it should not set out definitely to encourage and facilitate the establishment of monopolies. It should oppose their formation. The agreement is unnecessary if only one company is likely to manufacture motor vehicle engines in Australia, and it is unjust if more than one company is likely to start such operations. Therefore, I move That all the words after the word "" That "" be omitted, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words:"" the opportunity to nramifacture motor-car chassis, including the engine, be afforded to more than one Australian company whose capital, structure and control are in accordance with section 6, sub-section (1 ) , paragraphs (a) and (7>), of the Motor Vehicle Engine Bounty Act, and that immediate steps be taken to amend the proposed agreement between the Commonwealth and Australian Consolidated not Industries Limited to give effect to the foregoing; and furthermore, that in the event of more than one Australian company being established for the said purpose, the number of engines and the total amount of bounty payment be reviewed "". The latter section of the amendment has been inserted because of the argument advanced by the Prime Minister and various sectionsof the press that, if there were more than two companies, the unit of manufacture would have to be reduced in each ease, so that there might be grounds for seeking an increase of the bounty. Should that argument be borne out, my amendment, it' agreed to, will leave the way open for the bounty to be increased. It does not provide merely that the bounty shall be increased.",39
151,Mr MENZIES,MOTOR VEHICLES AGREEMENT,". 1 think that the Labour party will lose the Corio scat on that amendment at the general elections. Mr. Curtin"" - I do not think so. The right honourable gentleman raised so many issues at the recent by-election in the iCorio Division that I. am not sure whether it was this issue or some other one that was responsible for the defeat, of the Government's candidate. The Labour party does not put forward programmes or state cases merely in order to meet a possible contingency in a certain place. It has always regarded the subject of the manufacture of motor cars and their pants in Australia in the light of its national importance. That is its policy in connection with a great number of other things.",40
152,Sir HENRY GULLETT,MOTOR VEHICLES AGREEMENT,The Leader of i be Opposition,40
153,Mr CURTIN,MOTOR VEHICLES AGREEMENT,"The Acting Minister lor Information, who has been so kind as to thrust himself into the debate ait this juncture, knows that when he was in imposition, he voted for the lowest possible rate3 of tariff, but when he moved to the Government side of the House, he voted for the highest rates possible! The Opposition is uncompromisingly opposed to the agreement, the only real effect of which would be the limitation of Australian capital and enterprise in respect of the manufacture of motor-vehicle engines to Australian Consolidated In dustries Limited. I commend to the House the amendment which I have moved.",40
154,Mr FORDE,MOTOR VEHICLES AGREEMENT,"I second the amendment, reserving my right to speak later.  I very much regret that Parliament - should be required to discuss a bill of this kind at a time of Empire crisis. The hill must inevitably divide not only the House, but also the Government, at a time when the Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies) himself has appealed to the nation for a closing of the ranks and a sinking of differences. It seems to me to be impossible to deal with a measure such as this without accentuating party differences of opinion. About six months [52] ago, this Parliament passed a bill providing for the payment of a bounty on the production of motorcar engines in Australia. That measure was a practical gesture of encouragement to anybody interested in the manufacture of motor car engines. The bill now before the House goes beyond that, first by restricting the right to receive bounty to one company, and secondly, by attempting to restrict the right to manufacture motor car engines to one firm. .Before proceeding to examine the bill in detail, honourable members should ask themselves this pertinent question: Will this new industry, if started by mean3 of the encouragement offered in the bill, help us to win the war? The war has reached a, stage at which all of us realise that we must, not only put more trained men in the field, but also direct our maximum industrial effort to the production of the things which are essential for the winning of the war. We must enormously increase our output of guns, aeroplanes, and munitions, and we must immediately embark upon a programme of shipbuilding,"" a work which would definitely assist us to win the war. In order to answer the question - as to whether the manufacture of motor vehicles in Australia would also assist our war effort, I draw attention to the evidence given on behalf of the Department of Defence to the Tariff Board regarding the value of this industry from a defence point of view. On page 22 of the Tariff Board's report, the evidence given by the then secretary of the Department of Defence, Mr. Shepherd, is recorded as follows: The military authorities are of opinion that there are ample lorries and motor cars in Australia to meet the requirements of the fighting services in war extending over a considerable period, even after allowing for essential civil requirements, as civil motor transport is likely to he sevcrciy restricted by shortage of fuel.",40
155,Mr FORDE,MOTOR VEHICLES AGREEMENT,When was that inquiry held?  ago.,40
156,Mr FORDE,MOTOR VEHICLES AGREEMENT,"The report is dated 1937 - the e years ago. The inquiry was probably held much earlier.  skilled men capable of producing guns, aeroplanes, munitions and ships, and of forming efficient ground staffs for the Royal Australian A i r Force is by no means inexhaustible. The A i r Force aeroplane factories are today short of their requirements of To draw upon that reservoir of skilled, or partly skilled, labour for any purpose other than the production of war requirements would impede the national war effort and reduce the maximum rate of production which could otherwise be attained. I draw the atten- tion of the House to answers given the other day by the Minister for Supply and Development (Sir Frederick Stewart) to questions asked in this House by the right honourable member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page). The questions were1. Are there sufficient trained men to work three shifts in the manufacture of aeroplanes in various factories? 2. If so, are three shifts being worked? 3. If not, can arrangements be made for the working of three shifts to expedite the output of complete aeroplanes? . The Minister stated in reply1. Not at present. 2. (i) In Wirraway production, in addition to the full day shift in the engine and .aircraft factories, a half capacity afternoon shift is being worked in each factory and a half capacity night shift in the engine factory. (ii) In Tiger Moth production by De Havilland of Sydney, a single shift is being worked, but arrangements are being made for this production to be speeded up immediately. (iii) The Beaufort production will be commenced on single shift and increased to double and treble shift production as soon as possible. 3. The .working of three shifts in these tories is dependent upon (i) training of supervisors; (ii) availability of materials; (iii) obtaining of tradesmen and the training of other operatives. The training of personnel is proceeding, and every effort will be made to secure a sufficient number of trained men to serve the needs of this and other industries vital to the defence requirements. Those answers are relevant to the subject before the House today. Not one man should be encouraged, especially by the Government, to engage in a new non-essential industry until the nation's full requirements of skilled labour for its war effort are obtained. For the reasons I have stated, I give notice that I intend to move, as an addendum to the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr C u r t in )That the following words be added to those proposed to be inserted:-""but the manufacture of motor-vehicle engineB  in Australia be deferred until such time as, in the opinion of Parliament (expressed by Resolution) arrangements have been made and proved to be effective to overcome the inadequacy of the warartisans. time supply of munitions and aeroplanes, and to commence a programme of shipbuilding, so that Australia's maximum industrial effort in the production of the things most essential to win the war may not be impeded"".",40
157,Mr ROSEVEAR,MOTOR VEHICLES AGREEMENT,"If we cannot manufacture motor cars, how can we manufacture ships?  can. manufacture both, but we should not drain our resources of trained man-power in order to do something which is not essential to the nation's war effort. This is. a bill of restrictions, or monopoly provisions. I draw attention to paragraph 12 of the schedule of the bill which is one of the assurances proposed to be given by the Commonwealth to this one firm, Australian Consolidated Industries Limited. It statesThat the Commonwealth will use its best endeavours to limit production of motor cars and trucks of 15 horse-power or over to the proposed company for a period of five years. It is one thing to confine the bounty to one firm, and an entirely different thing to refuse to other firms the right to manufacture motor cars. Such a prohibition of manufacture is almost unthinkable in this country. The Leader of the Opposition dealt more particularly with Australian firms employing Ausfac- tralian capital, but I propose to carry his argument a little further and ask what would happen if other big establishments which are now operating in this country, such as the Ford Motor Company or General Motors-Holdens Limited, should conclude that their established connexions would be adversely affected by a tightening of the restricted quotas which operate today in respect of imported chassis-and it might well be argued tjhat further restrictions may naturally be expected as the corollary to local manufacture-and they decided to manufacture engines and chassis here? I have had no communication with either of the firms mentioned, but I imagine that those firms would decide that they would manufacture their own engines and chassis here in Australia without a bounty rather than run the risk of losing their business assistance to and the connexions which they have built up. Supposing these firms were to say, "" ""We cannot obtain a bounty, because the conditions under which our capital has been subscribed preclude us from obtaining it ; but rather than lose the business that we have built up, we think that it is preferable, even though we may lose money for a time, to build our own engines and chassis in this country"". Is it proposed, under paragraph 12 of the schedule, absolutely to prohibit the manufacture by such firms of engines and chassis in Australia, even though no bounty be payable to them? Even if in war-time we have the power to do such a thing, on what reasonable ground could those powers be invoked? It seems to me that we can say, "" Y o u cannot have a bounty because your capital has not been raised in the way that entitles you to it "" ; but the suggestion that we may say, "" Y o u shall not manufacture engines or chassis here even without a bounty"" is one of the most extraordinary things that I have ever heard in this Parliament. Last week, the Prime Minister, in what was undoubtedly an admirable speech from his point of view, referred to these companies as "" foreign companies making huge profits"". No doubt the reference to huge profits is true- I notice that one of these companies is paying for the year just closed a dividend of 55 per cent, on its ordinary shares-bu t the point I make is that the inference to be drawn, and the inference which I think the right honourable gentleman intended to be drawn, from his reference to foreign companies making huge profits, was that the high prices of cars in this country, and the huge profits made by the industry, are due to our dependence on imported chassis. The Tariff Board report shows definitely that it is not in that direction that we must look to .account for the very high prices of cars in Australia. That prices of cars in this country are exceedingly high, no one doubts. If any one wishes to compare the prices here with those obtaining for similar vehicles in the United States of America, he will see a most interesting table on the last page of the Tariff Board's report. There is there a list of five American cars, which shows that, when the American price is converted iuto Australian currency, the prices charged for those cars in Australia is, in one instance, two-and-a-half times the price ruling in the United States of America. Although the prices shown in the table were those which ruled about two years ago, I submit that the comparison is quite good today. The following table shows the respective prices charged in the United States of America and in Australia for the five cars mentioned:Price in Make of Car. United States Price in Australia. . of America. £ s. d. £ a. d. Terraplane 198 0 0 445 0 0 Chevrolet standard . . 163 0 0 349 0 0 Oldsmobilo 224 0 0 445 0 0 Fontiac 215 0 0 430 0 0 Plymouth de luxe . . 176 10 0 439 0 0 1 Honourable members will see that in respect of the Oldsmobile and Pontiac cars, the Australian price is double the American price ; that the price charged in Australia for a standard Chevrolet is 2£ times the American price; that the Terraplane costs 2\ times as much here as in the country of manufacture; and that for the Plymouth de Luxe 2-J times the American price has to be paid by the Australian purchaser. Where have we to look to find the explanation of the extravagant prices charged in Australia compared with the American prices for similar cars ? Whatever the reason, I emphasize that it is not clue to the necessity to import the chassis and engines. The portion of the car which is imported-the chassis, which includes engine, frame, axles, driving shaft, steering gear, most of the electrical equipment, and some other parts, which I submit are the most important parts of the car-is seen to be by far its cheapest part. If honourable members want evidence on that point, I direct their attention to page 13 of the Tariff Board's report, where they will see a table which sets out the landed cost, freight paid but without duty, of the chassis of certain American and Canadian, as well as British cars. The landed cost, without duty, of American and Canadian chassis, represents 22 per cent, of the final cost to the Australian public of such cars. That is to say, the landed cost of an American or Canadian chassis, which is sold as a completed car in this country at £350, is £77. I am one of those who would like to see manufacture extended in this country, so long as it can be done on lines that are even reasonably economic; but whether we can ever produce at a price even remotely approaching £77 the parts of a car that can be imported for that sum, remains to be seen. We can definitely lay down that it is not here that we must look for an explanation of the high prices of cars in Australia, because after a chassis is landed its price is multiplied four and a half times.",41
158,Mr ROSEVEAR,MOTOR VEHICLES AGREEMENT,"Would it not bo fairer to add the duty before making the comparison ?  actual cost, because no duty would be collected on locally-made chassis. I admit that the duty is a matter to be taken into consideration. The £95 flat rate of customs duty imposed on imported sedan bodies is probably a greater contributing factor to the high price of motor cars in this country than is the fact that we have to import the chassis. Because of the efficient mass-production methods which are employed in Australian motor ear body-building, I believe that a duty of about one-quarter of £95 on imported sedan bodies would give ample protection to the local industry. The reduction of the duty to that ievel would at least compel the distributors of cars to sell them at lower prices. With the trade door just a little bit ajar, they would be compelled to make their prices conform more closely to competitive levels in other parts of the world; but when the door is locked, bolted, and barred by an absolute prohibitive tariff on motor-car bodies, it is open to these companies to charge very much higher prices than would otherwise be possible. Sound though these arguments may be in themselves-and I submit that they are absolutely incontrovertible- I do not - wish that they shall disturb the main argument of my speech. I want to impress on honourable members that the grim reality of the war situation demands that we shall concentrate our industrial manpower on the production of those things which are essential to victory. We can look to the manufacture of motor car engines and chassis as a possible means of absorbing skilled labour after the war is over. I repeat that for the present, we should concentrate the energies of our mechanics, fitters, engineers and improvers upon guns, aeroplanes, munitions, and ships, and refuse to encourage the sidetracking of any part of our maximum industrial war effort to what, after all, is not essential work today. I shall later move the amendment which I have foreshadowed.",43
159,Mr SPEAKER,MOTOR VEHICLES AGREEMENT,Hon. G. J. Bell) The amendment foreshadowed by the honourable member for Gippsland may not be moved until the House has decided that the words which the Leader of the Opposition has moved to omit should be omitted. The honourable member may move his amendment only when the question of inserting certain words is before the House.  Io move my amendment as an addendum to the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition when that honourable gentleman moves to insert the words proposed to he inserted.,43
160,Mr DEDMAN,MOTOR VEHICLES AGREEMENT,"iCorio) [3.31] - In moving the motion for the second reading of this bill the Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies) expressed curiosity as to where I would stand in connection with the proposal to establish the motor vehicle engine manufacturing industry in this country. I shall satisfy his curiosity at once. I favour the manufacture of the complete motor vehicle in Australia at the earliest possible date compatible with the availability of the skill, labour and resources to do the work. I wish to contrast the procrastination of the Lyons Government during the four years preceding the introduction of the Motor Vehicle Engine Bounty Bill with the indecent haste that has been manifested by this Government, in the last six mouths or so, to give a certain Australian company a monopoly in relation to this undertaking. In 1936 the Lyons Government undertook to investigate the possibility of establishing this industry in the Commonwealth. If the Labour party had been in power at that time, the industry - would have been actually established long before .this. If grave concern. the Government then in office had informed those already engaged here in the making of motor car bodies that it was prepared, by the provision of certain protective duties, to encourage the construction of complete motor vehicle engines here, the industry could have been established within two years without the provision of any bounty. A degree of inertia has been exhibited in connection with this proposal by certain companies already engaged in the manufacture of motor car bodies and parts within the Commonwealth. I concede quite frankly that from their own point of view those companies had adequate reasons for their attitude. Take as an example the position of the Ford Motor Company of Australia Limited, which is controlled by the Ford Motor Company of Canada. The Canadian company has established a unit of production in the sister dominion which manufactures 100,000 motor engines per annum. Obviously, it is of greater advantage to that company to manufacture in Canada all of the engines it requires than to divide its production and manufacture 80,000 engines in Canada and 20,000 in Australia. I suppose what I have just said applies, with equal force, to General Motors-IIoldens Limited. Had the Government faced the situation in a statesmanlike way, it could have issued what I shall describe as an ultimatum to the interested companies, that it had decided that within, say, two years the manufacture of the complete motor vehicle must be carried out within Australia. It could also have laid on the table of Parliament an appropriate tariff schedule to ensure the degree of protection that it considered necessary to achieve this end. Had that been done in 1930, motor vehicle engines could have been manufactured in Australia by 1938, with the result that for the last four years this country would have enjoyed an increasing benefit from an expansion of employment, and a greater development of certain resources which it possesses. We should also have had today a reserve of skilled labour and equipment upon which we could have drawn for the manufacture of munitions and aircraft, the lack of which is nowl causing us such Candidly, I believe that even if at this late date the Government would undertake an immediate survey of our available man-power and our resources of material and equipment needed for this work, it would find that Ave could adopt a step-bystep production of equipment which would enable us to reach our goal of the complete manufacture of motor engines without the provision of any bounty at all. That, in my opinion, would be the best way to tackle this problem. However, between 1936 and 1938 the Government did nothing whatsoever, and in 1938 it merely referred the whole subject to the Tariff Board for investigation. The Tariff Board subsequently presented a. report, which advocated the establishment of this industry in stages of one step ot a time.",43
161,Mr BLACKBURN,MOTOR VEHICLES AGREEMENT,"It did not "" ask to see the distant scene "". Mr Dedman"" - No . Consequent upon the furnishing of the report by the Tariff Board the Ford Motor Company of Australia Limited submitted certain proposals to the Government in March, 1939. As stated by the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr. Paterson), the position at that time was that, of the total value of the finished motor car, 80 per cent, was represented by Australian industry and manufacture. Only 20 per cent, of the total value was represented by imported parts and only 25 per cent, of that 20 per cent, was represented by the engines. The Ford motor company made an offer to the Government to concentrate upon the manufacture in Australia of those imported parts comprising 75 per cent, of the 20 per cent, imported; that is to say, on imported parts other than the engine. That proposal would have involved the expenditure of £350,000 on capital equipment, and it would also have provided for the continuous employment of an additional 150 employees, together with the use of an additional 3,000 tons of steel annually, as well as certain leather goods and trimmings necessary to the finished article. The Government entirely ignored that offer. Towards the end of 1939 this Parliament passed the Motor Vehicle Engine Bounty Act. I am not certain about the negotiations the Government conducted with Australian Consolidated Industries Limited prior to the passing of that measure. This point is abundantly clear,, however, that the passing of the act com' pletely altered the conditions that had previously existed in the motor-car industry of Australia. An entirely new set of conditions was laid down, which no one can deny altered the basis upon which the Ford Motor Company, of Geelong, and General Motors-Holdens Limited, of Adelaide, were operating. The bill was assented to by His Excellency the Governor General on Friday, the l'5th December. The ink could not have been dry on that signature before telegrams were despatched to, I understand, four different companies in Australia. I shall deal particularly with the Ford Motor Company. The telegram that was despatched to that company at 6.35 p.m. on that day asked whether it had any proposals to make to the Government in conformity with the new conditions laid down in the act just assented to - The telegram readManaging Director, Ford Motor Company, Geelong. Would appreciate telegraphed advice at latest early Monday morning whether your company is interested in motor vehicle engine and chassis manufacture in Australia in accordance with terms set out in Motor Vehicle Engine Bounty Act passed by Commonwealth Parliament this month. Kindly reply Sydney Customs House. Minister for Trade and Customs. A five-day week is worked at the Ford Motor Company's establishment at Geelong, and no work is done on Saturday. Yet the telegram required a reply by .Monday at the latest. On Monday, at 10.25 .a.m., the managing director of the Ford Motor Company .at Geelong despatched the following telegram to the then Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr John Lawson) :LAWSON, Minister Trade and Customs, Care Customs House, Sydney. Replying, your telegram December 15th, my company is interested in any development affecting the future of the automotive inilfr. Dedman. dustry. Have not received a copy of .th'o Bounty Act, but from press reports I gather that under its provisions my company is not eligible to make you any proposals owing to its corporate structure with non-resident shareholders. Under date March 29th, 1939, my company submitted to the Government certain proposals for the manufacturing of important chassis components. 1 would be pleased to again discuss the whole question with you at such time and place as may suit your convenience. NA Managing Director Ford Motor Company. On the next day, certain correspondence passed between the Commonwealth Government and Australian Consolidated Industries Limited which we are asked to believe amounted to a completed agreement. Thus we see the sequence of events. The bill was assented to on Friday. Late on Friday night, a telegram was sent to this company asking if it had any proposal to make, and giving it 48 hours to send a reply. The company sent its reply on Monday, and the agreement was entered into with the company on Tuesday. Earlier in my speech I described this as indecent haste, but, really, words fail me to describe adequately this callous disregard of existCanberra, 0.35 p.m. ing industries engaged in the manufac15 December, 1930. ture of motor cars in Australia. Honourable members may have read a book by Ellen Wilkinson called The Murder of a Town. This agreement is, in effect, the deliberate murder of industries already established in Australia.",44
162,Mr LANE,FRENCH,'The honourable member is a good advocate for foreign companies.,45
163,Mr DEDMAN,FRENCH,"Le t me remind IiAWSON, honourable members that the Ford Motor Company in Australia is not a foreign company, although it is referred to as such by the Prime Minister in one of his letters to Australian Consolidated In dustries Limited. The Ford Motor Company of Australia Limited is owned and controlled by the Ford Motor Company of Canada, which is entirely separate from the original American company. The Ford Motor Company of the United States of America sold, its rights to a Geelong, 10.25 a.m. Canadian company owned and controlled 18 December, 1939. by Canadian shareholders. I can imagine the uproar there would be on the other side of the House if I were to refer to the Canadian Expeditionary Force in France as a foreign army. The Ford Motor Company of Canada is not a foreign company; it is a British company, and' I strongly object to the use of the word "" foreign"" in the correspondence which led up to this supposed agreement. Having regard to the critical position of Great Britain ait this moment, I say that it is the wrong time for Parliament to deliver what amounts to a "" kick in the pants "" to any American - company interested in industries already established in Australia. The Prime Minister has eulogized Australian Consolidated Industries Limited directly, and has done so indirectly by trying to throw mud on those who undertook the initial processes associated with the manufacture of entire motor cars in Australia. Those who live in glass houses monopoly profits. ought not to throw stones. Australian Consolidated Industries Limited began as the Australian Glass Company. started with a capital of a little over Motor Company. £250,000. By means of mergers and the purchase of other businesses out of disclosed profits, it established a monoper poly in the manufacture of glass in tralia. Throughout the years, the comwas pany has paid very high dividends, amounting to 19 per cent, on one occaquoted sion, and 21 per cent, on another occaeach. sion. Not only was it able to pay such they rose to 38s. dividends, but it was also able to accumulate such big reserves that in March, 1939, it produced out of the hat, as it were, close on £4,500,000, which was issued as undistributed profits to its shareholders. Eleven fully paid-up shares were issued for every four shares originally held. Here is what one financial journal, pubmeasure, lished in January, 1940, had to say of operations of this company- . Earnings of Australian Consolidated Indusover normal profit. tries Limited as per accounts of the twelve months, although representing about 9 per cent, on the present market value of the shares, represents 33 per cent, flat old ordinary capital. Here is an extract from the Investment Digest of March, 1939, the date on which the distribution of bonus shares took placeThe method of distributing bonus shares is designed to exempt it from higher capitalization will permit a distribution of the same amount of profits at a lower rate of dividend, and thus prevent the public criticism that might be directed against higher rate of dividend. The company evaded taxation-/ on the whole of the £4,500,000 which ;was distributed in the form of bonus shares. I have said that these bonus shares came out of the hat. In point of fact, they came out of the pockets of the Australian people. Every milk bottle, every beei bottle, every glass utensil, every window pane in the humblest cottage paid tribute to this financial octopus. Every one of the 1,500,000 householders in Australia has paid tribute to an amount of £3 to the lords of Australian Consolidated Industries Limited. I do not need to hazard a guess at the profits which this company hopes to make out of its monopoly agreement, because I can calculate from the share quotations on the Stock Exchange exactly what is the expectation of",45
164,Mr FADDEN,FRENCH,The honourable member It can gauge it from the profits of the Ford,46
165,Mr DEDMAN,FRENCH,"The Ford Motor unCompany has never paid more than 15 cent., and frequently the dividends Aushave been less. Before this agreement entered into, the shares of Australian Consolidated Industries Limited were on the Stock Exchange, at 31s. After the making of the agreement,",46
166,Mr JOHN LAWSON,FRENCH,That is not true.,46
167,Mr DEDMAN,FRENCH,"It is true.. That was an appreciation of 7s. a share which, on a capital of nearly £4,000,000, represented a total appreciation of share value, because of the monopoly agreement, of approximately £1,000,000. That is the not of the total profits expected the to accrue from this agreement, but only of the expected excess of monopoly profit If that profit last is divided by the number of units only which it is proposed to manufacture on under the terms of the agreement, it will be seen that every single motor-car engine will be loaded with a charge of approximately £20 to pay principal and interest on the increased share appreciation. That is what the consumers would have to pay because of the monopoly character taxation. The of this agreement. I believe that the Prime Minister has, accidentally perhaps, confused the House a regarding the issue at stake. According to a press statement on the 31st January last, the Prime Minister reported as having saidThe Commonwealth Government has decided that, having regard to the issues raised in relation to the. agreement made by it with Australian Consolidated Industries in respect of motor engine and chassis manufacture in Australia, the whole transaction will be submitted to the Commonwealth Parliament for ratification when Parliament rc-asscmbles. This will mean that, pending ratification, the operation of the contract will be suspended. Later on in the same statement, reference is made to the "" agreement"". I take the point that there is no agreement, and there certainly is no contract, as mentioned in the statement of the Prime Minister. A contract is an agreement enforceable at law. I understand that it must consist in an offer and an acceptance. We have an offer by Australian Consolidated Industries Limited, but the letter of the Prime Minister to Australian Consolidated Industries Limited does not, in any sense of the term, constitute an acceptance of the original offer. It does, in fact, make a counter offer. That counter offer has not been accepted by Australian Consolidated Industries Limited, and, consequently, no agreement or contract exists at this moment for Parliament to ratify. Even if this Parliament passes what purports to be an agreement, all that it can do is to say that, within the terms set forth in the schedule-the terms announced in these two letters-at some future date an agreement or contract may be made between the Commonwealth Government and Australian Consolidated Industries Limited. I mention this, because I - understood the Prime Minister to say that Australian Consolidated Industries Limited was to be commended for having agreed to suspend the operation of the contract. There is no contract; consequently, it ought not to be commended for what it has not done. In regard to the terms of the bill itself, there is no definite undertaking the assurances of either Australian Consolidated Industries Limited or statesthe Commonwealth as to when the manufacture of motor-vehicle engines endeavoursThat will commence. In the first paragraph and of the undertaking of Australian Conthe solidated Industries Limited the word pears. ""ultimately"" is used. That deficiency ought to be rectified. If the bill reaches an interjection, stated that Mr Dedvian. is a later stage, I propose to move an amendment to the effect that the time within which the actual manufacture of these engines shall be commenced shall be explicitly stated in the agreement. I believe that the agreement should provide that, of the 20,000 units contemplated, at least 33 per cent, should be produced during the first year, a further 33 per cent, in the second year, and the balance within three years. I repeat, that there is nothing in the bill to show whether the company will begin its operations this year, next year, or within the five years mentioned in paragraph 12 of the proposed agreement. In actual fact, if Parliament should decide to agree to the proposals contained in the bill, this comnany could sit tight on its monopoly until the war had ended, when it could purchase capital, equipment cheaply and then begin its manufacturing operations, j>rovided, of course, that the war was over within the five years mentioned in paragraph 12.",46
168,Mr MCEVUGH,FRENCH,"That would be profitable to the company. Mr Dedman"" -'Certainly , it would be profitable. That is what is in the mind of the company; it wishes to secure the monopoly now and, for its own financial benefit, endeavour to operate it after the war has terminated. I have already referred to another portion of the bill which I think should be amended. Under the heading "" Assurances by Commonwealth"", in paragraph 10 of the schedule, the Commonwealth gives the assurance that it will safeguard the interests of the proposed company against the establishment of similar manufacture in Australia by foreign or foreign-controlled companies. I want the meaning of "" foreign "" to be clarified. Then there is paragraph 12 of the schedule, the meaning of which, I believe, the honor son) has not completely understood; nor in does he realise the effect it would have on existing Australian industries. It the Commonwealth will use its best to limit :production of motor cars trucks of fifteen horse-power or over to proposed company for a period of five The Prime Minister, in answer to there Avas form but not substance in the charge that this legislation, if passed, would entirely eliminate the Ford motor works in Geelong, and the works of General Motors-Holdens Limited in South Australia. I contend that there is substance in that charge, and that proof of it is furnished hy the wording of this particular paragraph, the interpretation of which is, that the Commonwealth will use every effort at its disposal to limit the production of motor cars and trucks. Limitation of production is not to be confined to engines, but may include the entire motor car and truck. Under the National Security Act, the Commonwealth has at its disposal the most effective means of preventing production. If the enforcement of this provision were insisted on by Australian Consolidated Industries Limited under a properly drawn contract, the Government would be compelled to prohibit entirely the manufacture, not only of engines, but also of the entire motor car and chassis, by any company except, Australian Consolidated Industries. Limited. I therefore say that there is very considerable substance in the charge that the carrying out of this agreement, would completely obliterate the motor-body building industry in Geelong and South Australia. I have always understood that lawyers are able to express tlieir meaning in exact terms. I have told the House exactly what I understand this particular paragraph to mean, and I believe that, all honourable members will agree that I have given the correct meaning. If that he not the meaning intended by the Prime Minister, who is a. very learned lawyer, he ought, not. to have used such terms. I remind honourable members that the Ford Motor Company of Australia Limited is a decentralized industry; it .maintains not only its main plant in Geelong, but also an assembly plant in New South Wales, Queensland and AVestern Australia. From a defence as well as. a decentralization point of view, the existing structure of the motorbody building industry is much better than would be the case if Australian Consolidated Industries Limited held a monopoly and had its plant in any one State. Another very strong objection that I have to the proposed agreement, as it stands, is that it makes no mention whatever of profits. In a previous measure, passed by Parliament for the payment of a bounty in respect of the manufacture of radiators, the definite provision was made that if the company concerned earned profits in excess of 10 per cent., the bounty payable would be correspondingly reduced. I consider that a similar safeguard ought to be inserted in this measure.",47
169,Mr GKEGOKY,FRENCH,We ought to throw the bill out altogether.,48
170,Mr DEDMAN,FRENCH,"I believe that it should be so amended as to permit the participation in the industry of other interests as well as Australian Consolidated Industries Limited. There is another aspect which I think was passed over very lightly by the Prime Minister, when he stated, in effect, that the skilled Avorkers necessary to establish ihe industry today Would be very feAv in number, and that only process Avorkers would be required. As a matter of fact, the investigations undertaken by the Tariff Board prove that statement to be entirely wrong. All . of . the skilled workers Avill be required in the initial stage, and it is in the; later . stages of manufacture that process .workers will be engaged. The report of the. board laid particular stress on the fact .that in the initial stops necessary to establish this industry, a very large number of highly skilled men, such as tool-makers, diemakers, - jig-makers, and makers of fixtures and presses for the "" operations concerned, Would be required. It AV5.11 thus be seen that the statement of the Prime Minister is highly inaccurate. Remembering the reply given this morning by the Minister for Air (Mr Fairbaim), to the effect that it is impossible to secure the services of the number of skilled workers needed for the aircraft industry. .1. begin to. wonder Avhere the Prime Minister proposes to find the skilled workers necessary to establish this mo tor-vehicle engine industry in Australia. . . In another respect, I believe that the right, honourable gentleman glossed over very lightly a great difficulty that has to he encountered. I refer to the demand on American dollars. I quite realise that he made a fair statement of the position; but I contend that he did not draw from that statement the implications it contains. What he stated was, that the demand on American dollars by reason of the establishment of this industry in Australia, would be very large in the initial stage, but that, if the industry were not now established, there would be a small constant demand on American dollars extending over a number of years. I took him to mean that, in respect of the demand on American dollars, the only difference between the proposal to establish the industry immediately, and - the proposal to delay it for a number of years, is that, in the one case, the demand would be high but would bo confined to one year, and that in the other case, it would be spread over a number of years. I agree ithat that is a perfectly true statement of the position; but our concern is to conserve our dollars this year and next year, 'not four or five years hence, and I say that the establishment of this industry now would drain our American dollars.",48
171,Mr JOHN LAWSON,FRENCH,"So ithe honourable member does not think that the industry should ""not .'be established in this country at all? ,! ' Mr ""DEDMAN' - I stated my position at the beginning of my speech and I shall presently state it again for the benefit of the honourable member. . \ Leave -. to continue given.] I believe, that the Commonwealth Government .has exceeded its powers in this proposed, agreement, which sets out in paragraph 12That ' the Commonwealth will use its best endeavours to l i m it production of motor cars and trucks of 15 horse-power or over to the proposed company for a .period of five years. That pow.er is taken under the National Security Act. If this war lasts for t»vo years does the National Security Act, which was passed as a defence measure, cover the other three years of those five years? No. The Government, therefore, has exceeded its powers under the Constitution in that paragraph and that in itself is sufficient reason for the House to carry the amendment moved by my leader.  the words ""use its best endeavours"" are used.",49
172,Mr DEDMAN,FRENCH,"Paraphrased , that means that the Government will use every power to obliterate the motor body-building industry in this country. In support of my contention that paragraph 12 is ultra vires the Constitution I shall quote a legal opinion that I have received. It is an opinion given by Mr Wilbur Ham, KC., and is in these termsI n view of my clear opinion that the letters do not constitute a binding contract and that the bill as framed could not make of the uncertainties and disagreements in the letters .an enforceable agreement or any agreement at all , it is not necessary to consider the very difficult constitutional questions as to the validity of any act which sought to authorize such "" matters"". The purpose of such act would go outside the customs power and the bounties power and, though the defence power is wide, its high-water mark is to he found in Farey v. Burnett 21 C.L.R. 433; it only authorized general price-fixing limits on the .price of bread "" d u r in g the - present state of w a r "" . The proposal is not so .limited but is designed to give one company the monopoly for five years, irrespective of the duration of the war, to the entire exclusion of all other companies that come within the scope of the Motor Vehicle Engine Bounty Act of 1930. section fi.. or any other manufacturers. I submit that because paragraph 12 is ultra vires Parliament should refuse to ratify this agreement as it has been submitted. I stated at the beginning my attitude towards the manufacture of the complete motor car in this country. * I desire to see the establishment of the industry at the earliest possible date, compatible with skilled labour and other resources being available for that manufacture. I believe that the best way in which this Government could approach this problem would be by making a survey of the skilled man-power available. Having set aside the skilled labour required for the defence industries and having ascertained the materials and capital available for the purpose of manufacturing cars, it could proceed on the basis of telling those engaged in the production of motorcar bodies and others that it proposed that the entire car should be manufactured in Australia within a given time, that time depending on the survey. The Government would then need to introduce an appropriate tariff schedule to give effect to the protection that it had in view. If the Government did that, it could have this industry established in Australia within a short space of time, without any bounty at all. However, the question before us is whether this agreement should be ratified or not. The honourable member for Henty (Sir Henry Gullett), on the 22nd May, 1936, in the capacity of Minister in charge of negotiations for trade treaties, introducing the trade diversion policy, saidIn the opinion of .the Government, reached after considerable investigation, there is in the Commonwealth for the profitable working of at least three separate units of motor car manufacture. It is intended, however, not to limit the number of units, but rather to invite engine manufacturers who are now supplying the Australian trade to participate in this great new venture in secondary industry. That shows that in the mind of the Government then there was no idea of a monopoly being needed in this industry. I am not concerned with arguments regarding the necessity for a monopoly in this country at this juncture; but, if any arguments can be advanced in favour of a monopoly, the only monopoly that should be set up should be a Government monopoly. If there is to be no Government monopoly, it is the right of the people to have free competition. That is the birth right of the people, and, in bringing this agreement before Parliament for ratification, the Government has endeavoured to sell the birth right of the people for a mess of pottage, for the agreement is nothing but a mess. For that reason, I hope that the House will carry the amendment moved by my Leader.",49
173,Mr BLACKBUBN,FRENCH,"Bourke) [5.25] This bill does not provide for the ratification of an agreement. It seeks to provide that the Commonwealth may make an agreement to give effect to the matter specified in the schedule. That seems to be an admission by the Government that no complete agreement has been made. I do not propose to discuss the points raised by the honourable member for Corio (Mr Dedman) with regard to that. But, if one looks at the text of the agreement and compares it with the memorandum of correspondence that was given to honourable members, one will see at once that the various paragraphs of the schedule of the so-called agreement and the various assurances contained therein are, with two whole exceptions and one partial exception, taken from the letters, either the letter of the managing director of the company, or the: letter of the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies). The first of the two complete exceptions is contained in paragraph 9, which statesThat the company will proceed immediately with the scheme . . . Although that is not set out in a letter, it is implied. The other exception isThat the Commonwealth will pay bounty iii room accordance with the provisions of the Motor Vehicle Engine Bounty Act 1939. That, of course, is naturally implied, because the whole basis of the thing is that the company will receive a bounty. The paragraph which does not wholly appear in the correspondence is paragraph 7. That readsThat the proposed company will use all bounty paid to it under the Motor Vehicle Engine Bounty Act 1939 to give a price concession to the public. That does not appear in any form anywhere else except in Mr Smith's letter, and he puts it in a much more guarded form than that. He does not say that he will use all of the bounty to give price concessions to the public. This is what he says on page 2 of his letterIn the early stages, therefore, the price must be sufficiently attractive substantially to counteract this sales resistance. The company will use the bounty to give price concession to the public in order to get the market, rather than use it in the payment of dividends. All that he suggests is that in order to get the market he will use the bounty to reduce prices and to prevent competitors from getting a foothold in competition. There is nothing like the definiteness of the guarantee )in paragraph 7 of the schedule, which is the only definite thing in the whole of the assurances. I now refer to the first of the assurances given by the Commonwealth. I do not take great exception to the assurance contained in paragraph 10, because it is an assurance that powers will be used to protect the company against foreign or foreign controlled companies. It does not protect the companies against Australian rivals. In the Motor Vehicle Engine Bounty Act, which we passed, we drew an unusual distinction between an Australian capitalist and a foreign capitalist. We drew that distinction, not because, we bad a bigoted preference for the Australian capitalist as against The the foreign, but because wo thought that unless this - industry was established offered a bounty. by Australian capital it could well get under the control of foreign this stipulationmanufacturers, and, in the course of time, be suppressed in their interests. That is why this House inserted the proto vision that two-thirds of the capital of chase any company enjoying the bounty must be owned by British subjects livin Australia. Paragraph 10, therefore, does not give me any concern, but paragraphs 11 and 12,. particularly the latter, cause me great disturbance of mind. The honourable member for Corio has very ably drawn attention to the meaning of those two assurances, but I wish reiterate and reinforce his remarks. Paragraph 12 statesThat .the Commonwealth will use its best endeavours to limit production of motor cars paragraph 3. and trucks of 15 horse-power or over to the proposed company'for a period of five years. That refers not merely to the production of motor chassis and engines, but also to the manufacture of complete motor vehicles.' ,.'lt .'means that the Commonengines, : wealth will do.its very best, in five to hand over'the whole of the industry Australian;'/'/Consolidated Limited. ' . ' . . , - If,- as the Prime Minister has said, speakers ..during the Corio by-election tiike campaign declared that should this agreeAustralian ment be concluded, it would be possible to close 'down the Ford motor works, they said nothing but the absolute truth. It would be possible for the Commonwealth Government,' at Mr Smith's request, to destroy every motor-manufacturing firm producing vehicles of 15 horse-power or over. That provision was not inserted by general accident. Mr Smith desired that it should be inserted. He made it plain in his recruiting original letter to the Commonwealth that what he sought was a monopoly of the ous manufacture.not merely of motor chassis and engines, but also of entire vehicles. other. That is clear beyond doubt. In the first letter published in the memorandum cirtime culated by the Government, Mr Smith stated- Tliemotor vehicle represents highly centrated labour as a major ingredient. Probably 80 per cent, or more of the factory is represented in labour and would amount Mr Blackburn. about £150 worth of labour on each vehicle. company would design and be responsible for the production of the entire car including the engine on which the Government has Then he asked the Commonwealth for That all Commonwealth Government departments requiring vehicles of the class proposed be manufactured by the company, will pura substantial proportion of tlieir requirements from the company. g in The Commonwealth refused to give an unqualified promise, but it said that if the price and quality of the vehicles were satisfactory, it would be prepared to do something on the lines that the company suggested. But then Mr Smith asked that paragraph 12 should be inserted in to the schedule. He used almost the very words contained in the paragraph.",50
174,Mr JOHN LAWSON,FRENCH,That paragraph should be read in conjunction with,51
175,Mr BLACKBURN,FRENCH,"No . It is perfectly obvious that the director of Australian Consolidated Industries Limited had in contemplation a monopoly of the manufacture not merely of chassis and but also of entire motor vehicles. years, He made that clear when he went on to to say, in the explanatory statement which Industries accompanied his first letterAn Australian company being formed for the purpose of manufacturing motor vehicles must into its considerations the fact that at least one foreign corporation will attack tile venture in the most ruthless manner if the Commonwealth does not protect it. That refers specifically to the manufacture of entire vehicles. At the end of that explanatory statement he saidThe company is not adverse to or jealous of other Australian manufacturers entering the motor vehicle manufacturing field, but considers that the interests of the industry in would be served best were the manufacture of motor vehicles to be restricted. The of suitable skilled labour for the now industry will undoubtedly present a seriproblem and the company does not want to bo faced with the position where it cannot get labour on the one hand or sales on the It is considered that, at present and for some to come,' there is room for only one large scale Australian motor manufacturer. The Government pledges itself in this bill to use its best endeavours to l i m it the conproduction of motor cars and trucks of cost 15 horse-power or over to Australian to Consolidated Industries Limite d for a period of five years. If the House approves of this schedule, the Government will then proceed to execute a document, not similar to this, but one drawn up by lawyers in order to carry out the expressed intention of the parties in legal terms. It will not contain words like ""probable"", ""sympathetic consideration "" or "" proposed plan "". It will use definite language from the meaning of which there can be no escape. What the bill actually means, if it means anything, is that the Commonwealth Government will be bound, so far as it possibly can be bound, to legally secure to Mr Smith a monopoly. That will not only be a monopoly against the foreign manufacture of chassis and engines, but also a monopoly against every manufacturer of heavy cars and trucks. The Government and its supporters, by the attitude they have adopted, seem to suggest that people who come to this country and introduce capital from Great Britain and the United States of America, in order to start an industry which employs thousands of Australian workmen, are enemies of the country. Be - that as it may, the men who work in those industries are not enemies of the country, aiid the Labour party cannot agree to stand by and see 'those men thrown on the scrap heap merely because the Parliament is asked to give this monopoly to Australian Consolidated Industries Limited. It would be possible for the thousands of men who are employed by General Motors-Holdens Limited and the Ford Motor Company of Australia Limited to be thrown out of employment if the proposed agreement were made. It is all very well to say that ithey would have a chance of securing employment from Australian Consolidated Industries Limited ",51
176,Mr ANTHONY,FRENCH,Why not give those two companies the same opportunity Australian Consolidated Industries LimiSmith ted in the matter of capital construction?,52
177,Mr BLACKBURN,FRENCH,"There should be no interference with the original tion of this Parliament that a bounty should be payable for the manufacture of motor-car engines and chassis, and there should be open competition between tralian companies in that field. would carry out the principle of the bill passed last year by this Parliament. At no time did honourable members contemplate that one person should be permitted to dominate the manufacture of large motor vehicles in Australia. This company would have in its hands, if this agreement were passed, power to control the fortunes of every person whose business is the manufacture of parts of motor cars, such as bodies and panels. They could sell their product only to Australian Consolidated Industries Limited, and Mr Smith, by virtue of the monopoly granted to him by the Commonwealth, would be able to treat them as vassals. That means that not only the fate of a great number of men and women employed by the manufacturers of motor-car chassis and engines, but also the fate of hundreds and thousands of people engaged by the manufacturers of accessories would be controlled by one man. Paragraph 12 of the schedule seems to me to be the crucial point in this measure on which this House should decide whether this agreement shall be approved or not. A great deal has been said about paragraphs 10 and 11, but the greatest danger lies in 12. Remember that, if this bill is passed, the Commonwealth and its advisers will sit down with Mr Smith and his advisers, and hammer out a legal agreement which need not be submitted to Parliament for approval. I am not prepared to give that power to the Commonwealth, and thus place the fortunes of the men and women whom the Labour party represents in this House into the hands of Mr Smith or any other monopolist.",52
178,Mr JOHN LAWSON,FRENCH,Has the honourable member read paragraph 3?,52
179,Mr BLACKBURN,FRENCH,Yes .,52
180,Mr JOHN LAWSON,FRENCH,Does it not impose conditions upon paragraph 12?,52
181,Mr BLACKBURN,FRENCH,"No . What I have said makes it perfectly clear, even as to the meanest intelligence, that Mr. was contemplating a monopoly of the manufacture not only of motor-vehicle engines and chassis, but also of motor intencars and trucks. He statedI t is considered that, at present and foi some time to come, there is room for only one large-scale Australian motor manufacturer. AusThe words of paragraph 12 appear also That in the Prime Minister's letter, which shows that there was no oversight in the matter. I understand that when the Government's draftsman was asked to draw up this bill, he had to take the correspondence which passed between the Commonwealth Government and Australian Consolidated Industries Limited, and put it together. Instead of assembling it, he dissembled it. He took the letters to pieces and the plan of Australian Consolidated Industries Limited has been dissembled in that way. Paragraph 11 of the schedule providesThat the Commonwealth will pay bounty in accordance with the provisions of the Motor Vehicle Engine Bounty Act 1U39. The obvious intention of that and of paragraph 12 is that only one man shall receive the bounty. The Commonwealth Constitution Act, however, states in section 51, placitum i i i Bounties on the production of export of goods but so. thai such bounties shall be uniform throughout the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth would not be paying bounties uniformly throughout the Commonwealth if it made it impossible for anybody but Mr Smith and his company to receive bounties. The language of section 51, placitum i i i . , of the Constitution Act is perfectly clear, but if it needed any clarification, it received it from the present Chief Justice of the High Court, Sir John Latham, in the case Elliott v. Commonwealth. His Honor saidThat section would be infringed by the absence of uniformity whether preference was given to si State oV part of a State over another State or part thereof. If the Commonwealth discriminates between persons by saying in this bill that one person shall receive bounty, and another shall not, it will be a breach of the Constitution. Whether the Government contemplates a breach of the letter of the Constitution or not, it certainly contemplates a breach of it in the spirit. Its intention is that the bounty, which this House has already authorized to be paid, shall be paid to Mr Smith's company and to nobody else. That is surely a violation of the spirit, if not the letter, of the Constitution. Probably I shall be told that the Constitution does not matter now when this country is at war, and that the Government is empowered to do anything it Mr lilackhurn. likes; but it is quite clear that the Government cannot do anything it likes, even under its war powers. The defence power given to the Commonwealth by the Constitution has become enormously enlarged, but that power is still subject to the provisions of the Constitution. It was pointed out by a former Chief Justice in the case, Farey v. Burnett, to which the honourable member for Corio referred, that the Commonwealth cannot override the provisions of the Constitution. Any one who dispassionately considers this measure must come to the conclusion that this Parliament cannot rightly agree to it. I took no part in the Corio by-election and did not read the agreement until it was laid before the Parliament. I refused to make up my mind regarding it on the information contained in newspaper reports. Indeed, I could not understand the document from what appeared in the newspapers. I reserved my opinion until I saw the document itself. Having seen it, I think that it goes far beyond what honourable members contemplated. I believe that most honourable members contemplated that there would be a bounty-fed industry for the manufacture of chassis and engines, and that, in order to prevent it from getting into the hands of foreign capitalists who might strangle it, the bounty was to be paid only to companies, 66 per cent. of whose capital was subscribed by Australians. We never contemplated handing over the industry to one monopolist, or providing that capitalists whose money was invested in other industries should be debarred from competitive manufacture. Certainly, we did not contemplate endangering the future of the men and women working in the existing establishments.",52
182,Mr ROSEVEAR,FRENCH,Does the honourable member seriously believe that paragraph 10 will prevent the Eord Motor Company from continuing to make motor-car bodies ?,53
183,Mr BLACKBURN,FRENCH,"At the moment, I am concerned, not with paragraph 10, but with paragraph 12, which provides that "" the Commonwealth will use its best endeavours to limit production "". After wo have approved this scheme, it will be submitted to the legal representatives of the Commonwealth and of the company who will draw up an agreement to give legal effect to the decision of the Parliament. The agreement will not come back to this House for ratification, because the Parliament in advance will have authorized the Commonwealth Government to make an agreement to give effect to its decision. If the Commonwealth Government enters into an agreement with Australian Consolidated Industries Limited that for five years that company shall have a. monopoly of the manufacture of motor vehicles of certain types, it will do so by virtue of the authority to do so given to it by this Parliament. I shall not consent to the Government being authorized to enter into such an agreement.",53
184,Mr CLARK,FRENCH,"Darling) [5.47] - I support the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin) and am opposed to .the amendment foreshadowed by the honourable member for Gippsland  been criticized for neglecting to prepare for the manufacture of armaments in this country. Whenever an undertaking of considerable magnitude is decided upon, plans must be prepared well ahead of the actual commencement of the work. The proposal to establish in Australia an industry for the manufacture of motor car engines and chassis is sound. Moreover, I believe that the industry should be established immediately. Notwithstanding that the Government is primarily concerned with the prosecution of the war, it must not fail to prepare for peace. When peace returns, thousands of men who, during the war, will be employed in the production of arms and munitions, will lose their employment in that capacity and will have to seek other jobs in secondary industries. The Government should therefore encourage the establishment of substantial industries in this country which will provide employment for those men when the war is over. Accordingly I am entirely in accord with the proposal to establish this industry in Australia, and I commend the enterprise of the company which is prepared to manufacture motor cars in Australia. About four years have - elapsed since the Parliament authorized the payment of a bounty to encourage the - manufacture of engines and chassis in the Commonwealth, but no company, either foreign or local, was prepared to undertake the work during, that period. The reason that they did not come forward was that they had a monopoly of the motor car industry of Australia. The Acting Minister for Information (Sir Henry Gullett) was responsible for placing certain restrictions on the importation of motor cars in this country. That policy gave to certain motor interests a monopoly of the importation of motor cars. During the depression, there was a tendency on the part of the people to purchase the cheaper cars such as Fords and Chevrolets, and as the import quotas were based on imports during a certain earlier period, the distributors of those makes of cars were practically given a monopoly. Other importers who desired to bring cars to Australia could not get sufficiently satisfactory quotas to enable them to establish substantial businesses because during the depression their importations were small. The Ford Motor Company and General MotorsHoldens Limited had a monopoly of the importation of cars for several years, and while they enjoyed that monopoly there was no necessity for them to interest themselves in the manufacture of cars in Australia. They would not be interested now in local manufacture were it not for the fear that competitors might come forward and by their courage and enterprise build up a connection which would result in the existing companies losing a portion of the local market. I doubt whether the existing companies would be prepared to manufacture cars here should these proposals fall through. They would probably be content to continue to import cars, even under restricted conditions. For the reasons that I have stated, I believe that this new company should be given every encouragement. But I am opposed to granting it a monopoly, although I believe that it is entitled to adequate tariff protection. Other companies which may wish to establish similar works should also be encouraged. I think, however, that few, if any, other companies will be prepared to establish works in Australia for the manufacture of motor cars, and for that reason I think that the paragraph which confers on Australian Consolidated Industries Limited a monopoly of this work is unnecessary. I understand that the National Security Act is limited to the period of the war and twelve months thereafter, yet this bill proposes to grant to one company a monopoly of the manufacture of motor engines and chassis in Australia for a period of five years. Should the war last only another twelve months, the powers exercised under the national security legislation would expire within two years. I do not think that the provisions of that legislation should be availed of in order to grant a monopoly to any company. I am opposed to the amendment indicated by the honourable member for Gippsland. The Country party is opposed to the establishment of secondary industries in this country under any conditions. Members of the Country party would take almost any steps to prevent the manufacture of cars in Australia at this or any other time. Although this country is at war, it must make preparations for peace. The establishment of. this undertaking would provide opportunities for training young men in useful employment, and when the war is over and the market for motor cars is again active, it should give work to returned soldiers and men previously engaged in the manufacture of munitions. In order that secondary industries may absorb these men this industry should be established as soon as possible.",54
185,Mr NAIRN,FRENCH,"Perth) [5.57] - In comber last I opposed the bill to grant bounty for the manufacture of motorsuch car engines in Australia.' The tion makes the establishment of such an industry at the present time most inopportune, and, therefore, my vote will be cast against, the agreement.",55
186,Mr MAHONEY,FRENCH,"Denison) [5.58] I am in favour of the proposal to manuthat facture motor cars in Australia, and there appears to be some conflict of opinion as to the location of the dustry, because of jealousy on the part of the people of both Victoria and New South Wales, I suggest that the comsive pany should establish its works in mania, where it would have the benefit of cheap hydro-electric power, resulting in lower costs of production and, consevehicle. quently, lower prices for its products. The manufacture of motor cars in Australia would provide employment not only in the major industry itself but also in. subsidiary industries. The company should not confine its operations to the manufacture of engines for motor cars, but should also manufacture tractors and. tanks for the defence of this country. I. agree with the honourable member for Darling (Mr Clark) that this industry will give employment to the youths of this country, and absorb men who are now engaged in various war activities, while making Australia less dependent on overseas manufacturers. Another point requires some consideration, however. In my opinion, the proposed rates of bounty are too high. It is intended to pay a bounty of £30 each on the first 30,000 engines constructed, £25 each on the next, 30,000 and £20 each on the next, 30,000. I calculate that this will absorb £1,750,000. There is no justification for the payment of such a heavy bounty in view of the prices at which certain makes of motor cars are sold in America and in Australia. For example, a Chrysler model, which costs £495 in Australia, is sold to the public in the United States of America for £175. Other comparative figures are: Dodge. £404, £139; De. .Soto, £465, £162; Ford'. £343, £104. The engine of the Ford motor car is equal to that of any other car that can be mentioned. If the Ford chassis had a body put on it comparable De, in quality to the bodies of certain a other makes of car in the same price class as the - Chevrolet, it would be a war situamagnificent vehicle. In view of the fact that the complete Ford car is sold for £104 in America, I suggest that the engine would not be likely to cost any more than, say, £30. It seems ridiculous, in such circumstances, we should be asked to provide such as an. exorbitant bounty for engines made in Australia which, probably, will not inbe comparable to the Ford engines. It seems to me that the motor cars that will be built in Australia will be expenvehicles, and that we shall therefore Tasfail in achieving what should bo our main purpose, that of providing the Australian public with a. reasonably priced We should not consent to any proposal which will have the effect of maintaining the existing high prices of motor cars. I fear that such would be the result of our ratification of this agreement. To use £.1,750,000 of the taxpayers' money for this purpose is quite unjustified. I hold the view that we should do our utmost to make Australia self-supporting and self-reliant. I cannot see the force of the argument of some honourable members that Ave should not give a monopoly to any particular interests to manufacture motor cars, for Ave have already given monopolies in relation to other industries. I have in mind the sugar industry, in particular. I am prepared to do the fair thing by any organization established to manufacture complete motor vehicles in this country; but I think that proper consideration should be given to the claims of all of States in determining Avhere the motor vehicle manufacturing industry should be located. Tasmania should be considered. I. know that the paper pulp industry has been established in that State, and T appreciate Avhat the Government has done in that regard; but it should not be overlooked that the possession of an unlimited supply of cheap hydro-electric power entitles Tasmania to sj>ecial consideration. It seems, however, that these industries are established in different States only after a consideration of their vote-catching qualifications. Economic factors are pushed into the background in the interests of political advantages; and the minority party of this Parliament- I refer to the Country party, which I call the parachute party-ha s been able to obtain far more than it is entitled to. We should not Avithhold from establishing this industry because it is alleged that insufficient skilled labour is available. Nor do I think that, the argument that the establishment of motorengine manufacturing works would injure the prospects of certain related industrial enterprises at Geelong or Adelaide should carry undue weight with us. We should give full consideration to the importance of all of the economic and industrial factors related motor car manufacturing. This reminds me that if the industry were established in Tasmania, no trouble Would be encountered in consequence of the lack of coal supplies, for the hydro-electric supplies of the State could be drawn upon almost without limit. I understand that the magnesium industry of Tasmania is being developed in the expectation that supplies of magnesium Avill be required in connection with the manufacture of motor-oar engines. I strongly advocate that the proposed Avorks should be located either in Tasmania or in Western Australia, Will the object of decentralizing our industries. The adoption of that course would result in the distribution of our population more evenly over our vast territory. It would also have a beneficial effect from the defence point of vieAV. No one would deny that Tasmania would probably be the last State of the Commonwealth to be the captured if a hostile force came our way. The people of Tasmania are 100 per cent, united, and I have no doubt whatever that they Would use to the very best advantage any opportunities provided for them to establish this industry Avithin their State. We need engines, not only for the usual class of motor A'ehicles, but also for tanks, aircraft and so forth. State jealousies should not prevent us from giving the fullest consideration to the advantages of the respective States in connection with the establishment of the projected enterprise. Even if one State were declared to have less skilled labour available than another, I would not regard it as being excluded. Wherever the Avorks Avere established, inen with the requisite skill will soon be forthcoming. We ought not to act hastily in coming to a decision on this important subject. A certain amount of caution is needed. .1. am not opposed to the investment of foreign capital in such an industry as this. In fact, I think the investment of capital from outside should, be encouraged in Australia. I hold broad views on that subject. I wish to see the motor engine manufacturing industry, established here as soon as possible, having regard - to. the need for adequate consideration of all circumstances. Australia to will never become a. strong nation until we establish essential secondary industries of this kind Avithin our borders. I am prepared to support any genuine proposal to that end that may be submitted to Parliament, but certain actions of the Government in relation to this particular project justify my expressing some doubt as to its sincerity. I submit that every manufacturing organization which is prepared to undertake the construction of motor vehicle engines in this country should be given reasonable encouragement.",55
187,Unknown,FRENCH,"Sitting suspended from 6.16 to S p.m. Mr MAHONE'Y - I am very disappointed that the Government did not take steps years ago to establish a motorcar manufacturing industry in Australia. Had it done so, the industry - would IIOAV be operating successfully. Any company starting now would need 600 trained artisans, and what hope has it of getting that number when the services of all skilled men in the country are needed for the production of munitions of Avar? Very soon the Government will have to ration petrol. That must come, and then tens of thousands of motor cars Avill be handed back to the garages for resale, and the market will be glutted. There will be little sale for new cars, so IIOAV can we expect people to put their money into au enterprise for the production of 30,000 motor-car engines which will have to be stored away because there is no sale for them? One Avonders why the Government has brought this bill down now. EAddently, it is merely seeking to save its face; to show the public that it has tried to do something. Actually, the scheme is doomed to failure, and the Government knows it. Instead of building luxurious motor cars, Ave should concentrate on the production of tanks and other war equipment for the defence of the country. I am in favour of the establishment of a motor-car manufacturing industry in Australia, but this is not the time to make the attempt. It should - have been dome long ago, but since it was not, we should turn our energies to the production of things more necessary during war-time. We know that Ave can build motor-car bodies in Australia equal to any in the world, and there is no reason Avhy we should not produce the engines also in due course. In the meantime, howeA^er, let us accept the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin), so that all parties in this House may present a united front to the people of Australia, and to the enemy.",57
188,Mr JOHN LAWSON,FRENCH,"Macquarie) [8.6] - The Prime Minister (Mr. Menzies), in introducing this bill some days ago, said that the industry to which it refers has had a very chequered career. I Would rather say that the birth pangs of the industry have been so prolonged that, Avhcn I took the matter in hand twelve' months ago, I decided, Will the concurrence of the Government, that heroic measures Avere ' necessary if it - was ever to breathe at all. Wc took those measures. One of the unpleasant results of our action was that I have been obliged to travel the path that many heroes have travelled before me. One of the more pleasant results has been that, Avhether the proposals now before Parliament are good or not, whether or not they are precisely those which'Parliament will approve, at least Ave have at last reached some basis for discussion. We haAe at least got r further than ever before. The Government is IIOAV able to place before the House a scheme that can be debated, a scheme that is in every .sense a practicable one, even though it may not meet with the approval of all members of this House. One very interesting feature of the endeavours of various Ministers and governments to establish a motor-car manufacturing industry in Australia is that when they spoke of the matter in the abstract, when they Avere merely building castles in the air and saying what ought to be done, and how and Avhen it should be done, it Avas easy to Avin the plaudits of members of this House and of the multitude outside. Even members of the Country party, Avhen they believed that the prospects of establishing the industry were extremely remote, Avere prepared in principle- a phrase A'ery much in use these days-to support the Government's proposals. Then one noticed the 'gradually Availing enthusiasm of certain honourable members as the prospects of success improved until, from giving lip service to the efforts of the Government, they have now become actively hostile.",57
189,Mr GANDER,FRENCH,That is not true of us.,57
190,Mr JOHN LAWSON,FRENCH,"I am not speaking of members of the Opposition. As I have said, so long as one talked in the abstract, it was easy to gain the plaudits of the crowd, but immediately we left the realm of rhetoric in order to enter the arena of achievement, all sorts of opposition was encountered. Our efforts were hampered by people prepared to utter libels, and to resort to any means, however despicable, to prevent the establishment of a motor-car manufacturing industry in Australia. I do not propose to discuss at length the need for this industry, because the Prime Minister put the case very well. Parliament admitted the need for it when it passed the Motor Vehicle Engine Bounty Bill last December. Therefore, I do not propose to argue the merits of the case, but I intend very briefly to state some pertinent facts. First of all, there is the fact that, during the last 25 years, motor cars and motor car parts to the value of £125,000,000 sterling have been imported into Australia That is a fact which is well worthy of consideration, and of itself was, I believe, sufficient to justify the policy laid down by the Lyons Government as far back as 1936. But there were also other facts. There was the matter of employment, and the widening of the base of our industrial organization. There was the very real need to make a contribution towards, the adjustment of the disequilibrium which has always existed between primary and secondary industries. There was the matter of foreign exchange, which is very much more pressing today than it was then, but nevertheless was, even then, of very real urgency. So, in 1936, a policy was adopted whereby this industry might be established. So long as it remained in a fairly vague and nebulous form, the proposal had widespread support. Later, there was a Tariff Board inquiry, the result of which, I am prepared to admit, was not encouraging; but I urge the House to consider the character of the evidence tendered at that inquiry. The bulk of the evidence was tendered by persons who, we now know, are actively opposed, and always have been opposed, to the establishment of the industry; for example, General Motors-Holdens Limited, the Eord Motor Company of Australia Limited, and the Chrysler-Dodge Corporation. All of those interests made it perfectly clear, not that they wanted the industry to be established, not that they were prepared to co-operate fully with the Government in promoting its establishment, but, on the contrary, that they were opposed to its establishment. The evidence was not confined to the motor importing firms. They had their distributors, their satellites, the legion of people who, in one way or another, rely on them for such profits as they earn. I say very emphatically, and after ful l consideration, that the evidence was so prejudiced that proper findings could not be based upon it. There was the evidence of the representative of the Eord Motor Company of Australia Limited. I was very interested to hear the passionate defence of that company by my newly-found friend, the honourable member for Corio (Mr. Dedman). The House would do well to scrutinize the evidence submitted by that company-submitted , mark you, on oath. Perhaps the most pertinent, the most interesting portion, was to the effect that, in the opinion of the company, the measure of assistance necessary to encourage the establishment of the motor engine and chassis manufacturing industry in Australia, would amount to no less a sum than £135 a unit. I pass over the fact that, immediately the Government proposed to establish this industry on the basis of assistance, not to an amount of £135 a unit, but at an average rate of £25 a unit for the first 60,000 units, Ford's general manager, who had given that evidence before the Tariff Board, was one of the first to protest to the Prime Minister that, if a company were established which would receive for the first 60,000 chassis and engines it produced, an average bounty of £25 a unit, such a company would close down the Ford Motor Company of Australia Limited. I can only say that that is a tremendous tribute, a remarkable compliment, to Australian industrialists and workers-that the Ford 'Company, which I suppose is one 'of the largest, most powerful, and most wealthy motor manufacturing companies in the world today, would find it, necessary to run to shelter from an infant industry, established by relatively inexperienced Australian industrialists and accorded only one-fifth of the measure of assistance considered necessary hy the Ford Company. Yet that was, in fact, everything the case. The general manager of General Motors-Holdens Limited, Mr. Hartnett, in evidence before the Tariff Board, said that, in his opinion, it cumb would be necessary for years to sell any Australian-made car at a price at least £t5 lower than the price charged for a comparable imported car. If one examines that statement at all closely, one must come to the conclusion that, in the opinion of'General Motors-Holdens Limited, the degree of assistance necesfurther sary for any company undertaking manuduration facture in Australia would be in the vicinity of from £100 to £125 a unit. That evidence having been tendered by persons who were in a position to express a really authoritative opinion, naturally the Tariff Board's finding was to the effect that £30 a unit-the figure then being offered by the Government-woul not be nearly sufficient to induce the manufacture of motor chassis and engines in Australia. That was one of the conHaving clusions reached by the Tariff Board. Time passed. The first Menzies Governan ment was formed, and I was allotted the task of doing what I could towards the establishment of this industry. many pleasant talks with various represult sentatives of the big motor companies this country, those companies which the Government thought might legitimately he expected to co-operate with it in establishment of this industry; pleasant encounters, if one regards them merely social occasions. It was not possible talk real business. The plain fact was, that they were then just as strongly posed to the manufacture of engines and chassis, as when they gave evidence bewho fore the Tariff Board. They suggested many things that might be done, such inquiry committees, rates of bounty ing from £135 a unit to as low as £50 a unit, the sending of a man to the United .States of America, and the attempt to procure certain equipment in Sweden, and so on. The matter dragged on for several months, until I came to conclusion-and I say it advisedly-that these persons in Australia who might legitimately have been expected to assist Mr John Lawson. the Government in the establishment of this industry, were, in point of fact, humbugging the Government, and doing that they could to prevent its establishment. They were playing a colossal game of kid-stakes, hoping that the Government would continue to sucto their tactics, as had been the case in the three"" previous years. When war broke out; the roar of guns in Europe was sweet music in their ears. They regarded the outbreak as a blessed refuge, thinking that the Government would be unable to establish the industry and that they would not have to bother about the matter, at least for the of the conflict. I am perfectly certain that that was their attitudea cold-blooded, materialistic attitudetowards their obligations to Australian industry. Little did they dream that the Government would find an Australian organization, with Australian capital, which had the courage, the enterprise, d and the ability, despite the attitude of overseas companies, to embark upon this undertaking; but that is what happened. failed to obtain any offers which one could consider at all, I authorized officer of the Department of Trade and Customs to go out and find somebody who might be prepared to undertake the I had work. He found somebody, and the reis the agreement now before the of House. I remind honourable members again of the evidence given by the Ford Motor Company of Australia Limited, the and of the finding of the Tariff Board that £30 a unit would not he nearly as sufficient to induce manufacture in this to country. I remind them, further, of the rate of bounty proposed. Finally, I reopmind them that the Government has not, even yet, received an offer from any one is prepared to undertake the work on the terms embodied in the proposals beas fore the House, much less on more ranggenerous terms. There has been much, criticism of, and complaint regarding, these proposals. It remains for those companies which have howled the loudest, and complained the most bitterly, to say that they would be prepared to undertake the manufacture on the terms embodied in the proposals.",57
191,Mr DEDMAN,FRENCH,They cannot do that.,59
192,Mr JOHN LAWSON,FRENCH,"They have not said that they would prepared to do it. I suggest to the House that, if the Ford Motor Company of Australia Limited, General Motors-Holdens Limited, the ChryslerDodge Corporation, or 'any other organization, were prepared to undertake the work on a monopoly basis, they should at least say so. They have not said so. Mr GREGORY.:-What would be purpose of their saying so when they had been prohibited from manufacturing? Mr JOH N LAWSON - The Government would at least have had before it some evidence that it was unwise to encourage Australian Consolidated Indusiries Limited so much. But we publicly invited proposals on much more generous terms than have been given to Australian Consolidated Industries Limited, and received no response from the Ford, General Motors-Holdens or ChryslerDodge companies. Within the last few weeks the Ford company has circulated a brochure containing its views. I have no doubt that every honourable member has received a copy. Mi'. MAKIN - On the 17th December, were those companies given any idea of n monopoly being possible?",60
193,Mr JOHN LAWSON,FRENCH,"I talked monopoly to every body I met during the whole of the period when I was Minister for Trade and Customs. - Mr MAKIN - That does not answer my question. ' Mr JOHN LAWSON - I cajoled and pleaded with General Motors-Holdens Limited and other companies to make proposals. They made none. I could not very well offer them terms when they refused to indicate that they were prepared to manufacture They always made it quite clear to the Government, to me, and to previous Ministers for Trade and Customs that they were not prepared to manufacture. If honourable members read the latest brochure circulated by the Ford Company it will be quite clear to them that even now the Ford Company is not willing to manufacture engines and chassis in Australia. I understand that the Chrysler-Dodge Corporation has also circulated honourable members; but that company did not offer any proposal.",60
194,Mr MULCAHY,FRENCH,Thos e companies want be to stop this bill from going through.,60
195,Mr JOHN LAWSON,FRENCH,"That is their policy. They want to hang their hats on any skeleton of an argument which might prevent the establishment of this industry. I ask honourable members to judge the agreement now before the House, not with the eyes of prejudiced people who are seeking to find the fault, or something crooked or rotten in this agreement, but with the eyes of people who are really anxious to see this industry established, and who will take into consideration the lack of proposals from other organizations. That is the approach that should be made to this proposal. The criticism of this proposed agreement divides into three main parts. E deal first with what has been styled the monopoly character of the proposal. Powerful pleas and defences are from time to time made by honourable members on all sides of this House on behalf of the monopoly that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited holds. I offer no criticism of that monopoly. I believe that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited is a very good company. Many honourable members were prepared not so long ago to support and encourage a monopoly to establish the tinned-plate industry in Australia. The Government, I believe with the approval of the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr. Makin), would have liked to afford a much greater monopoly in the manufacture of tinned plate than we are giving to Australian Consolidated IndustriesLimited, because what was proposed involved the granting the whole of the Australian market-no t one-quarter of it --to one company, a much more powerful financial group than Australian Consolidated Industries Limited, for a much longer period than we propose to give to Australian Consolidated Industries Limited under this arrangement. From certain honourable members who are criticizing the present proposal we had splendid support and applause in that proposal. The tinned-plate industry would have been established two years ago if the Government had been prepared to adopt less orthodox methods. It would have been established twelve months ago if the Government of which I was a member, bad accorded to me the same measure of freedom as I was given in my endeavours to bring about the establishment of the motor-car industry. It has been said that we should never grant a monopoly, but I ask honourable gentlemen to approach that question from another point of view. I speak now to those who want to see the motor-car industry established. Suppose that we did not grant a monopoly. What would be the position? I say in all seriousness that the position would have been as it was in the last three years, when the Government could not grant a monopoly, and we should have had no proposals to bring before Parliament for the establishment of the industry. The big importto ing companies were opposed to the establishment of the industry. They did not dream that any Australian company would undertake it. They were in a position to prevent any Australian company from undertaking it while this Government was not able to grant an Australian company the real protection that we propose in this bill. In order to exemplify the truth of what I am saying, I cite the fact that, not so long ago, we gave assistance by way of bounty and tariff protection to the Australian National Radiator Company Limited, which proposed to manufacture motoi'-car radiators in this country. Australian capital was subscribed, plant was purchased and the company got to work and produced good quality radiators. The company was selling radiators to General MotorsHoldens Limited and other firms. It was well on its feet, and was beginning to expand its business and its plant, when suddenly, like a bolt from the blue, came a letter from General Motors-Holdens Limited that it must not reckon on further orders, because the larger company proposed to engage in manufacture on its own account. The result of such a proposal, if pursued to its logical con- ful. clusion, would be that the Australian firm, which pioneered that industry in 1 Australia, would be closed down and ruined, and a company, which some people are so fond of defending, will step in. All of the profits from Mr John Laicson. radiators, instead of going to Australian investors, will now go overseas. That is the position that would undoubtedly develop if we allowed this other Australian industry to be established without giving it adequate protection against the most powerful motor importing organizations in the world. It would be established and would start production. Then the powerful companies would establish operations and the Australian company would go to the wall. I ask reasonable honourable members how otherwise is that position to be met? Goodness knows, we did everything possible, before we asked Australian Consolidated Industries Limited to undertake the manufacture, to induce the larger and more powerful companies enter the industry, but they refused to do so. Were we then to place the Australian pioneering company on an equal footing with those overseas firms which refused to assist us? We were under no obligation. The motor industry in Australia today is entirely under the domination of foreign and overseas firms; but this is one of the blessings that the war has brought to us: We are able, as the result of the war-time powers that we possess, to establish a real Australian equity in an industry which would otherwise have fallen permanently into the hands of overseas concerns had it not been possible for us to afford to the Australian industry the protection which is proposed. We have been obliged to invoke the National Security Act to give to this industry the protection that it must have if it is to be established at all. If there were no war, no National Security Act, it would not have been possible to establish the industry under Australian control. The foreign companies would probably then for all time have completely dominated the motor-car manufacturing industry of Australia. That is one aspect of this war, for which we can feel grateI t has been suggested also that at this time when there is such a demand for foreign exchange we should, not permit the use of dollars in the importation of the plant that it will be necessary to import in order to establish this industry. That point has been laboured and belaboured to a degree that to me is thoroughly ridiculous. The value in Australian currency of the plant and equipment which it will be necessary to import will amount to about £350,000. A very large portion of the plant will be made in Australia. The value of the chassis and engine unit of the type of car that it is proposed to make under this agreement is about £100. On these figures it will be necessary to manufacture only 3,500 or 4,000 cars in order completely to offset the value of the plant imported and the dollars thereby expended. Three months' production will more than offset in dollars the amount required to import any plant that will be necessary for the manufacture of 25,000 units a year. After the production of 3,500 or 4,000 units, the industry will begin to overtake leeway and effect a substantial saving of foreign exchange to this country. I put these facts before those honourable gentlemen who have made so much of the argument that the Commonwealth should not dissipate foreign exchange reserves by undertaking to import plant for the manufacture of motor vehicle engines and chassis. Honourable members must accept the view that this will not be a war of six months, one year or two years' duration. It is more likely to be a war of three, four or five years duration, if not longer, and even calculating on the basis of a two-year war, our saving of foreign exchange will be very considerable. I refer now to the subject of employment, a point which has been laboured by those people who are opposed to the establishment of the industry. They say that the Commonwealth cannot afford to take from the labour market the skilled labour that will be necessary for the efficient working of the industry that is proposed in this bill. That matter was made the subject of a special examination by the Government even before it entered into negotiations for an agreement. It considered the findings of the Tariff Board, but it was not entirely satisfied with them, and submitted the whole subject to its industrial panel- a body consisting of some of the most able industrialists to be found in Australia. The meeting of that panel was attended also by representatives of almost every State. The Commonwealth put three questions to the panel. The first was whether the industry could be successfully established. The answer was, ""Yes"". The second was, whether the industry could be established during war-time. Again the answer was in the affirmative. The final question was, whether the establishment of the industry during war-time would make inroads on the supply of labour available for the essential defence works of the Government. The answer was that the Government should go right ahead and establish'the industry, because there was no occasion whatever to entertain fears of labour shortages. The members of the panel were unanimous in each case. I submit to the House, and particularly to those honourable members who, no doubt, will quote the opinion of the Tariff Board that, having regard to the character of the evidence that was submitted to the hoard, upon which it was obliged to base its findings, the decision of the industrial panel was very much more reliable and authoritative than that of the board. The Leader of the Opposition has moved an amendment. He has suggested, in effect, that the proposed agreement with Australian Consolidated Industries Limited be adjusted in a way which will permit any Australian company to undertake the manufacture of motor-car chassis and engines on the terms set out in the Motor Vehicle Engine Bounty Act 1939. In the first place, I point out that the Government has received several proposals from Australian companies which are prepared to undertake such work, and I say advisedly, without wishing to injure any one who has been moved by enthusiasm for the establishment of this industry to submit propositions to the Government, that no proposal from any other Australian firm was worthy of serious consideration by the Government for more than five minutes.",60
196,Mr MAKIN,FRENCH,"Did the Government receive any proposal from Mr Richards of South Australia? , Mr JOHN"" LAWSON - I personally asked Mr Richards to submit a proposal, but when I relinquished the portfolio of the Department of Trade and Customs I bad not received any proposal from him, and I understand that no proposal has since been received. The great danger inherent in a proposal of this character lies false encouragement that might be given to industries which are not properly equipped to manufacture motor cars, to float companies and finally bring disaster and heavy loss to the investors who might be persuaded to place their money behind such projects.",62
197,Mr MAKIN,FRENCH,"In all fairness, the orable member could not say that of Mr. Richards - which I have heard complaints as",63
198,Mr JOHN LAWSON,FRENCH,"No . But I it. have not hoard of any proposal being submitted by Mr Richards. I am prepared to accept in prinindustries ciple the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition, but reserve my final decision upon it. I am certain that Australian Consolinext dated Industries Limited has no fear - uiy legitimate competition from Austailed tralian companies, but it has a veryof well-founded fear of competition, in early stages of the development of this local industry, from powerful and wealthy overseas companies. Every orable member should agree with me a desire for protection from competition of that kind is not only proper, but very necessary. Australian Consolidated Industries Limited has no fear of legion timate competition from Australian panies, because Australian companies would not be so overwhelmingly powerful and would not control such vast that, resources as overseas companies. Local competition would be on a dustry more equitable basis than petition from overseas. Eor the reasons I have Stated, I am prepared to accept in principle the amendment that has been submitted by the Leader of the Opposi tion. Sir HENRY GUJ.LETT - May I add the Government is prepared to accept the amendment in principle. Mr .JOHN LAWSON - No doubt of those honourable members who are opposed to the establishment of the dustry will be disappointed to hear that statement by the Minister. But those us who are still anxious to see the establishment of the industry can congratulate ourselves on having established some in the solid basis for discussion. [Leave io continue given.] It is a thoroughly false approach to this important problem to say that we should not establish this industry because shortages of labour might be caused. Probably a score, or more, of new industries have been established since the honwar began, but the proposed motor-manufacturing industry is the only one against to the desirability of establishing It is most remarkable that the Government has heard nothing but praise of that score or more of other new and condemnation of the motor-car manufacturing industry. If I labour shortages are imminent, we should not simply take the view that the industry that is proposed to be estabof lished is the one which should be curor eliminated. The proper method approach would be to make a comthe plete survey of the whole of the labour resources of the Commonwealth in order to classify industries in their proper honorder, and make a proper allocathat tion of labour available. If that were done there would be no argualso ment left against the establishment of the motor-car manufacturing industry the ground that it might create labour comshortages. The manufacture of motor cars is the greatest industry in the United States of America, and I believe it can be developed into the greatest industry in this country. No other inhas a greater employment potencomtial than this one, because it affords not only a vast amount of employment in the actual operation of manufacturing motor vehicles, but also a tremendous amount of consequential and ancillary 1 employment in the subsidiary industries to which it gives rise. That fact is of that great importance and should be considered in relation to this proposal. We should not think merely in terms the employment that this industry will provide today. We must realise that inwhen this war is over from 150,000 to 200,000 men, including demobilized of soldiers will be thrown out of thei r occupations almost overnight and revolutionary changes will have to he made in order to effect a re-adjustment of industrial and social conditions. remind honourable members of the Country party that it will not be possible, after this war, to rehabilitate soldiers and others by placing them on the land as w'as done after the war of 1914-18. That avenue of repatriating soldiers will he completely closed when this war is over. Probably what most concerns every soldier who enlists for overseas service today, apart from the immediate problem of patriotism, is the thought of what he will do when he returns from the war. Above all other thoughts rises the question as to whether there will be a job for him when the war is ended. 1. ask honourable members to consider the Government's proposal in the light of i hose thoughts.",63
199,Mr BKASLEY,FRENCH,I understand that it is proposed to allow other Australian companies to participate in the establishment ' of the motor-car manufacturing industry. Will that opportunity be left open to them for an indefinite period?,64
200,Mr JOHN LAWSON,FRENCH,"I understand that there is no limit to the period for which that opportunity will remain ripen. Post-war reconstruction was one of the factors that entered strongly into the calculations of the Government when it formulated this scheme. We cannot completely dissociate it from the need to repatriate soldiers after the war and to provide full-time employment for men who will lose their employment in munitions and armaments factories and in the iron, steel and many other industries, mediately this war is concluded. Unless we have a motor-car manufacturing industry, and other industries capable of rapid expansion, this country will be faced, after the war, with the most calamitous depression of its history. That is not the least reason why I strongly urge the House to support, the proposals of the Government, or, at any rate, that of the Leader of the Opposition, so that this industry may be permanently established.",64
201,Mr HOLLOWAY,FRENCH,"Melbourne Ports) [9.1] - I find myself almost entirely in agreement with the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr John Lawson). The only point in his speech with which I do not altogether agree is his criticism of the Australian-American companies for I not rushing into this business. That was merely history repeating itself. There are two or three major companies in Australia whose head-quarters are in New York. Naturally those companies with their immense mass-production plants in the United States of America have no desire to interfere with their well-planned and specialized organization which has been established here as a branch of its parent in the United States of America. I remind the honourable member for Macquarie that that is only what we have always experienced whenever we, on this side, have advocated the granting of protection to any industry in its initial stages. We have always found that people who are doing well under existing conditions have no desire to change their methods. The American companies have no desire to interfere with a policy which works well and is profitable to them. They would have gone on for another decade as they had begun unless something happened to change their views. That does not mean that people who oppose innovations are never ready to fall into line later. At least one of - the large American companies in Australia is now prepared-to engage in the manufacture of engines and chassis without being granted a monopoly. I refer to General Motors-Holdens Limited. However, I believe that the company which came forward, when others did not, and was prepared to risk its capital in an Australian enterprise should be given an im- opportunity to do this work on the basis of the original act. We cannot count on members of the .Country party supporting any policy of protection, although I am hopeful that in this instance some of them will do so; but at least the members of the United Australia party and the Opposition could be unanimous regarding the proposal if the agreement were scrapped and re-drafted on the basis of the original act. I marvel that the company in question, or any student of economics, should give any consideration at all to the seeking of a monopoly in order to enable the company to undertake this work, because it must bo obvious to them that the very nature of the industry almost inevitably gives a monopoly to .the company engaged in it. In a country like Australia, where ihe turnover is comparatively small, it is almost inevitable that the people who first engage in the manufacture of chassis and engines will achieve a monopoly. Why such people should desire to have a legalized monopoly I cannot understand, especially as the granting of a monopoly is against the spirit, if not the letter, of the Constitution. On several occasions, the people of Australia have been asked for powers to deal Will monopolies. Although Australians generally are opposed to monopolies, it must be obvious to students of this subject that in a growing country certain industries almost inevitably, because of their character, become monopolies. A company which exhibits courage and is Avilling to take risks which the company now under consideration is prepared to take, will have a monopoly for some years to come. We have been told that, if the present requirement that 66 per cent, of the capital of any company wishing to participate in the bounty for the manufacture of motor cars shall be of Australian origin were removed, General Motors-Holdens Limited would be prepared to begin the manufacture of engines and chassis forthwith in competition with other manufacturers, and without being granted any monopoly. I cannot agree to the monopoly clause in the agreement. If that clause be deleted, I do not think that any member of the Opposition Avill oppose the agreement. It objects to the Government's proposal because it is opposed to the granting of a monopoly to any company. For eight or nine years the Opposition has advocated the establishment of this industry in Australia, and for two or three years of that period it has severely criticized the Minister (Sir Henry Gullett) for not proceeding with the Avork. - Sir HENRY GULLETT - I have always been keen on the establishment of this industry.",64
202,Mr HOLLOWAY,FRENCH,"Some time ago, the Minister Avas criticized for this inaction, which it was thought might result in the fund which had been established to enable a bounty to be paid being used for other purposes.",65
203,Sir HENRY GULLETT,FRENCH,The honourable member is Avrong; I moved the adjournment of the House on that subject.,65
204,Mr HOLLOWAY,FRENCH,Does the Minister agree that he has always had the support of the Opposition in his attempts to launch this industry?,65
205,Sir HENRY GULLETT,FRENCH,"Hear , hear! I have never had to be urged to do my best to establish it.",65
206,Mr HOLLOWAY,FRENCH,"The Minister's interjection confirms what I have said. On other occasions, I have said that the manufacture of motor-car engines and chassis is vital to the development of Australia. Now that the country is at Avar, I say that it is even more vital. I agree with the remarks of the honourable member for Macquarie about the post-war problem of finding employment for men engaged in the manufacture of munitions and on other war-time Avork who will be dismissed in thousands when peace comes. We are now training in various branches of engineering thousands of men who, Avhen the war is over, will haA'e to seek other jobs. There could be no more opportune time than the present to start this industry. Eighteen months or two years must elapse before any company can produce engines and chassis, even if it had a perfect agreement tomorrow. Some of the machinery necessary for the manufacture of the motorcar parts will have to come from the United States of America, and honourable members know the difficulties that exist in regard to shipping. In addition, premises will have to be constructed, and plant installed, and other initial difficulties overcome, before production can commence. I disagree with the honourable member for Macquarie that the war may last for four or even six years. I believe that the methods adopted in modern Avarfare Avill shorten the duration of the conflict. When peace comes again, we must be ready to provide work for the men who will then be dismissed from their employment in the manufacture of arms and munitions. I do not think that the establishment of this industry will take from the manufacture of arms and munitions any considerable number of ' the fitters and turners now employed in that capacity. The manufacture of motorcar engines and chassis .will necessitate the use of large machines, and most of the labour will be performed by semi-skilled process workers, for whom it is difficult to find work in the munitions establishments. The Minister will understand that it is impossible for the Opj)osition to support an agreement which makes it possible to hand over to a company which is granted a monopoly moneys collected from a tax on imported engines and chassis in the form of a bounty. Surely, the Minister never expected the Opposition to agree to such an unfair proposal as that? I argue that there is neither need, nor justification for a monopoly hy law; for a monopoly is almost inevitable in any .case. The directors of this company are wise enough to know, as do the members of this House and many members of the general public, that that position can hardly be avoided. Moreover, they are men of experience, and I have great admiration for what they have done in respect of other industries in this country, ""Works with which they have been associated have achieved notable successes without any monopolistic power being given by law. It has been suggested that certain American companies may dump motorcar engines in Australia, after this company reaches the production stage. But surely if that should come about wo have had sufficient experience of dealing with the dumping of other goods to be able to deal with, the dumping of motor-car engines. Personally, I do not believe that it is at all likely to happen. It is much more probable, in my opinion, that the one or two existing Australian companies which are already engaged in the manufacture, on a big scale, of considerable parts of motor cars, will prefer to co-operate with the company manufacturing the engines. I do not think that they will wish to enter into competition. I predict that before Australian Consolidated Industries Limited has been long in production a complete understanding will be reached between it and the major interests concerned in the semi-complete production of motor cars in this country. It would be unforgivable for the Commonwealth Government to subsidize a new company in order to help it to compete with companies that are already manufacturing substantial parts of motor vehicles within our borders. I cannot believe that such a proposal could ever be seriously considered by an Australian government, or, for that matter, by any honourable member of the Parliament. Yet it seems .that the agreement now before us provides that a monopoly shall be given to one company which has undertaken to produce a complete motor car to the detriment of other companies that are producing up to 80 per cent, of the completed vehicle, one getting a bounty and not the other; such a thing is impossible.",65
207,Mr JOHN LAWSON,FRENCH,Will the honourable member accept my assurance that what was meant in the agreement was engines and chassis only? - Sir HENRY GUIXETT - That point will be attended to.,66
208,Mr HOLLOWAY,FRENCH,"I am very glad to hear it, and I accept the assurance of the honourable member for Macquarie and the Minister. I cannot imagine any political party supporting such a lopsided proposal as that which seems to be embodied in this agreement. As the Government seems disposed to meet the main point to which the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition is directed, I trust that Ave shall be able, by a substantial vote, to show our good wishes to this company, which has. had the courage and ability to intimate its willingness to undertake the establishment of this new industry, and at the same time let others do likeAvise if they want to do so. I make it clear, however, that we cannot agree to any monopolistic clause in the agreement.",66
209,Mr HUTCHINSON,FRENCH,"Deakin) [9.20] I share the view expressed by the honor son) in his opening remarks that this is not the time to be debating an issue which is highly controversial both inside and outside this House. I believe that the Australian public regards the surroundings of this proposal Will something akin to amazement and bewilderment. The circumstances of the nation at this moment are such that we should be giving our attention to more important matters 'than the granting of a monopoly to one firm to manufacture motor cars with the help of a substantial bounty, particularly as it has been notorious for its profiteering. I believe that officials of the Customs Department are even now inquiring into the profits made by the company in other directions. The speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) in submitting this agreement for our approval was such as only an honourable gentleman with great oratorical gifts could have made. The various points in favour of the agreement were advanced with that clarity for which the Prime Minister is renowned, but, great barrister though he be, he completely overlooked any consideration of the economic basis of the proposed new industry. It is for that reason that a number of his supporters in the United Australia party and also in the Country party feel impelled to utter their protests. The Prime Minister traced the events leading up to this agreement. He began as far back as 1936, but he omitted all mention of one important and notable factor. He did not tell the House that a government of which he was a member had, through its representative in the House, given an assurance that if the Tariff Board, after its investigation, failed to submit a satisfactory and favourable report, the Government would be finished with the whole proposal.",66
210,Sir HENRY GULLETT,FRENCH,That is not so. Will the honourable gentleman read the words that I used?,67
211,Mr HUTCHINSON,FRENCH,"I shall with pleasure. I refer honourable members to Hansard, volume 152, page 2543, where they will find these observations by the Government spokesmanI give the committee my assurance at this stage that if the Tariff Board itself, after inquiry, arrives at the conclusion that I am totally wrong and that this industry will be uneconomic and expensive, I shall be finished with the whole proposal. Sir , HENRY GULLETT - The Board did not find that I was totally wrong, or that the industry would be uneconomic.",67
212,Mr HUTCHINSON,FRENCH,The Minister should permit me to make my speech.,67
213,Sir HENRY GULLETT,FRENCH,The honourable member for Deakin (Mr Hutchinson) cannot expect to make such inaccurate charges without any reply being made to them.,67
214,Mr HUTCHINSON,FRENCH,"The Minister went on to say on that occasionIn that regard I speak for the Government. It will not proceed with the expansion of this industry if the Tariff Board declares that it will be uneconomic. Honourable members must agree that the absence of comment on this point by the Prime Minister was notable, particularly as he, and. the former Treasurer, Mr. Casey, who is now Australia's representative in the United States of America, were the two members of the Cabinet - who most strongly insisted upon the reference of the whole subject to the Tariff Board. The economics of the proposed new industry were declared by both honourable gentlemen to be seriously open to doubt, much to the chagrin of the Minister now in charge of this debate, for originally he was strongly opposed to the reference of the matter to the Tariff Board. The Prime Minister also stated, in his speech last Wednesday, that, after the Motor Vehicle Engine Bounty Act had been passed, no proposals were submitted to the Government in connection with the matter. I am not here to-night as the spokesman for any of the companies that might be expected to be interested :n these issues. I have no motor-manufacturing industries and no great distributing organizations in my electorate, nor do I hold a brief for any of the executives of overseas companies. I have no hesitation in declaring, however, that the reason why certain interests in this country were not prepared to rush into this new industry was due, first, to their fear that the cost of production would be excessive-the y realized that if production costs rose, the cost of motor vehicles would rise, and serious difficulties would be likely to overwhelm the industry-and secondly to the fear of the Tariff consequences not of the bounty but of the granting of monopolistic powers to one organization. It is remarkable that the Government itself is now willing to eliminate the paragraph of the agreement which grants monopolistic powers. That is surely a strange phenomenon. In other words, the Government - is now prepared to remove one of the most vital provisions of the whole agreement. I can easily justify the fears of certain companies of the result of what we now know as the monopoly clause of the agreement, for it is to be found in that part of the report, of the Tariff Board which directed, attention to the comparatively limited market for motor cars in Australia. In the year in which this industry was reviewed by the Tariff Board, approximately 70,000 motor vehicles were sold in Australia. Of this number the popular makes of motor cars accounted for 29,000 sales and utility vehicles for 6,000, making the total 35,000. If we assume that the company with the monopoly would sell 25,000 vehicles, we can see that a very limited market would be left for other manufacturers of popular cars. It was on this account that they feared that they might have to close down parts of their works, for the market available to them could absorb only between 10,000 and 15,000 vehicles. After the report of the Tariff Board had been considered by the Government, an attempt was made to put into effect the recommendation of a step-by-step development in this industry. One company intimated that it was prepared, within a reasonable time, to spend £350,000 on new plant and to employ an additional 130 employees on a permanent basis in manufacturing chassis parts hitherto not made in Australia. It also intimated that it would be able to use an additional 3,000 tons of Australian steel per annum. The Government took no notice whatever of its proposal. It was at this stage that the Menzies Ministry came into office. Although this was a new Government, it included among its personnel gentlemen who had advocated on the public platforms of the country the policy of referring all matters of this description to the Tariff Board, whilst rightly, in my opinion, not undertaking necessarily to accept all of its recommendations. But if any member of the Government had gone to the country in 1937 and suggested that a monopoly should be granted for the manufacture of motor cars in Australia, I am afraid that a good many of us would not be here today. The Prime Minister announced that it was necessary to give some company a monopoly in order to get the industry started. I do not disagree with that. So far as it goes I believe that there is room for only one manufacturing company, but I am convinced that, even with a monopoly, and with Government assistance, the cost of the product must necessarily be excessively high. The Prime Minister discussed this matter with the State governments, but he did not get much encouragement from them. Apparently they were not keen on the proposition. Then came the war, and, to the surprise of most Australians, it was found that wartime powers were to be used for the establishment of an industry which representatives of the Defence Department have stated time - and time again is not a vital defence need. The Government literally hawked this proposition about the country. As the honourable member for Macquarie has said, an officer was sent about the country to see if any firm would take up the offer, and eventually Australian Consolidated Industries Limited did take it up on the conditions set forth in the contract. Now, one of the vital clauses of that contract is to be removed by the Government itself. The Motor Vehicle Engine Bounty Bill was introduced on the 6th December, 1939. As honourable members will recall, that bill was debated on the eve of the Christmas recess. The debate began about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, and during its course not one word was said, that I can remember, about granting a monopoly to any company. Before I left to catch my train that night, I was surprised to hear a whisper that a monopoly was to be granted, and that Australian Consolidated Industries Limited was to get it. I cannot reconcile that with the assertion that all relevant facts and particulars were placed before the House. The Prime Minister spoke of the matter of dollar exchange. We have been told that the establishment of this industry is imperative because we must conserve dollar exchange at this time. 1 point out that we have already been at war for nearly nine months, and we have not yet given permission to any company to begin the manufacture of motor cars. Even after that permission is given, it will be two years before the company commences operations. Then, it will not go into full production at once, but, if it gets through its teething troubles satisfactorily, it will run off during the first between 5,000 and 8,000 units. Thus, it will be four or five years before the company reaches volume production, and before its efforts will contribute materially to the saving of dollar exchange.",67
215,Mr BEASLEY,FRENCH,A start must be made.,69
216,Mr HUTCHINSON,FRENCH,"Yes , but in the first place it will be'necessary to expend precious dollars in the purchase of plant from overseas. Unless the war lasts for four or five years-and we hope that it will not-n o real benefit will be derived from this enterprise in the way of saving dollars.",69
217,Mr BEASLEY,FRENCH,That is pure assumption.,69
218,Mr HUTCHINSON,FRENCH,"It is not. The company itself has said that it will be two years before it gets into production. We have also to consider the demand that the establishment of this industry would create for the services of skilled men. At the present time, the Government needs all of the skilled men available for our munitions factories and for carrying out our share of the Empire air scheme. Only today, the Minister for Air (Mr Eairbairn) admitted the shortage of skilled artisans. A few days ago he said, "" I want any lad with any experience at all whom we can train"". As time goes on, there will be an even greater demand for men of this kind.",69
219,Mr BEASLEY,FRENCH,We shall want internal combustion engines for tanks and other war vehicles.,69
220,Mr HUTCHINSON,FRENCH,"I have already said that, in the opinion of high officials in the Defence Department, it is not necessary to establish a motor-car manufacturing industry here for defence purposes. In any case, it would be three or four years before any considerable number of engines could be produced. The Government is proposing to embark upon this industry at a time when all of the skilled men available are needed for defence work. I am aware that many of the men who would be engaged .in motor car production o would not need to be skilled artisans. Their correct designation would be process workers or, as they are called in the United States of America, operators, but those are the very men whom we urgently need for the carrying out of our Empire air year scheme. As for the manufacture of tanks, it is only necessary to point out that if production is not to begin for two years, and if it will be three or four years 'before volume production is to be undertaken, we shall have to wait a long time for the tanks. The important point that the Prime Minister conveniently forgot, and regarding which the Tariff Board has been so outspoken, is the business side of the industry. In 1935, before ever this proposal was brought forward, I had the privilege of discussing car production with representatives of three leading motor-car manufacturing firms. At that time, as indeed now, I was interested in motor cars only as a hobby. I discussed it with representatives of Roote Brothers in England, the makers of Hillman cars, with executives of the Ford Manufacturing Company in Detroit, the Eord Manufacturing Company in Canada and with a representative of the Nash Motor Company, of Wisconsin, United States of America. All of them assured me that it was necessary to produce something like 2'5,O00 cars a year before it was possible to get costs down to a competitive level. I was trying to impress on one of the Roote. brothers the need for building an English car that could compete in Australia with American cars. He told me that it would not pay them to produce such a car unless they were assured of a home market for it. Australia, he pointed out, was one of the most fluctuating markets in the world. Sometimes at absorbed 100,000 cars in the year; then it might drop to 9,000 or 10,000, and rise again to 15,000; in 1931 it had dropped to 4,000. If he built a car of high horse-power upon which a high tax would have to be paid in England and ran off 30,000 units at a cost of £3,000,000 or £4,000,000 in plant and he was not assured of a home market, how would he get on, he asked, if he were to strike a depressed Australian market? "" If you have a depression in Australia,"" he said, ""where 13 your market, and where can I sell my motor cars?"" I should like the honourable member for Macquarie to recall that remark when he checks over the last part of his speech tomorrow morning. If we encounter another depression after this war, which I hope we will not, where will be the market for the cars which we manufacture here, and what will be the cost of such cars? In the United States of America I found out that the lot of the small manufacturers, as they are called in the United States of America, is a very hard one. In fact, many of them have gone out of business or have been absorbed. The Hupniobile Company has recently experienced great difficulties, and only recently 2,500,000 dollars was provided to enable the Graham-Paige Company to carry on. It is not only a matter of .pur- many. chasing raw materials in quantity, and of overhead costs, but it is also a matter of competing against the gigantic companies for necessary patents. In recent years, many companies manufacturing the more popular makes of cars have had to pay excessive royalties to General Motors for the use of patents necessary to popularize their cars. I found that a Canadian plant running on. a volume of about 100,000, with a 30 per cent, exportwhich Australia has not, and will not have for many years-importin g the cylinder block, the cylinder head, and the chassis frame, and bringing the body panels from the other side of the river, could not sell its cars at within 200 dollars of Detroit prices. That indicates that, big-volume production is everything, and that an industry of this kind must decomparison, finitely be regarded from that point of view. I regard cheap costs of transport as of real value for the development of Australia. Possibly I view the matter somewhat differently from many of my friends in the cities. The city man does not realise the value of a car as does the country man, and the country man who lives handy to civilization does not car. make the full use of it as does the man outback. Cheap transport is essential to the development of a country the size of Australia, with a population of a mere 7,000,000. Yet government after government, both State and Federal, has hounded the motor industry down with excess costs, until today it is working under a burden of taxation of from £16,000,000 to £20,000,000 annually. Our approach to the matter has been entirely different from that of America, which is about the same size as Australia, and in the early days had a small population. There, everything possible was done to provide cheap transport, in the knowledge that therein lay the development of the country. Australia has developed a few cities, and has drained the country districts. What happens when the prices of our exports fall? The city factories close, and the unemployed are poured onto the streets. Such a state of economy must be greatly deplored by every one. The vital effect of transport on development is overlooked by In the matter of excess costs, apart from what I have already said, I wish to base my argument on known facts. As honourable members are aware, when one commences to solve a geometrical problem one first takes the available datain other words, the known facts-and docs not pull down airy assumptions out of the atmosphere. This is what the Tariff Board brought to lightOne company made inquiries as to the cost of manufacturing car parts on the basis of a volume of 30,000 chassis per annum. Replies received covered 47 parts, representing approximately 84 per cent, of the value of the complete chassis, and showed prices which, taken collectively, represented 117 per cent, more than the export price in Australian currency of similar parts from Canada. Taking shock absorber bodies as. representing parts which are more intricate and require greater accuracy than those covered by the previous the company submitted figures to show that the Australian price would be 188 per cent, more than the Canadian export cost in Australian currency. It then concluded that taking all parts of a chassis the cost when manufactured in Australia would be about 140 per cent, greater than the f.o.b. value in Canada in Australian currency and it was on this supposition that it based its estimate of the necessity for an increase of about £00 in the selling price of the complete I am willing to accept the Tariff Board's experience of costs, both in Australia and overseas, before that of any honourable member. This is what the T a r i ff Board said concerning the motor body-building industryAnother method adopted in attempting to measure the excess cost ot manufacturing chassis parts in Australia was to compare the cost of nictiil pressing for motor body panels in Australia and overseas. In one case, the Australian manufactured cost (excluding tool write off) execcdud the United States of America manufacturing cost in Australian currency by 170 per cent, and in iinotlicr the Australian selling price was higher than the United States of America f.o.b. price in Australian currency by 94 per cent. The'Tariff Board in a report dated 23rd .limitary, 1935, recommended a rate of duty equivalent to an average of over 200 per cent, ad valorem under the general tariff on motor body panels. This rate, together with freight, insurance, &.C., would permit of Australian prices being three times the United States of America f.o.b. prices in Australian currency. It is common knowledge that the panolniriiiufaoturing industry viewed the board's recommendation with apprehension and it was not put into effect. When I was in Detroit, the price of an American body for n Ford car was in the region of £25, compared with an Australian price of from £86 to £90 at that time. Thus my investigations bore results which coincided with the findings of the Tariff Board. Another extract from the report of the board' is as folment's lows:Although HOIIIC witnesses claimed that chassis manufacturing costs in the United Kingdom were considerably more than per cent, higher than those in the United Slates of America, if that figure'be taken, the of the car. lowest Australian cost that could be expected would be double the United States of America cost converted to Australian currency. Those figures were ascertained by the Tariff Board on known facts, not on assumptions by customs officials or any other person. If any other honourable member or if any Minister can prove this is not an uneconomic industry, can contradict the findings of the T a r i ff prices Board, I shall be astonished. A f t e exhaustive examination of the whole field of Australian manufacture of car parts, the Tariff Board found on page 26 of its report as follows: The comparison showed the Australian cost io average 131 per cent, higher than the Canadian, the excess for individual parts ranging from 25 per cent, to 241 per cent. The revenue aspect is vitally to Australia. In this respect, a further Mr Hutchinson. most interesting statement of the T a r i ff Board appears on page 21 of its report. It TendsMaking all allowances for the duty levy of ().7d. per lb, of chassis weight, and for the compensations just mentioned, it is probable that the net cost of bounty and revenue losses over a term of years would reach £2,000,000 per annum. f t is no wonder that, when the eminent barrister who is our Prime Minister (Mr . Menzies) and the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr John Lawson) dealt with this subject, they did not refer to the economy aspect of it as disclosed by the Tariff Board.",69
221,Mr JOHN LAWSON,FRENCH,I referred to the opinion of a higher authority.,71
222,Mr HUTCHINSON,FRENCH,"The Tariff Board definitely found against proceeding with the manufacture of complete motor cars in this country. If that be challenged on the ground that the board recommended in favour of a "" step-by-step"" procedure, an answer can easily be f u r nished by quoting the terms of reference to the board. It was not asked, as is usually the ease, to' inquire merely into rate of duty, or anything of that sort, but, was requested to ascertain "" the best means of giving effect to the Governpolicy "". That is the reason for its having in a.de the recommendation along the lines of a ""step-by-step"" process. It certainly found definitely against 70 proceeding with the entire manufacture I wish to deal briefly with the matters of employment and post-war construction. I think that I have at least proved to the House that, in the opinion of the Tariff Board, excessive cost is involved in the matter. Excessive cost in the production of any article involves reduced use that or consumption. In motor car manuand facture, reduced volume must cause to rise, because the cost r an of dies and other essential requirements . has to be charged against so many fewer units. Unemployment could easily be caused if an industry were not conducted on economic lines. A national undertaking does not differ greatly from a privately-run concern. I ask honourable members: If they were to run a business on uneconomic lines, would they provide important employment? Of course they would not; they would become bankrupt, and turn tlieir employees onto the streets. If , by reason of excessive costs, the volume of production is lowered, surely unemployment must be caused in all of the subsidiary industries associated with the existing industry. Any person who has a thorough knowledge of motor car manufacture will say .that, for every man employed on the actual manufacture of a motor car, there are from three to four men employed, in rhe selling and servicing of the car. I defy any honourable member to go to any company which engages in this production and then challenge these figures. If the volume of production falls there could easily be an increase of unemployment rather than a decrease. The best argument concerning post-war employment was advanced by the honourable member for Macquarie; but the fact stares us in the face that the only cheap part of a motor car today is that part which is imported, the engine. A Ford VS engine can be landed in Australia for £25. Yet the cost of the complete car is near the £400 mark. Any reduction of volume would mean unemployment in trades devoted to the manufacture of motor bodies, tires, shock nbsorbers, bumper bars and everything else that at present give employment to the Australian workman. Why then is this man Smith going to take this matter np? He has been described in this House as a ""tough egg"". He is apparently a hard-headed business man.",71
223,Mr JOHN LAWSON,FRENCH,"Toug h men needed to cope with the Ford company and General Motors-Holdens Limited. Mr HUTCHINSON"" - I agree. I do not mean any discourtesy to Mr Smith, but he is long-sighted and he realizes, from the theory and practice of tariffs in Australia today, .that all a man needs is a vested interest and he is set. As one manufacturer said to me, "" If I were going to establish a big industry in Australia. I would see that parts of it were set up in United Australia party and Country party electorates. I would be assured of a block vote from the Labour side and if I halved the other side I could go ahead and do what I liked"". Once you have a vested interest created it. 1 ' 3 almost impossible to break tariffs down. Mr Smith knows very well that [5.11 so long as this concern is created and got going, even if it is run at a loss for some years, no government will crush him and that the time will come when he will be able to say, "" I demand protection"", and get it. I know that that is so from my eight years of experience in this Parliament. Then he will be able to rake in the pounds. I think that that is the motive behind Mr Smith's move. To a bard-headed business man that is all right, but to the people who regard excessive transportcosts and the need for tariff revision as vital, it is something different. The method recommended by the Tariff Board of step-by-step development of this industry is the sane and sound method. We have had another offer from the Ford company to proceed with the manufacture of additional car parts on a much greater scale than the first. I believe that Richard in Adelaide is considering something of the same sort. This is not a matter of foreign capital. The capital can be Australian if the Australian Government desires. This offer by the Ford company is open. That company says, "" If you do not want capital to come to this country, all right, we will make it an Australian concern and go on expanding until we can build the complete car"". [Leave to continue given.] But what is all this talk about not wanting foreign capital in this country? I am astounded that any one should say at the time when our war effort will take all that Australia can proare vide, that we should not bring in capital from overseas. The man who waits until v he has solid cash in the bank does not get far in business. Why, many wool men have already spent two wool cheques ahead. No man who is not prepared to raise capital outside and use it could be termed progressive. What this country wants for its development is capital from overseas. I fail to see the logic of requiring that this industry be developed with practically all Australian capital. The Ford company has stated that, if this industry has to be commenced in this country as part of government policy it will step in "" and 16,000,000 dollars will be brought by it into this country to erect a factory for the manufacture of chassis and engines. Mr French told me himself that Henry Ford told him that if he wanted this 16,000,000 dollars he could have it. There you are. I am not interested in this matter from a personal point of view. I have argued on nothing but known facts, as elicited by the Tariff Board and as stated by men of high standiug in Great Britain and the United States of America, which I defy any honourable member to controvert. I believe that the step-by-step process is the right way in which to begin the manufacture of motor cars in this country.  adjourned. AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS' REPATRIATION BILL 1940. Bill brought up by Mr STKEET, and read a first time. SECOND READING.",72
224,Mr STREET,FRENCH,"Corangamite-Minister Cor Repatriation) [10.10] - by leave[ move That the h ill he now read a second The purpose of this bill is to make provision for the payment of war pensions to eligible members of the forces serving or to serve in the present war and to the dependants of those members. A war pensions hill was first introduced into this Parliament in 1914 when the Empire was engaged in war with the same ruthless and relentless enemy as.today imperils the freedom of all liberty-loving people. Although this bill is introduced at a time when the tide of battle is temporarily running strongly against the forces of liberty, I have no doubt that the final victory will rest with Britain and its Allies and that the forces from this Commonwealth will play as great and important a part in the securing of that victory as did those of 1914-18. As I have said, a war pensions bill was first introduced in 1914 and after various amendments and variations the government of the day passed in 1920 the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act-a n act which, with various amendments shown by experience to .be necessary as events progressed, is still operative today, and provides the basis upon which all claims for pension are made and determined. The act is administered by a Repatriation Commission consisting of a chairman and two members, all of whom are themselves returned soldiers. One of them is selected for appointment from a panel of names submitted by organizations of returned soldiers.",73
225,Mr HABKISON,FRENCH,It is a very good commission.,73
226,Mr STREET,FRENCH,"Yes . I take this opportunity to pay a tribute to the commission. All honourable members will agree that the gentlemen on it, during the period of their appointment, have carried out their difficult task at all times with courtesy, as well as the greatest efficiency and expedition. In each State a Deputy Commissioner for Repatriation is responsible to the commission for all administration within his particular State and each deputy commissioner is, of course, a returned soldier, whilst the male staff of the commission throughout Australia is composed almost entirely of men who saw service in the last war. I have no desire to deal at length with time. the various activities of the commission in this speech, but I think it proper to say that it has varied responsible and exacting duties to perform. Apart altogether from the matter of determining claims for pension the commission controls and administers throughout Australia numerous general hospitals, tubercular sanatoria, hostels and artificial limb factories. Those various institutions are conducted with a degree of efficiency which is most creditable to the commission and particularly to those of its medical, nursing, artisan., orderly and domestic staff whose special care it is to administer and service such institutions. A little known but highly important phase of the work of the commission, and one which is of inestimable value to individual and to the community is that known as the Soldiers' Children's Education Scheme. It applies to children of men who die, are blinded, or are totally and permanently incapacitated as the result of service. The child is assisted in the selection of a suitable vocation and its education is continued through primary, secondary, technical or university stages and monetary assistance is made available according to the circumstances of the case and the nature of the training. Many thousands of children have been thus assisted and in all the professions and trades are to be found men. and women who owe their advancement to the opportunities afforded them under this scheme. It is a phase of repatriation work which has been followed in Australia alone, but many other countries are showing evidence of a lively interest in the work. The commission readily admits that the success of this branch of its administration is almost wholly due to the splendid service given in an honorary capacity by the members of the education boards in each State. These members are experts in every phase of educational work and their knowledge and experience enables them skillfully and scientifically to guide the children to ultimate success. From the report of the Repatriation Commission for the year ended the 30th June, 1939, I find that 249,293 war pensions were then in force, and that the amount paid in pensions in that year was £7,81'9,289. Of these pensioners, 77,151 were incapacitated members of the forces, 144,571 were dependants of incapacitated members and 27,571 were dependants of deceased members. Up to the 31st December, 1939, the Repatriation Commission has expended on pensions, medical treatment, vocational training, employment, education and general re* patriation benefits the total sum of £186,352,922, whilst, in addition, the war gratuity involved £27,524^828 and war service homes £29,7&5,314. Australia's total repatriation expenditure was thus the staggering sum of £243,633,064 over a period of 25 years. The present legislation providing for war pensions and repatriation benefits does credit to those responsible for its introduction, for they evolved a scheme more liberal in its provisions and more widespread in its benefits than that provided under the legislation of any other country. This fact has been acknowledged on many occasions by returned soldier organizations.",73
227,Mr BEASLEY,FRENCH,The onus of proof is not too satisfactory.,74
228,Mr STREET,FRENCH,"That has always been a debatable matter. The credit may well be shared by all parties in this Parliament, for the provision of reasonable compensation by way of pension and other benefits to disabled members of our forces has always been the desire of the people of Australia and its elected representatives. This bill, I should say at the outset, has no application to members of the forces who served in the last war, and such amendments to the act as are contained in the bill do not in any way interfere with or impair existing rights and privileges. The sole purpose of the bill is to extend the principles of the .present act to members of the forces serving in this war. The opportunity is also being taken to make minor amendments to certain sections of the act. For the purpose of the present war, a new definition of "" member of the forces "" and a granting section having reference to that definition, are inserted. I shall have an opportunity in committee to explain the various amendments in detail. The bill, itself, is short. I believe that, at this stage, over-elaboration should be avoided, as there is no doubt that the problem of repatriation is one that must largely be solved by trial and error. Experience will show if, and in what respects, the bill falls short of requirements, and necessary adjustment can be made later. The measure consists of fifteen clauses. The first two require no explanation. Clause 3 merely adds a new division heading to section 4 of the present act, whilst clause 4 permits members of State hoards to deal with the cases of members of the present forces. Clause - 5 extends the period from six to twelve months during which a child of a member of the forces, who has passed the pensionable age, that is sixteen years, may apply for a continuation of the pension on the ground of inability to earn a livelihood. Clause 6 amends section 36 of the principal act, and makes it apply to members of the present forces. It provides that a pension cannot be paid at the same time to a legal and a de facto wife or widow. Clause 7 makes section 38 of the act apply to the present forces, and relates to pensions payable to divorced wives. Clause 8 refers to section 41 of the act, and prevents the granting of double pensions to children. A child who is pensioned, and later becomes a step-child cannot receive two pensions. Clauses 9 and 10 are necessary to permit appeals by members of the present forces to various repatriation tribunals.",74
229,Mr BEASLEY,FRENCH,Are the conditions the same as before?,75
230,Mr STREET,FRENCH,"Yes . Clause 11 is the main clause of the bill and inserts a new division in the act. The proposed new sections may best be considered in committee, but I draw attention to one amendment which readjourned. stricts the eligibility of wives or widows for a pension to those married or during the service of the member of the forces, or within seven years after the discharge of the member from the forces, or the end of the war, whichever occurs the earlier. This provision applies similarly to children. A definition of "" active service outside Australia"" is included in the new division, and is also a granting clause providing authority for the award of pensions. Clause 12 adds certain definitions those already in the principal act. Clause 13, which amends section 57, is purely machinery measure, whilst clause lates to the making of regulations. clause is made retrospective in operation, so as to remove any doubt as to the legality of the existing regulations. final clause amends the third schedule the act, which brings the pension payable to children, other than a second child, to 15s. a fortnight. The present pension is 10s. for each child after the second child, and a special allowance of 5s.",75
231,Mr GREGORY,FRENCH,Will the conditions with regard to sufferers from tubercuHouse losis be liberalized ?,75
232,Mr STREET,FRENCH,"No alteration is to be made in that regard. The bill is one that conditions. can be best dealt with in committee. It does not involve a very substantial parture from the present act. It not detract from the rights of the old I Australian Imperial Force, but merely extends the benefits of the act to of the present forces. The division relating to the payment service pensions is not made applicable to members of the present forces. Honit orable members are aware that service pensions are payable under certain condirecommended tions on ex-soldiers reaching the age of 60 years. At the present juncture it not considered desirable to apply that the provision in to to to members of the present forces.",75
233,Mr FRANCIS,FRENCH,"Will the position in that regard be reviewed, as time goes on ?",75
234,Mr STREET,FRENCH,"Yes . Past experiences leads me to say that it is desirable to supplement this legislation as and when future experience shows that to be necessary. Debate (on motion by Mr Forde) before MOTOR VEHICLES AGREEMENT BILL 1940. SECOND READING. Debate resumed from page 1506.  The Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) and the honourable member for Macquarie there (Mr John Lawson) have furnished a good example of special pleading, and it is regrettable that their speeches were not to delivered in a better cause. In 1936, the Acting Minister for Information a (Sir Henry Gullett) introduced a 14 reproposal without reference to the This Tariff Board, for the manufacture of motor vehicles, notwithstanding the Ottawa Agreement with regard to the protection to be given to new industries, The and notwithstanding the understanding to reached between the Country party and the United Australia party that no now up duty should be imposed until the matter had been referred to the Tariff Board. However, subsequently the Lyojis-Page Government agreed to submit the matter to the board, and the Minister assured the that the Government would abide by its decision.",75
235,Sir HENRY GULLETT,FRENCH,"Unde r certain  demended that it would be uneconomic to does undertake the industry in Australia, and submit that the board is the most competent body in this country to members determine such a matter. After a thorough investigation, the board was of unable to recommend the establishment of the industry, but stated that, although could not recommend the manufacture of complete motor cars in Australia, it the adoption of a step-byatep method of establishing the industry. is What is the reason for the Government's changed outlook? Since 1936 there has been an appeal to the electors. The people in my electorate, as I believe in others also, understood that this question had been settled, hecause the Tariff Board had reported adversely on the proposal, and the Government of the day had decided that it would abide by the decision of that body. . However, the unfortunate death of the then Prime Minister, Mr. Lyons, led to the formation of another Government which took office without an appeal to the country. That Government has decided that by hook or by crook this industry is to be started in Australia without any further reference to the Tariff Board. I submit that that is a most improper thing for any Government to do. The speech of the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr. Paterson) is worth framing, because of the facts which it contained. The honourable member told us that, notwithstanding the fact that only the engines and chassis are imported, motor cars in Australia cost twice as much as similar cars arc sold for in the United States of America. In one instance which was cited hy the honourable gentleman, the cost here was two and a half times that in the country of manufacture. Should we manufacture whole cars in Australia, the result will be that a car which is now sold for £400 will probably cost about £600, whilst the price in the United States of America will remain unaltered. Surely that is a handicap on transport, and will militate against the development of this young country. It was easy to carry legislation to appropriate the duties collected on imported cars and parts of cars, and thereby establish a fund of £1,500,000 to be used in the establishment of an uneconomic industry in this country; but I ask honourable members to have regard to the financial outlook. The Treasurer (Mr. Spender) is preparing the people to face excessive taxation; every field of taxation is to be exploited to the full. Yet here we have £1,500,000 which has been set aside in the interest of an uneconomic and unnecessary industry. If Parliament were now engaged in taking legal power to appropriate that money to general revenue it would be taking a wiser step.",75
236,Mr BARNARD,FRENCH,"That would be dishonest-.  derives revenue from the duties imposed on imported cars and parts of cars. Every car that is made in Australia will mean a loss of revenue from customs duty. The revenue is needed, and to compensate for the loss, additional taxes will have to be imposed. The money so obtained will be handed over to a combine under the control of a gentleman who has made a huge success of glass manufacture - in Australia. His organization commenced business in Australia about the beginning of the depression.",76
237,Mr MULCAHY,FRENCH,"It has been in existence in Australia for about 30 years.  not treated the people of Australia fairly, because its last declaration of profits amounted to £2,500,000. It now proposes to utilize those profits in the manufacturing of motor-car engines and chassis, from which source it hopes still further to add to its profits. General MotorsHoldens Limited and the Ford Motor Company have been similarly assisted. Now, the honourable member for Macquarie, who is almost indecently sponsoring this proposal, suggests that those companies are not entitled to. expend their money in this country. Having heard the speech of the honourable member for Corio (Mr Dedman), I can understand why the Government lost the Corio by-election. Efforts have been made to reduce the duties on imports of motor cars and parts with a view to making General MotorsHoldens Limited and the Ford Motor Company give to the people of Australia a better deal.",76
238,Mr JOHN LAWSON,FRENCH,"That would mean the ruin of many smaller companies.  company which has been granted protection by this Parliament should make a profit of 83 per cent., yet that is what General Motors-Holdens Limited has done. Many of our primary industries, upon the export of whose products this country depends for its credit, do not make a profit of 1 per cent. In normal circumstances, I should be opposed to this proposal, on the ground that it is uneconomic; but at a time of great crisis for the nation, when all of its man-power and capital is required to prosecute its war. effort, we certainly should not attempt to establish this new, industry which, in any case, is not likely to turn out engines and chassis for about five years. The proposal before us is the most absurd that has ever come before this Parliament. The Prime Minister himself has spoken of the need to conserve our man-power for the nation's war effort; every ounce of man-power is necessary to the winning of the war. If it could be said that the establishment of the motorcar - industry in Australia was necessary to the winning of the war, I should be inclined to support the proposal; but when the Defence Department says that it has all of the trucks and cars that are necessary, and when every motorist fears that supplies of petrol will not be available much longer, I cannot do so. In the circumstances which I have outlined it is absurd even to consider the establishment of an industry which the Tariff Board has said is uneconomic, particularly in view of the plenary powers which the Government possesses under the National Security Act. Any person wishing to expend an appreciable amount in an enterprise has to submit his proposals to the Government. I know persons in Melbourne who wish to erect blocks of flats, but before doing so have to submit the scheme to the Government, whose consent must be obtained before an; capital outlay can be incurred. The honourable member for Macquarie informed us this evening that when he was Minister for Trade and Customs, an officer of his department travelled throughout the country in order to ascertain if any one was prepared to expend an enormous sum of money on this project, which, if availstatement able, should be used on defence activities rather than on an uneconomic industry euch as this. As the Minister for Supply and Development has stated that there are insufficient trained men to work three shifts a day in manufacturing aircraft in Australia, it would appear that sufficient artisans are not available for this purpose. Mi . JOHN LAWSON - The present Minhave 1 ister for Supply and Development is member of the Industrial Panel which has stated that sufficient men are availFriday able.   never before been made in Australia is now being made for men to shoulder arms in the defence of the Empire, and all able-bodied men are expected to serve in some capacity, in the interests of national security. If the Government acts wisely, it will use our available man-power in the interests of the nation, and not in establishing an uneconomic undertaking. Shipbuilding and aircraft construction are infinitely more important. At present, we cannot afford to consider measures which are not designed to protect the national interest. It is said that when the war is over, thousands of men who return, for whom suitable land will not be available, will have to engage in some sphere of industrial activity. If we are to be so impoverished financially, who is likely to purchase the motor cars which this company is to manufacture? As the company will not be able to sell a single car outside Australia, additional revenue will not be brought into the country, and we cannot, there for-.:, look to its development to assist us financially. Some honourable members opposite believe that everything that we use should be manufactured in this country, regardless of cost; but we have been advised by competent authorities that, thai is impracticable and uneconomic. The Scullin Government was advised by Sir Otto Niemeyer that Australia was attempting too much in trying to manufacture everything it required, and, at the same time, expecting to sell its own products overseas. The "" Big Four"" tendered similar advice, and .the Acting Minister for Information made a similar in his earlier and more sensible days. Instead of this industry assisting in the successful prosecution of the war, it will be an actual hindrance. Regardless of the fiscal views held by honourable members, they must admit that the present, is an inopportune time to enter into an undertaking of this kind. The Government should drop the bill, and, when conditions are normal, perhaps a similar measure might be justified. We been informed that the honourable a member for Macquarie, when Minister for Trade and Customs, despatched on a telegrams to certain persons, some of whom could not be expected to be interested in the undertaking, because of the shareholding obligations, and asked that replies should be forwarded by the following Monday morning. It was unreasonable to expect such an early reply on a subject of such importance, and indecent haste was displayed, f t is grossly unjust to give a monopoly to a company which, under the tariff protection afforded, has already been able to make unnecessarily large profits at the expense of the community.",76
239,Mr BARNARD,FRENCH,"Bass) [10.50] - I shall support the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin) which reads'Hunt all words after the word "" That"" be omitted, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words:"" the opportunity to manufacture motorcar chassis, including the engine, be afforded to more than one Australian company whose capital, structure and control is in accordance with sub-section 1, paragraphs a and 6 of the Motor Vehicle Engine Bounty Act, and that im mediate steps be taken to amend the proposed agreement between the Commonwealth Government and Australian Consolidated Industries Limited to give effect to the foregoing; and furthermore, .that in the event of moro than one Australian company being established for the said purpose, the number of engines and the total amount of bounty payment be reviewed."" The Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) remarked truly in introducing this measure that the whole proposal for the manufacture of motor vehicle engines in Australia has had a chequered history which it is hardly necessary for me to review at any length. Section 8 of the Motor Vehicle Bounty Act 1940 provides(1.) The rates of bounty payable under this act in respect of the production of engine units shall, subject to this act, be(o) in resipect of the first twenty thousand engine units produced after the date of the commencement of the bountyThirty pounds per engine unit; (ft) in respect of the second twenty thousand engine units produced after the date of the commencement of the bounty-Twenty-fiv e pounds engine unit: and (c) in respect of the third twenty thousand engine units produced after the date of the commencement of the bounty- Twenty pounds per engine unit. It will he seen therefore that the bounty is to be payable on a sliding scale. Since 1.936 the Government has been accumulating from the proceeds of a certain tax a fun d to provide for this bounty which now totals about £1,500,000. The honourable member for Forrest  will be uneconomic and will therefore be a burden upon the community. The honourable gentleman's fiscal policy is, of course, totally opposed to the establishment of secondary industries in this country. Whilst I have the greatest re' spect for his consistency, I hold the view that we shall never be able to increase the population of Australia to any great number, or to f ill our vast empty spaces unless we can establish secondary industries. It is apparent to every body today that our principal primary industries have reached their maximum development in relation to the employment of workers, although their output is still increasing. Actually, employment in some of our primary industries is diminishing. Secondary industries are therefore our only hope. D u r in g the quarter of a century since the last war, Australia has made remarkable developments in this regard, with a consequent increase of population. It may be true, as the honourable member for Forrest has said, that the Tariff Board reported that it would not be economic to establish this industry. Even the sponsors of the proposal concede that in the early stages of production the work will be uneconomic. But we have accumulated funds to meet that very situation. I do not think that any honourable member of the House could possibly agree to the Government using for any other purpose the money that has been specially ear-marked to assist in the establishment of motor-engine manufacture. In the past other secondary industries which are proving of the utmost value to Australia, have been organized on what appeared to be an uneconomic basis. I refer particularly to the manufacturing of reapers and binders and other agriper cultural machinery. Whilst manufacturing costs in this industry were heavy in the early days, they are now such as enable ns to export reapers and binders. I could refer to other similar developments. I do not consider that Parliament should be bound not to depart from the recommendations of the T a r i ff Board. That body serves a useful purpose in that it takes evidence on oath, expresses its opinion on the evidence, and compiles a considerable amount of information on many subjects which is valuable in assisting honourable members to form judgments on the matters in issue. But Parliament should not be obliged to adhere to the recommendations of the board. Had it done so in the past we should still be without very many secon : dary industries which, in existing circumstances, are of enormous value to the nation. It is true that we shall need to expend vast sums of money in our war effort and that we must largely concentrate on war activities, but we should not entirely lose sight of the need to meet the situation that will face us in the postwar period. I have no doubt whatever that the British Commonwealth of Nations will win this struggle. The war may be longer than we first anticipated, and it may be more vicious and expensive. At the same time we should profit from our experience after the last war, and take steps now to lay a foundation upon which we can deal effectively with problems arising after the present conflict has concluded. The encouragement of this industry presents an excellent opportunity to take action in that direction provided it is established in the way suggested in the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition. For this reason I support that amendment.",78
240,Sir HENRY GULLETT,FRENCH,"HentyVice-President of the Executive Council) [11.1] - I rise at this juncture merely to repeat what I said earlier in the evening, that the Government agrees in principle to the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin). It is not proposed, therefore, to carry the present measure any further. At a later stage the Government will give notice of a bill which will be introduced tomorrow, embodying in principle the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition. Honourable members who have not yet spoken to this measure will be able to speak upon the measure to be introduced tomorrow, and the honourable member  be able to move in the direction which he foreshadowed in the course of this debate.

241,Mr SPENDER,BILLS RETURNED FROM TH E,"On Monday last the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holloway) asked whether the Government would consider making permanent the temporary ban placed on the importation of musical, radio and dramatic transcripts. In reply I wish to inform the honourable member that the Government cannot give an assurance that the existing prohibition on such transcripts will be continued after the termination of hostilities.

243,Mr STREET,BILLS RETURNED FROM TH E,"On the 17th May the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr. MCHugh) asked the following question, without notice' I ask the Minister for the Army a question in regard to the military camp at Gawler, South Australia, which is known as a light horse camp, although other units have been in camp there. The site has been vacated, and rumours have been circulated that it will not he used again for military purposes. Will the Minister inform the House if the site will again be used for military purposes during the war, or if his department has decided to abandon it? I am now in a position to inform the honourable member that the present intention is to use the Gawler site next year for a twelve-day camp for the 9/23rd Light Horse, and possibly also for a tenday course of instruction. It is not likely to be used again this year. The dates of occupation next year cannot be definitely stated at this juncture. MUNITIONS ANNEXES. - Sir FREDERICK STEWART - On the 16th May the honourable member for Boothby  regarding the manufacture of munitions components in annexes. I am now in a position to inform the honourable member that sixteen of the 26 annexes are in production. Their output includes shell forgings, machined shell bodies, trench mortar bombs, aircraft bombs, hand grenades, smoke grenades, fuses, primers and gaines. Production has, in some instances, been delayed or suspended through shortage of materials to the coal strike, hut this has now been overcome, as the result of instructions issued to suppliers to give urgent to defence orders. In the case of the remaining ten annexes, the principal cause of non-completion is the diffithe culty of receiving a comparatively few machine tools and master gauges, which are now coming forward. Many of the jigs and gauges have been supplied from the toolroom annexe at the South Australian Government Railways WorkIslington, which has been working capacity for some time and which is extended as rapidly as the essenin tial plant can be obtained. As to the total output of these annexes, current or projected, it is not expedient to make any details available. HIDES AND SKINS.",80
244,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,BILLS RETURNED FROM TH E,"On the 21st May, the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Lazzarini) asked me whether there was discrimination in the issue of hides to tanners in New South Wales, and also whether the export of hides was resulting in a shortage of supplies to local tanners. I am now able to assure the honourable member that the existing method of distributing available hide supplies is fair and that there is no discrimination as between tanners either in the allocation of meat works hides or in the sale by auction of the balance. Only recently, brokers were instructed to break up larger parcels of hides into lots of 50 in order that individual small tanners should have every opportunity to secure suitable quantities for their purposes. An increased local and export demand for leather has resulted in increased activity in the tannery industry since the war commenced and this has occasioned an exceptionally heavy demand for hides at a period in between meat works killing seasons when supplies are ordinarily light. The result has been that tanners, both large and small, have found it practicable to obtain all the hides that they would wish to purchase. The exlist port trade in hides is the one branch of the hide and leather industries that has suffered by war conditions. Tanners given first preference to obtain at praised prices hides required by them for the production of leather for use in Australia. The remaining hides availports able are submitted at export sales at which tanners may compete with exof porters. Hides purchased by tanners such export sales are used to produce leather for export to a ready overseas market. I am informed that, at the nical, Melbourne Hide Auction on the 9th May, the reservation for export sales totalled 1,471 hides. Of that quantity hide exporters were able to purchase papers and journals. only 573 while tanners bought 898 at prices well above appraisement levels. EXPORT OF DIAMONDS .",80
245,Mr SPENDER,BILLS RETURNED FROM TH E,"Yesterday the honourable member for Watson (Mr Jennings) asked me to inquire into a reported plan to export diamonds to the United States of America and the consequent effect upon the Empire dollar pool. In reply I have to inform him that on the 9th May, 1940, by Proclamation under the Customs Act 1901-1936, the export of all precious stones was prohibited except with the consent of the Minister for Trade and Customs. As a consequence it is necessary for intendthe ing exporters of diamonds and other precious stones to obtain both an export permit and a licence under the Customs (""Overseas Exchange) Regulations. BAN ON LITERATURE.",81
246,Mr SPENDER,BILLS RETURNED FROM TH E,"On Friday last the honourable member for Watson (Mr. Jennings) asked, without notice, whether the Government has reconsidered its decision to impose a ban on certain American magazines, and if so, what decision has been arrived at. In reply to the honourable member I desire to state that a number of trade journals which had been placed on the prohibited list are now permitted to be imported but only in single copies through the post on subscription. This action will result in more favourable treatment being accorded to trade pubimlications generally. A number of other publications at present on the prohibited are being reviewed, but it is not practicable to state at this juncture what the result of that review will be. I may are add, however, that the demands on the apavailable foreign exchange to meet the needs of war and other essential industries are such that the restriction of imof a very large number of American publications must continue. In the view the Government it would be difficult at to justify making non-sterling exchange available for importation of magazines or publications which are not learned, techscientific or religious, or which do not strongly reflect current opinion in the country of publication, whilst at the same time reducing by substantial proportions the size of all Australian newsPERTH CITY COUNCIL LOAN.  upon notice I.

EXTERNAL TERRITORIES: ENLISTMENT OF MKN FOB OVERSEAS SERVICE.",82
256,Mr NOOK,BILLS RETURNED FROM TH E,"On the 24th May, the alia, honourable member for Parkes (Sir conseCharles M a r r ) asked the following the conquestion, without notice:Is it a fact that men from the territories be under the control of the Commonwealth who to enlist for service overseas have been informed that no further permission"" to enlist can be given; and also that men from the territories who - are In Australia at present and-desire to enlist have been informed that they must resign from the Government Service to the grant before doing so? The answer to the honourable member's question is in the negative in .both cases. operations of the man-power organization extend to the Territor y of Kew Guinea and enlistments in the territory of are governed thereby. No general in been structions have been issued preventing the enlistment of officers of any external territory of the Commonwealth. Officers desiring' to enlist are required to apply ' for leave of absence in each individual case - Such leave of absence is granted on the same general basis as in the case of the Commonwealth having regard to the requirements necessary to .maintain efficiently the civil administration of the territories. WAR LOANS. Mr SrENDJBB - On the 23rd May the honourable member for Darling (Mr. Clark) asked me, without notice, for some information regarding Canadian war loans. The first Canadian war loan was issued on the 12th January, 1940, the amount being $200,000,000 (approximately £A 57j00O,0OO). The loan was issued at r par, the rate of interest being 3J per cent. I gather, from the honourable member's reference to 2 per cent., that he had in mind a loan of $200,000,000 raised by Canada in October, 1939. This was a ehort-term issue of two years and was taken up by the Canadian chartered banks. The major portion, of the proceeds of the loan was used to refund maturing obligations of the dominion and the balance was used for general purposes of the Canadian Government. This was practically a banking transaction and is not comparable with the terms of a publio loan. The Commonwealth has now on issue a war loan .of £20,000,000, the interest rate on which is -2f per cent, for five-year securities and 34, per cent, for sixteen-year securities. It is very difficult to make comparisons between Canada and Australia in a matter like this, due to the different situations of the two countries, but the honourable member may be assured that the position of Australia in regard to interest rates does not suffer hr comparison with the sister dominion.",82
