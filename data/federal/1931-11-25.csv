4,Mr LYONS,D EATH OE GENERALSIRJOHN,"Ha 3 the Prime Minister given consideration to the protests made to him agaiust the imposition of primage duty and sales tax on books of an educational character; if so, will he indicate the intentions of tlic Government in regard to this tax on knowledge?",11
5,Mr SCULLIN,D EATH OE GENERALSIRJOHN,"The representations to which the Leader of the Opposition has referred were merely a renewal of those made when the primage duty and sales tax measures were uuder consideration in this Parliament. Invariably, new taxation arouses protests in some quarter. A Parliament is sometimes obliged to imposo taxes against its inclination, a tax on books is one of them. It is not easy, however, to distinguish between educational books and others; much depends on the point of view. The Government has to raise additional revenue, and if all the exemptions that have been asked for were granted, other sources of income would have to be explored. Those who have made representations against the tax on books are the best organized protestors of whom I have knowledge, for I received 40 telegrams on the one day, lodged simultaneously at the same telegraph office. EXCHANGE. . Mr. Curtin - Will the Treasurer state whether the Government has made any proposals to the exchange pool regarding the reduction or maintenance of the present rate of exchange?",11
6,Mr THEODORE,D EATH OE GENERALSIRJOHN,"The Government has not asked the banks to reduce the exchange rate; on the contrary, in consultation with the Commonwealth Bank, the Government indicated that its policy was to endeavour to maintain the existing rate. . STATUTE OE WESTMINSTER .",11
7,Mr GUY,D EATH OE GENERALSIRJOHN,"In view of the fact that at least two of the Australian States have objected to, and arc making strong protests against, the proposed Statute of Westminster, and that the bill for its adoption is at present before the British Parliament, will the Prime Minister advise the Imperial Goverument that the States of Western Australia and TasBOOKS. mania have protested against this measure, aud suggest that it he held in abeyance until agreement on the subjeel has been obtained?",11
8,Mr SCULLIN,D EATH OE GENERALSIRJOHN,"The Parliament of Western Australia adopted a resolution in opposition to the proposed Statnto of Westminster, and tlic Commonwealth Government's first knowledge of it was a communication from the United Kingdom stating that it had been conveyed to the British Government. We thought that at least we might have been communicated with simultaneously with the Imperial Government. The Commonwealth Government communicated with all the State Governments, examined their objections, and gave assurances that there was no desire to encroach in any way on the constitutional rights of the States. To make assurance doubly sure, a supplementary motion to that effect was submitted to this Parliament and adopted. The Government of Great Britain is apparently satisfied, for it has introduced a bill in the terms of the proposed statute. The Commonwealth Government has no intention to make further representations to the British Government other than to urge the passage of the bill through the I m perial Parliament. Mr D . CAMERON,-Is there any foundation in the report, that the amendments to the resolution accepting the Statute of Westminster which were agreed to by the Commonwealth Parliament, were uot included in the measure brought before the British Parliament?",11
9,Mr SCULLIN,D EATH OE GENERALSIRJOHN,"There has been some deletion from the amendments which were moved by this Parliament, and, if the honourable member desires, I shall give him the particulars tomorrow.",11
10,Mr LATHAM,D EATH OE GENERALSIRJOHN,Will the Prime M in i ster make a statement in the House!,11
11,Mr SCULLIN,D EATH OE GENERALSIRJOHN,Yes . NA NEW SOUTH WALES.,11
12,Mr COLEMAN,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"I ask the Treasurer whether the agreement made between the Commissioners of the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales and the Board of the Commonwealth Bank for the amalgamation of the two institutions has been approved by the Commonwealth Government; if so, is any validating legislation necessary; if not, can immediate effect be given to the agreement so far as it concerns the Commonwealth Bank? Has the Premier of New South Wales indicated his attitude to the agreement?",12
13,Mr THEODORE,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"On Monday the representatives of the Commonwealth Bank presented to me the draft agreement reached by the committees representing that institution and the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales. After consultation with the Prime Minister, I advised the Commonwealth Bank that the Government approved of the draft, which I minuted accordingly. When the formal agreement is presented, it will be approved by mo as Commonwealth Treasurer. The Commonwealth Bank Act requires no other sanction or validation on behalf of the Commonwealth. WAR SERVICE HMS.",12
14,Mr WHITE,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"I ask the Assistant Minister in charge of War Service Homes whether he can make known to the House the recommendations of the Cabinet subcommittee which investigated the concessions requested by occupiers of War Service Homes? Is the Minister aware that the State Savings Bank of Victoria, in agreement with the Government of that State, intends to evict certain occupiers of War Service Homes whose payments are heavily in arrears?",12
15,Mr CUNNINGHAM,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"No finality has been reached in regard to the requested concessions. If the honourable member will let me have a list of the persons to be evicted by the State Savings Bank of Victoria, I shall investigate the matter. I remind him, however, thai persons financed by the bank aro in the position of ordinary mortgagors, and in such cases the Commonwealth Government has no power to intervene. OLD-AGE PENSIONS.",12
16,Dr MALONEY,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"I ask the Assistant Minister in charge of pensions whether arrangements can be made for the old age pensioners to be admitted into the drill room at Elizabeth-street on paydays, and so be under shelter from rain and heat; and, if possible, be provided with seats?",12
17,Mr CUNNINGHAM,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"I shall inquire into the honourable member's sugges'tion, ancl let him have a reply. PAPERS.

WHEAT BOUNTY.",12
18,Mr THOMPSON,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"Is the money for the bounty on wheat available; if not, when will it be made available? Will the Minister also state what steps are being taken by the Markets Department to acquaint the wheat-growers of the procedure to be followed in applying for the bounty ?  the next two or three days I shall be able to make a complete statement as to the exact position. TELEPHONE RATES.",12
19,Mr LACEY,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"Is the Postmaster General aware that a general impression prevails among persons who have entered into contracts for the payment of certain telephone rentals, that the rates will be reduced after seven years, at the expiration of their contracts? ""Will the Minister state whether any of his predecessors have given tliC3C persons to understand that such a reduction in rates would take place, and will he consider reducing telephone rentals in accordance with the decline in the purchasing value of money?",12
20,Mr A GREEN,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"I have received no word to the effect that the persons concerned expect a reduction in their telephone rentals after seven years when their contracts expire. The question of reducing telephone rates has been repeatedly raised in this House, and referred to me in correspondence, but every examination has shown that it would be entirely uneconomical to reduce telephone rates. We are today showing a great loss on telephone services. With the exception of one other country, we have, the lowest telephone rates in the civilized world, and if the telephone rates were reduced, a further loss would be sustained. EEDERAL CAPITA L TERRITORY. Houses MINING LAWS.",13
21,Mr TULLY,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"Has the Minister decided to allow mining in the Eederal Capital Territory; and, if so, what mining laws are to be adopted?",13
22,Mr BLAKELEY,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"A mining ordinpassage ance dealing with mining in the Federal Capital Territory has been promulgated, and will be made available in the future. AMENDMENT OF BANKRUPTCY agreement.",13
23,Mr R GREEN,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"I understand certain representations have been made to the Attorney-General concerning a necessary amendment to the Bankruptcy Act, covering deeds of inspectorship.. there any likelihood of the act being amended in that direction shortly, because if no alteration is made, a great deal hardship will be . inflicted on country storekeepers throughout the CommonZealand wealth?",13
24,Mr BRENNAN,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"It is correct representations have been made to me, proposing amendments in the banktrade ruptcy law, and relating to many things, including deeds of inspectorprevent ship. It was proposed that a short amendment should immediately be introduced to cover that point, but we other countries? have a number of matters which we propose to submit to the House by way of amendment to the Bankruptcy Act, and deeds of inspectorship will be among them. Precisely how far we shall be able to meet the wishes of those who have made representations on the subject is a matter for further and fuller consideration, but I think that I can assure the honourable gentleman that a bill, dealing with the subject that he has raised, will be introduced at an early date. NECESSITOUS BONDHOLDERS.",13
25,Mr LEWIS,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"When is it anticipated that the necessary arrangements will be completed to enable bondholders, in necessitous cases, to obtain an advance, as provided for in reeent legislation passed by this Parliament?",13
26,Mr THEODORE,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"The measure referred to makes full provision for meeting hardship cases. It passed both of the Commonwealth Parliament, and has since received assent. The agreement does not become operative until ratified by the State Parliaments. Three weeks ago, the Commonwealth Government corresponded with the State Governments, urging them to expedite the of the ratifying legislation in their respective Houses, so that the hardship provisions might operate. I do not near know how many of the State Parliaments have passed that legislation, but until they pass it, we cannot operate the ACT. that TRADE AGREEMENT BETWEEN CANADA AND NEW ZEALAND.",13
27,Mr HAWKER,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"Has the attention of the Minister been called to a report in Is yesterday's Melbourne Argus, in which the Australian Trade Commissioner in of Canada, Mr L. R. Macgregor, statesI t is almost certain that a Canadian-New trade treaty will be negotiated in the near future which should place New Zealand butter on an equal basis with Australian as that regards tariff preferences. Is it a fact that the Australian-Canadian treaty, which was recently negotiated, contains no clause which would it from being more or less nullified by other treaties which may in the near future be made hy Canada with  notice the statement of tBe Australian Trade Commissioner in Canada, but have had no official communication from Mm. I know that a similar statement was made about a month ago, but nothing further has happened. I am not aware that any negotiations are taking place or are contemplated respecting a trade agreestamps ment between Canada and New Zealand. The honourable member can rest assured that Australia's interests will be guarded in any circumstances. IMPERI AL CONFERENCE.",13
28,Mr CUSACK,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,Can the Prime Ministhe ter infonn the House whether the British Government has decided upon the place aud time of the next Imperial Consuch ference?,14
29,Mr SCULLIN,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,There is no informaNew tion to hand as to the definite time or place of the next Imperial Conference. PETROL INQUIRY.,14
30,Mr FRANCIS,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"Some considerable time ago, the Government undertook to make an inquiry into the selling price of petrol within Australia. A preliminary report bad been received, and it was stated that a further inquiry would be underthey taken. Will the Prime Minister inform the House what is the position today, and when does he expect to be able to present a report to the House concerning the selling price of petrol?",14
31,Mr SCULLIN,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"The Government has appointed to the Board of the Commonspecial wealth Oil Refineries Limited an official of the Treasury, so that it will be better informed as to the whole position regardpartments. ing our interest in that organization. An officer of the Customs Department is at present investigating the general question of duties and excise on petrol and the margins between them. Other informaagainst tion has also been gathered. We are them ? a-waiting information from those officers as to the real position before deciding whether an inquiry is necessary. When we get the information, it will be given to the House. "" ON SERVICE "" STAMPS.",14
32,Mr CROUCH,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"Can the PostmasterGovernment's General say whether O.S. stamps have recently been issued to the public, and, if instance. I so, whether there is precedent in auy postal administration in the world for such action? If O.S. stamps have been issued to the public, will the Minister give the reasons for the action taken ?",14
33,Mr A GREEN,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"A number of O.S. have been made available for sale to the public, ancl there are precedents for such action. In the Mandated Terrisafetory of New Guinea, O.S. stamps were recently issued to the public, although not by the Postmaster-General's Department. The reason for making available these stamps to the public is that all over world there are stamp collectors who will get O.S. stamps by surreptitious means, and pay high prices for them, if stamps are confined to the Public Service. That actually happened in Guinea; stamps which_were bought for 2d. each were sold for f l each. Moreover, it is known that certain Melbourne stamp dealers forged New Guinea O.S. stamps. It will not be necessary to forge these stamps. The free sale to the public will prevent that.",14
34,Mr YATES,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"Are these stamps being sold to the public at their face value, and can they be used for ordinary postage? If can be so used, will the Minister explain why O.S. stamps are necessary?",14
35,Mr A GREEN,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"The O.S. stamps are being sold to the public at their face value, but it has not been decided whether they may be used for ordinary postage. They were used on letters posted by the Christmas air mail to Great Britain, although ordinarily O.S. stamps are confined to use by government de how many of the New Guinea stamps were forged, and what action was taken the person or persons who forged",14
36,Mr A GREEN,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"It was not possible, to ascertain who forged the stamps; but it is known that a large number of O.S. stamps were in circulation, and that the only way to secure them, other than by obtaining them from members of the Public Service in New Guinea-and that was not possible-wa s to forge them. The action will make forgery unnecessary and unprofitable in this WIRELESS BROADCASTING .",14
37,Mr WHITE,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"H as Cabinet considered the making of appointments to a board to control wireless broadcasting; and, if so, what names have been suggested ? If the matter has not yet been dealt with, will the Government consider the advisability of appointing a select committee to inquire into the control of broadcasting, as wits done in Great. Britain in connection with the British Broadcasting Corporation, an institution which is without political bias?",15
38,Mr SCULLIN,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"At a later hour today the Postmaster-General will move to introduce a bill to deal with national broadcasting. Until that legislation has been passed, no action will be taken along the lines indicated. Obviously, it will be necessary to pass tlic legislation before anything can be gained by making a selection. Tbere is no need to appoint it select committee to make nn investigation at this stage. GROUP TELEPHONELINES . Mr M . CAMERON - Will the Postmaster-General consider the advisability of altering the regulations relating to group telephone lines, so that where one person in u group defaults in payment, the other members of the group will not be penalized tlirough having their telephone service disconnected? Mr A . GREEN - The question raised by the honourable member is one which cannot be answered off-hand, since it involves « radical departure from the existing system. I invite the honourable gentleman to place his question on the notice-paper. TOBACC ODUTIES .",15
39,Mr JONES,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"When does the Minister expect to receive the report of the Tariff Board on tobacco duties? Will lie give 'an assurance that no alteration of the existing duties will be made pending the receipt, of the report?",15
40,Mr FORDE,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"I shall have inquiries made to ascertain when the report of the Tariff Board ou tobacco duties is expected, .and shall lot the honourable member know. It is not, usual to give assurances thai duties will not be altered. nlijcct of referring the matter to the Tariff Board was to have a full investigation made. When the board's report is received, it will be carefully considered by the Government before any alteration is made. CONTROL OF FIRE - ARM S. Dr MALONEY "" - In view of the con : fusion caused by'conflicting laws in the several States regarding the possession of revolvers, and other similar weapons, will the Attorney-General bring in a law to control the sale and possession of firearms, which will apply throughout the Commonwealth ?",15
41,Mr BRENNAN,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"I am afraid tha< constitutional limitations would prevent the Commonwealth from legislating in the direction indicated. The States have ample powers to control the possession of fire-arms within their boundaries. I cannot promise that the Government will consider the introduction of federal legislation to control fire-arms. UNE'MPLO YMENT RELIEF GRANT. I'YIUM.U, MOTION FOB ADJOURNMENT.",15
42,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"Hon. Norman M a k in ) . -. 1 haye received from the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) an intimation that he desires to move the adjourmnent of the House this afternoon for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, "" The method adopted by the Government in die selection of men to be em ployed in connection with the recent federal grant for the relief of unemployed "". Five honourable members having risrn in their places, Question proposed.",15
43,Mr BEASLEY,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"West Sydney) [3.29J. - On the 30th September last I was requested by the Glebe Municipal Oouncil to inquire whether the Government intended to make money available this year for Christmas relief, as was done on previous occasions. The Prime Minister answered that the Government intended to do much more before Christmas than had been done in other years. In a cynical way the right Honourable gentleThe man suggested that if we Sad to wait until Christinas to do something f n this-matter, the relief given would be rather overdue. On the 23rd October, the Prime Minister made a statement in this chamber to the effect that the amount of £250,000 would be made available for_ relief work just prior to Christmas. That sum was to be spread over the whole of the States, and £90,000 of it was allocated to New South Wales. Thereupon honourable members who belong to this group made inquiries as to the way in which the money would be distributed in New South Wales. They were anxious to know whether the Government intended that the money would be expended through municipal councils, as was done previously, and to learn just how the labour was to be engaged. That was important to mc and to all the members of this group, as we desired that the expenditure should assist the greatest number possible of needy unemployed persons. We failed to get any satisfactory reply to our inquiries. We were told, in answer to our questions, that rhe Government had not determined the details of the scheme, and consequently, could not enlighten us on the subject. On the Oth November, Senator Dooley made a statement in another place outlining the intentions of the Government, and particularizing the work that was to be undertaken in New South Wales. Following on that utterance, representatives of this group waited upon the Works Director nt the Customs House, Sydney, on the 7th November, and asked what he proposed to do with regard to the engagement of the labour. That gentleman informed us that he had received a circular from the Government detailing the procedure to be followed. That circular was dated the 30th October, which makes it clear that the Government had arrived at a decision before the announcement was made by Senator Dooley. My colleagues persisted in our inquiries as to the method that was to be employed with regard to the engagement of the labour, and were informed that the names of the men desiring work would be registered at the Sydney Customs House, and at the office of the superintendent of the engineers branch of the Postmaster-General's Department in Castlercagh-street, Sydney. Men seeking work proceeded to register at those places, particularly on the following Monday and Tuesday. So many thousands sought registration that the authorities decided to call a halt, and made a public announcement that sufficient names had been recorded. To the surprise of myself and my colleagues, we found that between the time of the determination of the method by which the money would be spent, as set forth in the circular of the 30th October, and the statement that was made by Senator Dooley on the 5th November, supporters of the Government bad been secretly informed its to the procedure to be followed. That gave them an opportunity to canvass the unemployed in their centres who favoured their political opinions, with the result that those persons received priority of registration. In the circumstances, it was not strange that a sufficient number of names was recorded on the Monday and the Tuesday, and that the list was then promptly closed, causing many applicants to be turned away. Our contention is that the Government divulged to its own supporters information denied to other honourable members which provided them with an opportunity to get their friends registered early, thus assisting their political organization, at all events, in New South Wales. We claim that the money that was voted by the Parliament was intended for the benefit of the unemployed generally, and that any announcement by the Government of the procedure of distribution sliould have been made publicly; such information sliould not have been kept confined to those who were supporters of the Government; members of my group, and other honourable members of this House, should have been informed simultaneously, so giving no undue advantage to anybody. I desire to pay the highest tribute to Mr Todd, the Works Director for New South Wales. I have no grievance against that gentleman for anything that he, has done in this matter. He frankly informed us as to the position, and stated that, in the circumstances, the only course open to myself and my colleagues was to send along the names and addresses of those who came to us for employment. After the registration, had closed on the 10th November, there was a positive stampede of applicants to myself and my colleagues both at the offices of the Commonwealth Bank and at our homes. As a matter of fact, ""when men called at the Postal Department's office in Castlereagh-street, the officer in charge informed them that they should go to their local member, and register through him. We contend that it was then too (ate to do anything; that the men who came to us were not given a fair opportunity to obtain employment, as supporters of the Governmenit had already submitted names for registration, and in many instances the men had already obtained employment. shall not dilate further upon that aspect of the matter, as my time is limited. My colleagues will amplify my remarks if they get the opportunity to do so. Of the £90,000that was made available for expenditure in New South Wales, £5,000 was set aside for special work at the naval dockyard at Cockatoo Island. The management of that dockyard determined upon the procedure to be followed when registering names. Eor about a week the names of men were registered at the dockyard-that is to say, the fact that it was necessary to register was publicly known for about a week. Over 1,000 men registered, and the management then declared that they had sufficient for their purpose. In order to prevent any more men coming from the mainland, they posted notices on the Sydney wharfs and at Balmain, informing those seeking employment that sufficient men had already registered. They were then troubled about how to choose the number needed from among the names registered, confining the work available to men who had formerly been employed at the dock. A number of those registered bad not been employed at the dockyard for upwards of ten years. The management decided to engage only those who had been employed at the dockyard within the last four or five years, claiming that such men were more familiar with the work, aud because they had not worked elsewhere but had depended on the dockyard for their means of subsistence, they should have preference of employment. The welfare committee at Cockatoo Island Dockyard, which is composed of representatives of various organizations, had also discussed this matter, and Mr liea&lcy. it arrived at the conclusion that the work should be made available for former dockyard employees. The matter then became a very live issue in the residential centres surrounding the dockyard, which is situated on an island among a number of electorates adjoining the surrounding water. The dockyard itself is in the subdivision of Darling Harbour, in my own electorate, but most of the employees live in adjoining electorates, including Martin, Dalley, West Sydney, North Sydney, and Parkes. After it had been made known that I £5,000 was to be available for this work, it was discovered that' an organization in the Dalley electorate was busily engaged collecting names, to enable its nominees to obtain preference of employment. The Bailey-Theodore organization had sent out its paid organizer, Mr MACPherson, in association with Alderman Thompson, of Balmain, who is also an. organizer for the Eederal Treasurer, and is now working on The World newspaper, to collect names to be submitted for employment. I have bere a number of declarations from men who were visited by those two persons, in which arc set out the reasons that the latter advanced for their activities. One declaration contained this statementI have been approached by men working in the interests of ' Mr Theodore, and promised on his account relief work ut Cockatoo in lieu of my support ut the forthcoming elections. In another declaration the following statement is made: Having registered for relief work at Cockatoo, T was naturally anxious to get a position by fair competition. In conversation with a Mr Simons ami Mr Stuin, I was informed by Mr Simons that to make a certainty of a position all that was necessary to do was to attend the Theodore league and get in. toueh with Theodore or Thompson. S t ill another declaration contains this statementI was approached by a Mr Frank Murphy and told to go to Cockatoo Dock and put my name down for employment, and probably a letter would follow notifying me of a job. The last declaratio n w h i o h I shall quote statesA. representative of. Alderman Thompson called at my residence m i advised me to register my name at CbeRafoo Dockyard for relief work. I wag: told that if I did EP Thompson would see that I was iucluded among those selected, but that I must register my name as a matter of form.",15
44,Mr GULLETT,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,Are these sworn statements?,18
45,Mr BEASLEY,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"Yes . Before I conclude my speech I shall make a proposal which, if accepted by the Government, will enable it to prove its bona fides in this matter. The declarations from which I have quoted are only a few of the number collected. I have dealt only with the Dalley electorate, but the activities of the political organization that I have referred to extend beyond it into my own electorate. I have a letter in which two persons are named, Mr. Charlesworth and Alderman Walsh. These gentlemen were directed ""to collect a selected list of names for Christmas employment for Mr Theodore."" We shall be able to prove, if we are given opportunity to do so, that canvassers went from door to door in my electorate informing householders that they had instructions from the Federal Treasurer to collect 200 names. They also said that their instructions were that priority of employment would be given to those who supported the political views of the Treasurer. We also learned that Mr. MACPherson told a member of the Annandale Workers Association, Mr Gilchrist, who was collecting names for the Federal Treasurer, that work would be available, not only at the dockyard, but also on jobs under the control of the Public Works Department. Mr MACPherson asked Mr. Gilchrist for 50 names. Mr Gilchrist said that he could not supply the names there and then, but he supplied them on the following Sunday, having collected them by the same process that I have already outlined. There is also in Annandale an organito zation known as the Unemployed Workers Movement, which is associated with communist party. This party has branches of the Unemployed Workers Movewhose ment established to conduct political paigns in every centre where it is concenguarantee trating. The Unemployed Workers Movethat ment is working under the direction the communist party. It is interesting to note that the secretary of the Annandale Unemployed Workers Movement took the chair at Mr Theodore's meeting at dale last Wednesdaynight. I state this fact because we have recently heard a good deal about the "" moderate Labour party,"" and have been told by the Treasurer that New South Wales is heading towards communism or fascism. As a matter of fact; we read a little more about that subject in a statement attributed to the Treasurer in today's press. Honourable members will, in these circumstances, be interested in the developments which are occurring in the Treasurer's own electorate, for they show how far that gentleman is prepared, for his own. ends, to exploit any organization, whether it is communistic or otherwise. No doubt the honourable gentleman thinks that the Unemployed Workers Movement, or any other organization, may be called upon to fire poisonous darts at Lang, and cause inconvenience - and trouble to those who foster Lang's views. At any rate, the one of the chief officers of the Annandale Unemployed Workers Movement took the chair at the Treasurer's meeting. This man, I am informed, has already secured employment. The Annandale Workers Association, which has 500 members, has so far not received a reply to its request for information as to when work will be provided for the 50 men whose names it supplied. One of the members of this association attended the meeting of Mr Theodore's league last Wednesday night, and asked the Treasurer to say definitely what would happen in regard to the men whose names had been taken. He was told by the Treasurer that the whole matter was in the hands of Mr MACPherson, the organizer of the party to which I have referred. I have the name and address of this person and he will make the necessary declaration as to the facts when the opportunity to do so presents itself him. When I interviewed him in the presence of others, he told me that he was the informed at that meeting that employment would be guaranteed to the men names had been taken. That the camTreasurer .should have given such a surely is conclusive evidence the expenditure of this money is of being ministerially directed. Having had all this information collected, the Treasurer sent for the manager Annanof the Cockatoo Island Dockyard, and told him that the work must be provided for ex-employees of the dockyard, and at the same time handed him a list of over 100 names. This instruction altogether upset the manager's intention to give the available work at the dockyard to men who had registered and had been employed there during the previous four or five years. All the employment had to be reserved for the men whose names had been collected on behalf of the Treasurer. The manager was also informed that additional lists of selected men would be supplied. It is interesting to know that those additional lists have not been supplied because of the exposure of the whole scheme by Senator Dunn in another place. I feci that I have made out a prima facie case for an inquiry into the methods employed for the expenditure of the grant for the relief of unemployment in New South Wales. Seeing that this is public money, it is not right that any one should be able to guarantee a job to any particular man. Most honourable members were under the impression that there would be an equal opportunity for all men to register for employment, and that the work would be allocated in the ordinary way. I , therefore, suggest to the Government that a select committee be appointed of honourable members of both Houses of the Parliament. Five honourable members of this chamber could bo elected by ballot in the House, and the Senate could be asked by message to appoint three members. Such a committee could make a thorough inquiry into this whole matter. If the Government will adopt that course it will not be sary for us to proceed with the discussion of this motion. Only in this way can the Government satisfy the general community, its own supporters, and honourable members generally, that this business has not been improperly handled. This money was voted by Parliament for the purpose of affording some relief at Christmas time to men who are in dire straits, and men should have been given work without inquiry as to their political beliefs or their willingness to serve a ticular party during an election campaign which may be only a short time ahead. The facts which I have outlined justify the making of an investigation. Only by a thorough examination of the Sir. lictislci/. whole situation shall we be able to ascertain who has been responsible for what has happened. If honourable members were to go through the Dalley electorate today - they would find it seething with discontent in all directions. Naturally, when a man finds that other men can get a job and he cannot, he asks how the other fellows are able to get work. A. man who came to my home last night told me of a man he knew and whose name I have, who was actually sent for to begin work at the Cockatoo Island Dockyard, although he is on compensation for an injury to his thumb inflicted while working at Mort's Dock where he has been employed for five months. Other honourable members of the group to which I belong can give the names of persons who have been specially selected for work by canvassers who have gone right tlirough the districts named. It is to be regretted that such troubles should have arisen at a time when we should all be straining every nerve and putting forth every effort to relieve distress. It is also to be regretted that this should have happened in the electorate which the Treasurer represents. I assure the Prime Minister and the Government that the evidence that we have collected in the Dalley electorate is such that the appointment of a select committee to inquire into the position, is thoroughly justified.",18
46,Mr THEODORE,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"Dalley-Treasurer ) [3.50] - The speech of the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) must have disappointed his colleagues in neces- the corner party. He had allowed the impression to get abroad that he intended to launch a serious attack on the Government, and that Ministers would be assailed on uiia:iiswer«b!e""cbarges. Yet for twenty minutes we have listened to sheer puerilities. The honourable member stated that his allegations would be supported by evidence, but what sort of evidence has he produced? I propose to answer, categorically, the innuendoes and charges relating to myself, against whom this par- attack appears to be mainly directed. First, the honourable member stated that in connection with the employment to be given under this Parliament's grant for relief works, an organization was established in Dalley, under my authority, to collect the names of persons desiring work at Cockatoo Island, apparently some kind of promise by me that the persons whose names were so collected would got preference. I deny that any such authority was given by me, or that such an organization as is alleged .set up in Dalley under my authority with my cognizance. Secondly, the honourable member stated that canvassers in his own electorate, well as in Dalley, were instructed, at request, to collect the names of 200 appliby cants for work. I deuy that. No such request was made by me; if any person - collected names and said that he my authority or instruction to do so, was stating a falsehood. Thirdly, the honourable member stated that at the meeting of the Annandale branch of the Australian Labour Party which I addressed a week ago, some son asked me a question regarding ployment at Cockatoo Island, and that I replied that the matter was in the of Mr MACPherson, and that I would guarantee to get work for auy persons whose names were collected by him. deny that any such question was asked, or that any such answer was given by ine. That denial is not given lightly, because there are at least 100 persons who could testify regarding what took place at that meeting. Fourthly, the honourable member said that I sent for the manager of the Cockatoo Island Dockyard to instruct him to the method of selecting men for I deny that also. It is true that I had a consultation with the manager of the dockyard; that I shall explain later. So soon as it became known that the Commonwealth Parliament had granted a sum of money for the provision of relief work, I , in common with other federal members representing New Wales, received many applications employment.",19
47,Mr BRENNAN,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,That did not only in New South Wales.,20
48,Mr THEODORE,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"No doubt memto bers representing constituencies in had been filled. other States had a similar experience. When the application indicated that the applicant was a former ember. ployee of Cockatoo Island, it was sent on to the management of the where that was not indicated, the appliwith cation was sent on to Mr Todd, Commonwealth Works Director in New South Wales. All applications were forwarded for registration and'consideration in the usual way. Probably two or three hunwas dred applications passed through the or hands of myself or my secretary, I did not ask for preference for any applicant, nor suggest that others who had a superior as claim should be overlooked in favour of my those whose names had been forwarded me. In Balmain, Rozelle, aud Leichhardt there was a general desire on the part of the hundreds of unemployed to had have their names registered, and he naturally they wrote to their member. Some of the letters I received contained lists of names, the writers apparently having gone to the trouble of collecting the names of others of their acquaintance who perdesired to be registered. I sent those emnames on to the appropriate quarter in the same way 'as the honourable members bauds for West Sydney (Mr Beasley), East Sydney (MT . Ward), and Werriwa (Mr. Lazzarini) did. The numbers are not I known to me, but probably as many electors of West Sydney as of Dalley are employed on this relief work; probably also the list of applicants forwarded by the honourable' member for West Sydney was larger than the list I submitted. I do not know bow ninny names were on my list.",20
49,Mr THOMPSON,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,Why did not the as Treasurer (Mr Theodore) apply that work. procedure to all honourable members?,20
50,Mr THEODORE,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"I applied no procedure; I merely forwarded to the appropriate quarters those applications which were addressed to me, and that was the common-sense course for any member to adopt. I am certain that if persons applied to the honourable member for New South England (Mr Thompson) for employfor ment under the Commonwealth, he would forward their names to the department happen concerned. That is all I did.",20
51,Mr MARR,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,We did not get a chance forward names until all the positions,20
52,Mr THEODORE,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,I had no greater chance than any other honourable mem,20
53,Mr MARR,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,The Treasurer filled all dockyard; the positions first.,20
54,Mr THEODORE,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"I did not. Speaking from memory, of the applications from Dalley that passed through my hands, not more than 120 were forwarded to Cockatoo Island. Probably the registrations at the dockyard numbered between 3,000 and 4,000; the number of men to be employed was about 400, and the state-, ment that I attempted to rush my constituents into these positions is without a tittle of justification. It is only part of the slanderous campaign that has been undertaken to discredit ir.e. The honourable member for West Sydney speaks of evidence! What evidence has he produced which would anybody but a school boy?",21
55,Mr GULLETT,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,He stated that he had several sworn statements.,21
56,Mr THEODORE,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"If the honourable member has definite particulars, why does he not disclose them, instead of merely making foolish insinuations to advance a vague and indefinite case? I received yesterday this letter referring to employment at Cockatoo Island- . I notice in The World of today's date that Mr Beasley is going to move a motion re £250,000 being used for political purposes. I wish to inform you that while sitting in the union room of the Federated Iron workers (Balmain branch), the secretary of the branch, Mr Stacey, while telling the members who came whether they were among those chosen for work at Cockatoo Island, made the following statement:-""That he had had to stop Mr Beasley and Mr Dunn from sending men over to the island with letters to register their names who had never worked on the island; one of these was Mr Dunn's brotherin-law."" A man who complains in this Parliament of other members sending forward names for registration has been trying to work into a job at Cockatoo Island his brother-in-laAv, who had never previously been employed there. The chief cause of the chagrin that, is evident in the Corner party is that its members have not been able to work their own political stunts at Cockatoo Island and elsewhere. I admit that the irregularities of the Lang Administration would not justify similar misconduct by the Eederal Administration, but the fact is well known that the Lang Government has used its political power to exercise patronage of the worse and most tyrannous kind. It is common knowledge throughout New South Wales that railway and tramway employees dare not, for fear of losing their jobs, open their mouths against the so-called Lang plan or the State Government, or support the Australian Labour Party. There is ample evidence that a miserable, mean tyranny is practised by the State Government against the workers in New South Wales. These have been sacked and victimized by the Langites, yet members of that party in this Parliament have the hardihood to criticize the Commonwealth Labour Government for what is alleged to be unfair discrimination in the giving of employment. If this Comimpress monwealth Government were guilty of one-tenth of the malpractices of the Lang Government, it would deserve to be censured, but no evidence of wrongdoing has been adduced. I have nothing to apologize for in connection with the distribution of work under the relief grant. The honourable member for West Sydney stated that I had sent for the manager of the Cockatoo Island Dockyard, and instructed him how he should engage men. I have already denied that. In the absence of the Minister for Defence (Mr Chifley), I communicated with the manager of Cockatoo Island Dockyard in connection with the grant of £5,000 by the Treasury for expenditure there. He produced a list of works which he intended to carry out, which, after discussion, I approved. We discussed nothing further, and he received no instruction from me in regard to the men he should employ, or the manner of preparing the employment register. If any persons in West Sydney or Dalley promised to get work at Cockatoo Island, they were not acting with my authority or knowledge. I can say no more.",21
57,Mr WARD,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"(East Sydney) [4.1] The Treasurer stated that not a tittle of evidence has been adduced in support of the charges against him . .We know from his past career that a lot of evidence is required to convict him of wrongdoing. A government could not be guilty of anything more contemptible than to exploit the unfortunate unemployed to gain a political advantage. The Treasurer sought to excuse himself by alleging political patronage by a State Government; that has nothing to do with the matter now before the House. I charge the Treasurer with having deliberately misled the members of this House in regard to the manner in which workers needing relief were to be engaged, in order that he and others might be able to put their own particular cronies into jobs at Cockatoo Island. On the 29th October, when the relief grant of £250,000 was being discussed, I asked the honourable gentleman, amongst other tilings, what method would be adopted for the engagement of relief labour, and whether the employment that was to be given would be distributed through the State Labour Exchanges. The Treasurer replied- "" I answer that question; the details have not yet been settled."" Yet on the 30th October instructions were issued to the Commonwealth Works Department by the Government, notwithstanding that the Treasurer had stated on the previous day that the details had not then been settled. Not only did strange things occur in the Dalley electorate in connection with registration for employment, but a member of this House went so far as to break the defence regulations in order to make a political attack on the Premier of New South Wales and exploit the unemployed. The Treasurer has asked for specific evidence; I have here one of the original notices posted at Liverpool CampTO ALL THOSE WHO ARE UNEMPLOYED. Mr A. K Rowe. M.H.R., Federal member for this electorate, will visit Liverpool on Tuesday, the 10th November, 1931, and wishes to obtain a list of names of men seeking employment: he would be glad to interview, personally, those who wish to be placed on his list, at the Works Office, Liverpool, at 9 a.m. on the above date. RICMEMUKR -! ) o'clock next Tuesday morning, at the Works Office, just inside the main entrance to Liverpool Camp. 1'. G. WHITESIDE, K.A.E., Certain Government supporters even made use of the military department in order to have the men mustered. The meeting was duly held inside the gates of Liverpool Camp, on military property, and a political address was delivered, in which not only the Premier of New South Wales, but also the members of the Beasley group, were castigated. During the meeting some of the unemployed objected to the procedure that was being adopted in distributing labour, and the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr. Rowe) replied, "" If you do not want work, go to the State Labour Exchange; if you do want work, enrol now"". Even then, the men who were enrolled were not given work in the order in which their names were taken. Discrimination was exercised against certain men. because their political views were known; because they were not supporters of the Premiers' plan and of the present Commonwealth Ministry. No known Lang supporters were given work. Evidence to that effect can cannot be obtained in hundreds of instances. It is perfectly true, as the Treasurer has said, with his usual adeptness in confusing the facts, that we supplied lists of men; but what we complain of is that the supporters of the Goverument had previous knowledge, and were able to supply their lists a week before we did. We were not informed that names were being taken by the Commonwealth Works Department, and we would never have known that fact had we not ascertained it by accident. We certainly submitted lists when we found that other honourable members had already done so. One member of the Permanent Military Forces at Liverpool Camp attempted to get into touch with the Minister for Defence (Mr Chifley) to protest against the breaking of the military regulations, and to suggest that the arrangements be cancelled with a view to engaging labour through the local bureau. He could not get into touch with Mr Chifley, so he made representations to Senator Dooley, who refused to take any action. It is also true that members of the Federal Government have received letters from men in the East Sydney electorate seeking employment. These men wrote to the Government supWorks Officer, Liverpool. porters. Knowing the type of Government with which they had to deal, they were of the opinion that if they submitted their names through the member for East Sydney no work would be given them. These things certainly warrant an inquiry. Discrimination has been shown against certain men. One member of the East Sydney electorate was fortunate enough to receive a notice to commence work, but no opportunity was given bim to commence work. The following is his declaration:STATUTOR V DECLARATION . 1, James Frederick Baird, of 35 Waterloostreet, Sydney, in the State of New South Wales, solemnly and sincerely declare that 1 was engaged hy a Mr Todd, of the Public SVorks Department (Commonwealthj. at Customs House, Circular Quay, for the purpose of relief work, painting the Balmain telephone exchange. I reported for work on Monday, litth November, at 7.30 a.m. When I arrived ou the job at Balmain, which cost me tram in res, I was informed by a Mr Gardiner that he had received instructions not to start me. Other men were treated the same way, and I make this solemn declaration conscientiously believing the same to be true and by .irtue of the provisions of the Oaths Act 1900. Subscribed and declared ut Sydney this 24th day of November, one thousand nine hundred and thiitv-one before me, Justice of the Peace, Paddington. One of the suggested reasons why that man was not allowed to start work is that his brother is one of the Lang party candidates nt the municipal elections at Paddington. The Treasurer has brushed lightly aside the charges made against him. It takes quite a lot of evidence to convict him.",21
58,Mr WHITE,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,Who gave Mahony a job at Cockatoo Island?,23
59,Mr WARD,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,The honourable member is in a better position than I am to answer that question. The Treasurer (Mr Theodore) has made certain attacks outside of this House ngainst the Beasley group. I remember an occasion when he demanded the right to defend himself against certain charges. he wanted was the opportunity to be sworn and to be cross-examined on oath. But when he was given the opportunity he did not take advantage of it . He was too cowardly to subject himself to cross-examination. The facts that have been submitted to the House warrant an inquiry being made. I have much pleasure in seconding the motion of o the honourable member for West Sydney.,23
60,Mr GIBBONS,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"Calare) There seems to be some disturbance in connection with the appointment to positions of certain persons in Sydney. A certain organization is in operation there, and its plans have been interfered with by the officers of the Commonwealth Works Department, who are only doing their duty. I wish to give an illustration of the methods adopted by the members of the Lang party in respect of appoiutments to prominent positions. Take, for instance, the Graves family, which is closely connected with the Lang group.",23
61,Mr ELDRIIXIE,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"On a point of order. I submit that the remarks of the honourable member for Calare are distinctly out of order, since they have no bearing on the subject before the Chair.",23
62,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,The honourable member for Calare (Mr Gibbons) has not proceeded far enough to enable mc to .IAMBS FKEDKUICK BAIUU. determine whether his remarks are actually out of order.,23
63,Mr GIBBONS,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"Mr Graves, who is W. l i . R. BATES, secretary of the Lang group, receives £10 a week. Miss Graves, his sister, receives £5 a week as dole inspector. Miss Graves, his daughter, is employed in Mr Graves'"" office, at £4 a week. Another daughter, who is employed in the Child Endowment Department, receives £5 a week. Another daughter receives £3 10s. a week.",23
64,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"I draw the attention of the honourable member to the fact that the motion before the Chair involves the adjournment of the House and relates to the methods adopted by the Government in the selection of men to be employed in connection with the recent federal grant for the relief of unemployed. The honourable member must confine his remarks to matters that are relevant to the motion. All that Mr GIBBONS - I was pointing out that a section of people in Sydney have been making political appointments, and that their actions have , been interfered with by the officers of the Commonwealth Works Department, who have adopted a rational and proper system of allocating employment. I am showing that one family alone, because of political appointments, is receiving £27 1.0s. a week. Then in connection with another family",23
65,Mr ELDBIDGE,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"On a point of order, [4.10] - I submit that the honourable member for Calare is introducing into the discussion matter which is quite foreign to the motion before the Chair.",23
66,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"I cannot permit the honourable member for Calare to proceed further on those lines, and I ask him to confine, his remarks to the motion before the Chair.",23
67,Mr GIBBONS,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"I am justifying the system which was adopted by the officers of the Commonwealth Works Department. This work has now been distributed among a larger number of families. I. now wish to refer to the family of Jock Garden. Mr SPEAKER,-The honourable member must not try the patience of the Chair too far. I have given him reasonable latitude, but so far he has uot, to my satisfaction, connected his remarks with the subject before the Chair.",24
68,Mr GIBBONS,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"The statement that Government supporters were given a privilege as against other members of this House is absolutely untrue. As soon as [ knew that a certain sum of money was available for unemployment relief, I endeavoured to have as much of it as possible expended in my electorate. Other lionorable members have taken similar action. The statement that members of the Cabinet and other Government supporters have received an advantage through being able to place certain of their electors in positions, is absolutely untrue, and cannot be substantiated by evidence.",24
69,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"The honourable member has been in the House sufficiently long to know that his expression that a certain statement is untrue, is unparliamentary.",24
70,Mr GIBBONS,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"I withdraw it, and say that the statement cannot be substantiated by facts. There is no evidence that the officers of the Commonwealth Works Department have given consideration to the political opinions of persons applying for employment, and it is altogether wrong to allege that they were in any way influenced by political representations. This charge, summed up, is simply a charge against responsible officers of the department.",24
71,Mr THOMPSON,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"New England) | 4.19] - I take this opportunity to protest on behalf of the electorate which I represent ngainst the methods adopted by the Government in distributing the grant for unemployment relief. This grant was agreed to by the House entirely on non-party lines. The measure was introduced at the closing stages of the recent sitting of the House, when there was a small attendance of honourable members, and I was one of those who, at that time, pointed out to the Government that grave difficulties would arise if the members of the Opposition Ave re not consulted by the Government as to the fairest way of apportioning this money. The Treasurer's statement that any suggestion made by members of the Opposition would be considered by the Government is on record in Hansard. But no sooner had the House adjourned than it Avas announced that the scheme had been finalized; the money was actually allotted a few days after the House rose. I regard the GoA'crnmeut's action as a gravo breach of faith.",24
72,Mr THEODORE,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,In what Avay?,24
73,Mr THOMPSON,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"The Treasurer gave an undertaking that any suggestions made by Opposition members would be considered; but, apparently, that Avas never intended, for suggestions were never invited. The scheme Avas announced a few days after the House rose.",24
74,Mr THEODORE,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,The scheme A\as drawn up by departmental officers.,24
75,Mr THOMPSON,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,Then why did the Treasurer say that the Avay was open for honourable members to make suggestions?  orable gentleman make any suggestions?,24
76,Mr THOMPSON,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"Before Parliament adjourned, I said that, in my opinion, the right: procedure was to employ as many men as possible, rather than that £4' a week should be paid to only 14,000 or 15,000 men. When I pointed out the difficulties which I considered would arise in applying the Government's scheme, the Treasurer interjected that the Government Would not necessarily follow that scheme. He said that be had not attempted to give any details of the scheme which Would be adopted. Yet a few days later the Sydney Morning Herald showed IIOAV the money allotted to New South Wales had been allocated. I am pleased that honourable members opposite have been able to throvr some light on this subject; their statements shoAv that members sitting in opposition have not been given a fair deal. Apparently, GoA-ernment supporters, especially those representing industrial electorates, Avere invited, either by the Government or by the authorities in charge of the scheme, to submit lists of unemployed men in their electorates. I received no invitation to supply such a list in respect of the New England electorate, in which there are probably 12,000 men out of work. Eor their relief the sum of £750 has been allocated! That money is to be spent in painting one post officework which has been approved for many years. I do not object to that work being done.  torates represented by members on this side have not been allocated even £750.",24
77,Mr THOMPSON,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"I object to the method of allocation. The evidence placed before the House by the honourable member for ""West Sydney (Mr Beasley) shows that some members were invited to submit a certain number of names of unemployed men in their districts.",25
78,Mr LEWIS,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,We were not imvited to do anything of the kind.,25
79,Mr THOMPSON,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"Apparentl y the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr. Rowe) was invited to submit 200 names. I am not objecting to that; if the honourable gentleman can secure work for 200 men in his district, well and good. But I was under the impression that this grant would be allocated on a non-party basis. The Government invited all sections of Parliament to agree to the making of the grant, and it was reasonable to suppose that the money would be distributed fairly among all the electorates throughout Australia - So far as I can gather,, country electorates will receive very little of the money. I have been bombarded with letters from all the local governing authorities in my electorate, and also from unemployed associations, inquiring whether the Government would distribute any money in their district. I realise that £250,000 will not go far in relieving the existing unemployment throughout Australia. On the basis of distribution in the case of the New England electorate, it would appear that only about £21,000 of the £90,000 which has been set aside for New South Wales has been accounted for. Apparently, 75 per cent, of the grant will be spent in metropolitan electorates; I do not blame the Government for attempting to find work for the unemployed in the metropolitan electorates; but I submit that the unemployed in my electorate are as much entitled to consideration as are unemployed men elsewhere. On their behalf I protest against the methods adopted by the Government in allocating this money. Because it did not adopt the suggestion that the local governing bodies should be allowed to distribute this money, the Government has got itself into difficulties. Although the honourable member for West Sydney revealed nothing of a scandalous nature, he made out a good case against the Government. If the anomalies mentioned by him are found to exist, the Government is deserving of censure. I strongly support the suggestion that a non-party committee be appointed to investigate this matter. I repeat my protest against the unequal distribution of this money.",25
80,Mr SCULLIN,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"Yarra-Prime Minister) [4.26] - The honourable member for New England (Mr Thompson) is labouring under a misapprehension. There was no suggestion that members were to participate in a conference, with a view to deciding how the money should be allocated, although they were invited to make suggestions. The honourable member said that he had made a suggestion; but he did not indicate its nature. I have a recollection that he proposed that more men should be employed than could be given work at £4 a week. The Government did not accept his suggestion to lower the daily rate of pay. It was never suggested that £250,000 would be sufficient to - relieve unemployment throughout Australia. That sum was set aside to inaugurate a prosperity compaign in which employers generally were invited to assist. When the campaign was launched, the Leader of the Opposition in this chamber, as well as the Leader of the Opposition in another place, co-operated with the Government in making a broadcast appeal to citizens generally to employ more men. I am pleased to say that there has been a wonderful response to that appeal by every section of the community. All that the Government did was to set an example to other employers. Nor was it intended that the money should be equally distributed among the electorates. The Government had properties in various localities which were depreciating through lack of attention, and it decided to spend this money on renovating them. Other employers were asked to follow its example. The Government guarded against the possibility of duplication, by providing that the State labour bureaux should be given lists of the men who received assistance under the federal scheme. Some honourable members do not seem to realise that the Commonwealth has in every State an organization capable of dealing with this work. With the exception of Tasmania, each State has its Commonwealth works director. Moreover, the registration of applicants for employment has not necessitated any additional appointments to the staff of the departments. In order to show that in the allocation of the money there has been no discrimination against honourable members who support the Lang plan, I point out that, whereas an equal division of the money among the electorates would have given each district about £2,000, the East Sydney electorate has been granted £11,000a greater sum than has been allocated to any other district. The honourable member for New England (Mr Thompson) complained that only £750 was to be spent in his electorate. The district of Barton is to receive no money at all, while only £170 is to be spent in the Calare district, and £800 in the district represented, by  Moloney).",25
81,Mr JAMES,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,What amount has been allocated to the Dalley electorate?,26
82,Mr SCULLIN,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,Onl y £600.,26
83,Mr JAMES,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"Not £600, but £5,600.",26
84,Mr SCULLIN,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"Eve n if the £5,000 set apart for Cockatoo Island Dockyard were included in the grant for Dalley, the amount would still be only £5,600, as against £11,000 for the East Sydney electorate. Mention has been made of the sum set aside for Cockatoo Island. The dockyard is controlled by a board set up by a previous administration. Section 11 of the act which constituted the board provides that the board may appoint such officers and servants as it thinks necessary for effectively conducting its business. The board was made absolutely independent of interference by any member of Parliament, or any Minister. I assume that the board is carrying out its instructions, and is doing its duty, since no evidence has been adduced to the contrary. The Minister for Defence (Mr Chifley), in his control of Cockatoo Island, acts on behalf of the Prime Minister. On the 5th of November, the Minister for Defence wrote to Mr J. Payne, chairman of the Australian Commonwealth Shipping B o a r d , in the following t e r m s : I desire to inform you that the sum of £5,000 is being allocated by the Treasury to your board for the purpose of providing work at Cockatoo Island Dockyard for ex-employees of the dockyard. The Government wishes it to be clearly understood that no portion of the £,5000 referred to is to be expended in providing additional work for those already employed at the dockyard, but it is to be spread as far as possible over ex-employees who are now out of employment, with a minimum of two weeks' work. The Government also desires that no distinction of any kind be made which would grant preference in employment, as the money is intended to provide some relief for Christmas to the general body of ex-employees. Yours faithfully, J. B. CHIFLEY. P.S - It is desirable that the work in question be put in hand and paid for before the Christmas holidays. Those were the Government's instructions. If any honourable member can give me an instance in which those instructions have been departed from, I , personally, undertake to have the matter investigated. But I will not agree to .the setting up of any royal commission or special committee of inquiry.",26
85,Mr JAMES,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,Then we will have an election.,26
86,Mr SCULLIN,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,Le t us have it. If honourable members want to go on with the motion,26
87,Mr JAMES,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,We are going on with it.,26
88,Mr SCULLIN,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"If honourable members wish to take the business of the House out of the hands of the Government, they can have an election. But I suggest that they have chosen a poor issue on which to appeal to the electors. The hunger of some persons for office would cause them to make anything an issue. This Government has said a score of times that when it loses control of Parliament, it will not attempt to carry on. It has not yet lost control. The honourable member for West Sydney made the statement that the officials at the Engineers Branch of the Postal Department had advised applicants for employment to anply to their local members.",26
89,Mr BEASLEY,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"I said that the ofncials of the Postal Department in Castlereagh Street had informed applicants that they could not register there, but should go to their members.",27
90,Mr SCULLIN,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"In reply to an interjection from the right honourable member for North Sydney the lionorable member reiterated that instructions had been given to that effect. I had a telephone message sent to the Deputy Director of Posts and Telegraphs at Sydney, asking him to check the accuracy of the statement by the honourable member, and Mr. Kitto has telephoned stating that he has spoken to the Assistant Superintendent Engineer, who says that there is absolutely no foundation for any such statement. He said that the names were simply recorded, ancl that no advice to see or to apply to their local members was given to the men by any official. Three thousand men called to register, and three officials were detailed to record their names ancl addresses. The lists that were forwarded by members of Parliament to the postal authorities were accompanied with the request that the names should be added to the departmental list. No endeavour was made by any member to seek preferential treatment for those named in such lists. That is a complete answer to that particular charge. I have obtained a report as to the allocation of this money in the various electorates, and it discloses that able sums have been made available in some electorates, while smaller amounts have been allotted to others. Everything depended upon the work that the departments had to make available, ancl the money was distributed irrespective of electorates, without bias, ancl free from political influence. I am the Minister in charge of the administration of Cockatoo Island Dockyard, and I delegated to the Minister for Defence authority to deal with this matter. Instructions were issued which had the approval of the Minister and of myself. If there is any charge of dereliction of duty, I am prepared to have the matter investigated by the permanent head of my department, on whom suspicion has never been cast. All I atsk is that specific instances of improper behaviour shall be given. T am not prepared to allow the Government to be subjected to the humiliation that would be associated with the appointment of a royal commission or a special commission to inquire into any unsubstantiated accusation made against a Minister. As Prime Minister of Australia, I say that the last thing that this Govern-' ment would dream of doing would be to take advantage of the unfortunate position of our unemployed by exploiting tbcin for political purposes.",27
91,Mr LYONS,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"Wilmot) [4.38] - I am afraid that the discussion that has taken place this afternoon will not be very edifying to the large number of electors who have conic here to listen to it, or to the larger number throughout Australia who are awaiting the result. Having listened to the case that was advanced by the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr. Beasley), and to the replies that were given by the Prime Minister (Mr. Scullin). the Treasurer (Mr Theodore), and another honourable member on the Government side, I believe. that a case has been made out which shows that, to sny the least, this business has been badly managed. The endeavour of the Government to assist in the relief of the unemployed, ancl to encourage private employers to increase employment during the Christmas season, is most commendable, but, unfortunately, Ministers have adopted wrong methods in milking this money available, and consider that has resulted in some honourable members being placed in a. more favourable position than others. It has been made clear by the honourable member for West Sydney that certain honourable members, through receiving early advice as to the intention of the Government, had already submitted lists of names before the proposals of the Government were known to the public, or to other honourable members. Mr C. RILEY - I give that an emphatic denial.",27
92,Mr LYONS,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"The honourable member for West Sydney gave it as a fact that between the 30th October, when he sought information from the Government, and the 5th November, when Senator Dooley made a statement oil the subject, lists of names of men seeking employment were lodged with the authorities, ancl the honourable member claims that the existence of those lists resulted in the principal lists being closed very quickly.",27
93,Mr SCULLIN,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,Coul d not that have taken place as a result of the announcement that was made by the Treasurer to the effect that this money was available to relieve unemployment?,28
94,Mr LYONS,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"If the right course had been followed, none of this trouble would have arisen. Because of the ill-considered action of the Government, there has been a conflict of opinion between honourable members, aud an endeavour on the part of some to obtain a political advantage over others. That is not an edifying spectacle. It has had the effect of making distinctions even among the unfortunate unemployed themselves, who are now ranged into two camps, each fighting for jobs through a particular political faction.",28
95,Mr THEODORE,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,Her e is a new apoloThere gist for Mr Lang.,28
96,Mr LYONS,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"I shall never be an apologist for Mr Lang, nor for his lowers in this House. The only defence that was made by the honourable member for Calare was that Mr Lang did worse things than this. Half of the defence the Treasurer was an endeavour to draw attention to the awful things that Mr. Lang is doing in New South Wales. I is no satisfaction to us or the people Australia to be told that the Government has done this because Mr Lang has worse. I regret that tlic Prime Minister, who has dealt with the matter very reasonably, and has advanced the only for Defence) [4.46] - The adequate defence that has so far submitted, is not prepared to have the whole matter properly investigated. Mr SCULT.IN - I did say that I would have the matter investigated.",28
97,Mr LYONS,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"Yes , by departmental officers. I point out that this £250,000 does not come from the Government, from this Parliament.",28
98,Mr BEASLEY,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,It comes from the people.,28
99,Mr LYONS,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"It will not come from the people for a long time. It comes from the banks that have been subjected to so much condemnation of late. £250,000 that the banks have made availset aside for the purpose. able is to be used to enable political capital to be made of the position by party or another. Had the Government made the money available through existing State organizations, or through its own organizations in the various cities and towns of the Commouwealth, all this trouble would have been obviated. Without bothering about bringing into the matter politicians, the workers could have been informed through the columns of the daily press, wliere to go to register. That would have shown a genuine endeavour to give the desired relief to our unemployed.",28
100,Mr JOJTES,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,Has not that course been followed ?,28
101,Mr LYONS,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"It has not. Had that been done, politicians would not have been drawn in, and the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Rowe) would not have called the meeting at Liverpool at which he announced that those seeking employment must make application through him. has been a definite attempt to make political capital out of the expenditure of this money. The Prime Minister has been folcourageous. I assure him and other honourable members opposite that his threat about going to the country will not deter honourable members on this side from folof lowing the course that they deem to be the right one. The Prime Minister could not offer a better reason to honourable t members on this side for supporting the of proposal of the honourable member for West Sydney, than to threaten that an done election will follow that action.",28
102,Mr CHIFLEY,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"Macquarie-Minister honourable been member for East Sydney (Mr Ward) made reference to the action of an officer of the Defence Department, and alleged that somebody had endeavoured to get in touch with me. I assure the honourable member that it is not difficult to get into touch with; me. The circumstances mentioned have not come to my knowledge; or that statement. I can substantiate. The Prime Minister delegated to me the apportionment of the money that is to be expended on work at Cockatoo Island Dockyard. The dockyard officers submitted to me a list of the work that needed attention, and, at my This suggestion, a substantial sum was The proposal was first put to me by one the representatives of the workers at the dock, who asked that some money should be made available specifically to provide work for ex-employees of the dockyard, of whom there was a great number. They made it perfectly clear that they did not desire the work for men already employed at the dockyard, although they were heavily rationed. Senator Dunn also waited upon me and made a special, request that a sum of money should be made available for the employment of dockyard ex-employees. After the £5,000 was allotted for work at Cockatoo Island Dockyard I made a request that the Shipping Board should supervise its expenditure, as I considered that that board is familiar with the work that is required to be done, ancl is most competent to engage the labour required. I suggested that the board, rather than the Works Department, should supervise the expenditure of the money, believing that it could apportion the money economically and to the best advantage. I did not discuss the matter with the Treasurer (Mr Theodore). I did ask the management of Cockatoo Island Dockyard to furnish me with a report on the work that was to be carried out. The Prime Minister has read the instruction that I issued to the management of the dockyard, and he also made it clear to the House that the Shipping Board has complete control of these activities. Admittedly, board is subject to removal by the Government, with a certain proviso as to notice. Not one complaint has been received by me, either from the representatives of the employees at Cockatoo Island Dockyard, or from any honourable member, to the effect that the money was being unfairly apportioned. It is extraordinary that on every other occasion when representations have been made to me in respect to Cockatoo Island Dockyard, Senator Dunn has participated in them, while on this occasion not a word was said to either myself or the Prime Minister (Mr Scullin) about the matter by him or any member of his group. The first we knew of any alleged dissatisfaction was from newspaper reports of a discussion in another place. Even now, it has not been suggested that the shipping board, which has the entire responsibility for the spending of the money, has misused any of it. Mr Chifley. In the first place, I consulted the dockyard management in regard to the expenditure of this money, and indicated verbally that a fortnight's work should be given to men who had previously been employed at the dockyard, but were uow out of work; that the money should be made to go as far as possible; that there should be no preference; and that as little as possible should be spent on materials. These directions were afterwards confirmed in the letter which the Prime Minister read. In order to ensure that the minimum amount of money should be spent upon materials, I arranged with the Defence Department to make certain tools available to the dockyard. It has been said that lists of persons to whom employment should be given have been furnished by various members. I have a big industrial centre in my electorate, at Lithgow, but I did not send in a single name, although certain other honourable members, including Nationalists, sent in names of persons to whom work should be given both at Cockatoo Island and on jobs being done under the Works Department. There has not been the slightest ministerial interference in the expenditure of this money, nor has there been any misuse of it, and not a single member of the Ministry has even that been accused of having used his influence to secure preference for any particular person.",28
103,Mr ELDIMBGE,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,Surely the Minister realizes that our chief complaint is that it is very unfair that supporters of the Government should have been able to furnish advance lists secretly.,29
104,Mr CHIFLEY,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"No secret lists have been furnished. On various occasions, when grants have been made for unemployment relief, honourable members have made representations to the Government with the object of securing employment for deserving cases. I have had a number of requests and letters of that nature; but in every instance I have forwarded them to the management of the dockyard without making any recommendation. The members of the Beasley group have made requests of this kind. I challenge any honourable member to prove that auy Minister associated with the control of the dockyard has endeavoured to have a single penny spent in the giving preferences to any particular class person. No undue preference has been given. There is no suggestion that the patient. management has been af fault in any way, for the instructions which I have given on behalf of the Prime Minister been faithfully carried out.",29
105,Dr EARLE PAGE,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"Cowper) [4.55] I have listened very carefully to the three speeches made by Ministers within the to the public. last hour and a half in defence of their action in-expending the money voted a few weeks ago for the relief of unemploymember ment; but, so far, no effective answer remark. has been made to the charges of the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr. Beasley). A certain amount of sob-stu/f has been served up by the Prime Minister (Mr Scullin) to the effect that the vernment intended to set an example private employers of labour. But an example it has been! Ministers questionably had a flying start in regard to the expenditure of this money, and there has undoubtedly been a discriminacountry. tion on account of their political views in giving employment between the destitute persons of this community, who have been used for political purposes. I consider that there should be a proper inquiry into these charges, for that is the only way in which they can be properly answered. The GovernTreasurer ment has seen fit to refuse the request for such an inquiry, and I am therefore compelled to vote in favour of the motion for adjournment. I shall do this also because the Government has repeatedly said in this House and elsewhere that it has a majority of its own, that it has never been defeated on the floor of the House, and that it determines the policy of the country. If this is so, let Government prove it this afternoon. shall vote in favour of the motion cause I desire to test the bona fides the Lang faction in this House, to see whether it will stand by its declared tude towards the Federal Labour party. This faction has frequently quarrelled with, and criticized the Theodorecaused Scullin faction, although I have been able to find any fundamental difference between the policies the two parties. The Lang policy, if persisted in, must, inevitably bring of of New South Wales and Australia to. or ruin. This policy must have the same effect as a meal of broken glass to a",30
106,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,The right honourable member must realise that his remarks are have - rather wide of the subject.,30
107,Dr EARLE PAGE,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"All I wish to s.ty about the other policy, Mr Speaker, is that it would be like a dose of poison Mr SPEAKER,-The right honourable is not in order in making that",30
108,Dr EARLE PAGE,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"The discussion this afternoon has degenerated into one of the most squalid domestic party disputes that I have ever known to occur in GoParliament. The Treasurer is accused to of having used public money voted what for the relief of unemployment for unelectioneering purposes in his own and adjoining electorates, and of having made political pawns of the destitute of this No one should be really surprised at this charge, for it will be remembered that immediately after the last election the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) made a plea for the starving children of the miners in his constituency, and said that £1,000 had been obtained from the .miners by the present for electioneering purposes on the understanding that the mines would be immediately opened. What one does marvel at is that the present exposure should have been made by those who were accessories after the fact to a similar happening. The Government has done other similar things. In December, 1929, it filched £1,000,000 of the federal aid road surplus funds ostensibly for the relief the of unemployment throughout Australia. 1 This was not new money, but money that bewas actually being used to carry out of definitely planned work, and its withdrawal turned a certain number of men attiout of work. Later, another £600,000 a year was taken in the same way from the federal aid roads grant, and this also a large number of men to lose their not employment. The £250,000 now under discussion was voted ostensibly for of the purpose of relieving unemployment, but it was really taken out the funds available for the carrying out of works maintenance. As a matter of fact, in every country district in Australia two-weekly and monthly mail services, some of which have been in operation for upwards of 70 years, have been discontinued, ancl the persons who provided them have been thrown out of work in order to make this money available for electioneering purposes in certain Sydney electorates. For these reasons I shall vote for the motion.",30
109,Mr JAMES,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"Hunter) [5.0] - I wish briefly to state my reasons for supporting the motion of the honourable member for We3t Sydney - (Mr Beasley). I have made requests to the Prime Minister for the.expenditure of a certain amount of this money in the Hunter electorate, ancl against the method adopted for selecting labour, but have not been able to obtain any satisfaction from him. It appears now that the right honourable gentleman has burnt his bridges behind him, and that we are headed for an election. A great deal of the dissatisfaction that has occurred over the expenditure of this money has arisen from the failure of the Government to use the enrolment machinery of the States. If it had informed those who desired relief work that employment would be allotted according to the registers at the State labour bureaux, persons who had been unemployed the longest would have obtained the work; but the departmental officers were instructed by the Ministry that State facilities were to be used. This has caused a number of jobs to be declared ""black"". I have in mind two jobs in my own electorate upon which men will not work because certain persons employed on them were taken on although they had just left State relief jobs. It seems that departmental heads were anxious to avoid dissatisfaction among the unemployed in regard to the selection of men for the jobs available, and they would, had they been permitted to do so, have taken men whose names were on the unemployed registers of the State. But they were directed not to do that'. The jobs to which I refer are the painting of a drill hall at East Maitland, and the construction of a telegraph line between Maitland and Newcastle. Only yesterday I received the following telegram from a Mr Appleton, the secretary of the unemployed workers of West Maitland, which reads as follows:Position unsatisfactory in selection of labour at West Maitland post ofiice; men just off Stajtc relief work of twenty days and selected to start work today; take position up immediately. The Treasurer has admitted that certain lists were supjriied over his name to the manager ' of the Cockatoo Island Dockyard. What opportunity bus an ordinary man to obtain work when the names of other men are supplied by the Treasurer or any other member? It is absolutely iuequitable that this should have been done. The money made available for relief work should have been expended in the best possible way, but a great deal of it. has been used in the purchase of material.' When this money was made available, I suggested to the Government that an aerodrome site should be cleared at Cessnock. It is true that that aerodrome would have been used for civil aviation, but as the Defence Department subsidizes civil aviation, it would have been in the nature of a defence work. Had that work been put in hand, 05 per cent, of the money spent on it would have gone in labour. Compare the expenditure of £5,600 on work at Cockatoo Island Dockyard, and on other works in the Dalley division with the sum of £1,425 which is all that has been made available for expenditure in my electorate, although no other electorate in the Commonwealth not has passed through such a severe time as mine. Some of my constituents have not worked for six years, owing to mines closing down. This Government promised that it would put an end to a lockout on the coal-fields in a fortnight, but the lockout there is still effective to all intents and purp'oses. The Government was offered an easy way out of this trouble by the appointment of a special inquiry, but the Prime Minister rejected it, on the ground that, the Government could not consent to have the business of the House taken out of its hands. The last leader of this House to make that statement has passed out of political life, and history has a habit of repeating itself. This is the first time that the Commonwealth has set up an employment registration office in competition with the State bureaux. The result has been that persons who were aware of what, was happening were able to get their names listed, whereas unfortunates living miles away from the centre in which the work was to be carried out knew nothing of what was occurring until the jobs had been filled. That has happened in parts of my electorate, particularly at Maitland. At Kurri Kurri Wallsend the unions decided that work should not be accepted unless the employment was given according to the registers in the State bureaux. communicated with the Commonwealth Works Director in Sydney, who informed rae that he was not allowed to engage men through the State bureaux. I said to bim, "" Apparently this is a matter of jealousy between the Commonwealth and State authorities,"" and he replied that I »could think what I liked; but, if I submitted a list, he would give consideration to it, because he desired the work to be allocated in a manner satisfactory to the unemployed. I went direct to the Officer in charge of the State Registration Bureau, and obtained from him a list, which the Commonwealth officers accepted. At West Maitland and East Maitland men were chosen before the trouble over the registration of workers was known. The unemployed, I understand, have declared the job "" black "", and are asking those who had been engaged to refuse to work unless engagements are made in accordance with the priority of the applicants as indicated ou the State lists. The result is that both jobs are idle today. What has happened in the metropolitan area, according to Mr Beasley, savours of sharp practice, and of preference to the political heelers of Commonwealth Ministers and Government supporters.",31
110,Mr LATHAM,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"Kooyong) [5.10] Recently this Parliament voted £250,000 for relief works, moved by a genuine ilesire to relieve the unemployed who are .suffering distress. Soon after the grant was approved the Prime Minister (Mr. Scullin) stated in Melbourne that the only qualification for employment under the scheme would be hunger. The charge is now made that in Sydney a policy was adopted which favoured men who undertook to support the Government by their votes at the next election. [66]",32
111,Mr THEODORE,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,That is absolutely untrue.,32
112,Mr LATHAM,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"I am not concerned with the allocation of the grant between electorates, or with the complaints of individual members regarding the amounts spent in their constituencies. This money was provided for expenditure and on Commonwealth works, and naturally the greatest expenditure, would occur where-"" the greatest Commonwealth activity WHS; I anticipated that the Cockatoo I Island Dockyard, being a large Commonwealth establishment, would receive a substantial share of the amount. But the gravamen of the charge is that steps have been taken, through the organizers of the political party in New South Wales that is supporting the present Commonwealth Administration, to prepare lists of men seeking employment on the basis of favouritism tp those who would support the Government in the electorates. We have known for some time past that this charge would be made. It has been made, and has been denied specifically by the Treasurer (Mr Theodore), and more generally by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence (Mr Chifley). 1 had expected, however, that testimony would have been forthcoming from Mr. MACPherson and other persons who have been mentioned. Mr Scums - To-da y is the first time we have heard his name mentioned.",32
113,Mr LATHAM,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"I had expected that these persons would have spoken as to their part in the' activities mentioned. 1I have read in the newspapers that organizers of the Australian Labour Party were preparing lists of men who were to be favoured in obtaining employment. The Government might have been expected to produce some evidence in rebuttal of that statement. A further allegation is that a list of persons seeking employment was prepared at Cockatoo Island, but was subsequently altered. Surely there are official records of any changes in the basis upon which employment was to be given.",32
114,Mr SCULLIN,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OF,"I undertook to investigate that.. Mr LATHAM;-That that chargt would be made has been known for a week or ten days.
