Bill brought up, and read a first time. for Silting suspended from 3.S8 to 6 p.m. NA W. H . WILKS.",13
5,Mr MENZIES,DEATH OF THE HONORABLE," It is with regret that I inform honourable members that the Honourable William Henry :Wilks, a former member of this chamber, died in Melbourne on the 5th February last. Mr Wilks enjoyed the distinction of being a member of . the first Commonwealth Parliament. He was elected to represent the Division of Dalley in 1901, and held that seat until the general elections of 1910, When he was defeated. Prior to entering the Commonwealth Parliament, he had been a member of the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales for a period of seven years, so that in total he had a very long and an extremely useful public career. His Commonwealth parliamentary service included the occupancy of the position of Government Whip in 1904-5, of Chairmanship of Committees in 1905-7, and of Chairmanship on the Royal Commission on Postal Services in 1908. Many years have passed since the late Mr Wilks held a seat in this Parliament; therefore, he may be personally unknown to a large number of honourable members. I , of course, did not know him in his capacity as a member of this Parliament, but I had the advantage of some personal acquaintance with him a number of years ago, and I am quite sure that I speak on behalf of all honourable members when I say that very great regret will be felt on both sides of the House at the passing of a man who, for a long period of years, rendered noted service to the State of New South Wales in the Parliament of that State and tc the people of Australia in this Commonwealth Parliament. I recall a remark made by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Curtin) on the occasion of a similar motion last year, when he drew attention to the very special place that was occupied in the parliamentary history of Australia by those who were members of the first Commonwealth Parliament. They were, so to speak, pioneers of the parliamentary institution of the Commonwealth at that time-a . new Commonwealth, with a form that was little understood, and a future that was necessarily hidden. We have great reason to be grateful to the men who worked in this Parliament in its early and formative years. Accordingly, I am quite sure that there will be special regret at the passing of yet one more of those men who held membership of the first Commonwealth Parliament. I desire, on behalf of the Government and of Parliament, to extend our very deep sympathy to the widow and family of the late Mr Wilks in their bereavement. I moveHint this House records its sincere regret at the dcatli of the Honourable William Henry Wilks, a former member of tlio House of Representatives for the Division of Dalley and a member of the First Commonwealth Parliament, places on record its appreciation of his meritorious public service, and tenders its deep sympathy to his widow and family in their bereavement.",13
6,Mr CTTETIN,DEATH OF THE HONORABLE," I beg to second the motion. Like the right honourable the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies), I had no personal association with the late Mr Wilks; but all of us in this place are sufficiently well informed regarding tihe history of the federation to know that a man who, in the first decade of its existence, shared the tremendously difficult task of piloting this Commonwealth through its infant years, was one who not only had a great and an exceedingly important trusteeship for the future of Australia, but also, by reason of his previous membership of the Parliament of New South Wales, and his successive re-elections to this Parliament, must have won a very high place in the. regard of his contemporaries. It is, I believe, true, that all of the members of the First Commonwealth Parliament, apart from the privilege that they had of being the first members of this National Parliament, were in themselves men of very great capacity. Most of them had served in the Parliaments of the States, and some of them will, I think, remain for all time imperishable figures in our national history. Although every member of the Parliament could not occupy a place in the Government, I think that it must be true that there was a large number of them who were none the less of very great value to the public life and the public service of the day. So far as my reading enables me to form an opinion, I should say that the late Mr. Wilks was far from being the least of those men. Even to be the humblest in such a distinguished gallery was indeed to be a very important figure. I pay tribute to the late honourable gentleman's work, and on behalf of my colleagues and myself offer sympathy to his bereaved family. Mr AECHJ.E CAMERON (BarkerMinister for Commerce) - I desire to associate the Country party with all that has been said concerning the late Mr Wilks, and on behalf of that party extend sympathy to those who have been bereaved.",14
7,Mr EOSEVEAE,DEATH OF THE HONORABLE," I associate myself with the very kindly remarks that have already been made in memory of the late honourable member for Dalley.' As has been indicated, the late Mr Wilks was one of the pioneers on the unblazed track of Federal government, and played a very important part in the early work of this Parliament. He was a man of considerable political courage, and although his particular shade of politics was not entirely in harmony with that of the electorate that he represented, nevertheless, for nine years, he served faithfully the party to which he belonged in a division which has since transferred its political allegiance to another political party. He played a prominent part in the affairs of both the State of New South Wales and the Commonwealth, and was always a fearless fighter on behalf of those whom he held dear. By reason of my very early recollections of the political struggle in this particular electorate, I can say of him that, whatever his views were, he placed them fearlessly before the people and was at all times a fair fighter in the interests of those whom he represented. It is to his credit, too, that although he has been dissociated from the work of this Parliament for many j'ears, he continued to retain an interest in the' politics of this country. The opinions that he expressed to political friends as well as to political opponents were valuable, because of the wide experience he had had in politics. I desire to associate his old friends, as well as his old political opponents in my electorate-wh o speak well of him-wit h the remarks that have been made, and on behalf of the present generation in that electorate, convey very sincere sympathy to his relatives, as well as to the country in general, in the loss of one of its most prominent citizens.",14
8,Mr HUGHES,DEATH OF THE HONORABLE," I desire to associate myself with the remarks made by the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) and those who have also spoken on this motion. I knew Mr Wilks very well. He and I were close personal friends. We entered the Parliament of New South Wales at the same time and remained together in that legislature until the establishment of the Commonwealth, when we were both returned to this Parliament. I knew him intimately. He was a bright spirit. We were not members of the same party, but he was a man of democratic instincts. He served his country well. He was an upright and honourable man, and one in whose friendship I rejoiced. I deeply regret his death. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places. Motion (by Mr MENZIES) agreed toThat Mr Speaker be requested to transmit to Mrs Wilks the foregoing resolution, together with a copy of the speeches delivered thereon. NA W. 0. HILL .",15

10,Mr GEORGE LAWSON,APPOINTMEN T OF INDUSTRIA L,"Some few weeks ago the Attorney-General's Department advertised positions of industrial inspectors. Has the department yet considered the applications received? If so, when will the proposed appointments be made? What will be the actual duties of those inspectors?",15
11,Mr HUGHES,APPOINTMEN T OF INDUSTRIA L,A number of applications has been received.,15
12,Mr GEORGE LAWSON,APPOINTMEN T OF INDUSTRIA L,How many?,15
13,Mr HUGHES,APPOINTMEN T OF INDUSTRIA L,"When I say ""a number "" I mean a number.",15
14,Mr CURTIN,APPOINTMEN T OF INDUSTRIA L,Does the right honourable gentleman mean a great number?,15
15,Mr HUGHES,APPOINTMEN T OF INDUSTRIA L,"I mean a great number. They are not so numerous as the sands of the seashore, but they are getting on that way. The closest scrutiny, as the honourable gentleman will appreciate, is necessary in order that the great qualifications of applicants may be sifted and duly passed on. This will take some time; we are at work on it now. THE PUBLICIST.",15
16,Mr HARRISON,APPOINTMEN T OF INDUSTRIA L,"Has the Acting Minister for Information had an opportunity to look at certain articles contained in The Publicist, which are articles of a seditious and disloyal kind? If he has, what action does he propose to take to see that statements of that kind are not published?",15
17,Sir HENRY GULLETT,APPOINTMEN T OF INDUSTRIA L,"I assure the honourable gentleman that articles of the kind to which he has referred and which I have read for the first time today in this month's issue of The Publicist, will not appear in any subsequent number. PUBLIC ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE.",15
18,Mr SHEEHAN,APPOINTMEN T OF INDUSTRIA L,In view of the vastly increased commitments owing to the war will the Treasurer consider reconstituting the Parliamentary Accounts Committee in order to scrutinize all expenditure ?,16
19,Mr SPENDER,APPOINTMEN T OF INDUSTRIA L,I shall. . NA COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATIO N to the growers? COURT.,16
20,Mr HOLT,PENAL POWERS OP,"I ask the Priine Minister if it is a fact that, as the result action taken hy a previous Administraknow tion, the only penal power now available to the' Commonwealth Arbitration Court in respect of any award which not obeyed by a union is the power de-register that union? If that is a fact, will the Prime Minister consider taking prompt action either under powers ferred upon the Government by the or National Security Act or under powers conferred by legislation to be passed through this Parliament in order power the Commonwealth Arbitration Court to discipline any union disobeying an award of the court?",16
21,Mr MENZIES,PENAL POWERS OP,The honourable gentleman's question substantially and accurately .sets out the present position. The Government has under immediate consideration the introduction of legiscase lation to bring about changes in that position. APPLES AND PEARS.,16
22,Mr FROST,PENAL POWERS OP,"Has the attention the Minister for Commerce been drawn to a. report in the Sydney Daily Telegraph in reference to the conveyance of fruit from the wharves to the Sydney market? The statement readsDelivery of thousands of cases of apples and pears was held up yesterday morning while members of the Master Fruit Carriers' Association conferred with the Apple and Board. The carriers complained about the carting arrangements controlled by the board. "" Conditions have been chaotic ever since Apple and Pear Acquisition Scheme was introduced,"" said the secretary of the Master Fruit Carriers' Association' (Mr J. V. Sheridan) yesterday. "" One of our members waited on Monday from 7 a.m. t ill 3 p.m. expecting to cart 1,800 cases of apples to an agent."" "" A f t e r that long wait all he got was 78 cases."" Will the Minister have an investigation war made of the delivery from the Sydney wharves of fruit acquired by the Commonwealth Government, as the Apple and Pear Board in New South Wales seems to be trying to make a failure of the marketing scheme, thus causing heavy loss",16
23,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,PENAL POWERS OP,I have not seen the paragraph but I shall look of at it and let the honourable gentleman what the position is.,16
24,Mr JOHN LAWSON,PENAL POWERS OP,"Is the Minister for Commerce in a position to is say what payment has been made under to the apple and pear acquisition scheme in respect of each case of fruit? Will he explain the basis upon which future payconments will be made, and state whether not it is a fact, as reported, that it is not intended to make any further payment in respect of apples and pears until to emafter August of this year? Mr Archie GAMER ON - The first payment was Is. 4d. a case in respect of three-quarters of the assessed crop of each grower. A second payment of Sd. a. case in respect of apples, and an additional Is. a case in respect of pears, has been - authorized. Another payment, of Is. a in respect of approved qualities delivered to the board's agents will be made on delivery of the fruit. As to the third part of the honourable member's question, I inform him that no person has any authority to say that no further payment of will be made before August next.",16
25,Mr MAHONEY,PENAL POWERS OP,"Has the Minister for Commerce received any urgent communication from exporters of apples and pears in Tasmania who have been put out of business because of the inauguration of the apple and pear acquisition scheme, and will he see that the promise made Fear by the Prime Minister to the Leader of the Opposition, that these men would be given an opportunity to participate in the their regular business of exporting apples and pears, will be honoured ? Will he say whether he intends to take any action in the matter?",16

32,Mr WHITE,PENAL POWERS OP,"Is the Minister for Commerce in a position to sa.y whether any foreign wool appraisers, other than of men of French nationality are employed the by the Central Wool Committee, and can he give the approximate number of such has men and their nationalities ?

33,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,PENAL POWERS OP,"There ? are foreign appraisers of nationalities than French in the employ of the Central. Wool Committee. I cannot state the number of sueh men, but-if the. honourable gentleman desires the information,, I shall liave inquiries made, although some the correspondence' and considerable time in 1 for' iHi would be entailed. I point out that'- before the war, Australian wool, was sold to buyers of many; nationalities who had their representatives here. The system of appraisement is based on tliere being one appraiser to represent the buyer or the prospective buyer, another to represent the seller, the third to be independent. look into the honourable member's question, and shall supply him with the best information which it is possible to obtain, AUSTRALIANIMPERIALFORC E. SBI\AKATION ALLOWANCES-- TRAINING OF VOLUNTEERS INTHEIBOWN STATES.",17
34,Mr WHITE,PENAL POWERS OP,""" Will the Minister for the Army investigate the present inequitable basis on which separation allowances are paid to widowed mothers of men who have enlisted in the Australian ""Imperial Force, whereby the mother of an unemployed man receives nothing except the allotment Which is deducted from his pay whereas in other cases varying amounts are paid; and will he also bring down some equitable scheme whereby separation allowances will be paid to all?",18
35,Mr STREET,PENAL POWERS OP,"The ""whole question of allowances for dependants is at present under review 'by the Government with a view to removing anomalies and inequities wherever they exist. _ Mr Lazzarini - Will the Minister for the Army in f o rm the House what precautions, if any, are taken by the military authorities to protect the interests of wives and children of soldiers who have gone overseas? I have already furnished the Minister with particulars of two cases in which women other than the wives of the soldiers concerned have been drawing separation allowances, while the wives and their children have 'been in want.",18
36,Mr STREET,PENAL POWERS OP,"I think that the honourable member's question, has probably been covered by the answer which I .gave to a previous question. I point out that the records office must accept the declaration of the soldier regarding his dependants. If he mak.es a false .declaration some time must necessarily elapse before the matter can be put right. Mr :""N""AiRW,-Will the Minister for the A r m y in f o rm me whether any volunteers in Western Australia for ;servic,e abroad are now .being .trained in the Eastern States?

38,Mr MAHONEY,PENAL POWERS OP,"Will the Minister for the A r m y take immediate steps by regulation to meet an anomaly in the pay of dependants of soldiers going overseas ? A boy may allot to his mother 2s. out of 5s., but she gets nothing from the Commonwealth Government.

A lot of the hoys going overseas dp not understand the position. ;",18
39,Mr STREET,PENAL POWERS OP,As I .said earlier the dependants' allowances are at present under review.,18
40,Mr MAHONEY,PENAL POWERS OP,Will that aspect be taken into consideration?,18
41,Mr STREET,PENAL POWERS OP,Yes .,18
42,Mr JAMES,PENAL POWERS OP,"Is the Minister for .the Army aware that imdue hardship is at present being inflicted upon dependants of members of the Australian Imperial Force because of the way in which regu=lat'ions governing the .allotment ' of soldiers'* pay are being administered? In one instance, the details of w'hich I have communicated to the department, an unmarried soldier had made an allotment of pay to his mother. Subsequently he married, but the department refused tp make an allotment, fr.om his pay to the wife. When representations were made on the matter, she was informed that it would he ne.cess.ary for her to obtain a .court order against her husband.. I i i aijother case, a soldier .deliberately left his wife, who was in a delicate state of health, without any provision at all, and she had to go to the court for - an orderI ask the .Minister whether it is a fact .that, in that .particular .case., it was necessary .to .phtaiu a grant from the Loiid Mayor's Fund in Newcastle sp that the woman might he .able to buy the equipment necessary to .enable her"" to .go into hospital for the bi-rth .of her child ?",18
43,Mr STREET,PENAL POWERS OP,"In cases where a court order is made, the soldier is obliged to fulfil that order by an allotment from his pay. To the extent to which the order cannot be met from the soldier's pay, it is made up by the Commonwealth Government. No unnecessary delay occurs in those cases. If a soldier made an allotment, and subsequently marries, it is necessary for him to make a fresh allotment to his wife separation allowance can be paid to her. Until that second allotment is made no separation allowance can be made to the wife. The honourable member will realise that that must be so. SHIPBUILDIN GIN AUSTRALIA. Mr ""WATKINS --Will the Prime tory Minister state whether the Government has granted, or is granting, any assistance to the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited in connection with the constructing tion of ships at Whyalla? If so, what is the nature of this assistance?",18
44,Mr MENZIES,PENAL POWERS OP,"I shall have the matter investigated, and shall advise the honourable member later.",19
45,Mr FRANCIS,PENAL POWERS OP,"Havin g regard to the anxiety of the primary producers of Australia concerning the shortage of shipping to convey their produce overseas, I ask the Prime Minister to make a statement connumber cerning the Government's activities? also .ask the right honourable gentleman whether he will lay upon the table of the House the Townsend report on shipthe building and its possibilities in Australia?",19
46,Mr MENZIES,PENAL POWERS OP,"I understand that the report of Mr Townsend was prepared for the information of Cabinet. I cannot undertake to lay it on the table of House. The matters arising out of that report, and the whole shipping situation generally, are at present engaging the consideration of the Government.  aware that Mr .Townseud did not visit the State of South Australia during his investigations, and will the riglit honourable gentleman see that the claims of that State are not overlooked in this matter? South Australia is entitled to a fair share of any shipbuilding undertaken by the Commonwealth.",19
47,Mr MENZIES,PENAL POWERS OP,"I can assure the honourable member that the claims of South Australia in this matter will not be overlooked. Even if I desired to ignore South Australia in this matter, the honourable has member would not allow me to do so. before INDUSTRIAL TRIBUNAL FOR TH E NORTHERN TERRITORY.",19
48,Mr BLAIN,PENAL POWERS OP,"Will the Prime Minister consider bringing in remedial legislation to deal with industrial disputes in the Northern Territory in place of the present penal legislation? At present there is no Industrial Board in the Northern Terrias there is in the Australian Capital Territory, but only a Board of Reference. Will he introduce legislation, or have an ordinance passed, for the purpose of setup an Industrial Board which will function in the same"" way as does the Industrial Board in the Australian Capital Territory?",19
49,Mr MENZIES,PENAL POWERS OP,The honourable member's representations on this matter will be considered by the Government. CURTAILED MAIL SERVICES.,19
50,Mr ANTHONY,PENAL POWERS OP,"I have received a of telegrams from representatives I of towns in Northern New South Wales advising me that, as a result of a railway disorganization caused by the coal strike, carriage of mails to those towns is being seriously interfered with. It is suggested that tliere are alternative methods of getting the mails through, particularly by motor service, but that these methods have not been availed of. the Will the Postmaster-General have the matter inquired into with a view to ensuring that these northern towns, and particularly Tenterfield, have their regular mail services restored ?",19
51,Mr THORBY,PENAL POWERS OP,"It is true that the New South Wales Government has curtailed a number of the ordinary mail train services. As a result, there has been a certain delay on some days of the week in the delivery of mails to outlying country towns. Every effort is being made to utilize other services for the carriage of mails in order to prevent delay. COAL STRIKE .",19
52,Mr JAMES,PENAL POWERS OP,"Havin g regard to the importance of the coal industry to Australia's economic life, and to the successful prosecution of the present war, does not the Prime Minister believe that it is time the Government called the parties together under the provisions of the Industrial Peace Act, which provides that, in the event of a conference failing, an arbitrator may be appointed to bring about an agreement? If will not invoke the provisions of this act, which was specifically passed to cover the needs of the extremely intricate coal industry, will he state his reasons to the House?",20
53,Mr MENZIES,PENAL POWERS OP,"The Government is not prepared to exercise the powers it possesses under the provisions of the dustrial Peace Act, aud, in brief, its reasons are that it is not prepared to substitute some other tribunal for the Arbitration Colirt simply because a decision of the court has not been favourably received by one of the parties to the dispute.",20
54,Mr LAZZARINI,PENAL POWERS OP,B y both of them.,20
55,Mr MENZIES,PENAL POWERS OP,"The difference is that one party is observing the award, or would be willing to do sp, while the other is not. However, I agree entirely with what the honourable member has said about the great economic importance of the coal industry during the present war, and I only hope that his words will have a very wide circulation in the coal districts. Later:",20
56,Mr JAMES,PENAL POWERS OP,"Is the Prime Minister aware that in 1929 the coal-ownei'3 locked out the coal-miners for fifteen months in spite of the fact that they were working under an award made under the Industrial Peace Act and that his predecessor in the constituency which he now represents withdrew proceedings which had been commenced against the coal-owners? How can the right honourable gentleman reconcile the attitude of the present Government against the workers with the failure of a previous Government to proceed against the coal owners ? Is the right honourable gentleman correctly reported in the Sydney Morning Herald as purposing to go to the coalfields? Was the right honourable gentleman responsible for the statement in that article that the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Watkins) and myself purposed to accompany him? If he was responsible, does he not think that out of courtesy, a. member of this Parliament, who represents 80 per cent, of the coal production of Australia, should at least he bave been informed of his intention to go to the coal-fields and of the text of the talks that he proposes to have with the coal-miners ?",20
57,Mr MENZIES,PENAL POWERS OP,"I have no knowledge of what took place here in 1929. Mr CURTIA ' - Oh , yes, you have. T",20
58,Mr MENZIES,PENAL POWERS OP,"Wit h great respect, In - I have not, and I do not think that I should he asked to study a statement of a predecessor dealing with facts of which I am not aware. As for the latter portion of the honourable gentleman's question, I am not responsible for any statement that appears in the press that I may be accompanied through the coal-fields by the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr. Watkins) or the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James). The fact is that I had a conversation yesterday with the honourable member for Newcastle. I endeavoured to have one with the honourable member for Hunter, but he had not then arrived in Canberra. I told the honourable member for Newcastle that I was proposing to go to the coal-fields and would like to learn from him and subsequently from the honourable member for Hunter what were their opinions as to the best place to visit and the best time to go there. When I found that the honourable member for Hunter was not in Canberra I asked the honourable member for Newcastle to be good enough to tell that honourable member what I was contemplating and that subsequently I would get into touch with him. I regret that I have not had the opportunity today to do so because I have been almost continuously engaged. I know, however, that messages have been passed to the honourable member for Hunter, and I have the advantage of his view as to what locality I should visit. I am not responsible for what appeared in the press. I made it clear that I did not want to embarrass either the honourable member for Newcastle or the honourable member for Hunter. I realise that they must stand in a position quite independent of a visit by me and that they are in no sense to be treated as responsible for my visit there or for anything I say or do. I make that clear because I know each honourable gentleman has been working to produce a settlement of this dispute. I should be the last to suggest that they would be responsible for any action I took. COMMUNIST PROPAGANDA.",20
59,Mr JENNINGS,PENAL POWERS OP,"In connection with the proposals about to be implemented for the purpose of dealing with communist propaganda, has the Government the full co-operation of the various State authorities ?",21
60,Mr HUGHES,PENAL POWERS OP,"I have not made direct contact with all the State Governments on this matter, although with some I have. Speaking generally, I should say that the co-operation of which the honourable member speaks will be forthcoming.

62,Mr HUGHES,PENAL POWERS OP,"Quite . I will, if the honourable member insists on it. SALE OF PRIMAR Y PRODUCTS.",21
63,Mr ROSEVEAR,PENAL POWERS OP,"Will the Treasurer state whether it is a fact that payments from Great Britain for surplus primary products sold to it by the Australian vernment are made in sterling? Are the products not required by Great Britain being re-sold to other countries which usually purchase such products from Australia, and is foreign exchange from those re-sales being accumulated in Great Britain? Has this loss of foreign exchange by Australia resulted in the imposition of trade restrictions with nonsterling countries, thereby creating unemployment in Australia and loss of trade? Has the Government made any approach to the British Government with a view to having the foreign exchange from those re-sales paid to the credit of the Commonwealth Government in order to relieve these trade restrictions?",21
64,Mr SPENDER,PENAL POWERS OP,"Fro m my general knowledge of the matter I can say that no action by G.reat Britain has caused any loss of employment or of trade to Australia.

68,Mr MCHUGH,PENAL POWERS OP,"In view of the fact Gothat only 2s. 6d. a bushel has been paid on the wheat received, and the further fact that the representatives of the wheat industry have requested that a further advance of Is. a bushel be made, I ask the Minister for Commerce when he anticipates being able to make a pronouncement on this vitally important matter?",21
69,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,PENAL POWERS OP,In these disturbed times it is not well to anticipate too far ahead. As soon as a pronouncement can be made on the subject. I assure the honourable members that it will be made. POTATO PRICES.,21
70,Mr LANE,PENAL POWERS OP,"Seeing that conditions relating to the supply of potatoes from Tasmania to New South Wales indicate a good deal of piracy at both ends, namely in Tasmania and at Sussexstreet,"" I ask the Treasurer whether he will take steps to have potatoes brought under the authority of the Price Fixing Board in order that some more equitable organization may be set up to ensure that potatoes may be available to the consumers at a fair price.",22

If not, when is it anticipated that refined oil will be produced at Glen Davis nnd what quantities are likely to be available?",22
75,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,PENAL POWERS OP,I have no reports at hand which would suggest that the work at Glen Davis is being interfered with by the coal strike. I shall obtain information for the honourable member in reply to the other parts of his question. CORNSACKS.,22
76,Mr SCULLY,PENAL POWERS OP,"Is the Minister for Commerce able to inform the House whether adequate provision is being made to ensure a satisfactory supply of cornsacks for the forthcoming harvest? Will the honourable gentleman make a pronouncement on this subject, as the acute shortage last year inflicted great hardship ou many persons engaged in the wheat-growing industry?",22
77,Sir FREDERICK STEWART,PENAL POWERS OP,An advisory committee has already been constituted and is functioning to ensure that all the jute products required for commercial purposes in Australia will be available as needed in satisfactory quantities. There need be no apprehension on this subject. Requisite action is being taken to ensure that full supplies will be available for the current wool season and also for the forthcoming wheat harvest. BARLEY INDUSTRY.,22
78,Mr GREGORY,PENAL POWERS OP,Is the Minister for yet able to announce his decision on the request of the barley growers of Western Australia to be released as soon as possible from the operations of the Barley Acquisition Board?,22

Mr Lazzarini,-Will the Minister for the Army have immediate inquiries made to ascertain whether it is true that, although a great many of the men in camp at Ingleburn are on leave from the camp over the week-end, the same quantities of foodstuffs are delivered at the camp from Friday afternoon until Monday morning as though the camp were full, with the result that great quantities of foodstuffs have to be burned or buried because they are not required? I do not suggest that the Minister has information on this matter at the moment, but I have been informed .from a reliable local authority that commodities are delivered in the same quantities seven days a week irrespective of the number of men actually in the camp, with the result that there is wholetion sale waste - I ask that inquiries be made into this matter at once.",22
82,Mr STREET,PENAL POWERS OP,"I shall certainly inquiries made in the matter, but I am confident that the honourable member has been misinformed. NA TRAINEES. TRANSPORTATION COSTS WHEN ON LEAVE.",23
83,Mr CURTIN,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"Is it a fact that trainees called up for compulsory training have to pay their own railway fares when given leave during the period of their training? If so, will the Minister make arrangements whereby 'they may travel on the railways to their homes at such times without payment? In effect, my question aims at providing free transport to their homes for compulsory trainees while engaged on the King's business.",23
84,Mr STREET,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"T t has not been the practice to provide free transport for men cal-ed up for compulsory training when go on leave, and I am sure that the reader of the Opposition will realise that the granting of this concession would involve enormous expense. ""Where it is possible to use army transport vehicles to take men between the camps and the nearest railway stations that is done, but it is not practicable to pay the way fares of the trainees. The only fares that have been paid by the department have been in respect of pre-embarkation leave for members of the Australian Imperial Eorce. NORTHERN TERRITORY. HMS FOR ARTISANS.",23

CIVIL RIGHTS OE CITIZENS.",23
87,Mr DEDMAN,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"I draw the attention of the Prime Minister to the following report which appeared in the Melbourne Sun of the 4th MarchGeelong, Saturday.

89,Mr NAIRN,COMPULSORY MILITARY,"I ask the Treasurer a question in relation to the sales tax on railgoods which were ordered a considerable time ago, but were not shipped promptly because of the outbreak of war, and have since increased in price.

If so, is such action being taken in pursuance of some statutory requirement,'or it done simply by a departmental",23

93,Mr SPENDER,UTILIZATION OP WOOL,"There is a Capital Issues Board, which was established under the regulation that operates in respect of capital issues.

Mr SCHOLFIELD , for the Committee appointed to prepare an Address-inReply to H is Excellency the Governor General's Speech (vide page 3 ) , brought up the proposed Address, which was read by the Clerk.",27
120,Mr SCHOLFIELD,DAIRYI NG A ND POULTRY,"Wannon) [8.4] I move That the following Address-in-Reply to His Excellency the Governor General's Speech be agreed"" to:MAY IT PLEASE YOUK EXCELLENCYWe, the House of Representatives of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, in Parliament assembled, desire to express our loyalty to our Most Gracious Sovereign, and to thank Your Excellency for the Speech which you have been pleased to address to Parliament. I appreciate the honour that has been conferred upon me in my having been asked to move this motion. The House is meeting at the time of grave world disturbance, which is becoming exceedingly dangerous for the people of this country, and every other country with our forms of domestic and national life. The gravest. threats are being made against our independence as a free people, and are being accompanied by the vilest propaganda and the most underhand and treacherous activities that one nation could practice upon a friendly neighbouring country. National and individual morality has receded almost to vanishing point in some countries, and innocent people, whose only desire is to live on friendly relations with their neighbors, are being murdered at the slightest provocation and their property and homes are being confiscated. In those countries liberty is practically non-existent. There i -- indescribable chaos in the world, and scientific discoveries which should be used TO promote human happiness are being employed to destroy it and to destroy also the homes and even the lives of the people of those countries. I could go on indefinitely in this way, but there is no need to do so. Everybody must know what is being done. That these things are not abhorred by everybody is a calamity of the first importance, because entered the every ounce of effort that this nation can possibly exert to assist the Allies in their strenuous fight, against these things should be exerted. I say with the utmost deliberation that we are fighting in the defence of civilization. In very truth we are fighting for nothing more and nothing less than civilization itself. Therefore, every effort that we can make in the fight should be made. All rightthinking people will , I am sure, agree with me. Wrong-thinking people, and those who do not agree with this sentiment, should be obliged to submit to the closest investigation of their circumstances, to determine whether they ought to be placed in a position where, if they wil] not assist the Government, they at least will not be able to hinder it in its war efforts. No praise is too great for the soldiers of this country who have volunteered to fight in its defence and have actually gone, or are preparing to go. overseas to do so. It would be suicidal for us to wait until the battle had to be waged on our own shores. We are fighting for our independence and for civilization, b""ut if we wait u n t i l the battle comes to us, we shall fight a losing battle. Consequently, I desire to pay the highest tribute, to the young men of this country, and of the other Dominions, who bave enlisted for overseas service with the. object of endeavouring to localize the fight, if it is at all possible, in the regions where it is now being waged. 1 appeal to all loyal Australians to assist the Government in the strenuous task it has in seeking to assist the Allies in their fight. I appeal also to all honourable members of this House and to all Australian people to drop party politics and fall in behind the' Government so that OUT war effort may be made with our maximum strength. On the front bench on the Government side of the House, we have men of average, and probably more than average, intelligence; if they were men of only average intelligence, they would be a.ble to do the job that has to be done. The members of the Government are not less loyal than other persons in this community, and certainly not less loyal than their critics. We all know that they are industrious. Moreover, they have available much more and much better advice than any other persons in the community, and certainly than their critics. Mistakes, of course, wil] be made. They will always be made. But I hold the view that such mistakes'as have been made by the Government have been mistakes of detail and not of broad national policy. I invite honourable members in particular, and the people of Australia in general, to examine the war effort of the Government. I am sure that if they will do so they will come to the conclusion that the Government has implemented a fair and reasonable policy calculated to give to the Allies the greatest assistance of which we are capable in their very strenuous endeavours to defend our civilization. Helpful criticism, I am sure, will always be welcomed by the Government, but destructive criticism at such a time as this is nothing less than a calamity. I therefore appeal to honourable members to offer constructive criticism and not to engage in criticism of a kind which might be helpful to the enemy. The problems which the Government is facing are tremendous. In addition to the ordinary matters that must face the Administration of this country, there is the added problem of devising ways and means to market our primary products in circumstances which are most difficult. I ask the Government, to give very serious consideration to these vital matters, for primary production is of immense importance to Australia, I believe that this is the first Government that has attempted to limit profits in this country in wartime. I hope that it will take within its purview many details in this connection which, apparently, up to date have escaped notice; for in spite of its activities hitherto, certain people in Australia are taking advantage of the circumstances of the country to make undue profits. I know that the Government is facing a. very difficult problem in its endeavours to conserve the credit of the country, and fco make the best possible use of its financial resources in,the prosecution of the war. I commend it for what it has done in this way. I should like to see some additional investigation made into some minor details in connection with imports and the classification of imports. This subject is causing some irritation. Certain critics of the Government have objected to the classification that has been made of goods, and there is room for additional investigation on this important subject. It is, of course, inevitable that extra taxation must be imposed, but if such new imposts as must be' made are so devised as to ensure that they will fall upon those persons in the community who are best able to bear them,.I am sure that the Australian people will be loyal enough to bear them uncomplainingly, heavy though they may be. The Government will have to go on the money market, and it will encounter some difficulties here. To all of these problems must be added preparations for reconstruction after the war. Unemployment will have to be provided against and we shall also have to make provision for the well-being of the men who return from abroad. I was glad to notice the reference in the Governor General's Speech to the intention of the Government to make early preparations for the repatriation of our soldiers. It is not too early to set about the drafting of a comprehensive measure to ensure that the soldiers who come back from this war will receive better treatment than the men who returned from the last war. With the experience that we have had in the last 25 years, it should be possible to evolve legislation which will give much more satisfaction to returned soldiers than was manifested after the last war. But in the midst of all these difficulties the Government is being confronted with the dalamity^and that word adviaedly^of the coal strike, 'thig strike is'a crime against Australia and its people at a time w'hfcn Australian soldiers are fighting in distant lands. It is a crime against humanity and against the workers in other countries who have appealed to their fellow workers throughout the world to assist them in the fight against oppress sion. As we look around the world to'day 'wefind that in othe^r lands, particularly in the British Empire, the workers are doing their utmost to help the Allies in this fight. In New Zealand, where a Labour Government is in office, a magnificent job is being done. In Great Britain also the Labour party is behind the Government. From the Labour party in Norway an appeal for assistance has been issued to workers throughout the world. Yet in Australia one of the key industries of the country is being sabotaged by people who profess to bo true Australians. There are Communists in this country^ and therefore I am pleased to see in the Governor General's Speech an intimation that the Government will take steps to curb their activities.. Surely, not all of the men who are On Strike are Communists; surely, not even all of their leaders are Communists ? Should it be found that they are Communists, a very dangerous state of affairs indeed would be revealed--a position which should be closely investigated by the Government. If these men to whom I have referred - are not ail Communists, I want to see their leaders in this House advise them to end their stupid and traitorous activities. If these men are not all Communists, I charge the trade union leaders, and others, with the gravest acts of disloyalty ever perpetrated in this country. No excuse offered on their behalf will convince ma, or the majority of Australia* that such action is not disloyal. I have not noticed any effort tm the part of honourable m&mbers opposite to settle the coal strike, .and therefore it would appear that they condone the action of the strikers. I repeat that their action at this time is Mr Scholfield. one of the greatest acts of disloyalty that this country has ever witnessed. An appeal has been made to the Government to settle the strike by the exercise of the power vested in it under the National I use Security Act; but the very people who have issued that appeal would, at some future date, cite such action to support arguments designed to show why such powers should be refused to the Government. The National Security Act should not be invoked to meet the present situation, and I commend the Government for not taking action under its provisions. I am pleased that the Governor General's Speech indicates that action will be taken along the iines that I have mentioned. I have appealed for unity in the great struggle in which the country is engaged. I appeal to the Opposition in this chamber to drop party politics for the duration of the war, and to get behind the Government in its efforts on behalf of Australia.",27
121,Mr BLACKBURN,DAIRYI NG A ND POULTRY,--Does the Governor General's Speech suggest that party politics have been dropped by the Government?,29
122,Mr SCHOLFIELD,DAIRYI NG A ND POULTRY,"I shall conclude by quoting from a speech of a Labour politician in this country two months after the outbreak of the last war, when Labour was in office. His statement then is applicable to the present circumstances, and I commend it to the honourable members opposite. The gentleman to whom I have referred then said I bcliove that we have at the head of affairs today Ministers who will meet the situation lil« men, bravely and firmly, and do tlieir beet in the interests of the country. I am charitable enough to think that our opponents 1 in the Federal Parliament today will join with the Government in this calamitous time, and help them to put matters on asl satisfactory a footing as possible in the circumstances. I commend the motion to the House.",29
123,Mr AJETHONY,DAIRYI NG A ND POULTRY,"Richmond) [8.20] It is my privilege and honour to second the motion that the Address be agreed to. In times of peace the Address-in-Reply is a political occasion, but in time of war, and especially at such a critical time as the present, it becomes an occasion of great significance. The motion before the House gives vital"" and personal expression by each of us to the loyalties and high purposes which guide all British peoples. The supreme task that .lies before its 'today may well be defined .as ""the vindication of the freedom - of 'all - peoples, especially small peoples, fft is & 'task, in<to which we Australians, --although numerically ?small, .should throw - every - ounce - of viaility, energy *nd independence that we ipossess; it is a task '-to ithe accomplishment of which i:t is the dn'fcy - of the 'Government to lead the people with energy 'and purpose. I am glad., therefore, to note tkatt, since the House Oast met, the weight of Te'sponsihility falling upon the Administration - has been shared by members of the party *e which I belong. Faced, - ss we - are, iby one formidable enemy, covertly threatened by others, and - hesitatingly : «wl feebly assisted 'by 'stall others who shoefd be our active friends, we have .need for all of the singleness of purpose and high resolution which the Address-i-niReply expresses. We stand together as a parliament atad as a people in 'common loyalty to the .great fundamental principles of human, rights which in British - communities are safeguarded by Crown and constitution alike*-freedo m of speech, thought and action; freedom to Worship, or not to worship-; freedom to elect and control our own governments; freedom from the violation of our homes) freedom from the fear of the deprivation of our personal liberty, except by the due processes of the law; freedom a3 a peaceful and law-abiding people to .go our own ways and live our own lives. These lberties are in jeopardy today. To-night, I had the privilege of hearing an address on international affairs by the distinguished visitor from Great Britain who now occupies a seat on the floor of this House. After telling us that he had visited many countries recently and had seen what was going Europe and Asia, he said "" If the light of liberty flickers out in England, I do not know where it will again be lighted "". Those words made a great impression on my mind, because of the tremendous truth embodied in them. I have mentioned the various liberties which we enjoy, but there is one qualification iii respect of them. Eight down the ages when the very existence of the State has been threatened it has been the custom for democracy temporarily to surrender its treasured liberties to the 'executive, -'atfid to 'confer upon it <extra'or-tKrsaxy ipowers in order that the struggle - for the preservation - of the state might he most effectively waged. Throughout - tihe British realm, as well 'as in the .great democracy o i France, the legislature has .given to the 'executive .powers which, in peace, it would never dream of - conferring. By the passing - of the National - Security Act this Parliament with a miniw-um of opposition has given to - the Executive, exceedingly 'wide powers, which in peace it has reserved exclusively to - itself. If the legislature voluntarily restricts its privileges in 'tihe - national interest, in my - opinion it follows that the liberties ordinarily enjoyed by the - md-ivi""dual must likewise he curtailed if - such restriction is in the interest of the security of the State. When* therefore, any individual who enjoys civil and political liberty, such 'as this coiintry affords, abuses that freedom 'by engaging in subversive acts of a character likely to assist an enemy and bring about our - defeat, a duty devolves upon the Government to step in and protect the state. I therefore welcome that passage in the --'Governor General's Speech which indicates that a less tolerant attitude towards Communist activity and treachery will be shown in the future. Last Sunday - afternoon from the outskirts of the crowd I listened to some Comitnunist speakers in the Sydney Domain. I heard 'one of them say that not a man, or a guri, or a ship, should leave this country to assist "" in this imperialistic war."" The man who made that statement-, and those who were with him, were protected by a c'ordoh of police to enable them to 'do so. I commend the Government for having at on in last taken steps to end such a state of affairs, and I hope that the measures foreshadowed in the Governor General's Speech will be applied vigorously. Our sister dominion of New Zealand has already made some move in that direction. I believe that we can follow its example, and perhaps improve upon it. Before I leave that particular subject; I appeal to our friends oh the opposite side b.f the House to give the Government some assistance when it has to tackle this very difficult problem of dealing with subversive activities. I am not endeavouring to make party political capital out of the circumstances that exist. I am sorry that I am given no credit by one or two honourable members opposite, but I believe that a number of the members of the Opposition appreciate the penetrative tactics of the Communist section of the community, and have very good reason to resent the activities of those persons in their own organizations. One has only to read the newspapers which sometimes circulate as official organs of the Opposition.party, to appreciate that very many members of the Opposition are waging a desperate battle against Communists today. This is the second occasion during the present generation on which we have been called upon to meet from the same quarter a challenge to the elementary principles have propouuded. The threat today is graver than it was on the last occasion, because it comes from a dictatorship which avowedly is out to destroy democracy; a dictatorship that is not only ruthless and aggressive but is also as callous aud brutal as was any ravaging horde in the dark ages. It may be equipped with all of the scientific aid which the twentieth century can give to it, but its methods and ideals are those of many hundreds of years ago. Germany says that it wants colonies. God help ns if it ever had the opportunity to colonize us as it is today colonizing Poland, by means of extermination and pillage, free men being driven in hundreds of thousands to work as slaves in order that the Nazi might be in a better position to enslave others, women and children being left to starve or freeze to death, and the firing squad being used for any one who is brave enough to stand up in the name of freedom! Behind the programme foreshadowed in His Excellency's Speech today, matter of fact and material though such things may be, there looms largely the framework of the gigantic effort which Australia is making. Back of that there is a still bigger thing, namely, the indomitable will of Australia. When this war, which was not of our choice or making, burst upon us, we took our stand. All sections of this House and all sections of the Australian people instantly took their stand with Great Britain, and there we Mr Anthony. shall stand unflinchingly until the end. It will cost us much in men and material, in money and effort, but that is the price which we are called upon to pay for our integrity and our existence, for our right and the right of others to live as a peaceful, civilized, Christian people. We are, fortunately, distant from the flash and thunder of hostilities, but no man with any sense of reality can doubt what would be our fate; we should be trampled upon and plundered, as others have been, were it not for the combined might of the British and French peoples. Great Britain has taken the first shock of the assault. It has held the Nazi in check in the Kattegat, in the Skager Rak, in the North Sea, with France on the Maginot Line, and with allies and near allies in I the south Balkans, where our own troops - the men of Australia, the members of the Australian Imperial Force-ar e standing ready to lend a hand to drive the Nazi back to his lair when the time to do 30 arrives. The great dominions of Canada,- Australia, New Zealand and South Africa-althoug h we all know that South Africa has its own special and particular problems-coun t for much in this war, and their combined population of twenty million-'Canad a with ten million, Australian with seven million, and New Zealand with the& million-represen t almost half as many people-4 5 millionas are contained in Great Britain itself. Between us, we possibly represent much more in resources and materials; therefore, we count for a great deal. What Australia does will either influence other dominions to be lukewarm, or encourage them to give of theii utmost. Our heln may easily prove to be the decisive factor if it is prompt, immense, and thorough, and if it serves to encourage and inspire our sister dominions, and even Great Britain itself. We are immune from the immediate shock of war. We have no imminent fear of seeing our cities bombed, or our coasts ravaged. We have no distractions. Let us, therefore, put forward our maximum effort, and throw our weight where it will most count. Above all, let us fight where the fighting has to be done, and not wait until it is brought to tis. We have, unfortunately, seen others make that mistake. Personally, I believe that an overwhelming numbe'r of Australians is behind the Government which makes that plain. 1 give this.Government the credit that it has never equivocated on that issue. Many of us would like to have seen more done than has been done. We should like to see a greater acceleration on the part of the defence authorities. The Air Department should accept the services of thousands of young men throughout this country who are becoming discouraged by the delay that is taking place. Much, however, has been done. Australia got there instantly in the economic nhase of warfare, by joining in agreements long previously planned which cut off supplies from the enemy and assured them for our allies. These arrangements are of incalculable economic and strategic value; they are the basic strategy of modern warfare. On this occasion, arrangements were completed within a few weeks which in the last war took years to complete. Australia is getting there, too, with sea, land and air forces. The Empire air scheme, in particular, will help to hold the ring which will keep the Nazi bush-fire from spreading, which will keep it in check and help to beat it back and, I trust, finally beat it out. Here at home our industrial, commercial and financial systems have rapidly been placed on a war footing. The measures already taken are enabling us gradually to increase the total weight of pressure upon the enemy. But despite all that bas been done, our effort lags proportionately far behind that of Great Britain we are still not carrying an equable share of the load. The programme that the Governor General has outlined, however, foreshadows much more that is to be done. I welcome that, and feel sure that every true Australian will be glad of it. We shall be asked to sanction expenditure and measures of a magnitude never before attained in our history. To me it is a matter of pride that we are strong enough, that we have attained such national growth and that we can rise to such undertakings. If every Australian plays his personal part as he should, adjusting his personal affairs and expenditures to his individual war effort - as I think, when he properly understands the position, he will be ready and eager to do-w e shall all be able to provide sinews of war on a record scale; and nothing less will suffice. We can and we should, in this first year of this war, rise to a financial effort as great as, if not greater than, that attained in the last year of the last war.",29
124,Mr MENZIES,DAIRYI NG A ND POULTRY,I assure the honourable gentleman that we shall do more than that.,32
125,Mr ANTHONY,DAIRYI NG A ND POULTRY,"I am glad to have that assurance. It would ill-become any man to view this as a sacrifice. Rather is it our national subscription, our union dues to the greatest union of free people the world has ever known, the price of o.ur right to strike in the only way we should strike in these days against the tyranny of a foreign dictator who not only would impair our cherished industrial standards and filch our civil liberties,' but also would challenge our very right to life itself. I hope that the programme outlined, insofar as it relates to the war, will be entered upon and carried through this Parliament with the support of all sections in this House, with constructive criticism, not only from the Opposition, but also from Government supporters, where argument is needed, and with a full and earnest realization of the duties which Australia expects us to perform. I have pleasure in seconding the motion. Debate (on motion by Mr. Curtin) adjourned. NA COMMITTEES. Mr SPEAKER laid on the table his warrant nominating Mr Badman, Mr. Collins, Mr Jennings, Mr Makin, Mr.  Rosevear to act as Temporary Chairmen of Committees when requested so to do by the Chairman of Committees. Ma. DEPUTY SPEAKER, Motion (by Mr MENZIES) agreed toThat, during the unavoidable absence of Mr Deputy Speaker, Mr Speaker be authorized to call upon any of the Temporary Chairmen of Committees to relieve him temporarily in the chair.

126,Mr MENZIES,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,"Kooyong-Prime Minister) £8.49] - I move That the House do now adjourn. Honourable members will regret to notice the absence of the Chairman of  to whose absence I moved the previous resolution. I think that I am speaking for all members ""when I say that I hope that he will be speedily recovered to health. We desire to extend the same message to my friend and former colto league, the honourable member for Eden  for a considerable time, who is, I am glad to say, making progress, and who hopes to be in his place in the House in a week or so. My suggestion about the sitting of House is that we should sit on Thursbodies, day and Friday of this week. Next week, ANZAC Day falls on Thursday. I is a close holiday and many honourable members desire to be in their electorates. That is a matter about which I shall have to talk with the Leader of has the Opposition (Mr Curtin). House might meet on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday of next week. Honorable MEMBERS - That will not give all of us an opportunity to be our electorates.",33
127,Mr MENZIES,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,"I assure honourable members that I am willing to consult convenience of all. I said to my friend, the Leader of the Opposition, that I should have to meet with him.. My own suggestion, which, in the circumstances, must be tentative, is that we meet on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday next week to enable honourable members away before Thursday. In the following week I would suggest that we meet on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. I shall discuss with the Leader of the Opposition the possibilities of alternating the we opening sitting days between Tuesday and Wednesday, as we have in previous sessions, in order to give honourable nesday only. gentlemen at every alternative week-end an opportunity to visit more distant electorates.",33
128,Mr GANDER,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,For how long 'shall we be .sitting ?,33
129,Mr MENZIES,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,We shall sit until we - finish the business.,33
130,Mr GANDER,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,When will that be?,33
131,Mr MENZIES,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,"In my more optimistic moments I think a fortnight hence, and in my less, about the end of May': but, 'between me and the honourable member, I think it will be some time in June.",33
132,Mr CURTIN,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,"Fremantle-Leade r of the Opposition) [S.52] - It is true that the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) said that he would consult ine with - respect to the sitting days next week having regard the fact that Thursday is ANZAC Day, which, in certain Slates, is invariably l l regarded as a close holiday and in any event is fittingly celebrated. The Opposition will share with members of Parliament and the public generally on ANZAC Day in paying tribute to the men of the ANZAC and, in association with other doing all that is customarily done in that respect. I think that I can Say t appropriately that ANZAC Day this year will indeed have more than usual significance, but I point out to the right honourable gentleman that, if the purpose he in mind of sitting on Wednesday and The then adjourning until the next Week, is that members of the House may share in the ceremonies in their own electorates, it is utterly impracticable, except in the case of few honourable members of this House in. and, indeed, even fewer members of another place. If it is desired that on this occasion we shall make oiir arrangethe ments with a view to enabling honourable gentlemen to visit their electorates, theii indeed we should have to adjourn on an earlier day than Wednesday. There will be a ceremony, in every way a fitting ceremony, performed here at the Seat of Government, and the members of Parliato get ment can attend that ceremony.",33
133,Mr MENZIES,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,"The honourable gentleman will realise that the alternative is to sit on Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday if are to have three sitting days.",33
134,Mr CURTIN,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,That is worse.,33
135,Mr MENZIES,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,O r Tuesday and Wed,33
136,Mr CURTIN,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,"- It would not be convenient to adjourn on Wednesday and sit again on Friday, but I merely point out IIsiit if we sit on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday SIB EAKLE PAGE -'What , about Tuesday afternoon train? Mr. Curtin' - I do not know how that would benefit the Queensland, South Australian and Tasmanian members.",33
137,Mr MENZIES,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,"It is a matter that you mid I will have to discuss. Mr. Curtin' - Any i adjournment which would be at all reasonable would still be impracticable from the viewpoint of Western Australian members. We from Western Australia can view this question with perfect detachment, because none of us will be able to share in any function, except the one that we shall attend here at the Seat of Government. But I do have regard for honourable members generally, and I feel that, if the rearrangement of next week's sittings is for the purpose of enabling members to visit their electorates, it should be such an arrangement as will ensure that the majority will he able to do so. An arrangement which will serve only honourable members from Victoria and New South Wales, whilst convenient to them, is inconvenient to members from the other Slates. The Opposition will be content if, so long as this House remains in session, sitting days are arranged by the Government, having regard to its duty to prepare the necessary measures for our consideration and for the convenience of the Administration. Whether the House sits on. three or two days next week and then adjourns, we are here to expedite the Government in carrying out the work of the country. Questiou resolved in the affirmative. PAPERS.

138,Mr MENZIES,TEMPORARY CHAIRMEN OF,"On tie 6th December, 1939, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holloway) asked me the following question, without notice :-Will the Prime Minister give immediate attention to what is a matter of serious importance to the great mass of wage-earners throughout Australia, namely, the need to make some addition to - the basic wage aa determined by the Arbitration Court, in order to offset the continuous loss which the workers ore sustaining, and must continue to suffer, during the period of "" lag"" before the basic wage is adjusted to meet the changed cost of living figures! Will the right honourable gentleman give an assurance that something will he done to avoid long debates on this subject, and so prevent the natural discontent that must develop if something is not done? On the 18th December last the F u l l Court of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration delivered judgment in this matter and reduced the "" l a g "" from two months to one month. This means, in effect, that, when the cost of living is rising, employees, receive the benefit of the increase of the basic wage one month . earlier than they did previously.",36
