4,Mr SPEAKER,PENSIONS FOR TUBERCULAR,"I have received an intimation from' the honourable member for Grampians .(Mr Jowett) that he desires to move the adjournment of the House to discuss a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely,-"" The excessive and crushing rates of ocean freight now being charged upon the exportable products of Australia."" Five honourable members having risen in their places, Question proposed. ' - ",20
5,Mr JOWETT,PENSIONS FOR TUBERCULAR,"Grampians) [2.32] In giving notice of m.Y intention to move the adjournment of the House to discuss the present excessive and crushing rates of ocean freights on Australia's exportable products, I thought I was doing my duty in taking what' seemed to me the best opportunity available to draw public attention to a very serious a-nd urgent matter. I h addition to giving you, Mr. Speaker, and the members of the Ministry, notice of my intention to take this action, I thought it only courteous to make a similar intimation to the Chairman of the . Overseas Shipping_ Companies and to the press, and I was a little surprised to read in a Melbourne news'paper yesterday a telegram from its ,Sydp ney. correspondent stating thatresentment is expressed by the representatives of the owners of overseas shipping at the report from Melbourne that Mr Jowet^, M.H.K., intends to move the adjournment of the House to discuss the excessive and crushing rates of ocean freights now being charged . . Per-lb.'Weight. upon the exportable prqducts of Australia. I do not feel in the slightest degree hurt or discouraged by the resentment thus expressed, especially since the paragraph in which the words I ""bave read appear is headed "" Overseas freights reduced from today,"" and - contains details of some reductions that have been made. If the Overseas Shipping Committee will make substantial reductions in freights every time that I incur their resentment, I shall be prepared to continue to incur . it daily for the rest, of the year. : This motion of adjournment is not to be regarded asreflecting in the remotest degree-upon thp Government or upon any member of ""it; because for some considerable time past Ministers have done everything possible to bring about a reduction [301] of freights. There has been correspondence on« the subject ibetween the Pastoralists Association and the Government.. The latter replied, on !the 16th March, to a communication sent to them by the association, and, on the '4th April, Mr Deane, the Secretary to the Prime Minister, wroteI desire to inform you that urgent representations have been made to the Ministry of Food upon' the matter, and cabled advice has now' been, received from the' High Commissionerand so on. I quote thispassage to show that the Government have done everything in their power to bring about the most necessary reductions in freights. In my. opinion, the reductions which' have been announced during the past few days, and of which a great deal has been made, are totally inadequate, as I think honourable members will agree when I have given them a brief summary of the overseas freights ruling before the war compared with those of the latest date. In order that no injustice ,niay be done to the overseas shipping authorities, I have arranged that, should they make further reductions this afternoon,' before I have finished my speech-whic h is not unlikely, remembering their promptness of the last few days- I shall announce them to the House. The following is a comparison of ocean freights before the war and at latest dates of 1921:1 'Latest May,' Eates, - Increase. 1014-.. 102E1. d. d. Per Cent.

One accompaniment of the war was an enormous increase in the prices of modities, an increase which continued without ceasing until about twelve months ago. This, of course, was due to many causes, one very potent cause, in my opinion, especially since the war ended, being the enormous increase in the paper currencies of the world.",20
6,Mr MAXWELL,PENSIONS FOR TUBERCULAR,Is it not also due to the scarcity of commodities?,21
7,Mr JOWETT,PENSIONS FOR TUBERCULAR,"To some extent that was a cause of high prices during the war, but I am not so sure, that it has been cause since. One unfortunate result the increased prices due"" to the enlargeso ment of the currency is that, like the daily or hourly dram of the drunkard, the enlargement has to be increased more and more in order to have the usual effect; it would be necessary to go on flating the currency to even keep prices where they are. Somewhere about July or August of last year prices-and I am speaking solely of wholesale prices-pro bably reached their maximum, and the world is now faced with the reaction. I refer to the lower prices which the producers, and to a lesser tent the manufacturers of commodities, are now receiving. T do not propose to deal with the somewhat more complex difficult matter of the increase of retail prices which has resulted from "" passing o n "" by various distributors. Speaking generally, the whole of the articles which I have enumerated, with, perhaps, one exception, have fallen to pre-war rates, and in some cases below.",21
8,Mr HUGHES,PENSIONS FOR TUBERCULAR,"Do you say that freights ought to depend, or do depend, on the value of the commodities carried?",21
9,Mr JOWETT,PENSIONS FOR TUBERCULAR,"The Prime Minister a has raised a very important point, and my reply is that this is not so much, my mind, a question of ethics",21
10,Mr HUGHES,PENSIONS FOR TUBERCULAR,I am not talking about ethics. This is no place to talk about ethics.,21
11,Mr JOWETT,PENSIONS FOR TUBERCULAR,"I do not agree with the honourable member as to that, but I shall confine myself to economics. I say that the producers of Australia are faced the with a world-wide fall in prices of the commodities they produce; and if the cost ^ transportation from this country to other parts of the world is not adjusted, to a reasonable extent, in relation to the prices of products, the outcome must be coman enormous falling off in the production of those things which are the life-blood of our industry and finance. I shall give instances as I go along, showing how already, in certain directions, production has become unprofitable on account of the high costs of production, including excessive charges for transportation. I need not deal further with that point just now, except to remind honourable members of our enormous liabilities abroad,- and of the colossal requirements of our people in the the way of imported commodities, which of cannot be produced here, but which we, long as our present state of civilization is maintained, will continue to demand. I refer, however, particularly to our obligations abroad, and contend that the only way in which these outside obligations can inbe met, and our imports paid for, is by the exportation of our own primary and secondary products. If we reach a stage - at which it does not pay to produce and - export, the financial and industrial position of the people of Australia will, ininevitable deed, be very serious. 0",21
12,Mr GREGORY,PENSIONS FOR TUBERCULAR,Do we not accentuate exthe position when we get no back loading?,21
13,Mr JOWETT,PENSIONS FOR TUBERCULAR,"That is a very pertiand nent question, but I suggest that the better time to discuss it will be when the Tariff is before us. The freight on frozen meat has been increased by 238 per cent., namely, from 9-16d. per lb. in May, 1914, to 1 9-10d. at the present time. I am in a position to give some very definite information as to the relative value of beef in May, 1914, and at the present time. A contract was made in March, 1914, for a large parcel of frozen beef at 27s 3d. per 100 lbs.; whereas, in March, this year, sale of beef, in exactly the same condition, and from the same properties, was to made at 25s. 6d. per 100 lbs. I am now dealing with our products that are exported, and not with local or retail prices. It has to be remembered that in addition to other increased costs freight alone has advanced by 238 per cent. I now come to another item of very considerable importance, that of rabbits and rabbit skins. As honourable members are aware, one of Adjournment. the greatest pests that has ever troubled Australia is the rabbit.",21
14,Dr MALONEY,PENSIONS FOR TUBERCULAR,It is not a pest.,22
15,Mr JOWETT,PENSIONS FOR TUBERCULAR,"If my honourable friend says that the rabbit is not a pest, I must differ from him as to what a pe3t is.",22
16,Mr HUGHES,PENSIONS FOR TUBERCULAR,I have heard persons in this Chamber called pests.,22
17,Mr JOWETT,PENSIONS FOR TUBERCULAR,"When-it comes to the personal application of that statement, I might even disagree with the Prime Minister also. One of the means by which the rabbit pest has'been kept 'down has been the enterprise and industry of the people who trap rabbits for a living. The reward for their arduous labours and privations has been the price received for carcasses and skins. I nnd that the freight on rabbit skins has increased 200 per cent., and on frozen rabbits 205 per cent. In other words, the freight on the products of the men who earn a living by trapping rabbits has been trebled. As showing what rapid changes have been made since the end of last week, when I gave notice of this motion, I find in this morning's paper the following cable from London:FREIGHT ON RABBITS REDUCED. The Australian ship-owners have agreed to reduce the freight on rabbits to 168s. per ton. The importers asked for a further reduction, but the ship-owners replied .that this was imtion possible. My calculation of an increase of 205 per cent, was based on that reduced figure mentioned in this morning's cable. I have received the following letter, which I think it only fair to read to the House:The rate of freight on rabbits is 184s. per ton, to be reduced, according to the newspapers, to 168s. per ton. Pre-war it was 5§s. per ton. It then cost about 2Jd. to land one pair of rabbits in England; now it costs about 7Jd. per pair. Exporters have asked for a rate of 130s. per ton meanwhile, in order to make business possible. The shipping companies suggest the reduction be gradual, though when increases were being made they were not made on a gradual scale; but the request for a rate of 130s - meanwhile shows the exporters of this section are prepared to recognise a gradual reduction. At 130s. the rate would still be 136 per cent, above the pre-war rate. At 130s. it is believed business could be and this would mean employment for some hundreds, if not thousands, of trappers and others,- as well as being a source of revenue to the country. Perhaps more important still is that, through the cessation of trapping, rabbits [301]- 2 [14 APRIL, 1921.J Adjournment. 7449 will largely increase, and by next year prove a greater menace than ever to many land-owners. Not only has trapping ceased for the export carcase, but rabbit skins have fallen to such a price that trappers have discontinued trapping for the skin also.",22
18,Mr HUGHES,PENSIONS FOR TUBERCULAR,My notes show that the freight charged by the Commonwealth Government Line is 55s. per ton measurement.,22
19,Mr JOWETT,PENSIONS FOR TUBERCULAR,"That figure relates to 1914. The Commonwealth Line has done magnificent work, but it has not kept the freight on. rabbit skins down to 55s.",22
20,Mr HUGHES,PENSIONS FOR TUBERCULAR,The honourable member is correct.,22
21,Mr JOWETT,PENSIONS FOR TUBERCULAR,"I now turn to the items of jam and fruit in cases. There is no more important industry in Australia at the present moment than fruit-grow ins, the success of which is dependent upon a profitable export trade in jam and tinned fruits. The freight on jam and fruit in cases has been increased from 30s. a ton in May, 1914, to 120s,, although I am under the impression that the reduction from 120s. to 105s., made on the same day as the ship-owners expressed' resentment at my action, applies to fruit in cases ",22
22,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PENSIONS FOR TUBERCULAR,It does not.,22
23,Mr JOWETT,PENSIONS FOR TUBERCULAR,"If that 13 so the posiis even worse than I have said. I have based my calculation on. the reduction to 105s., and that shows an increase in the' freight of 250 per cent, from the rate ruling in May, 1914. Only la^t week a deputation of fruit-growers waited upon us, and told us that the freight on cased goods was now £6 per ton as compared with 30s. or 35s. before the war, and also that refrigerated space for fresh fruit was costing them 8s. per case as against 2s. 9d. to 3s. before the war. One deputation assured us that they are so disheartened by the prospects that in their district many of them will not prune their apricot and pear trees this year, although they will lightly prune their peach trees. As time is limited I must leave this subject, and pass on to the question of done, wool, which in respect of total value and volume of output is one of the most important of all the Australian products. The present freights charged on wool are more than double those charged before the'-war: '' Owing to the chaotic conJ dition of the wool markets of the world' it is impossible for anybody to say what relation present prices for wool bear to those ruling before the war; so much.of the wool is unsaleable that it is idle to say that it is worth a. certain price if a buyer cannot be found. At all events, there are some kinds of wool, not of the best quality, which are now worth much less than they were before the war. Every practical farmer knows that, however good your sheep may be, and however much you look after them, the actual value of a pound of wool is very largely determined by the district in which it is grown, the nature ,of the soil, and the season. Sometimes the richest land is so infested with trefoil burr and seed that it grows what from the manufacturing point of view' is the most inferior wool. Nobody should say that a man. ought to grow better wool if the best quality pays; every man grows as good a class of wool as he possibly can. I have some startling information brought Co my attention only this morning. Fortunately, publicity was given to the fact that I intended to move, the adjournment of the House today upon this subject, and, as a consequence, I had already received voluntarily a great deal of information from most reliable people. Further communications came to hand this morning from an undoubtedly reliable source. Sixty bales of scoured and fellmongered i wool, shipped in November last per s.s. JJlysses, according to the account sales just to hand, were sold in London at an average price of 4^d. per lb. Quite apart from the price paid for the sheepskins, it cost the shipper of these 60 bales, in fellmongerihg, scouring, and in freight, 6Jd. per lb.; so that he sold the wool at 2£d. per lb. less than it cost him to fellmbnger it and ship, it .",22
24,Mr MATHEWS,PENSIONS FOR TUBERCULAR,"When they put that wool into 'the manufactured article, it costs' 4s. 6d: per lhi",23
25,Mr JOWETT,PENSIONS FOR TUBERCULAR,"The honourable member is perfectly right. In spite of the fact that some Australian wool-growers are receiving practically nothing for their wool, it is impossible for any .one in the world io buy clothes.at a reasonable price. Extension of time granted. The increased freight on sheepskins is apparently one of the most crushing of all. Before the w.ar, the rate was 75s. per ton; it is now 297s."" per ton, an increase of 296 per cent. Sheepskins are not included in the reductions recently announced. It is certainly highly desirable to have our own sheepskins fellmongered before export, providing that the sheep farmer gets the world's parity for them; but, from the example I have just given, it is .quite apparent that, at present prices, they cannot be fellmongered locally. Furthermore, obviously the. sheep farmer must look to the sheepskin exporter to obtain some recompense for the trouble of treating the skins, and for the cost he incurs in sending them to market. In regard to sheepskins, the Sydney correspondent of the Argus saysIn the case of hides, skins, tallow, copra, and certain other lines of cargo, it has heen represented to the ship-oWners that the' rates of freight have prevented business. Shippers have not complained that the rates were unreasonable, but that, owing to the great fall in the prices of their commodities, they cannot do business unless there is a great reduction in the freights. The Ship-owners' reply hag been, "" Show us what rate of freight you can do business at, and we will consider reducing it for you."" Where this had been done the ship-owners have reduced the rate accordingly, and, in one instance, space was actually offered free. It is asserted that the policy of the ship-owners right through has been to assist traders. Answering allegations about a Combine controlled by Lord Inchcape, which is slowly squeezing Australian shippers to death, the owners state that no such Combine exists. I have made no reference to any Combine, but, as this, matter has been introduced into the reply sent to me by those persons who resent my taking steps in this direction in the House, I think I am justified in introducing it now. The article proceeds:The number of companies under the direction of Lord Inchcape does not account for more bhan a decimal fraction of the tonnage trading to Australia. The information brought to me yesterday from a most reliable source-fro m ' people who understand what they are talking aboui>-doe s not bear out the view taken by this writer. This is what they say in regard to the statement that there is no CombineMr Jowett intends to move the adjournment pf the House to consider the excessive and crushing rates of oversea freights now being charged upon the exportable products tralia. We have been moving in this matter for some weeks past, without success. Inquiries made by us among individual shipping companies go to show that if the Combine give them permission they would willingly duce the freights at the present (time for offers of cargo made to them. As a matter of fact, we have offered big parcels, of vided the rate is reduced, but there are takers. The position, as you know, particustatement larly with hides and sheepskins, is that vast quantities are practically valueless, for reason that excessive freight rates prohibit export. Our company alone would purchase hundreds of thousands of sheepskins port them if the rate was anywhere within reason. Such skins would be unsuitable local fellmongers, even if they got them nothing. We want you to make a point seeing Mr Jowett before the matter comes for discussion in the House, and; if necessary, show him the enclosed letter. Please wire promptly if you have been successful in interhave viewing Mr Jowett, or otherwise, as we to act promptly in the matter. We would much prefer, however, that the handling this matter remains with him.",23
26,Mr SPEAKER,PENSIONS FOR TUBERCULAR,The honourable memI ber's extended time has expired.,24
27,Mr HUGHES,PENSIONS FOR TUBERCULAR,"Bendigo-Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [3.8] While I regret that the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) has not been able to conclude his remarks, I think he has placed sufficient facts before the Chamber to enable honourable members to discuss the matter intelligently. I question which affects the whole comsome munity very seriously. Australia pends upon the sale of its products seas for the income upon which its people live. The honourable member claims freights are exorbitant, and that they prevent the exportation of goods that would association,, otherwise find a ready sale. He has Zealand quoted sheepskins and fruit, and given us the impression that what he has said in regard to these two items applies to all glad commodities. At any rate, it applies to rabbits, because the honerable member placed emphasized that point. I propose with the question without reflecting in way upon the shipping companies who are engaged in this trade along with Commonwealth Line. I have expressed my own view on the matter very plainly on many ' occasions, and the extent which my views have been supported in the press is perfectly well known to honourable member. This position, howmy ever, is an almost negligible factor when of Ausit comes to determining the rate of freight from Australia to the United Kingdom'or other parts of the world. I would shall deal with the matter, as far as I recan in the very limited time at my disfirm posal, by a reference, to figures. The honfreight proorable member for Grampians (Mr. no Jowett) has sought to show, both by direct and by inference, that, as the the prices of the commodities which Australia produces fall, so ought freights to fall. That contention, however, will not and exbear examination for a moment.' In for order to judges what should be the rates for for. carrying goods from here to the of markets of the world, we must have reup gard to the cost of running the vessels us upon which those goods are placed. We to consider what is the relative cost wish of taking goods from here to England of now as compared with the cost in 1914"". The value of the goods carried is material only in so far as it affects the producer. t is not a ground upon which to found a charge of exploitation against the shipowner.",24
28,Mr JOWETT,PENSIONS FOR TUBERCULAR,I did not do that.,24
29,Mr HUGHES,PENSIONS FOR TUBERCULAR,"Yer y well. First-of all, let me say that I have used every means at the disposal of the Government to secure a reduction in freights, and to secure freight for refrigerated produce. t is a The honourable member has given me credit for that, and I think I am deentitled to read the following letter, overwhich I sent to the chairman of the Oversea Shipping Representatives Assothat ciation on the 7th inst.:It has come to my knowledge that your which controls rates from New as well as from Australia, contemplates a reduction in freight from the former country to] the United Kingdom. I shall be to have an assurance from you that, in the . event of such reduction, Australian shippers and primary producers will not be in 'a position less favourable than the to deal producers of New Zealand. any On Tusday last I received a reply to the effect that the association had decided the that the reduction made in the case of .New Zealand should apply to Australia. Every honourable member who has apto plied to me, either directly or through my office, knows that I . have not wasted a every moment in making application, nor has application lacked emphasis or force, The position, however, has to be looked at from the stand-point of the shipcombine owner. I shall not refer to the Oommonshipping. wealth Line. I shall say nothing at all about it. It speaks for itself. I cannot rise to deal with a question of this as if T were a petty hucksterer wishing advertise my particular wares at the exwant a reduction"" pense of any one else. This is a great must live. national question, and I want to $eal with it on that basis. I think I may say, ing the vessels. however, that it may be taken for granted that the existence of the Commonwealth Line has not been the means of increasing freight. Let us consider what are the charges incidental to the running of a vessel now as compared with 1914. Taking as example the operating expenses of a reand cent round voyage as compared with war rates on the same steamer in 1914, the percentages of increase are as follow: - Por t charges, 137 per cent.; cargo charges, 165 per cent.; coal, 172 per cent.; wages, 166 per cent.; other expenses, 255 ner cent. The aggregate operating expenses of the same steamer in connection with a recent round voyage as compared with 1914, just prior to the war, show an increase of 197 per cent., or £3 today for every £1 during the war period of 1914. As against this, the fair. earnings of the same steamer show an increase pf only 165 per cent, pared with the earnings in 1914 just prior to the war. It will therefore be seen by honourable members that, from the ship-owners' point of view, their running expenses have gone up to a very much, greater extent than is counterbalanced by the freights. The honourable member for Grampians .has to face that position. need not remind him of what he will know: that today the ports of Britain are crowded with vessels. I am no desaid, fender of combines. It is alleged that there is no combine, so that-we need not attack that which does not exist;- but with the meat of the Argentine. Britain is surrounded by competitors who, if they destroy her mercantile supremacy, will inflict upon us here infinitely harm than even a combine could do. have always been an opponent of comUnited bines. I am now, and I have erected what in my opinion is the only effective means of dealing with this particular combine; but I"" am not condemning that Mr Hughes. irom the stand-point of British Where the charges are high they must show us that they are justified by their running expenses. Nothing less kind than that will satisfy us. If they do to that, then of what avail is it to say, "" We They, too, like us, I come now to the cost of provisionThe British Chamber of Commerce has compiled oflicial statistics which I commend to the attention of honourable members. These official statistics show that on nine voyages made by steamers during the year 1913-14 the cost of provisions totalled £1,984, whilst for the year 1919-20 the cost was £7,667. an In running, exclusive of' management depreciation, it cost £46,165 in the preyear 1913-14, and £77,505 in 1919-20. Thus the total cost of running and provisioning covering nine voyages : in 1913-14 was £48,149, as against £185,172 for nine voyages in 1919-20. running On the earning side the increase may be taken as 165 per cent, in 1920 over 1913, while the increase, adding provisions and running costs together, was 285 per cent. We must judge by comparison whether as a matter of prefact we are paying more than what is Ma. MCWII.I.IAMS -'When the comas combine supplied these figures",24
30,Mr HUGHES,PENSIONS FOR TUBERCULAR,"They were not supplied by the combine. They are official statistics compiled by the British' Chamber of Commerce. Let me now deal with freights. From the Argentine to the United Kingdom the raje for frozen beef is 1-Jd. per lb., and from Australia to the United Kingdom l£d. per lb. Seeing I that the mileage from Australia to the United Kingdom is nearly twice as great as that from the Argentine, it cannot be comparatively speaking, that the Australian rate is excessive, or that it puts us out of the running in our competition The ship-owners are not to blame because the price of frozen beef is low, or because the more wool market is disorganized. A steamer I trading between the Argentine and the Kingdom will make two and a half voyages to one made by a steamer trading between Australia and the United Kingdom, so that the Australian rate to be the equivalent of the Argentine rate would have to exceed it by l j d . per lb. I merely mention the fact that Australia has Commonwealth Line of Government steamers, while the Argentine has not. The freight to Java on general cargo '75s. and on flour 50s. It cannot be that there has been no reduction to the East. Recently all lines reduced the rate on flour by 33 per cent. It was been. 75s. The grain rate to the United dom was in 1920 for wheat, 120s., and now 57s. 6d.; for barley, 140s., and now 68s.; and for oats, 160s., and is 88s. According to the Auditor-General's report for 1920, the ascertained profits 13th September, 1919, on all the overseas voyages of the controlled panies. shipping lines was £261,347, and the loss on coastal trade £301,189, a net deficiency of £39,842. The Shipping Control Committee's expenditure for the half year was £7,356, and the net loss for the period £212,554. Auditor-General says that on the 23rd August, 1920, it was reported that, with the exception of one vessel, all the today. ships requisitioned had been handed back to their respective owners. On 31st March, 1920, the profit on oversea voyages was orable £260,461, and the loss on coastal voyages £371)208, the net loss for the half year being £110,747. Archibald Hurd, ing in the London Daily Telegraph, says that the extent to which rates have been recently reduced may be shown as folwas lows :Eiver Plate to United Kingdom, Marcli, 190a.; September, 105s.

If time permitted, I would go into this bark upon a comprehensive scheme of matter at greater length, but there is point that stands out: the cost of ning a vessel has, like everything gone up, and short of a subsidy to the primary producers which would place them in their pre-war position, there is Dock scandals. no way out of the present difficulty unless and until vessels can be run at a lower cost.

That there is a combine is indisowners' putable. The shipping companies of the world are today members of a icombine of which Lord Inchcape is the head. The honourable member for Grampians showed how powerful is this combine, large its profits. The Prime Minister replied that a comparison, of running penses showed that their profits were not so great today as in 1914 - The question, however, is, Were their profits too high in 1914? They were then making undue profits -, and it is no defence because their working expenses are now larger their profits are not so were too heavy in 1914, and are too big now. It is general knowledge that the shipping companies have been making enormous profits. . The Prime Minister said not long ago that the profits of the Commonwealth ' steamers were so great that in three years they wiped off the capital. cost of £2,50.0,000. What, then, must have been the profits of the private companies? Mr Bonar Law said in the House of Common's that, having purwhich chased 8,000 shares from ""two snipping companies, he received in two years diviState; dends equalling the original purchase money.",27

What we have heard today, combined with what we know ourselves, is a complete answer to the Prime M in ister in his attempt to show, on behalf of the shipping companies, that they are losing instead of gaining.",27

The Moor Line announces a dividend of 25 per cent., compared with 12i per cent, last year. The - profits amounted to £374,248, exceeding the capital. The Statist estimates shipnet gainslast year at 575 per cent, higher than in 1913, after paying half their surplus to the Treasury.",27
41,Mr MAXWELL,PENSIONS FOR TUBERCULAR,"Are all the big increases to the shipping companies' fleets and how made out of their losses1  exfacts are so well known as to need no .emphasis. I thought it well to quote the statement of Mr Bonar Law, for it has remained in my memory as an illustration of the immense profits that the shipto say that ping companies make.",27
42,Mr MAXWELL,PENSIONS FOR TUBERCULAR,"Mr Bonar Law was great. They ashamed of the dividends.  I do not know of anything more important to the great bulk of our producers than the question we are now discussing; and I dare say that there is not an honourable member but who is desirous of seeing an end of the present state of affairs, and Some tangible remedy found. Some years ago the Western Australian Labour Government chartered a line of steamers, was called a State-owned; line, to trade with the northern parts of that and there are irrefutable figures to show that one result of this venture was a great reduction in freights to the primary producers. At that time hardly any one outside of the Government concerned had a good word for that line-of although the result of its creation was what I have stated. Then, in Queensland lately, the Government bave chartered vessels to carry produce to and the n o r t h ; and there, again, we find a reduction in freights, very gratifying to the primary producers of that State. In - my opinion, . it is along these lines that the remedy lies. I a d m it ' that it is not an easy problem to solve, but if we desire results, - we must get down to "" t i nthe tacks."" It would, of course, be useless or impossible to get another section of private enterprise to step in and compete with the present companies, for we kngw what the inevitable result would be- a re-formation of the happy family. The only remedy is for the Commonment, wealth tb enter into the business itself.",27

A loss on one year's operations does not by any means prove the venture to be a failure; there might be a loss of, say, £2,000, but we have to consider the many thousands of pounds that the presence of these steamers on the coast put into the pockets of the producers. I do not call such a venture a failure if there is a loss on the running of the vessels cause, as I say, we have to bear in mind the number of people benefited.",28

It is not quite fair for the honourable member for Hume  honourable member for Grampians with not having proposed a remedy, because, as we know, the honourable member's time expired before he had said all he desired. I have held for very many years that the shipping of the world today is dominated by the Inchcape Shipping Combine, which has purchased practically the whole of the line3 running, not only to Australia, but running in Australian waters. As an example, I may say that the boats running to Tasmania are in the [302] all Inchcape Combine. I have put on the notice-paper for tomorrow the question, ""Has an arrangement, or any agreebeen entered into by the overseas Combine and the Commonwealth Line of Here is a statement which appeared in today's newspapersIn announcing the reductions, it was stated behalf of the owners that the task of the schedule had been most difficult.

We have the extraordinary ""fact that the freights of the Commonwealth Line always go up and down exactly on a par with the freights of the Combine.

56,Mr COKSEB,PENSIONS FOR TUBERCULAR,That is a very unjust statement! Mr RICHARD. FOSTEB - And a very unfair one!,29
57,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PENSIONS FOR TUBERCULAR,"I am dealing with the freights charged on the Anstralian-owned ships. Two days ago I asked the Minister controlling shipping what' Commonwealth boats had carried fruit from Australia during the present season, and what was the price charged; and I was informed that the price was Ss. per case. This is the price fixed by the Inchcape Combine- a fact hard to get away from.",29
58,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PENSIONS FOR TUBERCULAR,"Does that not suggest that, if the Commonwealth Line is not making inordinate profits, therefore, the Inchcape Line is not making an ipordinate charge? ' Mr MCWILLIAMS - I have been asked to be fair, and I am trying to be. I know that the cost ofrunning ships has enormously increased; everything connected with shipping, from sails to wages, and dock charges to insurance, has been increased in cost, very largely in some cases, as compared with the period before the war. But I say that the prices charged before the war enabled nearly every one of the companies trading to Australia to practically renew their fleet out of the profits made. We have the fact, as stated to me in the House two days ago, that the freight on a - 40-lb. case of fruit from Australia to England is 8s., whereas in 1914 the cost was 2s. 3d. to 2s. 9d.",29
59,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PENSIONS FOR TUBERCULAR,"It was more than that, I think, in 1914.",29
60,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PENSIONS FOR TUBERCULAR,"No , that was the freight at that time. What the honourable member for Grampians has . said is quite true; and if any industry in Australia is suffering today, it is the f r u it 1 enough. industry. Some time ago, I went with the honourable member for Echuca (Mr. Hill ) through the Goulburn Valley, and it was, indeed, pitiful to see the splendid fruit rotting on the ground. May I say here that if it had not been for the assistance given by the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook), some 5,000 or 6,,000 tons of I peaches would have rotted in Goulburn Valley alone. I am trying to be fair; but we Sannot forget the high' freights that are charged today as the result of an unholy alliance. What disturbs me more than anything is that, whoever dictates the freights as between Australia and England, tliose charged on the Commonwealth Line go up and down according to a scale fixed. No one knows who fixes the scale, and we ought to know. Mr. Larkin, the manager of the Commonwealth Line in England, has said on more than one occasion that it is not the policy of the Government to enter into a rcight war with the Comf bine. I submit that that is the very object for which the Commonwealth Line of vessels was created, and for which it is kept in existence. When we think that the freights of the shipping companies are too high, then there should be.a war of freights.",29

62,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PENSIONS FOR TUBERCULAR,May I say that there are honourable members on this side who would give all the assistance possible in such a case.,29
63,Mr JAMES PAGE,PENSIONS FOR TUBERCULAR,Jowett' s gun is not loaded; he is only letting off fireworks. Mr MoWILLIAMS - Eve r since the honourable member for Grampians entered this House he has been fighting the Shipping Combine. When I was fighting the Combine I received more help from him than from the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr James Page).,29
64,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PENSIONS FOR TUBERCULAR,"What is the honourable member's remedy? Mr MoWILLIAMS - The Commonwealth Line should fix fair and reasonable rates of freight. If the Commonwealth is not big enough to fight the Combine on the freight question, it is time we went out of the business, and allowed somebody to come in who is big Having regard to the slump which.has come in meat and hides, and.is coming in wheat, unless we can get our produce conveyed to Europe at something like a reasonable price, much lower than it is today, ruin must come to the producers. This matter is not one which affects this party or that. It affects not only the primary producers, but the whole financial stability of the Commonwealth. As the mover of the motion has said, .the only thing which enabled Australia to pay interest on her bills during the last five or six years was her export trade in those things taken out of and off the land. Although some honourable members speak harshly of the wool growers, it is nothing less than t financial disaster that there should be, as - stated by the honourable member for Grampians { Mr Jowett), something like 4,000,000 bales of wool carried over, and representing from £70,000,000 to £80,000,000. Instead of that amount being distributed in Australia, much of it will be represented by overdrafts bearing interest at 7 per cent. That is a serious position. Everything we are producing today is low in price; except wheat and milk, there is no primary product that is being sold at a price which covers the cost of production. We cannot allow the high freights to continue. A freight charge of 8s. per bushel case of apples is nothing more or less than piracy and high-sea robbery. The black flag with the skull and cross-bone3 is what the Shipping Combine should be flying. The only hope we have is the competition of the Commonwealth Line of steamers, and if that line is to work by arrangement with the Combine, the primary oroducers will be at the mercy of Tiberius.",29
65,Mr MATHEWS,PENSIONS FOR TUBERCULAR,"Melbourne Ports) {3.55] - I should like to settle this matter in a few moments. I am pleased that the question of freights has been raised' by a member of the'Country party. The farmers are always fond of a little bit of Socialism if it suits them, but they do not care to give much to the poor unfortunates in my'electorate. The honourable member for Eranklin (Mr MCWilliams) has complained of a freight charge of 8s. for a case of apples. There is not enough refrigerated space in the Commonwealth Line of steamers to carry all the Australian fruit to the Old World, so that if the whole of the Commonwealth freight were made available, most of the fruit would still have to be handled by the Combine. The honourable member said that the Commonwealth Line should lower its freights. If that were done, and my fruit went to England for 6s. per case, and the honourable member were charged by the Combine 8s. per case, he would grumble. The only satisfactory solution, therefore, is for the Commonwealth to carry the whole of the fruit. We can-, not build the requisite number of ships in time. We must charter sufficient ships to carry the whole of the Australian produce to Great Britain. After we have done that, and lowered the freights, the Inchcape Combine will come into competition and reduce their freights still lower in order to beat us. And the producers will, thereupon, rush their goods into the. ships of the Combine, the chartered ships will go to the wall, and the whole undertaking - will then be pointed to as another instance of the failure of State enterprise!",30
66,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PENSIONS FOR TUBERCULAR,We may sign our contract for five years.,30
67,Mr MATHEWS,PENSIONS FOR TUBERCULAR,"I know all about signed contracts. Every time an attempt has been made to socialize any public utility the private combines have fought the Government undertaking with lower charges. The people msh the lower charges, and the State enterprise is wiped out. Another example of the folly of Socialism! If the Government were to charter sufficient ships to carry all Australia's exportable commodities, the Shipping Combine is strong enough to fight us with lower prices. When that happened would the producers refuse to avail themselves of the cheap rates? Honourable members may talk of making an arrangement for a number of years; but how can it be done?",30
68,Mr BELL,PENSIONS FOR TUBERCULAR,The Commonwealth Line crjuld answer the Combine with a further reduction of freights.,30
69,Mr MATHEWS,PENSIONS FOR TUBERCULAR,And make the „ chartered ships a worse losing proposition?,30
70,Mr BELL,PENSIONS FOR TUBERCULAR,But the producer would get the benefit of the freights.,30
71,Mr MATHEWS,PENSIONS FOR TUBERCULAR,"The honourable  tried to show that, even though there had been & loss on the ships operated by the Western Australian Government, the enterprise had been beneficial to the growers and consumers of meat; but we heard not a word about that when we were assailed on account of that instance of the alleged failure of Government enterprise. If cheaper freights were offered by the Inchcape Combine in their endeavour to defeat the chartered ships, the primary producers and exporters would not remain loyal to the Australian Government. What is the use of honourable members making suggestions without indicating what they are prepared to do to defeat the «Inchcape Combine? ' They will get every assistance from honourable members on this side in inaugurating a Socialistic shipping enterprise. I know that the shipping charges are too high, and it is impossible for things to continue as they are today. The honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) will show that some of our minerals, cannot be exported on account of the high freights. If the stoppage of the export of certain commodities would lead to the expansion of some of our local trades, such as fellmongering, I would hail the existing conditions with joy; but it does not have that effect. On the contrary, it helps to defeat the particular trade I have mentioned. If the members of the Country party and Government supporters desire to embark upon a'Socialistic venture in the shape of Government control of shipping, we will help them; but we require also the assistance and loyalty of those who sent them to this House in order to make it a success. A Government, enterprise could not succeed if , as soon as the Inchcape Combine lowered its charges in order to squeeze the Government out of the market, the producers transferred their support to them.",30

The question raised by the honourable member for Grampian3 (Mr. Jowett)* concerns mainly oversea shipping, but coastal shipping was mentioned again and again by the honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams), who made certain erroneous statements. have repeatedly corrected him on other occasions, and I say once more that the coastal shipping companies submitted the whole of their figures to the Select Committee on the Sea Carriage of Goods, and their statements were confirmed by Admiral Clarkson in behalf of the - Government, and Mr Eva, the local manager of the Commonwealth Shipping Line. hope I shall not have to repeat that correctionf again. It is the duty of every v honourable member who served on that Select Committee to see that justice is done to all parties. In regard to the question at issue today, I have been waiting to hear a . remedy proposed. We are exceedingly fortunate that already there has been a slump in freights, which have decreased by from 60 per cent, to 70 per cent. I wish they would fall further, but we must tackle the problem from a practical point of view in such a way as to bring us back gradually from abnormal and artificial conditions to normal conditions. The solution cannot be found in any other way.",31

74,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,PENSIONS FOR TUBERCULAR,"It will be a slow process, and it will not be completed in a month or a year. The same remark applies to the high cost of living. Certain figures have been submitted by the Prime Minister today, which not merely tell against the capitalistic or. monopolistic party, but apply all round. The Select Committee on the Sea Carriage of Goods received ample evidence as to what was responsible for the increased shipping charges. When those charges are fairly tackled, and reductions made all round, there will be a howl-of opposition from honourable members on the Opposition side as well as from the monopolists.",31

It is useless for honourable members opposite to talk platitudes in the country electorates. If we are to face the existing problems, let us face them fairly and squarely, and admit' that if freights are to be reduced, they can be reduced only by fair reductions all .1 round. When we are back to normal conditions, everybody will be better off than under abnormal conditions.",31
77,Mr JAMES PAGE,PENSIONS FOR TUBERCULAR,Maranoa) [4.4] I was pleased indeed to listen to - the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr. Richard Foster). He is the latest public apologist for the Inchcape Shipping Combine. I Mr RICHARD FOSTER - I have never apologized in my life.,31
78,Mr JAMES PAGE,PENSIONS FOR TUBERCULAR,"The honourable member has done nothing else but apologize for the Shipping Combine, whose claws are at the throats of shippers throughout the Commonwealth. Another apologist for the Combine is the Treasurer. The honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) deserves the thanks of the country for having brought before the House the subject of oversea freights. But his gun is not loaded; he merely makes a noise with blank cartridge. As the honourable member for Perth (Mr Eowler) has told them times us. out of number, the Country party have the remedy in their own hands; but they choose to do nothing. Last year they took the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) to task for having spent £10,000,000 without the authority of Parliament, but he told honourable members that they ought to thank God that he had done it, because thereby the whole of the Commonwealth had escaped from the tentacles of a Shipping Combine. Now we find that the Commonwealth Line of Steamers is in that Combine as much as any other line of steamers, but if the Country £arty are merely going to shoot fireworks the Government are perfectly safe. The honourable member for Franklin (Mr MCWilliams) has ' pointed out that, whereas the freight on fruit before the war was not higher than 2s. 93. per case to the United Kingdom, today it is 8s. per case. What would happen if any member on this side of the House moved that the freights chargeable by the Commonwealth Line of Steamers should be reduced to the normal conditions applying before the war?",32
79,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PENSIONS FOR TUBERCULAR,Does the honourable member think it possible to get back to those conditions with the present cost of labour and the other high charges?,32
80,Mr JAMES PAGE,PENSIONS FOR TUBERCULAR,"No , I do not expect it ; but can the Treasurer say the charges have gone up to an extent that would justify imposing a rate of 8s. per case for fruit to the Old Country? - Sir JOSEPH COOK - I do not know. I can only say that there are no abnormal profits being made by the Commonwealth Line of Steamers on the overseas trade.",32
81,Mr JAMES PAGE,PENSIONS FOR TUBERCULAR,"But ""we do not want to make profits. We want to carry the produce of the primary producer[303] his wool, tallow, hides, skins, - fruit, butter, &c, but not to make a - profit in doing so.. We have enough business to keep our own boats employed.",32
82,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PENSIONS FOR TUBERCULAR,"That is not the point. The honourable member complains that the shippers are fleecing the people here, but that remark cannot apply to the Commonwealth Line of Steamers.",32
83,Mr JAMES PAGE,PENSIONS FOR TUBERCULAR,The Commonwealth Line of Steamers charge the same freights as the others do who fleece,32
84,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PENSIONS FOR TUBERCULAR,"Eve n supposing we do charge the same freights, all I can say is that the charge does not express itself in the shape of inordinate profits. Mr JAMES' PAGE - All I can say is that the Commonwealth are in the Combine just as much as other ships are. The Prime Minister told me yesterday that my education as a mathematician had been neglected, but the facts as they present themselves to me are that wool was conveyed to the United Kingdom in 1914 for less than half the cost today. The Prime Minister' told us that he - bought the Commonwealth steamers because he was far-seeing enough to realise that there would be a general combination of shipping throughout the world which would so manipulate freights as to bring injury to the primary producers of Australia. To that sentiment the Corner party said "" Hear, hear!""; in fact, they tendered him a dinner, and some of them helped to subscribe £25,000 for him for what he had done. The honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) is a member of the Pastoralists Union, one of the biggest Combines in Australia, and he does exactly what the other fellow is doing. When the other man puts the screw on he seeks to have his freights that reduced. When I saw the announcement in the press that the honourable member intended to move the adjournment of the House today, I realized at once that it meant nothing, and that the motion would go the way of all other adjournment motions; it would end in smoke.",32
85,Mr EJEEY,PENSIONS FOR TUBERCULAR,He would not take a vote upon it?,32
86,Mr JAMES PAGE,PENSIONS FOR TUBERCULAR,There is no danger of that. The Country party will watch him very carefully to see that he does not .call for a division.,32

No one who followed him has sheep suggested any. I cannot see how we bring the overseas shipping combine to their knees, and no one has suggested how - Mr JOWETT it ' can be done, but. as the honourable member for Grampians is very largely terested in wool, it has occurred to that there is a way in which his industry mentioued. could be protected to a considerable extent. Before the drought Australia had 93,000,000 sheep, Russia 72,000,000, the United States of America 48,000,000, and Argentine 43,000,000. Two Australian sheep will produce the value of woo] that can be produced by three sheep Russia. It is clearly evident that have a control of a vast quantity the of the raw material for the woollen manufacturing industry; and why should we not manufacture it here so that the manufactured .article could bear the cost of freight overseas ? It could do i far more easily than can o'ir raw material. Mr Stirling Taylor, Director of the of freight. Bureau of Commerce and Industry, writing on the 26th February, 1920, saidAlthough there may be difficulties, there is no real obstacle in the way of the greater part of the Australian clip being treated, namely, turned into woollen goods, in Australia. Then he pointed out that to treat 200,000,000 lbs. of greasy wool, representing one-third of the clip, and turn it into worsteds, woollens, and .all kinds of piece goods, cloth, flannel, and blankets, would require, bn the authority of leading woollen millers, an expenditure ' of £50,000 foiland, £3,200,000 for buildings, £600,000 for power (including heat and light),, and £10,000,000 for plant, the total being £13,850,000. If each of the S0,000 wool-growers supplying wool the Central Wool Committee contri-'buted £ 2 0 0 , a sum of £16,000,000 could raised for the purpose of dealing with our wool clip. Of course, the contribution would not be on a flat rate. Each to individual would subscribe according to the number of sheep he held. If we complain of the difficulty of getting our products shipped at anything like the pre-war rate, we must try some means of achieving that object. I recommend the member for Grampians to in n - vestigate the scheme T have put forward, and see whether it could not be adopted. It might be possible in this way to do a away with the threats that the flocks of of Australia will be largely depleted can unless some alteration is made! - I am a member of the Bureau to which the honourable member inhas referred, and I have done everything me possible to forward the objects' he has",33

The profit to be made upon manufacturing the in wool would be distributed among those we who subscribed the.money to inaugurate scheme, and if the subscribers are the producers themselves, then they would be deriving a profit out of a secondary in dustry. I think it is our duty to endeavour to find remedies for existing disabilit ties in respect of getting our goods to the other side of the world at reasonable rates  personally indebted to the honourable . member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) for having brought this matter before House this afternoon. Even if no definite solution of the difficulty has been prosituation, pounded by honourable members who nave spoken, the time devoted to the debate not been lost, since it will serve at least demonstrate to the House the under which Australia labours in marketing her primary products in competition with other parts of the world.

The costs that are heaping up un the Shipping Combine, and which, as the Prime Minto ister has been able to show, are very great, have also been piling up on other industries; but while the Shipping bine is able to pass' on such increased costs, there are primary industries Australia which are quite unable to do If the export of those commodities to which the honorablo member for Gramthe pians (Mr Jowett) has referred is made unprofitable because of the increased of production and the charges which are laid upon them, they will simply go of production, because it will become utterly impossible for us to compete other countries. Honourable members will have read the statement made by Presia dent Harding, as published in this morning's newspapers, in which he wisely recognises that primary production is the principal and fundamental thing for the United States of America. He regards most seriously the fact that primary production there is costing so much that Russia, the Argentine, and other countries can export their produce America and outdo the local producers. He has, therefore, decided to give primary industries the benefit of heavy protective duties as a natural corollary to the heavy Protection given to the manuhas factured products of the country. The fact that oiie section of industry was tected, while the other was not, brought him to the conclusion which is reported in the press this morning. I do not regard as likely to be effective ward. the remedy suggested by the honourable [303]- 2 I am member for Melbourne Ports (Mr. Mathews) for the matters complained of by the honourable member for Grampians; the The fleet of vessels which we now have has had no appreciable' effect - on the and, if our ships of the future are to cost us what we are paying for has them today, we shall not be able to comto pete, in the matter.of ship construction, disability with other countries'.",33
91,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PENSIONS FOR TUBERCULAR,"The Labour party say, "" Go further "" in the matter of shipbuilding in Australia, while the press say,  there are certain; honourable membprs, as well as people who are not honourable in this Australia of ours, who are prepared advocate the manufacture of certain things in the Commonwealth, uo matter what they cost, as long as some one elBe Comwill pay for them. Possibly there will be an opportunity to-, increase our fleet in either by chartering or purchasing addiso. tional vessels, but the evidence we hav'e in regard to the little fleet now owned by Commonwealth rather inclines us to the belief that they are in the Shipping cost Combine. A great many people in Australia, provided we got a big fleet, would out sympathize with the Combine as long as shipping construction could go on in Auswith tralia. Some people do not seem to care what a primary producer has to pay for plough as long as that plough is made in Australia. Their chief consideration is that everything should be manufactured here. The fact that in their desire to give effect to that.principle they may render it more difficult for our farmers to compete with the primary producers of the Argentine is of uo concern to some' Australians; they care not whether Austo tralia goes out of primary production, and consequently is deprived of the means the of obtaining more money from abroad. I am glad, however, that this question been brought up, because the discussion will aid some people to recognise the proposition in which Australia is gradually being placed in competition with other countries. We are face to face with a most serious problem, and if things continue as at present, we shall come to a dead-end before we get much further forQuestion-That the motion be agreed '-o - put .
