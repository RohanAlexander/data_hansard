1,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"I wish to know from the Minister of Defence if he has read the cablegram in today's papers, in which it is stated that Mr Ramsay Macdonald, M.P.,"" 'speaking at Stepney last night, averred - his belief that Australians are preparing to build a navy to fight Japan? Is it the policy of the Government to build a navy, and have Ministers discussed in Cabinet the possibility of having to fight Japan?",15
2,Mr EWING,Unknown,"The Prime Minister will shortly explain to Parliament the policy of the Government in regard to the con.struction of an Australian Navy. If a navy is built, it will, of course, always be available for use against the enemies of Australia. It is to be hoped that we shall have no enemies, but if we are attacked, and have a navy to defend us, it is to be presumed that it will do its duty.",15
3,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"Will the Treasurer take steps to correct mischievous statements such as I have referred to, which are calculated to disturb and disrupt the peaceful relations of friendly nations? SiT WILLIAM LYNE - I think that it would be ibest to take no notice of the matter.",15
4,Mr HENRY WILLIS,Unknown,"Despit e the curt reply given by the honourable gentleman to the important question which I have asked, 1 still ask whether there is any ground for the rumour that the Government proposes to build a navy to fight a friendly nation? Currency has been given to it by a member of the House of Commons, who spoke as one in authority, possessing a knowledge of the facts.",15
5,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,The honourable member might ask a sensible question. The Government know nothing about what Mr. Ramsay Macdonald has said. The honourable gentleman must know that Ministers have no such idea in their minds as that PAPERS. imputed to them. The answer of the Minister of Defence was a very proper one. Ordinance TRUNDLEMAIL SERVICE .,15
6,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"Has the attention of the Postmaster-General been drawn to a telegram from New South Wales, published in this morning's Argus, in which what is termed a curious instance of lack, of enterprise on the part of the Postal Department is commented on ? It appears that Trundle, an important centre in a mining and farming district of the Calare division, has to depend for mail communication upon a coach service, although trains have been running there for at least two months past. If he is aware of the circumstance, will he give reasons for the continuance of this arrangement, and inform the House how long it is to continue ?",15
7,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I do not admit lack of enterprise on the part of the Postal Department. Very often hundreds of pounds are saved by using coaches for the conveyance of mails instead of paying for their carriage by train. The whole subject is to be considered - in Conference next week, and I hope that a satisfactory arrangement will then be made with the Railways Commissioners. TELEPHONE DIRECTORIES.",15
8,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"I would like to ask the Postmaster-General whether he is aware that a good deal of inconvenience is being .caused by the changing of telephone numbers and the non-issue of new directories? Will he take steps to issue the new directories as soon as possible, so that subscribers may know the telephone numbers of those with whom they wish to .communicate ? My own telephone number has been changed. .",15
9,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I am not aware of the facts; but in view of possible complications and the strange rumours which are current, I shall make all necessary inquiries-. NA",16
10,Mr MAHON,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Will he lay on the table a copy of the nance of the Legislative Council of Papua permitting the removal in certain cases of aboriginal natives from the Territory? 2. Whence and for what purpose are the natives to be removed ? 3. Can he say whether, pending, the approval of Ordinances by the Governor General, it is usual for the local administration to take action under such Ordinances?",16
11,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"In reply to the honourable member's questions, I beg to state1. Yes. It is the practice to lay copies of Ordinances on the table as soon as possible after assent is given, and this would have been done yesterday but for the delay of the Government Printer in supplying copies. 2. A copy of an explanatory memorandum by the Acting Administrator is furnished for the information of the House. when intimating the fact of the Governor General's assent to the local authorities, an instruction was issued that the Ordinance was to be availed of only in special cases, and that all instances where permits were granted should be reported to the Department of External Affairs. 3. In cases where Ordinances are reserved for the assent of the Governor General, it is not lawf u l for the local Administrator to take action on them pending communication of His Excellency's decision. COMMONWEALTH YEAR-BOOK.",16
12,Mr MCDONALD,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"the Minister representing the Minister of Home Affairs, upon notice I. Has a contract been let for the Commonwealth Year-Book? 2. Was any tender asked for or received from any of the State Government P-rinting Offices? 3. On whose recommendation did the Minister act when deciding to have the work done outside of one or other of the State Government Printing Offices? 4: Will the Minister lay upon the table of the House all papers in connection with the said contract ?",16
13,Mr MAUGER,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"The answers to the honourable member's* questions are as folyou, upon noticelow :1. Yes. 2. In addition to the advertisement in the Commonwealth Gazette, and lea'ding newspapers, a special letter was written to the Government - Printer of each State, but none of them forwarded' atender. The Government Printer of Melbourne intimated that he could not guarantee to do the work within a specified time. 3. The responsible officers of his Department. 4. It is not considered desirable to do so, but I shall be glad to show them to any honourable member. TELEGRAPH LINE , NORTH-WEST AUSTRALIA. ABORIGINALS. Mr Mahon asked the Postmaster General, upon notice. 1. Has his attention been recently drawn to Ordi- the frequent collapse of the telegraph line connecting the north-west portion of Western Australia with Perth? 2. Is he aware that telegrams to and from the north-west townships are sometimes delayed for twenty-four hours or more; and does he think it right that districts vitally affected by the movements of shipping should be deprived for such long intervals of means of communication with the outside world ? 3. Seeing that a line running along the coast must always be subject to mishaps from climatic causes, involving the Department in heavy maintenance ancl repairing charges, and in view also of the growing importance of the north-west districts, does he not think the time has arrived for erecting a telegraph further inland ? 4. In view of the circumstances, will he give directions that a survey of a new telegraph line from Peak Hill to the north-west vid Nullagine be undertaken, and an estimate of the cost obI may add that tained, so that the work may be provided for on next year's Estimates?",16
14,Mr MAUGER,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow : - 1. Yes; my attention has recently b.een drawn, to this matter by the honourable member. 2. Yes; I am aware serious delays have been, experienced on this route, and am taking steps with a view to obviate their recurrence as far as possible. 3. I have given instructions for the line from Geraidton to Wyndham to be inspected throughout, and reported upon in detail by reliable line» inspectors, with the view of improving the condition of the line, and altering the route where practicable. 3. The estimated cost of erection of a line fromPeak Hill to Nullagine is* £13,550, to which would have to be added the cost of contingent work between Peak Hill and Perth, making a total of approximately £20,000. . ? VENTILATION OF CHAMBER.",16
15,Mr LIDDELL,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"I desire to apologizefor having addressed my question to the Minister of Horde Affairs, seeing that the matter referred to lies entirely within your province, Mr Speaker. I desire to'ask If , seeing that the ventilation of this chamber is still unsatisfactory and bad, you - will seriously consider the scheme first suggested by theofficers of the Department of Home Affairs, and act on it at the earliest possible moment?",16
16,Mr SPEAKER,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"As the honourable member has implied, this and all other matters relating to .the House, and the convenience of honourable members, is under the control, not of Ministers, but of the House Committee. In pursuance of a resolution arrived at by the Committee some time since,, steps are about to be taken to provide another system of ventilation for this chamber. The scheme is the one in which the honourable member has taken a considerable interest. Yesterday afternoon the Prime Minister informed me that Colonel Owen has been instructed to proceed a.t once in the matter.",16
17,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,Has anything been and done in regard to the sewering of the buildceived. ing?,17
18,Mr SPEAKER,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"This is not the time for answering questions without notice, but perhaps I may be allowed to say that that matter, too, has been under the consideration of the House Committees of the two Chambers, and arrangements have been made to provide for sewering. FEDERAL PRINTING.  ister, upon notice Whether, in regard to a statement contained in the Argus of yesterday under the heading of "" Federal Printing,"" and setting forth that the Department of Home Affairs had accepted a tender, one condition of the contract being that all the setting is to be ""done by hand, the use of machines not being permitted1. Is this statement in accordance with fact? a. If so, why has a clause been inserted in the contract obviously intended - vent the use of labour-saving machinery ? 3. Has any estimate been made as to the increased cost of this contract consequent upon the restriction referred to?",17
19,Mr MAUGER,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"In reply to the honorof able member's questions, I beg to state1. Yes, so far as the setting of type by is concerned. 2 and 3. The work is of a special nature, involving a large amount of tabulation, and is ject to continual alteration, as fresh data come to hand, and in the opinion of experienced tical officers and printers, it cannot with tage and economy be dealt with by machine setting. NORTHERN TERRITORY. Mr JOSE PH COOK (for Mr JOHNSON) asked the Prime Minister, notice I. Whether he is yet in a position to say when the House may expect to have laid upon the table a return, in pursuance of a resolution of the House upon a motion submitted by Mr Johnson on Thursday, n t h July last, relating to Land Tenure, Alienation, and Settlement in the Northern Territory of South Australia? 2. In view of the fact that three months have elapsed since the date of the motion, is the Minister aware of the existence of any formidableobstacles in the way of obtaining the desired information ?",17
20,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"In reply to the honourable member's questions I beg to stateI cannot say when the return will be laid on the table. The information is not in the possession of this Government; the Premier of South Australia was accordingly asked to supply the desired particulars on the 18th July last. * Reminders were forwarded on the 21st August 5th October,' but no reply has yet been reTARIFF. In Committee of Ways and Means (Consideration resumed from 8th October, vide page 4361) : Item 1S7. Wire-netting, ad val. (General Tariff), 30 per cent.; (United Kingdom), 25 per cent.",17
21,Mr FULLER,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,Illawarra) [2.47] - I HAND SETTING. should like to know whether the Treasurer has any - proposition concerning this item to submit to the Committee?,17
22,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,Probably I shall have later on.,17
23,Mr FULLER,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,-Are honourable mem-' bers to proceed with the consideration of the item in the absence of any intimation as to what is the nature of the Government proposal ?,17
24,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"Hume-Trea to pre- surer) [2.48] - In reDly to the honourable member, I would point out that the Government proposal is before the Committee. As honourable members are aware, the duty upon wire-netting has engaged a good deal attention throughout a-, considerable portion of some of the States. That fact has hand been evidenced by the circulars which have been addressed to honourable members, and subalso by petitions which have been presented to this House. At the present stage I wish to statissay that a duty has been imposed upon advanthis material in consequence of the recommendation of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission. That section reported to this effectThe representative of the Wire-netting upon Workers' Union of New South Wales complained to your Commission that there was no duty on wire-netting under the Tariff, and that the industry was suffering for want of adequate protection. There was only one factory in Australia at present, and the men there did no£ average more than half-time all the year round. There was no duty on wire-netting in New South Wales immediately before Federation, it having been removed by the Reid Government. That is to. say, that a duty upon this material was imposed by 'the Dibbs Government.",17
25,Mr WATSON,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,What was that duty?,18
26,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"I think it JO per cent, ad valorem.",18
27,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"It was remitted by the Reid Government, and was not reimposed by the next Ministry, I suppose?",18
28,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"After the displacement of the Reid Government there was practically a fiscal truce in that the people of New South Wales, upon a second referendum, had agreed to enter the Federation, and accordingly the Tariff question was remitted, to the Federal arena. That is why no attempt at alteration was made in the New South Wales Tariff during the - eighteen months or two years immediately preceding the establishment of the Commonwealth.  mit the duty upon wire-netting when he was Premier of New South Wales?",18
29,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"I did not remit the duty. It was taken off by the Reid Government. For the honourable member's information, I may say that the duty was imposed in 1892' or 1893, and continued to operate until the end of 1894 or the beginning of 1895. When the Dibbs Government retired, and the Reid Government assumed office, the latter remitted the impost. That Government lasted until the imiddle of 1898. The Commonwealth draft Constitution had - then been agreed to ",18
30,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"Yes , in 1898 or 1899. At any rate, the duty had been remitted when the second Federal referendum had been taken in New South Wales. Upon the overthrow of the Reid Government, I became Premier of that State, and held office until the Commonwealth was established. But it was understood that in the interim no attempt should be made to alter the Tariff. I desire the honourable member for Maranoa to distinctly understand that I did not remove the duty npon wire-netting. It was abolished by the Government of which the leader of the Opposition was the head.  pression that the Treasurer was responsible for its removal.",18
31,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"No . The Protectionist section of the Tariff Commission, in their summary of the evidence of the representative of the Wire Netting Workers' Union of New South Wales, saidThere was no duty on wire-netting in New South Wales immediately before Federation, it having been removed by the Reid Government. was There was no duty in Victoria under the old Tariff. . In his opinion, a duty of 25 per cent, should be placed on English and 30 per cent, on German netting.",18
32,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,Fro m whose evidence is the Treasurer quoting?,18
33,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"Fro m that of a witness before the Tariff Commission. I have just given the substance of his replies to questions 87,447 and 87,382.",18
34,Sir JOHN EORREST,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,Was he one of the employees in Messrs. Lvsaght Brothers ?,18
35,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"I do not know, but probably he was: The report continuesBy placing such duties on importations people would be encouraged to invest capital in the industry in other States, and employment would then be materially increased. The protectionist section of the Tariff Commission also states.A grazier in ""Queensland, owning extensive stations in that State, made strong objection to the suggested duty. Amongst the reasons given by the witness, weie :-That it would prove pernicious to the whole community, especially to those interested in districts now free of rabbits, but which were in danger of being invaded by them ; that the present price of wire-netting rendered the erection of fences expensive; and that any serious addition to the cost of the material would make the erection of rabbit-proof fencing almost impracticable, with the result that, in a few years, a large area of country would be rendered worthless by the invasion of rabbits. , That is the testimony of Mr Jowett-the gentleman whom I saw yesterday. I did not then know that he was such a prominent man in connection with this matter, but I can well understand it, because he told *me that he was a strong free-trader.  truth.",18
36,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,Hi s statement accords with the answers which he gave to the questions put to him by the members of the Tariff Commission ,18
37,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"I happened to meet this gentleman yesterday and I thought that he was "" red hot.""",18
38,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,Le t us agree to admit wire-netting duty free and dispose of the matter at once.,18
39,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"Certainl y not. A great outcry has been made in connection with the duty on this material by interested persons. I know of more than one occasion in the New South Wales Parliament when objection. was urged to persons interested in the pastoral industry being permitted to vote upon questions affecting that industry - The objection was based upon constitutional grounds, and I am satisfied that the majority of those who are objecting to the duty upon wire netting at the present time are interested parties. - Mr HENRY WILLIS - Not at all.",18
40,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"The honorstatement able member knows nothing about the matI made. ter. He is interested only so far as the interests of a few of his supporters concerned. I think that I may take credit for knowing as much about the necessities of the pastoralists as does almost anybody, and I say that the agitation which has been worked up against the duty on wire netting is to a very large extent a spurious per cent. agitation. In saying that, I do not suggest that the duty should be as high as there in Canada? that which is proposed.  surer should say that, because he has not made a fortune out of the pastoral infrozen in Canada. dustry"".",19
41,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"I have not made a fortune out of anything, but I can stand up and say that I am not interested in this matter in any shape or form. That fact makes my position stronger than it would otherwise be.",19
42,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,It may make the Treasurer indifferent.,19
43,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"The honourable member himself told me that he wanted to buy a lot of wire netting, so that he interested in the item.",19
44,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,I do. not want to buy an ounce of it .,19
45,Mr WILSON,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,The Treasurer ought to withdraw that expression.,19
46,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,It is a downright untruth. »I do not want to buy a yard wire netting..,19
47,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,The honoras has anybody else. able member must not take ' umbrage at my statement.,19
48,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"I do not want to buy a yard of wire netting, and I never told the honourable member that I did.",19
49,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,The honourable member is quite mistaken. He so within the past twenty-four hours.,19
50,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,I do not want buy any.,19
51,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"I did not make the remark which the honourable member will have to pay for it. questions in any hostile spirit, but i ply,,to an' interjection by him.",19
52,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"I never said anything of the sort, and I have never bought a yard of wire netting in my life-at least not directly. Sir WILLIAM LYNEv-Wel l indirectly. I do not want the honourable member to jump up in such a fiery spirit",19
53,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,I did not make the which the Treasurer alleges that,19
54,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"Oh , yes. I are may inform honourable members that in Canada the"" duty upon wire netting of British origin is 20 per cent., the intermediate duty-whic h * is a sort of semipreferential duty-is 27J per cent., and the duty under the general Tariff is 30 Mr WILSON.:-How many rabbits are",19
55,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,The rabbits Treawill probably become a pest there.,19
56,Mr WILSON,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,No . They would be,19
57,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"Perhaps a rabbit, as well as other animals, will live amidst snow.",19
58,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"No , it wil l not.",19
59,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"I have no desire to relieve the Government of any responsibility, but I do not wish honourable members to allow the hysterical petitions which have been presented to the House to unduly influence them in connection with, is this item. I hope that they will approach it with an open mind, and deal with ir in an equitable way.  nected with it when one has to foot the. bill.",19
60,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,Has the honof orable member to foot the bill ? ,19
61,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,If the users of rabbit-proof netting care to go to the proper source they can purchase it cheaper today than they could before the duty was imposed.,19
62,Mr TILLEY BROWN,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,That is not a told me fair statement to make.,19
63,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"If , on the conto trary, they will purchase the imported article through the agency of companies and banks, there is no doubt that they Probably these n reinstitutions will make their customers"" pay the full amount of the duty. 1 But I find that the wire netting which is commonly used is now purchased at Lysaght's at a cheaper rate than before the duty.",19
64,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,It is £ 1 2 than it used to be.,20
65,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,And I will give the honourable member the reason.,20
66,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"I should hear it, because we want to see the price less.",20
67,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"Let the honourable member be fair. The rise'in the price took place some considerable time before the imposition of the duty, and I have taken the trouble to' ascertain the cause. I have no doubt that if the duty were taken off tomorrow the increased price would continue, because the same reasons operate. The price before the duty was imposed was 50 per cent, higher th in the lowest price for five years past. ",20
68,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"Yes , and Australian wire too; and the reason is that the raw material, the wire, has, during the last five vears, gone up 70 per cent, in price. These details can, if necessary, be verified by statutory declaration.  wire here?",20
69,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"I put that question, and I may say that communications have gone on between the company in Sydney and Mr Sandford, who, as soon as he can obtain the necessary machinery, will undertake the manufacture of the wire. I understand that the parties aire prepared to enter into an arrangement by which the company in Sydney will take the whole of the wire that Mr Sandford can produce at his' works at Lithgow.  Sandford a bonus for producing the wire, instead of imposing a duty? Sir WILLIAM LYNE' - That is what I should like to do, because I regard a bonus as the proper and legitimate way to encourage an industry of the kind. I make that remark now, because, in the past, some antipathy has been shown to a bonus for the iron industry.",20
70,Sir TOHN FORREST,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,Not at all.,20
71,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"On two occasions I have tried to pass an Iron Bonus Bill, and have been defeated, or have had to withdraw the measure. These facts remain in my memory, and have to be taken into consideration in framing a Tariff. All these events happened before the duty was imposed, and I may further say that the price of spelter, which is used in large quantities for the manufacture of wire for wire netting, has increased by 50 per cent. dearer At the present moment, Lysaght Bros, cannot secure half the quantity of spelter they require, and are taking the whole of that which is produced at Broken Hill and like to other places. Indeed, the company are prepared to enter into further contracts to take the whole of the spelter that can be produced in Australia, in preference to purchasing imported material. I think the honourable member for Kooyong, who has some knowledge of this matter, will bear out what I have said. Lysaght Bros, at present employ over 400 hands, and I am assured, and believe it to be correct, that their order book today is not full . One of the directors of the company and the manager have informed me that if they do not get large orders they will have to dismiss 150 hands.",20
72,Mr HENRY WILLIS,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,Why do they not reduce the price ?,20
73,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,They ' have done so.,20
74,Mr HENRY WILLIS,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,B y £ 1 !,20
75,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"I have obtained authority to give the history of this company - and I should like to do so as shortly as I can, in order to place the facts before honourable members. If the statements I am now making are not accepted by honourable members the representatives of the company are prepared to make a statutory declaration.  altogether in the wire industry in New South Wales today.",20
76,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"What I am stating is absolute fact. I got my information from one of the directors* and the manager of the company; and, as I say, they are prepared to support their statements by statutory declaration if necessary.",20
77,Mr WILKS,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"The 400 includes men and boys. ' Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I think the boys are over and above the 400, though I cannot speak definitely on that point. I received this information on Monday, and I put very keen, searching questions to both of the gentlemen I have mentioned, because I desired to obtain the exact truth. The manager told me that the present proprietary had had to do with the companv for only two years; that they had taken over the works, together with a debt of ; £ 100,000, created by the attempt to cany on this struggling industry.",20
78,Mr HANS IRVINE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,And now the Treasurer wants the Commonwealth to bear the burden.,21
79,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"I do not want anything of the kind. I know the honourable member will be fair ; he says he is a protectionist, and I am sure that he is, if he will only allow full fling to his inclinations.",21
80,Mr WILKS,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,The fact is that it is not a Victorian industry.,21
81,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"in reply to that interjection, I may say that a great deal of harm has been done by the announcement that it is proposed to carry on the. wire-netting industry in the gaols of Victoria.",21
82,Mr WILKS,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,It is not a Victorian in the duty. dustry ; that is the point.,21
83,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"I am not going to say anything about that. I promised honourable members to refer to the prices. The New South Wales Government invited tenders for 4,000 miles of wire-netting, which, of course, is a very large quantity. A tender was received for 4,000 miles of wire-netting of 42 inches in width and i £ inches in mesh, which is the usual size. The tender accepted by the New South Wales Government was at the rate of £ 2 6 10s. per ton, which is practically a mile; and the transaction staggered the ordinary importers in Sydney who were charging -£4 or £ 4 10s. a; ton more than the tender price for the same class of netting at that particular time. Lysaght Brothers tendered for the' 4,000 miles of netting at ^ 3 1 a. ton, which is estimated to mean ^3010s. a ton, seeing that the company, unlike the Government of New South Wales, truck the wire-netting to the individual purchasers, at a cost of 10s. per ton. The tender is the lowest that has ever been accepted in Australia.",21
84,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,Wire-nettin g free.,21
85,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"No : duty is being charged, and that causes extra expense.",21
86,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,Was that tender before or after the institution of the Tariff ?,21
87,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"Let me proceed, because I regard the information I have here asan education. The Wales Government then invited tenders for £ 2 4 . wire-netting of 36 inches in width, with i j - in ch mesh, and the tender accepted at £ 2 4 . The tender of Lysaght Brothers was ^ 2 7 , or, deducting the 10s. for trucking, £ 2 6 10s. I asked the manager why the price was lower than they are charging in a general way now, and he said that it was because of the enormous quantity ordered, namely, 4,000 miles. Let me tell honourable members what is the retail price for this very wire-netting today. With the Tariff in operation, Lysaght and Company are charging ^""31 7s. 6d. per ton for small lots, or, with the reduction of 10s. for trucking, £ 3 0 17s. 6d. for the same class of wire which the New South Wales Government purchased at £ 2 6 10s. Sir JOHN FORREST. --But the wire is made here.",21
88,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,And that is the reason they do not charge the equivalent of,21
89,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,What were they charging before the Tariff operated?,21
90,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"The price was the same, or a little more. The tender to which I am referring was before the Tariff was imposed, and, therefore, Lysaght Brothers have reduced their price by £ 1 per ton since the imposition of the duty.",21
91,Mr HARPER,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,What tender was that at,21
92,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"I think it was a German tender, and I am informed by every one who has used it that the German wire-netting is very inferior. I am giving these figures to show bow near the Australian price is to the price of the imported article. I have seen many farmers and squatters in and around Wagga in reference to this matter, and they all tell me that Lysaght's netting is worth from 30s. to £ 2 more per ton than the imported wire, a great deal of which is German.",21
93,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,They can still buy Lysaght's wire-netting.,21
94,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,That is why I is say there should not be an outcry for whioh there is .no justification.,21
95,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"Lysaghts have done very well without a duty; why should they not go on without one ? Sir WILLIAM . LYNE - Let me proceed, because I wish to have these facts recorded in Hansard. Lysaght Brothers tendered at practically £ 2 6 10s. for 36-inch wire - netting, and the tender accepted by New South the New South Wales .Government was At present those who receive that wire in the course of ordinary retail trade was are charged ^ 2 7 7 s. 6d, which, with the reduction of ios. for trucking, means £ 2 6 17s. 6d.; and the users get better value for their money, inasmuch, as the Australian wire-netting lasts much longer than that imported from Germany. These facts .are, to my mind, extremely important.",21
96,Mr FULLER,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,Fro m what statement is the Treasurer reading?,22
97,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"I am quoting statements made by Mr Meeks-who m the honourable member knows-and by Mr. Chant, who is the principal officer connected with the works. I mention these names because I am authorized to do so, and I have before me a type-written copy of the company's price list.",22
98,Mr FRAZER,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"When the honourable member spoke of the price being £ 2 4 per mile, did he mean to say that that was the price of the wire-netting landed at Sydney ?",22
99,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"Yes . But not on the trucks. As a matter of fact, Lysaght Brothers place the netting on the trucks without extra charge, whereas those take the Government netting incur an additional expense in conveying it from the wharf to the railway trucks. 5s another class of wire-netting which is probably more largely used than member is that to which I have just been referring. I speak of the i j - i which is used for sub-divisional fences. Wire-netting of i j - in. mesh is used the boundary fences, since it shuts out the small rabbits; but the i j - in. mesh Lysaghts bf Great Britain. is, as I have said, used for sub-divisional fences. Lysaght Brothers are supplying great quantity of the larger sized mesh, in. , and their price for it, 42 inches wide, according to the retail distribution rates, ^""25 15s. If we deduct the ios. per ton, as we have done in connection with the other class of netting, as representing cost of trucking, the price is £ 2 5 5s. mile.

I management. was told that they had large orders from Queensland and Victoria, as well as some from South Australia and a few from Western Australia. Last week their output was 335 miles of wire-netting, and within a month or two they anticipate that it have increased to nearly 600 miles a week.",22
100,Mr TILLEY BROWN,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"Then they have been doing fairly , well.",22
101,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"But for the fact that wire-netting which was to be .distributed is still lying in bond, they would not have been able to reduce the price, even to the extent of -£i per ton, as they have done. All the imported wire netting would otherwise have been in competition with their output.",22
102,Mr JOHNSON,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,What fools the importers would have been had they taken the wire-netting out of bond.,22
103,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"Considering .that they have the support of a number of free-traders, they would have been foolish to do so. I feel strongly on this question, but I may say at once that I do not intend to ask the Committee to pass the duties of 30 per cent, and 25 per cent, originally proposed.",22

117,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"Yes . Judging by the information I have received as to the quality of iron ' now being produced Lithgow, I am inclined to think that quality of the wire-netting produced Australia will still further improve. A function which I attended a few days a representative of the Otis Engineering Company publicly stated that the iron which they had used in the construction of a traction engine, and which they had obtained in Australia, was equal to the best Scotch iron, and better than that imported from England. The fact that such superior iron is being produced at Lithgow within a few months of the establishment of the industry there seems to warrant the assumption that the quality of Australian wire-netting will also improve. It should be, and must be, better than the German wire-netting, which is most inferior and short-lived.",23

125,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"I speak subject to correction, but my information is that a great portion of the wire-netting to be supplied under that contract will be of German manufacture. I do not vouch for the accuracy of that statement as I do f p r at others that I have made; portion of the the wire-netting to be supplied may be of in English manufacture, but my information t a is that it is not. The Minister of Trade ago, and Customs has just reminded me that wire from Great Britain is now free.",23
126,Mr HANS IRVINE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"Does not a great deal of wire come from the United Statesof America? - Sir WILLIAM LYNE - Why should we not make it in Australia? Why should we depend on Germany or America for our supplies? I hope that we shall shortly be able to manufacture all the wire that we need. I have put the position as strongly as I can, and I trust that the information I have placed before honourable members' will so impress them that a majority will not be prepared to leave the iron industry of Australia entirely at the mercy raw of the Germans or the Americans.",23

I trust that the Committee, in dealing with this item, will give reasonconsideration to the interests of our per own people, and that they will not be prepared to place wire-netting on the free the list. I have shown that v.o great harm can result from the imposition of a duty upon it. At the present slack time, the total requirements of Australia in respect of wire netting average about 15,000 or 16,000 tons per annum,. It is estimated that the demand will increase in the autumn of next year, but I am assured that for some months the quantity required will not exceed that which I have mentioned.

Lysa,ght Brothers employ 400, if not more, hands-, and when they double their output, as I am told they will within a few months, the number of their employees will also .be almost doubled.

138,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"I did not. The action of the honourable member in introagainst ducing personal matters is outrageous; I shall tell the Committee why my son terial sought to obtain the imported article. As a matter of fact, he is struggling to place his operations on a sound footing, and applied for the imported wire-netting simply because the State Government offered to supply it on twentv years' terms. pavment of 5 per cent, for twenty was sufficient to make good the total cost ancl interest.",24

153,Mr CHANTER,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,I understand that the statement made by the Treasurer will be supported on oath if necessary. Treasurer has just handed to me a statement relating to the operations of the company.,25
154,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,I have opened the letter in which it was enclosed since making my speech.,25
155,Mr CHANTER,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"The statement is as followsLysaghts' Factory, New South Wales, started twenty-three years ago, under a protective Tariff. The immediate effect of the. local factory starting was a £ 1 0 per mile reduction in prices of the imported article. Some ten years ago, the duty was abolished by a free-trade Government, and the company became a steady loser in trying to compete with cheap foreign netting. Two and one-half years ago acrisis arrived, when a huge debt had been accumulated, but, luckily, the keen demand for rabbit netting enabled the company to realise better prices in spite of competition, and it has therefore survived. Prices of all nettings have creased during the last three years owing to the enormous rise in the prices of raw wire and spelter. The rise in wire has been 70 per cent., the rise in spelter has been 50 per cent. ting has increased in price from above causes about 50 per cent. Whether the price of netting is maintained depends largely on the cost of wire. At present, the huge German combinescontrol the wire market, especially for fine sizes, such as netting is made from. Since the imposition of the duty on netting, owing to the falling off of foreign and English orders for netting wire, the German producers of wire are becoming' weak, and if the duty on netting is passed, it is almost certain the price of wire will fall. If this is the case, a reduction may be expected in local netting early in the coming year. The local factory employs 400 hands. The local factory put out 300 miles of nettins; weeklv now, and will increase this quantity ranidlv if the duty remains. The local factory is spending £15,000 on extensions to plant to protect their position, and will spend more if encouragement is afforded. The local factory is surmlyinp all demands at an already reduced price, and wants more orders. The local factory is owned exclusively by local men, and cmploys a capital of £100,000. New South Wales Government Purchase. The difference between the price of the netting purchased by this Government and the tender by the local factory is not so great as it appears, for the following reasons :The Government has not allowed for(1) Administration. (2) Loss in interest. (3) Exchange. (4) Handling. (5) Cartage. (6) Storage. (7) Trucking. Tariff [g OCTOBER, 1907.] (Item 187). 4421 The local price was for the netting delivered on trucks consigned to consumers and delivered in any size parcels as required. The local netting is alsb of a much superior quality, and consumers for many years past have always been willing to pay a higher price for it. To show The its bona fides, the local factory finally asked the New South Wales Government to offer the local netting side by side with the imported, the local at the local price and the Government purchase at its price. There is no doubt in the minds of the local manufacturers which' netting would have been most sought. The Government, however, would not take up the offer.",25
156,Mr THOMAS,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,There is nothing there in support of the statement that the company has obtained spelter from Broken Hill .,25
157,Mr THOMAS BROWN,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,B y whom was the statement furnished?,25
158,Mr CHANTER,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"B y the manager of the company, - I understand.",25
159,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"It is stated that there has been a rise of 50 per cent, in the price of spelter.",25
160,Mr CHANTER,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"Yes , and the Treasurer said, on the authority of persons connected with the company, that it has obin- tained from Broken Hill all the spelter which it could obtain there.",25
161,Mr HANS IRVINE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"That must have been Net- next to nothing, because they have not produced spelter of a good quality there vet.",25
162,Mr WILSON,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,That is so. The arrange- 0 merits for supplying spelter have broken down. They cannot produce it at Broken Hill.,25
163,Mr CHANTER,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"Personally , I have no knowledge of the subject, but the honourable member for Barrier should be in a position, to say whether spelter of good quality ancl in sufficient quantity can be produced at Broken Hill . I yield to none in my desire for the establishment of industries in every part of Australia, and I would go to any reasonable length to bring that about.",25
164,Mr THOMAS,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,So would we all.,25
165,Mr CHANTER,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"F r o m the statements made from time to time, I think that some honourable members have no liking for Australian industries, or, at any rate, would not give them preference. They contend that the god of cheapness must be worshipped, and that if goods can be purchased more cheaply in other parts of the world than they can be produced here, we should go abroad for our requirements.",25
166,Mr THOMAS,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,The honourable member says that he would do only what is reasonable for the establishment of an industry. Every honourable member is prepared to say that; but opinions differ as to what would be reasonable in each case.,25
167,Mr CHANTER,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"If the honourable member will go as far as I would consider reasonable, he would go the length of doing all that is possible to establish our industries on a sure, firm, and profitable basis. It is always asserted by free traders and revenue tariffists that the position of duties adds to the burdens of consumers, but that is correct only when duties are imposed on articles which are not manufactured or produced within the Commonwealth, because in regard to them importers have a complete monopoly, and can pass on the charges to their customers. But where there is internal competition, caused by the existence of Australian manufacture .or production, the importer is compelled by it to pay part, if not the whole, of the duties imposed. The Committee may see its way to assist the wire netting industry, not by the immediate imposition of a duty, but by the granting of a bounty for every ton or mile of wire netting manufactured, until such time as the New South Wales and other factories have a sufficient output to supply the requirements of the Commonwealth. When that stage is reached, an import duty might well be imposed to protect our omanufacturers from competition from abroad, and the bounty be discontinued. In the first instance, the users of wire netting would not be called on to pay any more for it, because the bounty would be provided out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund. That has been suggested, and I fail to see why the Government cannot pursue that course. There is - no doubt that the land-owners throughout the Commonwealth, and more particularly in the Riverina district, will be saddled in the immediate future with a very large expenditure in the purchase of wire-netting. Realizing as I do that they are now suffering from another drought it would ill be- industry ? come me to add to their burdens by supporting the imposition of a duty upon, that material. I should like to see the impost upon it reduced to io per cent, in the case of German importations,, and the full amount of the preference proposed granted to Great Britain.",26
168,Mr WILSON,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"The honourable member is going to "" f all "" upon the item of wire netting.",26
169,Mr CHANTER,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"The honourable member is quite wrong. I do not slip upon anything. The honourable member did me the honour to visit my electorate and to address the people of Deniliquin with the object of banishing me from the public lifeof the Commonwealth. Their answer to him is that I am still a member of this Parliament. The fact is that I have never broken a single pledge which' I have given im- my constituents. I call myself a protectionist, and I claim to be a thorough-going protectionist. There are two ways in which a man may be a protectionist; first,, by supporting the payment of bounties for the encouragement of industries, and, secondly, by supporting the imposition of Customs duties to achieve the same result.",26
170,Mr WH IRVINE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,Le t us get on rothe item of wire-netting-. ' Mr CHANTER - I know that some honourable members - are prepared to vote for the removal of the duty upon this article.

The statement has beeni made that there is only one wire-netting factory in the Commonwealth today. We are told that a second is about to start inSouth Australia.,26

I think that he my opinion upon this matter pretty If we reduce the duty upon wire-netan ting, we might grant a preference of 5 per cent, to British manufactures, and authorize the payment of a bounty to all 4 . wire-netting manufactured within the Commonwealth for a period of two years. Some little time ago I put some questions in the House in reference to this matter, and received answers to the effect that Lysaght this Brothers were then turning out 200 miles of wire-netting per week; that within three months the company would underduty. take to produce 300 miles per week; and within twelve months, if the duty were retained, the output would be increased to 600 miles' per, week, which is estimated to meet the annual requirements of the Commonwealth. The first promise has been carried out, because, although three months have not elapsed, the output has been increased to 335 miles per week. We may safely conclude, therefore, that the proprietary will extend their operations, and give more employment, and that within twelve months they will have overtaken the demand within the Commonwealth. "" If we extend to that company, and others who choose to encage in the industry-, the assistance of a bonus of 12s. 6d. per ton for a period not exceeding two years from the passing of the Bonus Bill , and then substitute for the bonus a duty such as that proposed now. of 15 per cent., the case will, I think, be met. Such a scheme would meet the wishes of the land-owners, who are the consumers of this commodity, and also of those who are about to engage in the industry, thus doing that justice which is the object of the Committee. I do not know whether at this stage it would be judicious for me to move that the duty be reduced.",27
194,Mr HUTCHISON,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,How can we vote a reduction of the duty when we do not know that a bonus will be given?,28
195,Mr CHANTER,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,That is my difficulty.,28

The honourable member for Riverina has suggested that those honourable members who favour the abolition of this duty show a disregard for the industries of Australia. I submit, however, that the - action of the Treasurer and of the honourable member distinctly shows that, in their opinion, if the duty is maintained at the rate proposed by the Government, it will prove inimical to one of the largest industries in Australia.",28
199,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,Nothin g of the kind. %,28
200,Mr FULLER,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"Why do the Treasurer and the honourable member for Riverina agree to accept any reduction in the proposed duty ? The reason is to be found in the agitation which has been raised in Riverina and other constituencies of Australia, which has distinctly brought home to those gentlemen the fact that the farmers and pastoralists, who have to combat the great rabbit curse, are strongly of opinion that a duty on wire-netting does not have the effect of reducing the price of that material.",28
201,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,The honourable member knows very well that the agitation does not affect me.,28
202,Mr FULLER,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"At any rate, we have had netitions from Wagga in opposition to the Tariff.",28

207,Mr FULLER,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"I admit that the last few words are my own. At any rate, the Minister of Trade and Customs was distinctly referring to extremists of the type of the Treasurer. It appears to me that the Treasurer cannot for one moment entertain the proposal for a bonus, in view of the statements he himself made in submitting the Tariff. The honourable gentleman told us that the total consumption of wire-netting in Australia is 15,000 odd miles per annum. Sir - WILLI AM LYNE - It is 16,000 miles' at present, and will increase.",28
208,Mr FULLER,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,The honourable gentleman has also stated that the output at Lysaghts' works is equal to the requirements of Australia at the present time:,28
209,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"I did not say so. - Mr FULLER - H as the honourable"" gentleman not said, not only today,- but a fortnight ago on the floor of the House,, that Lysaght Brothers are turning out from 300 to 400 miles per week?",28

211,Mr FULLER,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"We l l , if we multiply that by fifty-two we have 15,000 miles which, according to the honourable gentleman himself, is the total annual requirement of the Commonwealth.",29
212,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,At this particular season of the year.,29
213,Mr FULLER,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,We know that there are heavy demands for wire netting at the present time.,29
214,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"No , there are not; the order books of the firm are not full .",29
215,Mr FULLER,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"I shall read one or two letters directly on that point. This question of wire netting was inquired into, to some extent, by the Tariff Commission. Mr Meeks and Mr Chant, who represent - Lysaght Brothers, had ample opportunity to state their case before the Tariff Commission ; but, instead of coming themselves, they sent one of their employees, who had been engaged for a considerable time in the industry. The members of the Tariff Commission had no opportunity of crossexamining Mr Meeks and Mr Chantwho represent Gibbs, Bright, and Co., the principal shareholders of Lysaght Brothers - and thus ascertaining the real state of affairs in connection with the business. In stead of appearing before the Tariff Commission, those gentlemen went direct to the Treasurer, who now tells us that he put searching questions to them, though he has not said what those questions were. Sir WILLIAM LYNE. - Yes ; I gave the answers to the questions today.",29
216,Mr FULLER,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"I never heard what the questions were, and I listened closely to what the honourable gentleman said. heard the honourable gentleman read a statement from Mr Meeks, but that statement is merely ex parte, and .there is no opportunity to test it by cross-examination. Yet honourable members are asked to swallow a statement given under such circumstances.",29
217,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"I the information given to me by those two gentlemen, but also a letter which I received after I - made my statement.",29
218,Mr FULLER,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"I am perfectly aware of what the position is, and I submit that, under the circumstances, we are entitled to regard very carefully the statements submitted to us by the Treasurer. Sir WILLIAM ' LYNE - I thank the honourable member for his insinuation.",29
219,Mr FULLER,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,There is no insinuation against the Treasurer. said that the Sir WILLIAM LYNE - The honourable member makes the insinuation as an anti-Australian.,29
220,Mr FULLER,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"I am not an anti-Australian, and I make no insinuation.",29
221,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"I sent for the men, and they answered questions put by me.",29
222,Mr FULLER,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"What I submit is that the Committee are entitled to look very carefully indeed on evidence given in this way. The Treasurer made an eloquentappeal that the consumers of wire netting in ' Australia should not be left at the mercy of German and American manufacturers. But it is not from America and Germany that the largest importations come. We have the same old story in connection with the whole of this Tariff. Every duty that is being imposed under it is being directed, not so much against the foreign manufacturer as against the manufacturers of Great Britain. In many_ instances, our chief competitors in the Australian markets are not the foreigners to whom the Treasurer has referred, but our fellow countrymen in the motherland. For the most part imported wire-netting comes from Great Britain. In 1906 wire-netting of the value of ^£521,000 was imported, and, of that total, nearly ,£400,000 worth came from the mother country. Honourable members will therefore recognise that these duties are imposed, not so much against the Americans or the Germans, as against the manufacturers and the workers of the United Kingdom. The Treasurer based the whole of his case in support of these duties on the report of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission, as well as on the statement made by I Messrs. Meeks and Chant. I trust, that every honourable member will read the report signed f/ythe Chairman of the Commission and his protectionist colleagues, in which a duty of 25 per cent, is recommended. I am sure that no fair-minded man will contend that there is anything in it that would have not only justify the imposition of any duty whatever. Wire-netting is required,' not onbby the big pastoralists, but by the small farmers and settlers of Australia. In many districts where rabbits were never seen a few years ago, thousands of them are to be found today, and they are eating out the small settlers. In one of the most closely settled districts in Australia-the electorate of Illawarra, which I have the honour to represent-grea t damage is being done by them. Farmers in the Camden, The Oaks"" Appin, and Mittagong sections, in some cases have had to give up their holdings owing to the depredations of rabbits, and the pest is making its appearance even in the coastal districts. Nearly everything used by the settlers is taxed under this Tariff; but I contend that it should be our desire to admit duty free everything they require in the development of their holdings. If honourable members refer to the report submitted by the free-trade section of the Commission,. they will find that it absolutely justifies the position I am today taking up. It has been suggested by' the honourable member for Riverina, and others, that the free-trade section of the Commission recommended a 5 per cent, duty on wire-netting. If honourable members read the conclusions of that section, they will find that that is not the case.",29
223,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,Neve r mind the conclusions; look at the recommendations.,30
224,Mr FULLER,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"In the fourth report of the "" B , "" or free-trade section of the Commission, there appears the statementNo sufficient case has been stated to warrant any duty on wire-netting. On the other hand, there is evidence that a duty would be a direct tax upon rural industries, and would seriously militate against the successful occupancy of large areas of Australia. Surely that is a definite pronouncement.",30
225,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,Will the honcost orable member read the recommendations under of the free-trade section?,30
226,Mr FULLER,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"I am referred by the skill. honourable member to the schedule "" Metals and Machinery."" ",30
227,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"Why not read but the recommendations"" on page '31 of the as report ?",30
228,Mr FULLER,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"They have nothing to 1,200 do with the item now before us. They are mere suggestions. It was not our to frame a Tariff, and the recommendanetting, tions in question were made as part of a only 8s. 6d. suggested symmetrical and uniform Tariff. In no case did we suggest duties exceeding cent. 20 or 25 per cent., and I do not think, we need go beyond the conclusion I have read.",30
229,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,The recommenwhich dation to which I refer goes further than the conclusion which the honourable member has read.,30
230,Mr FULLER,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"Then the honourable member may read it to the Committee. One of the reasons advanced by protectionists for the, imposition of protective duties that they lead to increased employment. The evidence given before the Tariff Commission clearly shows that, in the wire-netting industry, the proportion of labour cost to the value of the manufactured article is infinitesimal. It is in the erection of mile after mile of wire-nettingfencing, to shut out the rabbit pest, that employment is given to a number of men.",30
231,Mr BRUCE SMITH,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,And labour is employed in utilizing the land protected by the netting.,30
232,Mr FULLER,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"Quite so. Much labour is also employed in connection with the products of land so protected. Thousands of people are employed in our cities in handling and dealing with the produce of the soil. Even the very wharf labourers, whom the honourable member for West Sydney said last night would not immediately participate in the benefits of duty free wire netting to the settlers of Australia, are concerned in this question. They have to handle our wool, our butter, and other products which we largely export, and consequently are dependent to a very large extent upon the success of our farmers and pastoralists. I propose now to read from the report of the free-trade section of the Commission, to which I have just referred, a paragraph dealing with the question of labour costAlthough precise details as to complete labour were not given, some facts were admitted cross-examination which afford a guide to the cost of production. The weaver who gave evidence stated that his work required the most Working full time on piece-work his wages averaged £ 2 2s. a week, and he thought the average wage for weaving was over 30s. a week; he was unable to state the average over the whole factory. He made a series of calculations to the cost of weaving, on which basis he, as a weaver, received 8s. 6d. for weaving a total of yards' run of 48-in. wide poultry netting, which, when sold retail, realized £20. duty In other words, the labour cost of wirefor which the public pay £ 2 0 , is",30
233,Mr BRUCE SMITH,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,Les s than 2\ per,30
234,Mr FULLER,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"That is so. Evidence was given by Mr Jowett, to whom the Treasurer has referred, as to the effect a duty on wire-netting would have on the pastoralists. He pointed out that the suggested duty of 25 per cent, would mean an increase of about-'^6 per mile' on the normal cost. When we remember that mile after mile of netting has to be erected for the protection of holdings, we must is - recognise that these ' imposts would be a very serious burden on those who have fight not only rabbits, but other evils. The free-trade section of the Tariff Commission. reportedIn certain years named the bulk of the ports into Queensland appeared to have been Sydney manufacture, and that netting was in Brisbane on the basis of the list of the manufacturers. Prices for the size of netting quoted had advanced very greatly lately, owing to creased demand and limited supplies. Queensland Government had been unsuccessfully trying to get supplies for years. I am sure that every representative Queensland will confirm that statement, movewhich is based oh the evidence given by Mr Jowett.  - Mr FULLER - In New South Wales, the position became so acute that the vernment of that State had to import netting for the use of settlers. Mr Jowett referred particularly to the fact that large number of men are employed, not only in erecting wire-netting fences, but in speaking of the requirements of the Com keeping them in order. I desire able members to take the reports of both sections of the Commission into consideraimported tion. We shall provide increased employand ment for labour, not by giving special treatment to the wire-netting industry, by allowing the settlers throughout Ausgeneral. tralia the fullest opportunity to obtain netting as cheaply as possible.",30
235,Sir WIJLLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"Why did the orable member recommend a duty of 5 cent, on wire-netting?",31
236,Mr FULLER,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,I did not.,31
237,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"If the honourable price, member refers to page 31 of the report, he will find that recommendation there.",31
238,Mr FULLER,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"I wonder that the wild'dogs Treasurer knows anything about the matinvestigation ter, because he has stated that he has read our reports.",31
239,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"I have not said tralia. that. I read a good many, but found them so absurd that I had to stop.",31
240,Mr FULLER,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"That is an easy way of dismissing a. difficult question. For benefit, I shall again read the conclusion of the free-trade section of the Tariff Comthe mission in this matterNo substantial case has been stated to any duty on wire-netting. On the other there is evidence that a duty would be a direct tax upon rural industries, and would seriously militate against the successful occupancy of large areas of Australia. The Treasurer has himself suggested a reto duction of the rates from 30 and 25 per [ T 5 6 ] -2 9 'diem 187). '44C7 to cent, to 15 and 10 per cent., which is a droughts and very good beginning.",31
241,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"It is the end, too.",31
242,Mr FULLER,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"The honourable member immade out no case for any duty at all, and of the investigations of the Tariff Commissold sion, as well as the general information available, show that, in the interests of the inpastoralists, the agriculturalists, and all The engaged in developing the lands of Australia, and all dependent on them in the big cities and elsewhere, wire-netting should of be admitted duty free. I , therefore, That the following words be added : - "" and on and after ioth October, 1907, Free.""  port the amendment of the honourable memGober for Illawarra. If ever there was a wiregenuine agitation for the removal of a duty, it is that which is taking place a throughout Australia in reference to the duty on wire-netting. The Treasurer, in r honormonwealth as 16,000 miles, loses sight of the fact that last year 14,000 miles were in addition to the local output, this year, and for some years to come, the importation will increase, because the but use of wire-netting is becoming more In South Australia hundreds of wirethousands of pounds have been spent upon various methods of rabbit destruction, honwhich have resulted in failure; but some per years ago the Government of the State bought wire-netting extensively, and supplied it to farmers at a reasonable allowing long periods for repayment. The use of that wire-netting has been very successful in assisting the settlers to keep down both and rabbits, and after a thorough the Government of New not South Wales has decided to follow the example of the Government of South AusThe necessity to use wire-netting will mean a tax of from 3d. to 4d. per acre on the .farmers who use wire-netting, while the duty is equivalent to an increase in price his of £ 6 per ton and to a total impost of -£ 37»59.4> if the importation continues at 1 rate of last year. In speaking against these duties last night I referred to them warrant as a class tax, because they affect the hand, primary producers only. I know of hundreds of thousands of acres on which crops cannot be grown unless they are protected by wire-netting, and, in my opinion, it was a criminal thing for the Governr/ent propose a tax on the users of this article when there were no good grounds for doing so. On the Minister's own figures the duties are equivalent to a bonus of over £ 3 0 0 for each man employed in the New South Wales factory, and the persons who are called upon to pay it are the unfortunate settlers who have to battle against climatic conditions, and often on inferior land, which is practically useless without the application of superphosphates. withstanding their difficulties, Ministers who profess to be the friends of the farmers are loading them with a tax which in the aggregate, based on the imports of last year, will amount to ;£ i37>594j but will probably be much larger. In my opinion, there should be no duty, and, consequently, no preference. Reasonable competition between the German, English, and Australian manufacturers will cause the users of wire netting to be fairly dealt with. Last year romething like £378,00 0 worth of wire netting was imported from the United Kingdom, the balance of the importation coming from Germany. According to a statement in today's Argus, a gentleman, who for ten years was. in the employment of Messrs. Lysaght Brothers, has stated that the bulk of this wire-netting is made by piece-work, those employed receiving wages equivalent to 22s. 6d. a ton.",31
243,Mr HEDGES,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"Twelv e shillings a mile.  tailed ""poultry netting,"" which is of large mesh. Netting 3 f t . 6 in. wide and of i i - in. mesh is woven at a cost of 22s. 6d. a ton for labour, a ton of netting'stretching out to the length of a mile. Yet the manufacturers have increased the price to £31. The Treasurer - has not justified in any way his proposal to increase the price to the farmers by £ 6 a ton. One of the most remarkable speeches which I have heard for a long time was that of the honourable member for Riverina, who claims to be' a consistent protectionist. Notwithstanding the statement of the Treasurer to the contrary, he says that the agitation for the remission of these duties is not hysterical, but that the farmers are in earnest about it, and, as the result of the agitation in _ his district, gested a duty' of 15 per cent, against foreign manufacturers, allowing British manufactures to come in at 10 per cent. When we hear a pronounced protectionist like the honourable member for Riverina taking up the position that he did, we know that some' very strong pressure must have been brought to bear upon him by residents of his own constituency. Otherwise he would have voted consistently for the imposition of high duties. I shall support the proposal to place the item upon the free list.",32
244,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"Swan) [4.47]. - I feel that I must make a few observations in regard to this item, seeing that I represent the major portion of the agriNotcultural and pastoral districts of Western Australia, and that my own opinion in respect of it is in complete accord with that of my constituents. I believe that in supporting the amendment of the honourable I member for Illawarra I shall be acting 1 not only in the interests of my constituents, but in the interests of the rural population of the Commonwealth. It seems to me that the fiscal question does not arise in this connection. Wire-netting is an absolute necessity to those who are engaged in rural industries. They have to combat the rabbit plague and the wild dog pest-no t to mention other pests-and it is a sine qua non that they should use wire-netting. Indeed, in many parts of Australia, occupation cannot be successfully established without it . I am surprised that the Government should now desire to make a new departure by levying a duty upon that article. When the first Commonwealth Tariff was introduced by the honourable member for Adelaide in 1901, the Government of the day, of which I was a member, decided that wire-netting should be placed upon the list of exemptions. That proposal was agreed to by Parliament, and the item' has remained upon that list ever since. We know that in New Zealand no duty is levied upon the article, and that one-half of the members of the Tariff Commission also recommended that it should be placed upon the free list. Why the protectionist section of that .body should have recommended making a new departure in this case, and proposed the imposition of a duty of 25 per cent, upon if is to me' quite inexplicable. The original proposal of the Government was that a duty of 25 per cent, should be imposed upon wire-netting of he sug- British origin, and of 30 per cent, upon all other netting. But in view of the opposition which has been aroused to those proposals, they now desire to reduce the duties to 10 per cent, and 15 per cent, respectively. The reason given for desiring to impose this duty, namely, in order to support one industry which has been established in New South Wales, and which, according to the evidence tendered to the Tariff Commission, has been doing fairly well, does not appear a sufficient reason for placing an obstacle in the way of successful occupation of the land. This factory is said to have done well, and to have increased its output to a very large extent.  very low wages.",32
245,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"Las t year the Commonwealth imported £ 5 2 1 , 7 8 8 worth of wire-netting, the larger portion of which came from the United Kingdom. ought to be satisfactory to those who desire to encourage the importation of goods from the mother country. Personally, I believe in granting a real preference to Great Britain-no t a sham one such as is contained in the present proposals of the Government. Out of the £ 5 2 1 , 7 8 8 worth of wire-netting imported by the Commonwealth last year, £ 3 7 9 , 0 0 0 worth came from the United Kingdom, £ 1 4 0 , 0 0 0 worth from Germany, and a little more than £ 3 , 0 0 0 worth from other countries. It has been said that the firm in whose interests we are asked to impose a burden upon the whole rural population' of Australia will undertake not to increase the price of wire-netting if we grant them an adequate measure of - protection. But I would point out that what we desire is a reduction in the price of that article. A few years ago the price of wire netting was, I believe, £ 1 2 per ton less than it is now, and we hope to see it again reduced to that level very soon.",33
246,Mr STORRER,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"I hope that all metal will maintain a high Drice, because it will be a good thing for Australia.",33
247,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,We require to be able to purchase some cheap materials in order to encourage those who are endeavouring to subdue the great forces arrayed against us in the development of this country.,33
248,Mr WEBSTER,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,It is of no use robbing Peter to pay Paul.,33
249,Sir JOHNFORREST,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"If anybody lead requires assistance, it is the producer. repeat that years ago, wire-netting could purchased for £ 1 2 per ton less than it can be purchased now. I trust that its price will again 'be reduced ere long in the interests of those who are endeavouring subdue the wilderness, and to make the land profitable. It has been urged surer that 400 hands are employed in the wire-netting industry in Sydney. are their interests compared with those the tens of thousands engaged in rural industries, who are doing their best to develop the resources of this country > We know that those engaged upon the land cannot do very much unless they enclose their holdings with wire-netting for the exclusion of vermin. It has been suggested that the States-which , under the' Braddon section of the Constitution, are entitled to receive three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue collected by the Commonwealth-ar e at liberty to pracThat tically remit the taxation which we impose upon wire-netting to its users. "" I look upon that as a.most mischievous suggestion, and I hope that any such action would be held to be illegal. If it would not amount to a bonus under the Constitution, I hold that it would bepractically equivalent to that. It would place those who benefited by it in a different position from that occupied by persons in other parts of Australia, whose State Governments might not feel disposed to adopt a similar course of action. If we encourage the idea that the States Governments are able to grant to certain individuals in their own States an advantage which cannot be conferred upon others engaged in the same avocation in different States, we shall be introducing a most mischievous principle.  ber have any objection to the New South Wales Government refunding the duty upon wire-netting to the settlers within its borders if they so desired ?",33
250,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"It would be a very mischievous principle to encourage. It would be practically introducing a bonus system and would entirely upset our system of Inter-State free-trade. I intend to do my best to retain the item of wire netting upon the free list. I see no reason why an attack should be made upon the rural industries of Australia by altering the old condition of affairs. The rural population have enough difficulties to overcome without our adding to them. They isolated lives-they are subject to inI numerable disabilities - and they are be worthy of every encouragement. If there is one class in the community whom we ought to assist, it is that of the agriculturists and pastoralists. The imposition of to a tax upon an absolutely necessary article such as wire-netting, cannot be in the inbv the Treaterests of Australia.",33
251,Mr THOMAS BROWN,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"Calare) [4.49]. What - This afternoon, the Treasurer made a of very impassioned address in support of his pet duty upon wire-netting. He advocated it strongly as giving expression to the protectionist principles of which he is such an ardent champion. He intimated that the interests of 400 persons-employer s and employees-were at stake in this connection. I am speaking on behalf of not only employers and employees, but also of the consumers, who represent the great primary industries of the State, without which those employers and employees would have no vocation. In asking that fair consideration should be given to those other interests, I am only asking what is fair and legitimate, and pressing home to the Committee interests which are entitled to receive some attention. The rabbit pest affected, first of all, our thinly-populated districts and pastoral areas, and later still the agricultural and more closely settled districts. Since the pest became acute immense sums of money have been expended in efforts to control and limit it. As the outcome of past experience, extending over twenty years, and after vast expenditure, it is realized that one of the most effective weapons in fighting the pest is wire-netting fencing. This is not an absolute preventitive, because enclosed country is apt to become infested in time, so that other means have to the adopted. It is claimed, however, by those who have practical experience, that wire-netting restricts the spread of the pest from country which has been eaten out to more favoured country; and that it is only by this means that any practical work can be done in the way of preserving holdings and preventing the devastation of newer areas. The pest has reached such proportions as to become a national evil, our grazing and agricultural industries being in the grips of a lifeand-de.tth struggle. Surely, if this Parliament, in its wisdom, can do anvthing to help those industries to retain their position, it is a legitimate work for statesmen. Mr JO„SEPH COOK - This is on all-fours with the fodder duty.",33
252,Mr THOMAS BROWN,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"Practicall y Workers' so; but there is the great distinction that the fodder duties operate only in very diswire-netting astrous seasons, whereas the rabbit pest is tection. with us all the time, and is, even now, contralia verting good seasons into disastrous seaaverage sons, equal to any resulting from drought.",34
253,Mr HUTCHISON,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"We can make wireThat netting Here, whereas we cannot make fodThere der in times of drought.",34
254,Mr THOMAS BROWN,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"We have to tion, consider that, while we are engaged in hand-to-hand struggle with this terrible pest, the Australian manufacturers of wire netting are not able to cope with the requirements of those engaged in grazing and farming. Not only have the local manufacturers not been able to cope with the demand, but they have so raised their prices as to make them practically pfohi'bitive to a large section of the community. Some years ago the Government of South Australia, followed a little later by the Government of New South Wales, came to the assistance of the primary industries in this connection.",34
255,Mr HUTCHISON,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,That was on account of the prices charged by the importers.,34
256,Mr THOMAS BROWN,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"And by the local manufacturers, too. If the manufacturers in Australia had kept their - prices within a reasonable limit, 'and had indicated that they were in a fair way to meet the demand, the States Governments would never have stepped in and given the orders they did. The Government of New South Wales are as anxious as any honourable member here to encourage the manufacture of wire-netting; but they are not prepared, in the interests of a single industry, and of a few employees, to crush the great primary industries, which support all the other industries, including that of making wire-netting. It has been stated here that Lysaght Brothers can sell wire netting cheaply; but let any honourable member become a purchaser, and he will be very speedily undeceived. Much information has been given to us; but why did not the manufacturers go before the Tariff Commission, and, in that way, lay their case before Parliament and the country? Instead of going themselves, they' sent a representative of their sweated employees, who thought that an increase in the duty might do something towards bettering their position. On this point, the Tariff Commission report is as followsThe representative of the Wire Netting Union of New South Wales complained to your Commission that there was no duty on under the Tariff, and that the industry was suffering for want of adequate proThere was only one factory in Ausat present, and the men there did not more than half time all the year round. was before the Tariff was imposed. was no duty on wire-netting in New South Wales immediately before Federa^ it having been removed by the.Reid a Government; nor was there any duty on this commodity under the Victorian Tariff. The report of the Commission proceedsIn his opinion, a duty of 25 per cent, should be placed on English, and 30 per cent, on German netting. By placing such duties on importations, people would be encouraged to invest capital in the industry in other States, and employment would thus be materially increased. Only one witness gave evidence on the opposite side. That was a grazier from Queensland, and, in regard to him, the Commission's report is as followsA grazier in Queensland, owning extensive stations in that State, made strong objection to the suggested duty. Amongst the reasons given by the witness were-that it wouldprove pernicious to the whole community, especially to those interested in districts now free of rabbits, but .which were in danger, of being invaded by them; that the present price of wire-netting dered the erection of fences expensive, and that any serious addition to the cost of the material would make the erection of rabbit-proof fencing almost impracticable, with the result that in a few years a large areaof country would be rendered worthless by the invasion of rabbits. As an outcome of that evidence the protectionist section of the Commission recommended a duty of 25 per cent., and the report was signed by the four protectionist members-Si r John Quick (Chairman), Mr Francis Clarke, Mr W. G. Higgs, and Senator MCGregor. It was on that report, apparently, that the Government acted in submitting the item to this Committee. I undertake to say that* throughout the length and breadth of New South Wales no item out of the 440 odd in the Tariff, has called forth so much adverse criticism.",34
257,Mr HEDGES,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,It is the same all through Australia.,35
258,Mr THOMAS BROWN,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"I can well understand that, wherever the rabbit pest has made, itself felt, or has become a menaoe, there should be an outcry against this duty. It has been well said that the Tariff is designed, not to assist the primary producers engaged in agriculture and grazing, but to protect the rabbit against his human foes in the terrible contest for supremacy. In New South Wales, the rabbits first appeared on the sparsely populated pastoral areas in the western, division, and, as a result, holdings there have been practically abandoned. In a large number of cases, where attempts were made to bring, about settlement under homestead leases, hundreds of pounds spent in fencing, clearing, and making honies, have been lost. But the pest is assuming wider and more destructive' proportions. There was a time when it was considered that the depredations of the rabbit would be limited to sparsely populated areas, and to light sandy country where cover could readily be obtained by burrowing. It is nowrealized, however, that the pest is spreading from the abandoned areas' to the agricultural areas ? As I stated last night, in my own electorate, where farming operations have been carried on for the past thirty-five years without any thought of danger from the rabbit, the crops, during the past two years, have been lost through the depredations of the pest. Farmers now realise that unless they are able to enclose their cultivated, and also ren- their grazing, areas, they will not be able to hold their own against these incursions. They have been laying poison and adopting every recognised means of fighting the pest other than erecting wire netting around their holdings, and they now find that all their efforts in that direction count for nothing. A veritable wave of rabbits is flooding their land, and their position today is worse than it has ever been. Only those who have been able to enclose their holdings with wire-netting can hope to secure anything like a reasonable return .for their labour. Farmers have informed me that, owing to their failure to secure wire-netting, they found that it would be absolutely useless this year to put in any crops-that their experience of the last few years had forced them to that conclusion. The grazing areas have to be enclosed in this way, in order that the grass required for stock may be preserved. Last year I met in one part of my electorate land-holders who were purchasing fodder at considerable cost to feed their stock in the early autumn, their grass supplies having been almost depleted by the rabbits. The pest had eaten up all the grass with any nutriment in it, leaving nothing but the tall, dry, wiry grass, which was absolutely useless as a fodder. Considerable losses of stock occurred, and the percentage of lambs this year - has been materially reduced. These losses will be intensified unless the farmers, settlers, and graziers are able to protect their areas. The cost of enclosing a holding with wire-netting is very considerable. When the farmers, as well as thelarge pastoralists, found itnecessary to resort to that method of protecting their lands, the local manufacturer, as well as the importers, raised the prices to such an extent that a few months agu' wire-netting, which at one time could be purchased for £ 3 0 per mile and even less, was selling at from £ 4 0 to £ 4 5 per mile.",35
259,Mr JOHNSON,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,What gauge is used for rabbit-proof fencing?,36
260,Mr THOMAS BROWN,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"The class of netting used is i^-in. mesh, 42 inches and 36 inches wide. There are two gauges - the "" A "" and the "" B , "" and the "" A "" gauge is the stronger.",36
261,Mr JOHNSON,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,There is a 17 and an 18 gauge ?,36
262,Mr THOMAS BROWN,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"That is so. The 18 gauge was quoted to me in Sydney at £ 4 0 per mile, and the 17 gauge at £ 4 5 per mile. That quotation did not include the cost of sending the netting from Sydney to the districts where it was required. The Treasurer has said today that Lysaght Brothers, since the introduction of the Tariff, have reduced their prices by j£i per mile. Considering that the price shortly before the imposition of the Tariff was £ 2 6 per mile, and that it is now £ 4 0 their money. per mile, they have a very large margin on which to work. The small holders cannot place orders with Lysaght Brothers. They have to go to the retail houses to purchase even netting made by that firm, and, consequently, have to meet the additional charges imposed by the retailers - Can the Treasurer assure the Committee that, henceforth, the small settler as well as the big pastoralist' will be able to place his order with Lysaght Brothers and secure the more reasonable terms which he has mentioned ? If he cannot, then the position of the small settler will be as bad as it was before. A Government doesi not interfere - with the commercial arrangements made between consumers and producers unless there is grave reason for doing so. We have to remember, however, that after considerable agitation, the Government of New South Wales were induced to intervene and to invite tenders within the Commonwealth, and also in the old country, for the supplv of large quantities of wire-netting for distribution amongst settlers. A contract for the supply of 4,000 miles was entered into, not with a German firm, as one might have inferred from the statement of the Treasurer, but with a reputable firm in the old country which contracts largely for supplies required by the British Government. As soon as the wire-netting so contracted for was introduced the cry went forth ""The Government is giving the settlers an inferior article, which will not compare with the product of Lysaght Brothers, or with that supplied by the importers."" There was such a striking difference between the cost, of the article supplied direct by the Government and the price asked by private firms that many settlers thought there was possibly some ground for the outcry, and I was asked by a number of farmers in my electorate to investigate the facts. I did so, and found that the Government were supplying to farmers and settlers in the class indicated as good an article as that supplied by the local manufacturers or the importers. It was discovered in the first instance that there was a difference between what is known as the trade measurement and the actual measurement, and the first consignment received by the Government did not conform to the actual measurements which the contractor had undertaken to supply - The Government insisted that the terms of the contract should be adhered to, and the result was that the farmers who bought from them'obtained better value for",36
263,Mr BAMFORD,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,Where is the evidence to establish that statement?,36
264,Mr THOMAS BROWN,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,My authority is the Government officer charged with the supervision of the distribution of wire-netting in New South Wales.,36
265,Mr HENRY WILLIS,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,What is the difference between the trade measurement and actual measurement?,36
266,Mr THOMAS BROWN,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"I cannot say, but the Government official to whom I have referred said that it was so great that the State authorities insisted on actual measurements being supplied, and that the contracting company in the old country had to alter their machinery in order to comply with that demand. I was also informed that-the Government insisted upon the iron being properly galvanized. That is an important matter. If the iron be not properly galvanized, it speedily rusts, and soon becomes useless. It is highly important that the whole face of the netting should be properly and evenly galvanized. Owing to the action of the State Government, settlers are securing better conditions, both in respect of the measurement and the galvanizing of the wire-netting, than are obtainable in respect of the locally-manufactured article or wire-netting imported and sold by private firms.",36
267,Mr BAMFORD,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,I think that inspection is valueless.,36
268,Mr THOMAS BROWN,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"I can only say that those who have obtained supplies of netting from the State Government are anxious to secure more. The. Tariff was imposed at a very critical moment. About 2,500 miles of wire-netting had been delivered, and about 1,500 miles had yet to be landed, the effect of the duties being to increase the price of netting which the Government had been supplying at £ 2 6 per mile to £ 3 2 ios. per mile, and the price of other netting which had been landed at £22' ios. per mile tb ^28 4s. zd. per mile.",37
269,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN," I ask honourable members ,to conduct their conversation in less audible tones, as it is with difficulty that I hear the honourable member for Calare.",37
270,Mr THOMAS BROWN,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"I know that there is some excuse for the conversations which are taking place, because honourable members are comparing notes on this very important subject; but it is one to which the Committee should give very close attention. According to an article published in the Sydney Stock and Station Journal, cn the 16th August last, and headed "" A Crushing Duty,"" the Hon. James Ashton, ex-Secretary tor Lands in New South Wales, made this statement about the Tariff when first imposedOf the 4,000 miles to be supplied under the - current Government contract, about 2,500 miles have been delivered, leaving about 1,500 miles yet to be delivered. Of this, about 480 miles will arrive next week, on which the Government will have to pay duty to the extent. of over £3,000. At present wire-netting is free. The total duty payable in respect to the quantity yet to be received under the contract is about £10,000, and having regard to the average quantity of netting per individual up to date, that j£io,ooo will be paid by about 500 persons. Of course, if this crushing duty is preserved by the Commonwealth Parliament the question of counteracting it in some degree will have to ""be taken into consideration by the Government and Legislature of the State of New South Wales. At the present time it would be premature and ill-advised to take steps in this direction. Afterwards, Mr Carruthers, the late State Premier, took very drastic steps, seizing .480 miles ot wire-netting which was under the - control of the Customs. must be admitted that he had a very considerable grievance, I do not think that it will be generally held that he took the correct course on that occasion. Mr Ashton continuedI am hopeful that when the matter in all its bearings is put before the Commonwealth Government and Parliament, there will be a drastic modification of the present proposal. . I may add that at the time. I received the news of the proposed duty I was in the middle of negotiations for a further supply of netting, running into from 2,000 to 3,000 miles. In consequence of the proposal that has been made, and the uncertainty that surrounds the matter, negotiations have - been interrupted and nothing further is at present being done. The sooner the matter is finally dealt with by the Commonwealth authorities, therefore,"" the better for those concerned in the use of wire-netting. Then, in the Forbes Times, of the 17th August, appeared this statementThe Minister for Lands stated that the Department had in hand orders for gjooo miles of wire-netting. The question as to whether the State Government would be compelled to pay the increased duty was under consideration. The New South Wales Parliament voted a sum for the purchase of wire-netting, to be re-sold to settlers on terms allowing the deferment of payments for a period of ten years. But many were so desirous of obviating the difficulties resulting from long terms, that they paid in cash, and the Government, wisely, I think, intended to use this sum in purcHasing more netting, thus doing everything possible to meet the demand all over the State. Applications for netting came mostly from the small land-holders in the agricultural districts, requiring the supply of 9,000 miles. But the imposition of the Tariff disarranged everything, and left matters in, a state of chaos. Practically all the netting which was on its way here has since been held in bond.",37
271,Mr CHANTER,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,A great deal of it has recently been released.,37
272,Mr THOMAS BROWN,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"I am glad to hear that that is so. Some of the farmers who have been trying to keep the rabbits off their wheat, and urgently need wire-netting to enclose their holdings, went to the expense of visiting Sydney to see what could be done, but they informed me that nothing could be done until this Parliament had dealt with the matter. The state of affairs in the wheat-growing districts impelled me to take strong action in endeavouring to bring about the early consideration of this duty, instead of allowWhilst it ing it to be dealt with in its order in the schedule, which would have meant a delay of some weeks. The Minister has spoken of the agitation for the removal of the duty as hysterical. But the farming community is not generally regarded as hysterical. In fact, the jibe is often uttered that the farmers are so slow that they do not see the importance of things as leadily as do their better informed and quicker city brethren. But when they are hard hit with a real grievance, they place their case strongly before those who are in a position to remedy it. I represent a part of New South Wales which is largely devoted to agriculture. While there are big grazing areas in it, there are also many agriculturists spread about it. Consequently, I have received a sheaf of communications protesting against the duties. Condobolin is an important town in the Calare Division, on the border between the wheat-growing and the purely pastoral country, where settlers have great difficulty in protecting their holdings against the ravages of the rabbits. At a meeting held there, on the n t h August, and presided over by the Mayor, Mr J. T. Brady, this resolution was carriedThat this meeting of all persons interested in the welfare of the State emphatically protests against the proposed Tariff on wire-netting. In the letter conveying that resolution to me, the Mavor says that- : Wire-netting is 'essential for our mutual protection, and the purchase of it is forced upon us by the presence of what may be justly termed a national calamity. From the same centre I have received similar resolutions carried by the Pastures Protection Board, the Laehlan Shire Council, supporting the proposals of the Bogan Shire Council, and the Yass Pastures Protection Board. From Forbes, I have a communication which I read the other day, the Pastures Protection Board there also having carried a resolution protesting against the duty. In the letter communicating the fact to me, the secretary says The land-owner now finds it absolutely imperative to wire-net his land before he attempts to cultivate it. . . . The increased charge will , for the most part, f all on the small holders, for those with larger and more valuable estates have already purchased and erected their netting. I have also received a communication, which I have handed to the Minister, from Mr Charles Burton, the Secretary to the Farmers' and Settlers' Association, a very strong and representative body, which has protested against the duties on the ground that they amount to class taxation. I do not know what was in the minds of the movers and supporters of that resolution. In my view, the proposal has been put forward on the grounds on which protectionists usually justify the imposition of duties, and, if it is a class tax, the objection applies equally to a number of other Mr Thomas Brown. items in the Tariff. I therefore wrote to the secretary on the subject, but so far have received no reply, and therefore cannot tell the Committee why the'Association regards this as class taxation. I have also a communication from the Goobang Shire Council, which meets in Parkes, protesting on behalf of the land-owners against the duties. I saw, too, in the local press the report of a meeting of citizens and land-owners in the vicinity, at which both protectionists and free-traders condemned the duties as hurtful to the landed interests, and inflicting an injury upon those engaged in farming and agricultural pursuits, but I have not received a:iy direct communication from the promoters of the meeting. I have received a communication from Mr A. Stewart, secretary of the Parkes Farmers' and Settlers' Association, who desires me to convey to the Minister a resolution arrived at by that body. That resolution is to the effect that a tax should not be imposed upon wire-netting. It further contains the suggestion that the manufacture of this material should be encouraged, and that the best way to encourage it is, not by imposing the proposed duty, which .will have the effect of crippling the industries which have to pay it, but hv offering a bonus upon its production until the industry has become established. I have similar objections from the Molong Pastures' and Protection Board, from Weddin and Grenfell, from the Pastures and Protection Board at Young, and from the Farmers' and Settlers' Association at Bena, which is located in the district of Condobolin. Mr W. A. Ewers, in writing to me upon the matter, says The State Government has made prniseworthv efforts lo supply harassed farmers with cheap netting, and their action has been a great boon to the local farmers as well as to farmers and settlers throughout the State. It is a regrettable fact that in consequence of the increase of duty and the increased cost to farmers, numbers of orders for netting have had to be countermanrffd. The Condobolin Pastures and Protection Board had to cancel several orders at its last meeting. I have received similar communications from the Farmers' and Settlers' Associations at Bogan Gate, Eugowra, and Ponto. Ponto, I may inform honourable members, is situated in'the neighbourhood of Wellington, and the communication emanating from the local Farmers' and Settlers' Association, shows the extent to which the rabbit pest has travelled over this wheat-growing district. I am also in receipt of similar communications from the Boree Farmers' and Settlers' Association, from the Mandamah Farmers' and Settlers' Association, from tin: Reefton Farmers' and Settlers'' Association. I also noticed a report in the Sydney Morning Herald, that the Cowra Farmers' and Settlers' Association had instructed its secretary to communicate with me, protesting against the imposition of the proposed duty. So far, however, his letter is not to hand. Further, I have received communications in reference to this matter from the Sevastopol Farmers' and Settlers' Association in the Temora district, from the Condobolin Pastures and Protection Board, from the Goobang Shire Council, and from the Peak Hill Pastoral and Agricultural Society. I shall support the amendment, of the honourable member for Illawarra, and if I cannot get the duty upon wire netting remitted, I shall endeavour to approach as closely to that result as possible.' At the same time, I shall consider any fair proposal for the encouragement of the local manufacture of this article by means of rhe payment of a bonus. I desire to see wire netting made within the Commonwealth if it can be placed upon the market at a reasonable price. But I am not prepared to severely handicap our large producing interests for the benefit of a single manufacturer and a few hundred employees. I shall give their interests as fair consideration as possible, in view of the other large interests which are at stake. A great deal has been said by the Treasurer in reference to the injury which will be inflicted upon those who have invested their capital in the manufacture of wire-netting, and upon the 400 workmen employed in the industry if we do not agree to the duty proposed. But I would ask him whether he has investigated the conditions under which that factory has hitherto been operating? In the Worker- a labour newspaper published in New South Wales-of the 18th April last, I find an article with the following headlines:-""Strik e Workers,"" ''A Sweated -"" Familv Men on Ten Shillings to Twentysix Shillings a Week."" The article saysA l l the workers in wire-netting, numbering about seventy-five, employed by Lysaght Bros, and Company, Sydney, refused on Monday to work any longer under conditions which amount to nothing short of gross sweating.",37
273,Mr FRAZER,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,Does not the honourable member think that if the item be placed upon the free list the condition of those workmen will be rendered worse?,39
274,Mr THOMASBROWN,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"I know that"" whilst the manufacturers have been getting an enormous price for their wire-nettingas much as from £ 4 0 to £ 4 5 per mile being the retail price-the y have been sweating their employees, who have had to live upon wages ranging from ios. to 263. per week.",39
275,Mr LIDDELL,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,A r e those the wages of the weavers?,39
276,Mr THOMAS BROWN,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"No . If the honourable member will turn to the report of the Tariff Commission, he will find that the witness who represented Messrs. Lysaght Brothers' industry, and who asked that body to recommend the imposition of an increased duty upon wire-netting, describes himself as i.n ""expert weaver."" When he was asked the wages that' he was receiving, he said "" About two guineas a week."" The less expert hands receive a much smaller wage. Further, in this very factory a system has been in vogue of payingoperatives according to the quantity of work done- a kind of task system. Under it, things were cut down to such a level that men were unable to earn a decent wage. Perhaps I had better read to the Committee the statement made by Mr J. Gallon, the secretary of the Wire-Workers' Union of New South Wales, who, in addressing a meeting at Five Dock after the operatives had gone on strike, saidFor several months there has been much dissatisfaction among the machinists through the management delaying redress of grievances. On Saturday the men determined to bring matters to an issue. A deputation again asked the management for better conditions, pointing out that the company was continually putting on new men to learn the work, to the disadvantage of the older hands, who were able and willing to - do it. The poor pay made at the work under present conditions was scandalous. He himself had only made 4s. during a night shift, and several married men with children were only of Wire making from ios. to 26s. per week, owing to Industry,"" the management not finding sufficient material to work up. Under the circumstances all they could do was to cease working as a protest. The report goes on to saySeveral of the men spoke to the.same effect, and gave their experience of sweating at the works. One told how in a night shift he only earned 3s'. gd. Another in two hours at night had earned io£d., and then had to stop for - want of material. It was stated that the wage . of machining one mile of wire-netting was 28s. ' That is the amount which is paid"" for the manufacture of a mile of netting as against the retail price of from £ 4 0 to £45. The report continuesI t was decided to advertise the fact that they refused to work under the conditions obtaining at the works.",39
277,Mr LIDDELL,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"Wha f does the honourable member mean by ""machining""?",40
278,Mr THOMAS BROWN,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"The machining is the expert work of weaving. Here is another report from the Worker of 2nd May last, dealing with the same matterThe 70 or more wire-netting machinists who left Lysaght Brothers and Company's Sydney works because the firm persisted in paying them far below a living wage and refused to supply the quantity and quality of material agreed upon by both sides in the Arbitration Court, are giving some interesting particulars concerning the sanitary-conditions existing on the unsewered premises. The men suffered badly owing to the windows of their department having been broken a long time ago and never having been mended. The boy employees have for some . time been compelled to work close to an unsewered structure erected within a few feet of them - The floor of the works (one storey) is unboarded, and in bad weather turns to black mud. The firm, at latest, ha-d a .score or so of their own galvanizers and some outsiders trying to learn wire netting, but the top wage earned' since the experts left has been 22s. a week, and most earned much less. Four of the new hands have left, and declare themselves satisfied that it is impossible to make a living on wire-netting at Lysaght's. A few of the skilled workers who left; have got casual jobs, and the secretary of the Union is appealing through the Sydney Labour Council for assistance to meet urgent cases. Steady though the men were, it was impossible to save anything out of the firm's miserable pay. The men are all full y determined to have to do with the company while it runs a sweatingshop. These are the conditions that prevailed in this factory only a few months ago, when the demand for wire-netting was at its maximum, and the price had been raised to the enormous figure I have quoted.",40
279,Mr SAMPSON,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,Why is the factory legislation of New South Wales so far behind ? Mr THOMA S BROWN - The honourable member had better ask the Legislative Council of the State the reason.,40
280,Mr LIDDELL,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,What dividend does the company pay?,40
281,Mr THOMASBROWN,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"I have nothad an opportunity to ascertain what dividend is paid. We were told by the Treasuier today that Lysaght Brothers commenced business with a big debt, and no doubt they have been working a dead-horse for a number of years. I presume the re-ports I have read are fairly correct, otherwise I cannot conceive of their being spread broadcast without the firm taking some action. The fact remains that the question of the wages and conditions was taken to the Arbitration Court, and a certain wage Was fixed; but the employers defeated the order of the Court by refusing to sup-' ply the expert and better-paid men with the material necessary to earn decent remuneration. On the other hand, the employers engaged learners and low-paid men to work the proper material, with the result that the higher-paid men left the industry, and, I understand, a number of them have preferred to go to work in the sugar-fields of Queensland. This is a phase of the question worth consideration, when the Treasurer makes a strong appeal to honourable members to penalize our primary industries, in order to assist this company. Whatever profits have been made by the company have certainly not gone into the pockets of those who do the work, seeing that men with families were expected to live on wages ranging from 10s. to 26s. per week. Wire-neFting was one of the items in the first Commonwealth T a r if f ; but, in consequence of the rabbit pest, it was decided to admit the commodity free, and the conditions which led honourable members then to put wire-netting on the free list, have since been intensified rather than diminished. On that occasion it was largely the interests of the large pastoral holders which had to be considered, because the small settlers in the agricultural areas were not affected by the pest to the same notnin<; extent that they are now. The latter were then content with the cheaper methods of poisoning, and so forth, but since then the large holders have enclosed and subdivided their areas, and, to some extent, got the rabbits under control, whereas the agricultural country between Condobolin and Cowra., or Orange, has become severely infested. It is now recognised that the only means of combating the rabbits is furnished in wire-netting. We have to remember that the users of wire netting have not oniv to consider the first cost, but also the expense of upkeep, because, unless the fencing is kept in good order, it becomes useless.",40
282,Mr LIDDELL,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,The annual cost of up- . keep is from £ 5 to £ 7 per mile.,40
283,Mr THOMAS BROWN,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"That estimate, I believe, is a reasonable one; but, of course, a good deal depends on the. nature of the country. Many of the areas I have mentioned are subject to heavy rain, and, as they are not like the flat country, to be met with further west, the rushing of the water destroys a good deal of the netting, and, as I say, unless it is kept in efficient repair, it ceases to be effective. I hope that the Committee will not be led away by any stract theories as to the advantages or disParty. advantages of protection. I can assure my protectionist friends that if anything will discredit their theories with the pracopen tical men in the country, it is a duty or, wire-netting. I appeal to the Committee the interests of the producing classes to little. regard this question from the point of view from which it was regarded when the last Tariff was under consideration. If I canthere not get wire-netting placed on the free list, I shall endeavour to make the duty as low tection scheme. as possible. If the Treasurer wishes to the industry, he ought to submit a matured and reasonable scheme for a bonus, when I , for one, shall be prepared to give some help.",40

Whilst I say however, I question the attitude of the orable member for Calare, who advocates absolutely free ports for wire-netting. mand. While the honourable member does that, describes to us the condition of affairs anticipation of a higher duty. quite recently when wire-netting was ing at a high price- a price brought about, not by any scarcity in the products for manufacture, but simply by the increased demand. In other words, advanby tage was taken of the necessities of the farmers to increase the price of wire-netis ting, either by the manufacturer or the local has importer, one can scarcely say which. But wealth. the fact remains that the farmers were imposed upon, and that before the new Tariff rates were collected. The honourable member for Calare also detailed the cireven of the 30 per cent. duty. cumstances under which the employees this industry worked in Sydney, and clearly showed that they were reaping absolutely no benefit from the increased demand. The case of the employees is a pitiable and under free-trade too! Well, lot of employees under protection is to as bad, we are certainly between the devil and the deep sea.",41
285,Mr REID,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,It is as bad in many cases.,41

We can at least achieve our object under that system. I should support an amendment designed to preimposed, vent the dumping which would otherreadiness wise, in all probability, take place. It is always open to foreign manufacturers to take advantage of the cheap labour at too high. their disposal to destroy local competition in our markets. The cheapness of their stand-point ? production enables them to place their products on the Australian market at a low price, but they' do not give the public advantage .of it unless they have in view some such motive as has dominated the Standard Oil Company-the capturing the local market in order that it may be ferred. subsequently exploited. In anticipation of the ultimate imposition of a heavy those who have the advantage of cheap polies ? labour abroad, in the absence of any duty whatever, would no doubt flood the market and spoil the growth of the manufacture. A slight duty is necessary to prevent ploitation of our market, and I should think that a duty of io per cent, as against imports of wire-netting from ""ral foreign countries, and of 5 per cent, against those coming from the United imports. Kingdom, would be sufficient' for a time. Failing that, and rather than permit tinuance in our factories of the harrowing labour conditions so graphically described by the honourable member for Calare, as well as any imposition on our farmers, should support the fresh Government prowe posal of 15 per cent, and 10 per cent. I tend, however, to move an amendment, if no other honourable member does so, that duties on wire-netting be reduced to 10 cent, in the case of foreign imports, and to 5 per cent, on those coming from the United Kingdom. I should favour the imposition of such duties until the industhe try was so thoroughly established in Ausquire. tralia that it would be able to cope with the local demand, and afterwards a prohibisurrounded tive duty. I should, however, support such a duty only on the understanding that local manufacturers should sell at a reasonthe able price, and treat their employees as human beings ought to be treated. By such means only can we develop Australia on better lines than the unsatisfactory ones which have hitherto obtained, and which would continue if we allowed individual Mr Carr. enterprise, of which we have heard so much of late, to go absolutely unchecked.",41

The question is whether or not are prepared to build up the wire-netinting industry at the expense of the primary producers, who themselves find everything the that we require to' build up a great Comper' monwealth.

I know of stations in New South Wales from the which no income has been derived during last ten or fifteen years. This has been due solely to the depredations of the rabbits. Those who by erecting wire-netting fences and resorting to various other means of coping with the pest have been able to keep it down are bearing the heat and burden of the day, and we should do what we can to assist them. Instead of heavily taxing our primary producers we should encourage them by giving them their wire-netting at as low a price as possible. I think that a duty of i o per cent, on'foreign imports, and of 5 per cent, on imports from Great Britain would be high enough in this case, and I hope that the Treasurer will agree to the amendment suggested by the honourable member for 'Macquarie. There are other considerations to be borne in mind. We desire to develop the country. Instead of having a few sheep carried on large areas, we desire to see a large number carried on small areas. The agricultural and pastoral industry is the most important in Australia, and I hope that the reduced duties that I have just mentioned will meet with the approval of ancl be adopted, by the Committee. I certainlv am not prepared to go beyond them. It seems to me that we should have disposed, first of all, of the question of preference, and that before dealing with this item we need to know whether the Government intend to allow the drawn wire used in the manufacture of netting to come in free - It would be idle to remove the duty on wire-netting and put it on again in the event of our imposing a duty on the raw material.

Throughout New South Wales there are people who are waiting anxiously for supplies of wire-netting to enclose their holdings. I have received from a number of my constituents petitions praying that wire-netting may be placed on the free list. Communications on the subject have reached me from Pastures Protection Boards and Farm ers' and Settlers' Associations, and other bodies, at .Wellington, Mudgee, Hill End, Hargraves, Casillis, Merriwa, Curra Creek, Singleton, Murrurundi, Scone, Denman, Musswellbrook; also from the Cudgegong and other municipalities where meetings have been held and resolutions carried praying Parliament to place wire-netting on the free list. Those meetings comprised protectionists and free-traders. Representa-. tives of both views have written to me urging that the duty on wire-netting should be removed. The Committe has done well in giving preference to the consideration of this item, and the next duty before us is to do justice to the primary industries. It is all very well for those who are interested in the establishment of secondary industries to say that they seek protection for the manufacturer. I take it that they also All necessaries of life come from him, and if the cost of primary production be increased then the cost of living to the manufacturer, have and the artisan engaged in a secondary industry, must likewise be increased. That being so, representatives of manufacturing 0 districts will conserve the interests of those for of whom they think they are the special representatives by dealing with this item without delay, and removing the duties If that be done, those who have Our already sown their crops will be able to enclose their holdings with wire-netting, and That is as much as some of them expect to be able to do.

If grazing areas in rabbit infested districts are not protected by wire-netting there will be no grass for the sheep, and pastoralists, to whom a drop in the lambing percentages is a very serious matter, will sustain further losses.

But in this industry the probability is - that the difference of £ 1 4 to which I have referred is divided between the manufacturers and the middlemen.

329,Mr HENRY WILLIS,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"I cannot say. The representative of the company who gave evidence before the Tariff Commission was unable to give any information as to the profits made by the firm. Why, I ask, did not the principals give evidence before that body? Had they done so we might have been able to ascertain exactly the position which the industry occupies. But. instead of doing so, they preferred to approach the Treasurer direct, and to make their representations to him. H a d honourable they tendered evidence to. the Tariff Commission they would have had to submit to a searching cross-examination, and the result might have been damaging to those who advocate the granting of a larger measure of protection to the industry. The only inference that we can draw, therefore, is that the incessive cost. dustry is succeeding very well, and does not require further protection. It lived in South Wales under the operation of a prosmaller tective duty of i o per cent., and it was extinguished even when it was exposed a free-trade Tariff for five or six years, and a further period of five years under the first Federal Tariff. Since then the output of the factory has increased, and the number of hands engaged in the industry has also increased. out the aid of any duty whatever, Messrs. Lvsaght Brothers have reduced the price wire-netting by £ i per ton.

330,Mr HENRY WILLIS,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"The small land-holder experiences great difficulty obtaining his supply of wire-netting direct from the manufacturer. At the time large consignments of this material are in bond, but the small settler who ordered his supply months ago is unable to take delivery of it at the increased cost £ 6 IOS. per ton. Consequently the imspelter. porter, who practically indented it for him, has to allow the importation to remain in bond until the duty has been reduced. To my mind, the most satisfactory course for ment made by the honourable member. us to adopt is to place wire-netting upon the free list. The industry has succeeded very well under the old Tariff, and therewhich fore the item might fairly, be placed upon the list of exemptions. The ravages the rabbit are felt not only by the land-holder, but by the small. The pastoralist who requires a large quantity of wire-netting has already ordered the smaller land-holders have been unable to purchase their sunolies.

If the Government proposal be adopted, the of man upon the land who is already in debt will be obliged to pay the increased cost of ton. wire-netting, and I therefore appeal to the honourable members to make trie cost an of that article as little as possible.

As already pointed out by more than one honourable member, the rabbit pest is a national calamity- a national foe which settlers are' fighting throughout the length and breadth of the Commonwealth. The pest is becoming so grievous and serious a danger that the time may come when, not only the States, as States, must take action, but when the Commonwealth itself will find it necessary to take a hand; because regulations which are made within one State may not be sufficient to protect an adjoining State. ever, it was with astonishment that I heard the Ministry propose the duty which appears in the Tariff. I could not imagine what dictated their course of action, because it seemed to me to be placing a serious charge on the very people-whom we desire-to help, even under ordinary conditions, and at present the conditions are extraordinary, inasmuch as they are fighting a common enemy. Not oniy are large squatting interests affected, but the smaller holders have also to face great danger. Only this afternoon, a settler who has 20 acres, told me that, in consequence of an adjoining proprietor having abandoned his area he had been compelled to erect wire netting in order to protect himself from the pest. T should have liked to see wire netting free, though I consider that if a moderate duty be imposed, it cioes not necessarily follow that those who require wire-netting will have to pay a price materially in - advance of that which would have to be paid if the commodity were free. We are entitled to regard this as a large revenue-producing item, and, therefore, after giving the matter consideration, I have come to the conclusion that duties of 10 per cent, and 5 per cent, will not prejudicially affect the interests of either the industry or the consumers. Such duties as I have mentioned would, I think, be a fair compromise. This is the first item commodity on the free list. on which the question of preference to Great Britain has arisen, and I regret that we have not been able to debate it at length in order to determine on general principles what our attitude is to be. . Personally T consider that the wire-netting which is made in Great Britain is, as a rule, of better - quality than that imported from the Continent, some of the larger works of which I have personally visited. This is one of the cases, I think, in which we mav agree to preference to Great Britain being granted. I have already inquired from you, Mr Chairman, whether I would be in order in moving an amendment to the effect that the duties shall be 10 per cent, and s per cent., but I understand that at this stage it is not competent for me to make the proposal. At the proper time, however, I shall do so, believing, as I say, that the consumer will not have to bear such ah impost as will place him in a disadvantageous position. I was surprised to find that spelter enters so largely into this question-that almost one-third-cer tainly more than one-fourth-of the maHow- terial used in this industry, apart from the wire, is spelter, and we may hope for a very large increase in the production of that commodity. The general manager of the Broken Hill . Proprietary has recently arrived after an exhaustive investigation throughout Europe and the United States, with a view to the establishment of works at Broken Hill , which will allow no nossibility of doubt that all the spelter necessary will be obtainable within the Commonwealth.",46

It is perfectly evident that the high duties, which are now paralyzing the supplies of wire-netting all over Australia, are doomed, and that, at the worse, we shall have duties of 10 per cent, and 5 per cent., instead of duties of 30 per cent, and 25 per cent.

But the Denton Hat Mills and the Victorian Woollen Mills receive a rebate of every penny paid by way of duty.",48
341,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,What about the New South Wales woollen mills? Why does not the right honourable member be,48
342,Mr REID,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"Then , let us speak also of the New South Wales, woollen mills and the mills of that State. The principle in each case is the same. Why this extraordinary back-door free-trade contrivance for and the benefit of two industries? What an outrage it is on honest, straightforward . . . Rebate : Tariff reform.",48
343,Mr BRUCE SMITH,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"And the hat mills are paying 15 per cent, dividends !",48
344,Mr REID,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"There is always some reason for extraordinary actions of this kind. They are not done for mere f u n . It is not for mere f u n that rabid protectionists are allowing foreign machinery for the woollen The hat and hat mills to be landed free of duty in these States. What they do for the woollen and hat mills, protected to the extent of 45 per cent., they ought to do for the farmers and pioneers of Australia; but they should do it in a more straightforward way. Do not let us exact a duty at the Customs House, and provide that those who pay it may secure a refund on going round to the back-door. An infinitely more straightforward course would be to put the goods on the free lis t",48
345,Mr BRUCE SMITH,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,Those who have paid duty on wire-netting cannot obtain a . refund.,48
346,Mr REID,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"Certainl y not. There is no country more devoted to protection than is the United States of America, and yet, when that awful calamity, resulting in the destruction of Boston, occurred, all the protectionists of the United States met, and within twenty-four hours established free trade in building materials for the benefit This is an of the distressed people whose homes had. been destroyed by fire. What the great rabid protectionist power of the United States of America did in twenty-four hours for the homeless people of Boston, this Committee is not prepared to do for the farmers and settlers who are fighting a plague infinitely worse than a fire. When a fire has reduced one's home to ashes, one has a chance of building another on the same site, but the trouble in regard to rabbits is that the more we appear to exterminate them the more they come upon us. It is all very well for owners of houses in our great cities to collect their rents; but we are dealing with people who are 'over and over again deprived of the results of their industry for a whole year by this everlasting ineradicable pest, and surely the appeal which those people make to the Parliament is equal to the appeal which Boston made, and not in vain, to Congress.",48
347,Mr GLYNN,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,There is no opening in this case for compromise.,49
348,Mr REID,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,I should think not. ',49
349,Mr GLYNN,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,There ought to be a straight-out vote against the duties on wire netting.,49
350,Mr REID,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"It is not for nie or any one else to dictate to any honourable member what his duty is. I have very strong opinions upon this question, but I do not presume to cram them down any one's throat. I merely say that there are times when men should be able to sink even their desire for an effective protective policy in order to give a helping hand to those who all over the lands of Australia are fighting hard against a gigantic curse. When a bountiful season comes this curse multiplies. The bounty of nature is appropriated by the armies of rabbits, and when drought comes the last blades of grass intended to keep alive the last sheep are eaten by the pest. In drought or in plenty we have a gigantic curse eating into the heart of Australia. I would ask honourable members who talk of the employment of 300 or 400 men in the wire-netting factory to consider the majestic array of men, women and children scattered under pioneering conditions over the trying surface of the Australian Continent. Let them compare the lot of the half-million people crowded into the fifty or sixty square miles of Melbourne or the fifty or sixty square miles of Sydney - wit h their comparatively steady employment, and with all the comforts, refinements, and enjoyments of civilization which they possess-wit h that of the people attached to the lands of the country. talk about closer settlement, but it is the closer settlement of the rabbits which is destroying Australia. It is only the closer settlement of human beings that will enable us to cope with the pest. Do not honourable members who are ardently desirous of promoting closer settlement think that the advance guards-the men who are dotted over the surface of Australia, laying the foundations and providing the facilities for future millions to be settled on the land under the magnificent and proper policy of closer settlement-deserv e some slight consideration ? Let us pension the 400 workers in the wire-netting industry; let us give them £ 2 0 0 a year each as a retiring allowance. That would be infinitely better.",49
351,Mr WILKS,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,That would be,49
352,Mr REID,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,Perhaps I may be allowed to speak.,49
353,Mr WILKS,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,Perhaps I may be allowed to make an interjection.,49
354,Mr REID,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"The honourable member must allow me to say that I look urx>n this problem, as one of the most serious that we have to face.",49
355,Mr WILKS,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,And I look upon the food duties as constituting a serious problem.,49
356,Mr REID,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,The point is that I am at present addressing the Committee.,49
357,Mr WILKS,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"The right honourable member likes-, when it suits him, to get in an interjection.",49
358,Mr REID,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"Quite so; my honourable . friend, I am sure, will forgive me. Mr 'HUGHES - The honourable member for Dalley had better cross the floor of the House.",49
359,Mr REID,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,I do not invite ode of my oldest and best friends to cross over to the other side of the House. I have not the arrogance and self-confidence of the Treasurer. I do not order honourable members of this House to cross the floor because they do. not agree with me.,49
360,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,I think I remember an occasion in the New South Wales Parliament when the 'right honourable member did so.,49
361,Mr REID,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,If I did it was under the wicked influence of the honourable member. It was another instance of evil associations corrupting even the best of good manners. When the honourable member for Grey venWe tured tb suggest the omission of this item the Treasurer at once said,49
362,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"Oh , no..",49
363,Mr REID,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"Well, at all events, a minute, if not a moment, later the Treasurer said to the honourable member, "" You are going to vote against the Government."" Honourable members should be allowed everv reasonable degree of independence in dealing with the Tariff.",49
364,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,I do not wish it to be turned into a revenue Tariff.,49
365,Mr REID,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"The honourable member is perfectly entitled to that view. love for the Denton Hat Mills - was so ardent that he gave them free-trade in' German machinery and 35 per cent, protection. The magnificent generosity which could lead him to enrich the resources of the hat mills of Australia might be extended to the farmers and settlers of its six States. I am asking the honourable member to do for OUT great national industries, struggling with drought and disaster, what he has done, without the slightest pressure, for the woollen mills and the hat mills of the Commonwealth. In order to show the urgency of this matter, I would point out that the imports of wire-netting have risen from £ 9 5 , 0 0 0 worth in 1903 to 20,000 worth in 1906. The fact that wire-netting is the only remedy for the rabbit pest is shown by the marvellous expansion of our imports of that commodity. Some people seem to think that Lysaght Brothers have been struggling on a falling market against foreign importers, and that the Tariff treatment of the industry has always injured them. According to a business publication, The Australasian Hardware and Machinery Journal, in April,' 1906, full prices were being asked for all grades of wire-netting, and on 25th May, of the same year, it was reported by the same journal that an advance of £ 1 per mile all round was made in the price of Lysaght's. In August, 1906, there is this statement- "" Lysaght's have put their price up another £ J per mile."" I am not blaming them. The importers put up their prices whenever they have a chance to do so. No man can fail to have a wholesouled disgust for many of the profits which 'the importers derive; but do not let us' differentiate them from others.",50
366,Mr JH CATTS,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,Was not the price of wire-netting last year raised all over the world?,50
367,Mr REID,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"Of course it was. I am merely showing that it was not a falling , but a rising, tide for Lysaght Brothers. Probably prices were raised for a reason which left them no more profit than they secured before. It is common knowledge that the raw material of the wire-netting industry has increased in price all over the world, and it does not follow that this increase of £ 1 per mile represented any greater profit.",50
368,Mr HUMECOOK,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,It was a rise which was not a rise. 0,50
369,Mr REID,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"In noint of fact, it might But his have meant no rise in profit. I do not like to quote the views of interested people respecting these matters. We are all assailed-and properly assailed-with , letters regarding the Tariff. People have a right to give us all the information they can in reference to it ; but we must regard with a certain degree of caution all statements that we receive.",50
370,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,With a great amount of caution.,50
371,Mr REID,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"If the honourable member had received with a greater amount of caution the application of the Denton Hat Mills for free-trade in machinery, it would have been better.",50
372,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,Not at all.,50
373,Mr REID,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"Did the honourable member grant them free-trade in machinery without being asked to do so? I shall give the name of the firm responsible for the statements I am about to quote, so that honourable members mav take them for what they are worth. A firm which imports wire-netting, in a letter addressed to an honourable member, writes :With regard to a statement reported in the Sydney papers as made by Sir William Lynethat since the imposition 'of the duty the local manufacturers have reduced their prices by £ 1 per mile, and to another statement published in the Sydney papers, that these manufacturers are willing to give a bond that they will not increase their prices if the duty goes on; we beg to state for your information that the prices lately ruling have been the highest known for many yearson account of the high costs for materials which have, existed all over the world. These prices are now rapidly falling, and if the duty were taken off today the price of imported netting, instead of being £ 1 per mile less than prices lately, ruling, would be from ^5 to £ 7 per mile less, according to size.",50
374,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,Is that a letter from an importing firm?,50
375,Mr REID,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"Yes . Surely we must listen to these people. They are still allowed to live in Australia. The letter is from Messrs. Noyes Brothers, a well known Sydney f i r m ; not mere adventurers. I mention the name so that their statements, if incorrect, may be contradicted.",50
376,Mr KNOX,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,It is a very good firm.,50
377,Mr REID,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"Not very long ago, the price of wire-netting was increased by £ i o , . and it is therefore very easy now to reduce it by £ 1 , with a falling market. The simple-minded Treasurer, if Messrs. Noyes Brothers spoke to him, would curl up as though Satan were tempting him from the path of virtue, because they a,re importers; but Messrs. Lysaght Brothers he thinks entitled to share in the benefits of the high duties which the Government has proposed. I have no animosity against these manufacturers. They are as much entitled to consideration as are any others. making of wire-netting is not an intricate mechanical process The frame being fixed for the weaving of netting of a certain width and mesh, all that is necessary is to feed the machine with wire. can do the work, and probably many of them are employed.",50

379,Mr JOHNSON,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,T-They are mostly boys. There are four boys to a man.,51
380,Mr REID,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"If the importations of wire netting were stopped, it would mean an increase of only 23,000 tons in the local manufacture, and the labour to which additional employment would be given is of a most primitive character.",51

382,Mr REID,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"Yes . Moreover, all the raw material required is imported, though that is no reflection on the manufacturers.",51
383,Mr HUGHES,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,Has gentleman worked out the real margin of profit ?,51
384,Mr REID,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"No . I recognise that it is difficult fo dogmatize on business propositions of this sort. But the local manufacturers, who had an mterest in putting a good case before the Tariff Commission, preferred to send one of their hands, instead of giving the members of the Commission an opportunity to learn their position from themselves. As a rule, when manufacturers are struggling with adversity and free-trade, they are not averse from making their position known. must be remembered that we are not asking for a new g if t for the farmers and settlers. There has been free-trade in wire-nettini for years. In New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, and Western Australia, this is a larger question than in the other States. But under the Commonwealth Tariff, wire-netting has always been admitted free of duty. member for Adelaide, whose absence from this Chamber we sincerely mourn at all times, upon whom, whatever I may think of his views, I have always looked as one of those progressive spirits' who have a vast influence for good, and Sir George Turner, both agreed that, in view of the difficulty and urgency of dealing with the rabbit pest, wire-netting should be admitted duty free. But now, when the evil is ten times worse than it was, the Government proposes to increase the duties to 30 and 25 per cent. But the As the honourable member for Calare has shown, the rabbits are now advancing against the farmers of Australia, and destroying the wheat crops. Honourable members know what a calamity it would be to Bovs the masses if the price of bread were increased by id."" a loaf. If the plague broke out in Australia, should we not remove every obstacle, and tear down every barrier, 400 in the endeavour to stamp it out? The rabbit pest is a plague which is eating out the heart of the primary industries of the country. We cannot do much for our settlers, but we can at least send them a message of sympathy. Even protectionists desirous of giving effect to their policy might keep their hands off this wire-netting, as they have done for years. The New South Wales factory has prospered under the rate free-trade, though I was told, when I took off the duties in 1896, that it would be closed within a week, and its employees thrown into the streets. But there are more people employed now than there were then, and the business has greatly improved. the honourable If it is necessary to help them, why not do so in a way which will conserve the interests of the farmers ? In assisting Mr . Sandford, and those interested in ironworks in Tasmania, the Government proposes to show consideration for the engineering firms of Australia, recognising that v iron and steel are the life-blood of manufacturing, and, therefore, instead of imposing duties on iron, intends to introduce a Bounty Bill . Mr T OSEPH COOK - Wire-nettin g was dealt with in the last Bounty Bill . It Mr Reid - I am glad that the honourable member has reminded me of that. Now that another Bounty Bill is proposed, I hope that the Government will extend to our farmers the consideration which Ministers have shown to our manufacturers, and if they regard it as necessary to assist the wire-netting industry, will do so by a bounty instead of by a duty. In dealing with the The honourable Tariff we must cast an enlightened eye over the whole position, of Australian industries. There are some things which we cannot i do for one industry because of the urgent needs of others. We cannot make a g if t without taking the money out of some pocket. The gifts made to one industry are paid for by other industries. I do not question the right of honourable members who announce themselves protectionists to put into effect the policy which they advocated when before the electors; but, seeing that the protectionists of the past have allowed oiir farmers and settlers to get their wire-netting free of duty, I ask them, now that this pest is casting its ominous shadow over a still larger part of our bright Continent, not to do a great injustice. In former times it was the great sheep-walk owners or lessees who were interested in wire-netting. In days gone by large territories were owned or leased by individuals who possessed enormous resources. But most of them have been ruined. The strongest financial power in Australia, after many victories, collapsed when faced with the rabbit pest. Twenty years ago the great western division of New South Wales was covered with magnificent pastoral properties, whose owners had unlimited means behind them; but today there is scarcely one of these men who is not ruined, while their properties are in the hands of the banks, or other financial institutions.",51

389,Mr THOMAS BROWN,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,The rabbits are as bad as a perpetual drought.,52
390,Mr REID,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"Thos e of us who ask that wire-netting shall be admitted free of duty are not pleading in the interests, of the great squatters, but in the interests of the thousands of farmers and free selectors. The big men who were in the Western Division of New South Wales have been ruined. Who can point to one of them who has withstood the rabbits and the droughts? - All are bankrupt. I do plead for them; they are beyond the reach of help. But I am pointing out, as did honourable member for Calare, in a speech upon which I heartily congratulate him, that we can succour the smaller men. The honourable member has a closer touch with the realities of this evil than I have. Like other honourable members who repremember sent country constituencies,' he comes from a district in which every day may be witnessed an almost hopeless struggle by those on the land for the preservation of their flocks and their crops. Unfortunately, there can be no sort of co-operation in this. Each man must do what he can for himself. The rabbits come from all parts of the country, and wire-netting provides the only line of defence which will save thousands of homes and farms and free selections from absolute ruin. Surely the Committee will come to the relief of our settlers. We ask, not for any great act of generosity and indulgence, but simply that things shall be left as they were.",52

He uttered two or three statements to which I intend to reply, but I shall not speak very long, because there is not much to answer. He spoke as if he represented a. country constituency, although he represents, and has always represented, a city and an importing constituency. I , on the other hand, represent a constituency which is as much interested in this question as is any in Australia.",52

Had I misrepresented my constituency, I should have been put on one side long ago. No one knows more about this subject than I do, or better understands the requirements of the people in the country. There is no man who understands the difficulties experienced by those settled upon the land better than I do.",52
394,Mr TILLEY BROWN,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,Surely,52
395,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"I do not want to hear anything from the intertwitter over not there. I cannot refrain from laughing, because I know that he never really means the what he interjects. No honourable member, and no man in this country, feels more acutely than I do for those who are called upon to fight pests of any description. It is only a short time ago that the large squatters-whos e interests the honourable for East Sydney so gallantly champions - desire d to introduce into this 1 country a most virulent poison. I had to step in and see that it was not distributed broadcast in the way that was contemplated. Of course, I am referring to Dr Danysz's virus for the destruction of rabbits.",52
396,Mr ARCHER,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,It was never proposed to distribute it.,53
397,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"Oh, yes, it was. If the Commonwealth Government had not intervened to prevent its promiscuous distribution, the most serious results might have been experienced-from one end of Australia to the.other. Having acted in that matter, I can speak with some degree of certainty as to what actually happened. I freely admit that I should welcome any means by which the rabbit pest could be wiped out, especially upon the larger holdings. Where there are a large number of people settled upon a small area they have no need to fear the rabbits one bit. The ravages of the pest are felt only upon large properties, such as are to be found in my own electorateproperties which ought to be subdivided. Upon the occasion of the last election, I received the adverse vote of this class of property-holders, because I desired to do something in the direction of subdividing estates which are now a breeding ground for vermin. Because of that, [ was fought as no other man was fought at the last election. But I am thankful to sav that I triumphed. The true remedy for the rabbit pest is to be found in closer settlement. The wire-netting of the runs is the best work that can be undertaken at the present time, but in the future we desire to see settlement-wher e settlement can take place-instea d of the large holdings that we have today.",53

As I have already remarked, the 'true remedy for the existing condition of thines is to be found in closer settlement. Who but the members of the Opposition have blocked settlement? Every member of that body would vote against the imposition of a progressive land tax.",53
402,Mr REID,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,The Treasurer dare not bring one forward.,53
403,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"I would if I had the chance. There need be no mistake as to how I should vote upon that question. The honourable member for East Sydney has declared that wire-netting should have ibeen included in the Bounties Bill. He also stated that the honourable member for Adelaide-of whom I can say quite as much in eulogy as did the honourable member himself-di d not include that item in his Tariff. But the honourable member for Adelaide put it . in the Bounties Bill which he brought forward, and, at that time, he did not know that the measure in question would not be carried. Had that item not appeared, in the Bounties, Bill , I will undertake to say that it would have found a place in the Tariff introduced by the honourable member for Adelaide. Need I remind the Committee that the honourable member for East Sydney was the strongest opponent in this Chamber of that Bill , which contained the very provision that he has jumped Jim Crow about to-night. If we were not being loaded up by the importations of cheap' and inferior wire-netting",53
404,Mr JOHNSON,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,Chiefl y British netting.,53
405,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"We are being loaded up with importations of cheap and inferior wire-netting from Germany. Honourable members know that a large proportion of the wire-netting imported into the Commonwealth is of German manufacture. The effect of doing what has been suggested by the honourable member for East Sydney would be to allow all our Customs warehouses to be crowded with wire-netting before the Bounties Bill is passed, and to block any prospect of establishing the in that dustry that we are endeavouring to assist. That industry was brought into existence in New South Wales under the operation of the Dibbs Tariff, which imposed a 10 per cent, duty upon wire-netting. It thrived until ' the honourable member for East Sydney was returned to power in New South Wales, when a blight overtook it . It continued to struggle until those interested in the enterprise had incurred a debt of £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 , the larger proportion of which, I am informed, still stands to the debit of the company. That is the position in which the honourable member for East Sydney placed this industry, and if he had his way he would to-night put it in an even worse position. During the course of his remarks he referred to the iron industry. Who opposed the granting of a bounty upon the production of iron and steel ? Was it not the honourable member and the party which supports him? We have heard upon numerous occasions the same old screech that has emanated from him this evening. This is about the twelfth time that I have heard the appeal which be has made to-night upon this very question. When we had an opportunity of providing for the payment of a bounty upon the manufacture of wire-netting in the Bounties Bill , he was chiefly instrumental in blocking it. I ""know perfectly well what would become of any Bill of that kind if we had to depend upon members of the Opposition.",53
406,Mr REID,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,How can the Treasurer depend upon us? We are in opposition tc him.,54
407,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"The ment never do depend upon the Opposition. But when the honourable, member offers advice in the way that he has done to-night-when he pleads in such dulcet tones-honourable members should beware of him. I know him well enough to beware of him upon such occasions. He is not going to push the Government into a cul de sac",54
408,Mr REID,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,I helped to save the Government last night.,54
409,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"Because it suited the honourable member's purpose to do so* I accepted his assistance, but I recognised that it was given because it suited him to offer it . He was under the impression that he would get the Government into a position that it would be hard to escape from.",54
410,Mr REID,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"The Treasurer appealed to me across the table three times last night, and I assisted him every time.",54
411,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,I wish to say a word or two regarding his quotation of the provision in the Tariff relating to hatmaking machinery. He has eulogized the honourable member for Adelaide. I would point out to him that the same provision was contained in the Kingston Tariff. The same provision operated until it was superseded by the new provision. A similar provision was contained in the old Victorian Tariff,54
412,Mr REID,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,But the Treasurer buried it .,54
413,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"I should like to bury the Opposition. The honourable member endeavoured to make it appear that, the Government were doing something for a special class. But the same provision is contained in the Tariff of 1902.",54
414,Mr REID,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,The Treasurer buried it so well that I did not know of it .,54
415,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"I remember one occasion upon which the honourable member was asked whether he ever indulged in reading. His reply was, "" No ; I never read."" Evidently he could not have read the provisions of the Kingston Tariff. My answer to him is a complete refutation of his accusation that the Government are doing something unusual in the action which they are taking.",54
416,Mr REID,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,Is the Treasurer going to stand by that provision?,54
417,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,I am not going to stand by the honourable member.,54
418,Mr JOHNSON,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,On e good turn deserves ' Governanother.,54
419,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"I may be able to return the good turn done me by the honourable member when my action will not interfere with a policy of grave importance to Australia. I should like a duty of 15 per cent, to be im;posed upon wire-netting of foreign manufacture, and of 10 per cent, upon that of British origin, if I cannot get the duties for which I am now striving. But I do not intend to be blind, or to be a fool. I do not propose to act in the interests of a particular class, which has been circulating from a common centre petitions which have been reaching honourable members by thousands. The wire netting industry was established under a protective policy. Under a free-trade regime it struggled for years until it had accumulated an immense debt. The company was then obliged to reconstruct. All this time the importers were reaping the benefit, and the German manufacturers were making their profits. My colleague the Minister of Trade and Customs reminds me of the ad misericodiam appeal which the honourable member for East Sydney made to protectionists to support him at the last election - What was the result? He was absolutely beaten out of sight, and now he comes here and endeavours to obtain the support of those whom he thinks may not be disposed to give effect to their protectionist principles. That, however, is not a matter for the Government to consider. At the last election we received a mandate to introduce a protectionist policy, and we have done so; and T venture to think that this House has more stability than to throw over the pro- tectionist principles then enunciated. The leader of the Opposition, and others, bave queried a statement. I made in reference to Lysaght Brothers; and I have since despatched a couple of telegrams, to which T have received replies. I am much obliged to the honourable member for Kooyong for supporting what I said in regard to spelter being obtained at Broken Hill . It is Broken Hil l ore that produces the spelter, though the spelter itself is made at Cockle Creek; and honourable members who threw doubts on my statement only raised a quibble. I have received a telegram regarding the wages paid by Lysaght Brothers as follows: We take all spelter we can get from Sulphide Corporation, Cockle Creek, who make it from Broken Hill ore. Total wages about £ j o o weekly. work, 40s., upwards, according to class of work. Piece-work, up to 60s.; boys and improvers, to 35s., day work and piece-work. The majority of men and all bovs work thirty-seven and st half to forty-eight hours weekly. A few yard hands, fifty-three hours.",54
420,Mr HANS IRVINE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,The wages paid represent about 35s. per head.,55
421,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"The Chairman of Directors of the Company is now listen, ing to me; and he knows whether what I say is correct. As a matter of fact, I was under the mar-k this afternoon; because while the company produced last week 335 miles of wire-netting, they produce on the average 300 miles weekly. Fortunately I was able to obtain a quick reply to my telegrams ; and I am now able to refute the insinuations which were cast, upon my statements'. In addition to receiving a telegram from the manager of the works, I have seen the Chairman of Directors, of whose presence in Melbourne I was not aware this afternoon; and the in formation I have is, I am satisfied, absolutely correct. The honourable member for Calare this afternoon made some statements ns to which I am sure that he has been misled.",55
422,Mr THOMAS BROWN,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,Is the Treasurer aware that a strike took place in this.factory within the last four months?,55
423,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"Yes , and I have the fullest information regarding the occurrence. I know that Mr Flowers, and the President of the Trades Hal l Council, called off the men, all of whom, I believe, were taken back into the employment of the firm.",55
424,Mr THOMAS BROWN,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,The whole of them ?,55
425,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"Yes , I believe the whole of them; the information I have received will bear the fullest investigation. Any one who has anv doubts on the matter has only to telegraph to Mr Flowers, and the President of the Trades Hal l Council, to ascertain the facts.",55
426,Mr HUTCHISON,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,The men were working under free-trade conditions up to the time of the Tariff.,55
427,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"Of course they were; but I venture to think that there was no set of men better treated. I am sure that neither Mr Flowers, whom I know very well, nor the President of the Trades Hal l Council, would have afterwards adopted the course he did, unless he was satisfied that the firm were doing well by the men. I have the further information that Lysaght Brothers are selling the Men, day wire-netting to which I referred this after12s. noon, at £ 2 per mile less than the price of the imported article. Let us have straight out facts if we are to have a straight-out fight.",55
428,Mr DUGAL DTHOMSON,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,I suppose the duty is calculated on the price of the imported article?,55
429,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"Probably so; but I know that the price of local wire netting has beera reduced within the past few weeks by at least jQx a ton - I do not know that there is any other matter to which I need refer. No one is more anxious than myself to do all that is possible in the interests of - the farming community ; and it is mv personal interest to do.so. What personal interest can I have in placing an incubus on farmers, squatters, or any one else? But in the interests of Australia it is not right to wipe out an industry which is keeping the price of wire-netting down. If importers had their full fling they would do as they did in other industries in New South Wales tor so many years under the regime of the Reid Government-the y would raise prices by a scratch of the pen, without adding to the value of their imports, and thus fleece the public. What has been the history of everv properly protected industry ? When the local manufacturer has got his industry into working order prices have been brought down. This was the case in the hat industry in Svdnev. when some of the friends of the leader of the Opposition, who were large importers, had to reduce their prices in consequence of the local competition, and they are now selling their commodities much more cheaply than ever' before. Similar consequences have followed protection in Victoria, and must follow in all cases where internal competition affords an opportunity to people to invest their capital and fight the fleecing importer. I , for one, will not abandon the policy of protection, which is in the interests of the whole of Australia, because we can never have a large population with high wages and prosperity without that policy.",55
430,Mr TILLEY BROWN,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"Indi) [9.25] I had not intended to speak on this subject, although I am naturally interested as the representative of a large farming community. I have made up my mind, as my friends in the corner know, to vote for the amendment of the honourable member for Illawarra. The Government have framed a protectionist policy approachiner prohibition, but there is an old adage that there is an exception to every rule; and I venture to say that an exception ought to be made on the present occasion in the interest of. those people who have spent their lives in settling this country, and are engaged in that primary production on which so much depends. I listended to the honourable member for East Sydney, and I certainly observed nothing objectionable in his statements. The honourable member was appealing honestly for consideration for people who certainly deserve it. The Treasurer may think that he knows all about the pastoral and agricultural interests-abou t the struggle people have to make to maintain themselves on the land. Does the honourable gentleman know that the effects of the present drought are intensified by fully one-third owing to the rabbits? Does he know that hundreds of thousands of pounds have been spent in Victoria and elsewhere in efforts to eradicate the pest? The honourable gentleman ought to remember that, to common-sense, practical men, bounce and bluff cannot be addressed as convincing argument. We are not interested in old political feuds of New South, WaleSj but we are interested in the pastoral and agricultural industries, to which a duty of 30 per cent, on this commodity will, in many cases, mean ruin. The people engaged inthose industries are entitled to our fullest consideration. I have in my possession, though not here, a dozen letters from the Treasurer's own constituency, begging that this duty should not be imposed, and similar feeling has been expressed all over Victoria. Who is to benefit from such a duty ? It certainly will 'not benefit human beings, it is rea.lly and truly a protection for rabbits. This question is of enormous importance from a financial point of view, seeing that wire netting to the value of over £500,000 was imported last year, and rabbits are spreading to such an extent that more than double that expenditure will prove to be necessary if the pest is to be checked. In Victoria we have been endeavouring, to the best of our ability, to eradicate the pest by poisoning and so forth, and the high price obtainable for trapped rabbits has been an inducement to the destruction of more than would otherwise have been killed. Several computations have been made as to the number of rabbits in Victoria. At first the number was estimated at something like 5,000,000, but that estimate was raised to 15,000,000, and subsequently to 25,000,000, while today those who understand the question place the figure at no less than 50,000,000. If the late railway strike in Victoria had continued for another three weeks it would have meant ruin to a number of people, owing to the increase of rabbits, and if we alter the ordinary conditions of life in the way now proposed, I venture to say that the pest will so increase as to involve disaster. Surely there is some reason in the appeal made by the leader of the Opposition, and by other honourable memlrers on both sides of the House. Honourable members have a free hand in regard to this item, and there is no necessity for the bluff of the Treasurer. I must confess that it was only to-night I learned of that provision in the Tariff for the return of the whole of the duty paid on machinery imported for the hat industry and the woollen industry. The information astounded me. As the leader of the Opposition said, it seems that a man may pay duty at the front door of the Customs House, and obtain a rebate at the back door. That is not an honest procedure. We have been flooded with literature relating to the Tariff, and a business man ha,s not time to look into all these wretched details. The practice referred to by 'the leader of the Opposition is certainly a very undesirable one. It is not the expected outcome of such an - honest protective policy as we were led to believe would emanate from the Treasury benches. There can be no doubt that we have had to-night a development which will surprise the people of Australia. I trust that the speech made by the leader of the Opposition will have some effect upon my honourable friends in the Labour corner. We should all be deeply interested in the away. welfare of Australia, but, having regard some of the measures passed by this Parsay liament, I am inclined to believe that some honourable members are not. The fact that the House recently affirmed a proposal to expend something like £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 upon erection of a Commonwealth building in Strand, London, is a case in point. We have heard honourable members criticisef Government proposals, and we have seen them turn round and vote for them as soon as it was pointed out that the position the Ministry was assailed. When people hear of such conduct, what must they think of the Federal Parliament? is now proposed to subject the farmers and settlers of Australia to another serious disability. Instead of voting for these need of conversion. duties, I should be prepared to vote an expenditure of £500,000 on wire-netting to be distributed amongst farmers settlers. At the present time, it takes the money that the stock-owners and others can find to maintain themselves on the soil, and if we subject them to disability disability their position will become very serious. I trust that honourable members will recognise the desirableness of giving consideration to the farmers of Australia. The large squatter is practically extinct. There are now very few of them left in Australia. Thousands of Victorians acquired land in the Riverina district, and today they are assailed with drought and rabbits, with the result that the land which they hold is not worth the money that they owe upon it. The honourable member for Riverina knows that I am speaking the truth, and he must recognise that it is posed by these duties to inflict on the farmers and graziers of Australia a grievous wrong. They are the bone and sinew of country, the producers of everything that calculated to assist other industries, certainly ought to extend every considerabers tion to them.",56
431,Mr HUGHES,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"West Sydney) [9.35J I cannot recall any occasion when I have listened with greater pleasure to three secutive speeches than to-night in listening to the addresses delivered by the leader the Opposition, the Treasurer, and - the honourable member for Indi. They mind me of an old dish, very comorable mon in that part of the old country from which I come, called curds and whey. The curds come first, and the whey, which follows, is very watery and bitter. It is not at all palatable, and is usually thrown I listened with great attention to to what the leader of the Opposition had to regarding the duties on wire-netting, because I knew that all that could be said in favour of their remission would be said by him. I heard quite sufficient of his rethe marks to convert me had I stood in need of the conversion. I am sure that any one who has laboured under the necessity-the painu l necessity, as the honourable member for Indi has said-of paying 30 per cent, duty on his wire-netting, will be glad to know of that the right honourable member for East the Sydney is very sorry for him. His sorrow is so deep that during the course of his It speech, he was able not only to deeply affect the Committee, but even to convert himself. He seems to have stood in great During the last for election campaign, the one thing which he made painfully clear to the people and of Australia was that that was not all the time to bother about such trivial matters as free-trade or protection-it was a time when every one should rally round the after grand did flag, and down the Labour 1 Party. At that particular time, the right honourable member did not care two snaps of his fingers whether the rabbits spread over the land in millions or singly.",57
432,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,How much did the have honourable member care?,57
433,Mr HUGHES,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"The leader of the Opposition deliberately set up as his standard the sinking of the fiscal issue. He appealed to every protectionist and free trader in Australia to lay aside the fiscal prohatchet and to get under his banner. Many of them did so, and there they are in the Opposition corner. They are now clusterthe ing round him, and he cannot even make a is speech on a great question like this, withand we out having to appeal to honourable memon his own side of the House to let him get out what he has to say. No farmer is likely to be deceived for one moment by the present attitude of the right honourable member. Had he done at the last congeneral election what he did at the two previous elections, there would not have of been a duty on wire-netting. Why was no duty imposed upon it under the Tariff reof 1901-2? It was because the right honmember then stood in this House at the head of a solid phalanx in favour of a low Tariff. But, at the last general election, he deliberately threw aside an opporthese tunity to get a similar iband to follow Would he then have objected to any who believed in a duty of 50 per cent, wire-netting, provided that he was in of his ticket of anti-Socialism?",57

437,Mr HUGHES,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"The position is this The Treasurer, for reasons Lest known himself, has submitted a Tariff under which wire-netting is dutiable at 30 per cent.

I ask the Committee to say whether or not, if the leader of the Opposition had done his duty by free trade, by low tariffism, the Minister charge of the Tariff would have proposed tax. such a duty.

439,Mr HUGHES,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"The people of Australia have been taxed, so far as wire-netting is concerned, to the extent of 30 per cent., .simply because the leader of the Opposition has not done his duty. If one contrasts the speech made by him this evening with that which he delivered when the Tariff was first introtricts-when duced, one finds a striking difference tween the two. On the previous occasion, the right honourable member was going to extend to the Tariff that kind of treatment that the position of parties in this House deserved. He is now suddenly fired With a noble enthusiasm to fight against the Tariff. Whose interests are now at stake? The ground is absolutely littered with the tracks of the great moneyed institutions Australia.",58

They are in danger, and on when the tocsin rings he is to the front, as favour he always was. He has endeavoured to make the country believe that the interests memof the farmer are particularly bound up in in this question. Every one knows that Is he rabbits can be a menace to Australia only so long as the country is held in large, and not in small, areas. There is no doubt the real obstacle in the' way of closer settlement is the fact that it pays men and large institutions to hold great areas of and that it would not pay them to do so if we had in operation a fair progressive land tax. The men who' stand in the way of the real settlement of the : land, as the Treasurer has pointed out, to are those who stand in the way of the settlement of the rabbit question. In 1894, there was no man who more enthusiastically believed in land taxation, and advo. cated it more heartily than did the present leader of the Opposition. Mr 8 REID - Not in progressive land in taxation. I always opposed a progressive",58

In ray opinion, it would pay the CommonwealtK to arrange for Having said so much, I have only to add that the question for us to consider is whether the imposition of duties of 15 10, or 10 and 5, per cent, will increase cost of wire-netting.

The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN (Mr. BATCHELOR) - I ask the honourable member to withdraw that remark.

458,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"I hope that honourable member will not think that I spoke in any ungracious spirit, so far as he is concerned.",60
459,Mr FOSTER,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"In ' the debate, great stress has been laid on the fact that the importation of wire-netting equals in value more than £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 . In 1906 it, I find, was valued at £ 5 1 9 , 0 0 0 . In addition, there is the output of the Sydney factory, which the Treasurer states is 300 miles a week, and which, calculated on the same basis as the imported, may be valued at £577,000.",60
460,Mr JOHNSON,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"£1,000,00 0 worth is used annually.",60
461,Mr FOSTER,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"Shoul d not consideration be shown for an industry of so much importance? It has been said that very few hands are employed in making wire netting; but if we take a glance' at the great rabbit industry, we find that something like 30,000 persons are employed in connection with the trapping, freezing, and exporting of rabbits.",60
462,Mr BOWDEN,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"T f those who are rabbiting had to pay rent for the land on which the rabbits breed, they could not make a living.",60
463,Mr FOSTER,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"The fact that so many persons are employed shows that the destruction of rabbits is in itself an industry. Rabbit f u r , when properly prepared, is worth about 8s. a lb. Of course, I do not advocate the rearing of rabbits in place of sheep.' The wool industry is much more important than the rabbit industry, especially in the drier districts - In countries like New Zealand and Tasmania, the rabbit pest will never be known, because the regular rainfall produces such an abundance of feed, it is in times of drought that they are <such a great curse. This debate seems to have been conducted largely in the interests of those who desire to use foreign-made wire-netting. But, as thousands of pounds worth of locallymade wire-netting is used, there must be some advantage in using it, and the reports in the newspapers show me that the imported article is of a very rubbishy character. Some men are very sorry 'that they ever bought it, because they have found that it has rusted so quickly that the rabbits are now getting through it j and they will probably have to f all back on the Australian-made article. I listened with great pleasure to the speech of the leader of the Opposition. To my mind, he narrowly escaped fame when, in his the great Toowoomba speech, he advocated the establishment of State industries. Had he used the power' which he possesses, and which he would have gained, by establishing the local manufacture of iron, he would have done much to solve the troubles of the wire-netting industry. He himself has admitted that iron is at the base of manv industries.",60

466,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,The Premier of Victoria is providing for the State manufacture of wire-netting-in the gaols.,60
467,Mr FOSTER,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"We have noguarantee that some of the foreign-made netting imported into the Commonwealth is not manufactured in German gaols. When honourable members have spoken of the wretched conditions obtaining' in Messrs. Lysaght Brothers' factory, I could not avoid asking myself, "" What guarantee have we that the operatives who manufacture the German netting imported into Australia are not also sweated?"" Personally, I should prefer to see the industry established in our own country, where an attempt can be made to regulate the conditions of labour surrounding it . Fortunately, I represent a constituency which is not troubled with the rabbit pest. It is a district which enjoys a splendid rainfall, and such a diversity of climate that I do not think rabbits would ever flourish there. But if they were approaching that district I contend that the best means of coping with them would be by an effective system of closer settlement.",60
468,Mr HEDGES,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,B y the use of wire-netting.,61
469,Mr FOSTER,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"No . Closer settlement would itself keep the rabbits back, and upon the fringe of that country depots might be established where the rabbits could be frozen for export. The rabbit pest appears to me to be a just chastisement of Australia for the maladministration of the Lands Departments of the various States which has occurred in the past. It seems to me that we have erred in continuing the clumsy system under which we have permitted great areas to be monopolized by a few individuals. To sanction the imposition of a duty of 15 per cent, .upon wire-netting of foreign manufacture, and of 10 per cent, upon netting of British origin, would be to merely authorize the collection of revenue duties. I entered this Chamber with an earnest desire to fight for effective protection to Australian industries. I do not think that the wire-netting industry deserves too much protection, by reason of the fact that only the weaving of the netting is undertaken locally. Had the Treasurer stuck to his guns and proposed a duty of, say, 25 per cent, upon this materialwhich was the rate recommended by the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission- I should have been willing to support him, provided that he would include the item in division 6A of the Tariff. Is'ay this because I understand that it is his. intention to offer a bounty upon the production of wire. Division 6A of the Tariff relates to metals and machinery, and readsTo come into operation on dates to be fixed this Tariff. by proclamation, and exempt from duty in meantime. Proclamation to issue so soon as it is certified to Parliament by the Minister manufacture to which the proclamation refers been sufficiently established in the Commonprotectionist wealth. The wire-netting industry has not been, and will not be, sufficiently established until the wire used in it is manufactured locally, .instead of having to be imported. Until the industry has been established bounty should be granted to encourage the manufacture of this netting. It seems me very strange that so many thousands of upon barbed wire. persons should be using the local netting, and I ask the Government to give some thought to that aspect of the question their bounty proposals.

Lysaght Brothers have undertaken not to increase the price of the locally manufactured article to the consumer so long as the industry is afforded a reasonable measure of protection, aind the price of the raw material is not increased.",61
474,Mr WILKS,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"Dalley) [10.8] - When I entered the chamber after the adjournment for dinner, I was under the impression that a political crisis had occurred. 0 But I find that I was mistaken, and that, after all, the item under consideration is that of wire-netting. In speaking upon this question, the honourable member for West Sydney declared that if the members of the Opposition had been returned in stronger force at the last election, wire netting would not have found a place in Need I Temind him that it the was not due to the Opposition that that that the item was placed upon the free list under has the 1902 Tariff? It was put there by the Government of the day. The item immediately preceding wire-netting upon the Tariff schedule is that of barbed wire, on which the Government propose to lew a duty of 30 per cent. I am led to believe, from the remarks which have been made this evening, that many of those who a have pleaded for wire-netting to be placed . upon the free list will be found, advocating to the imposition of a high protective duty The production of barbed wire is a Victorian industry, and the manufacture of wire-netting is a JJew South in Wales industry, and I object to preferential treatment being accorded to either. We all know that the Premier of Victoria proposes to nationalize the wire-netting industry. He has suggested that the netting should be manufactured in the Pentridge gaol-an institution which is run purely upon socialistic lines, and in which uniform hours of labour, uniform wages, uniform board and lodging, and uniform apparel, obtain. There everything, in short, is conducted upon beautifully socialistic principles. I cannot understand why the Labour Party have not submitted a proposal in favour of giving effect to Mr Bent's idea. Not only are the conditions of' wages and labour uniform, but there is also a uniform desire on the part of the operatives to get out of the institution to which I. refer. But apparently honourable members do not desire to nationalize the industry upon the lines suggested by the Premier of Victoria. I come now to the position as it presents itself to me. The honourable member for East Sydney has spoken of the heavy tax which the impost upon wire-netting would mean to the farmers of the country. But I would point out that the same argument might be applied to other duties, which are of an even more oppressive character. There are tens of thousands of persons in Australia who will reap no benefit whatever from the duties levied under this Tariff, - but who will, nevertheless, have to,pay them. The wire-netting industry is one which employs more hands than does the barbed-wire industry. Why, then, should the latter receive more encouragement than the former? There is a proposal before the Committee to levy a duty of 15 per cent, upon wire-netting of* foreign manufacture, and of 10 per cent, upon the imports from the United Kingdom. not vote in favour of a revenue duty. The honourable' member for Kooyong desired to move that there should be duties of 10 per cent, and 5 per cent., but, in my opinion, such duties, while taxing the farmer, would not have the effect of building upthe industry, and I shall be surprised if the Government accept the suggestion. I would rather see wire-net.ting placed on the free list, because then something .would be done for the struggling selector and pastoralist. people are to pay revenue duties, I think the pastoralist mav well be called upon, . seeing that in the last few years wool has been bringing the highest price ever known in the history of Australia. I am glad to Ur. Wilks. say that the high price is keeping up, and that the pastoralists are making thousands of pounds a year.",61
475,Mr THOMAS BROWN,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,There is a long way less wool now.,62
476,Mr WILKS,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"What do the pastoralists care, so long as prices are high? Owing to not preparing for bad times, and to overstocking, pastoralists have done more injury to their runs than probably the rabbits have. No request has been made to me by the representatives of any 'industry in New South Wales; but, rightly or wrongly, if I see any evidence of particular industries being selected for protection, I shall certainly see that a share of the benefit goes to New South Wales. In the last Parliament and the Parliament before, although industries affected by the Tariff were carried on in my electorate, I 'voted free-trade every time; and I ask how many honourable members can show such a clean sheet ? ",62
477,Mr WILKS,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"The honourable member for Maranoa was certainly very strongly in favour of a duty on bananas, and he. now supports the placing of wire-netting on the free list, because it is used by most of his constituents.",62
478,Mr TILLEY BROWN,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"Quite right. - Mr Wilks - Then it is quite right for the honourable member for Dalley to vote for a duty which will benefit an industry in which some of his constituents are interested. My own opinion is that no more taxation should be imposed on the people than is necessary for the purposes of Government; but if taxation has to be imI shall posed I think, as I said before, that the pastoralists can as well afford tb bear it as anv section of the community. It requires 6 miles of wire-netting to surround a 1,280-acre block; and. if the duty be fixed at 15 per cent., it will mean taxation on the settler to the extent of £ 3 0 . We must not forget, however, that the wire netting may last from five to ten years, and if so, the taxation may amount to, say, only £ 5 a year. Are we to understand that the settlers are in such a struggling condition If the that taxation amounting to £ 5 a year will break them ? By way of interjection, I said a little while ago that if we were to take the duty off food and apparel - we would benefit the struggling farmers and settlers infinitely more than we should by the removal of the duty on wire netting. The wire-netting industry pays wages amounting to £10,000 a year, and it has never received any assistance in the past. Under the circumstances, therefore, I am prepared to vote for a duty of 15 per cent, as my high-water mark of protection. I cannot go back to my electors and say that I voted for removing the duty from wire-netting, the making of which is essentially a new South Wales industry, when a month later, the men with whom I voted, supported heavy protectionist duties in the case of the barbed-wire industry. The nail industry employs only about twenty men in Victoria; but I am sure we shall hear no appeal for the removal of the duty on nails in the interests of the fruit-grower, the butter producer, and others who use nails. The duty proposed on nails is $0 per cent.; and I should be prepared to place wire-netting and nails on the same level. Lysaght Brothers have been accused of sweating, but on that point - I have no information. In order to prevent sweating and unfair conditions, I shall support the new protection, which, I understand from the Treasurer, will be applied to the wire-netting industry.",62
479,Mr TUDOR,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"How will the Treasurer .apply the new protection to the wire-netting industry ? - Mr Wilks - The honourable member had better ask the Treasurer that question. As a free-trader, I should prefer to see all commodities on the free list, except a few . items for the purposes of revenue. That, however, is impossible, and, therefore, I shall in this case vote for a duty of 15 per cent., combined with the new protection. As I said on a former occasion, that system will have the effect of stopping the clamour for increased duties, seeing that employers will be called upon to share the protection with their employees. The difficulty will be to determine fair and reasonable wages - to determine whether they shall be based on the'profits or be standardized. If wages be based on profits, all the better for the workers. I have heard it said that in the wire-netting industry, only low wages were being paid, but, according to the Treasurer, wages are better now; and if they should .be reduced, the new protection scheme will come' into play. If any firm has shown their bona fides, Lysaght Brothers have done so by 'battling so long without any Tariff assistance. As to preference to Great Britain, I do not think that 5 per cent, is enough. I had hoped that the question of preference would have been dealt with in a special schedule and not discussed on items as they arise in the course of our consideration of the Tariff. While I shall vote to-night for a protective duty of 15 per cent., I shall reserve to myself the right to endeavour to make the preference in favour of Great Britaingreater than that now proposed. Unquestionably, a quantity of the wire-netting imported is of German manufacture, and I have sufficient Australian nature about me not to have any preference for German productions. For my own part, I should like to see free-trade within the Empire, with protection against the outside world. Many of the old hard-and-fast economic laws are giving place to more humane considerations; and it is from that point of view that I support the hew protection scheme. Joint-stock companies and other modern methods of handling capital, compel us, in the interests of humanity, to take a different view of those economic laws which were once regarded with so much veneration. As I said - before, most of the men employed in the wire-netting industry reside in my electorate, and my fixed policy, under present circumstances, is to do the best I can for them, as other honourable members are doing their best for their constituents, although they put a glamour over their action by talking about national industries, and so forth. I state my position in a much more blunt and open manner.",63
480,Mr CARR,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,More parochial manner.,63
481,Mr WILKS,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"The honourable member can be parochial enough when an item affects the farmers. I admit that under ordinary circumstances this duty could not be defended. Nor can I defend duties on food and apparel. I have in my electorate thousands receiving small wages, and not steadily employed, and they are called upon to bear the burden of heavy duties on everything they eat and wear. I have already pointed out that, on the other hand, the pastoralists are doing fairly well- I hope they will continue to do well-and that as a class they are better able than are the workers in my electorate to carry' fiscal burdens. I do not know why the honourable. member for Kooyong has submitted his proposal. It seems to me that, if a farmer can afford to pav a 10 per cent, duty on wire-netting, he should be able to pay a 15 per cent, duty upon it, while the higher duty would have the effect of encouraging an industry which, I . trust, will expand. It has been said that the industry consists merely of the weaving of imported wire. I would point out that the barbed-wire industry of Victoria simply consists of running wire through an imported machine, which twists it, and puts on the barbs. And so with the nail-making industry, in which imported machines are employed in treating imported wire. If wire-netting should be placed on the free list, then barbed wire and wire nails should also be free of duty. I am not prepared to support a higher duty than 15 per cent, on wire-netting, and if such a proposal be defeated, I shall vote for the item being placed on the free list.",63
482,Mr BATCHELOR,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"Boothby) [10.33]. - During this debate it has been urged that the question of rabbit extermination is closely allied with that of closer settlement. To some extent that contention is true. In very closely-settled districts wire-netting is not necessary to cope with the pest, but in the greater part of Australia such settlement will always be impossible. only an infinitesimally small portion of the Commonwealth that we can have such close settlement as will render rabbit-proof fencing unnecessary. Then, again, it has been urged that the question is one that affects the pastoralists rather than the small farmer and the horticulturist. tainly, is not the position in South Australia. There the pastoral areas are so large that it would be impossible to erect rabbit-proof boundary fences round them, and the cost of erecting such sub-divisional fences in country the sheep carrying capacity of which is not great, would be too much to allow of its being attempted. For the most part, wire-netting and barbed wire are used by South Australian pastoralists to protect the sheep from wild dogs. It would be absolutely futile_ for them to think of employing netting to protect the grass from the rabbits, which swarm across the larger areas. For one ton of wire netting used by the pastoralists, ten tons are used by the farmers and horticulturists. There are thousands of gardens in the. Mount L of t y Ranges, and' every one ""of them has to be surrounded with wire netting fences. Many of them are subdivided in the same way, SQ that this question is of the greatest importance to farmers and horticulturists in fRe State of which I am a representative. It has been suggested that many honourable members are opposed to these duties because they represent constituencies in which wire netting is largely used. The electorate which I represent is not troubled by rabbits, but, nevertheless, I intend to vote against these duties. We have to consider whether the wire-netting industry is of such importance that it is worth the added cost of erecting, and maintaining rabbitproof fences involved in the imposition of a duty. Contrasting the produce yielded by areas enclosed with ' wire-netting with the utmost possibilities so far as the wire netting industry is concerned, I fail to see that the industry is of much importance. Even if we manufactured every pound of wire-netting .used in Australia the industry would not be one to brag about.",64
483,Mr WILKS,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,It would be a cut above the wire nail-making industry.,64
484,Mr BATCHELOR,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"I voted againsl the duty on wire nails, and I intend, as 1, did before, to vote against the duty on barbed wire. It is-in Sir WILLIAM LYNE - What about salt?",64
485,Mr BATCHELOR,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"That is a primary industry.' My constituency is not interested in the salt industry, but that is a mere side issue. The Treasurer has told us that Lysaght Brothers are prepared to give an That, cer- undertaking not to increase their present charges for netting. I should like to know whether they will undertake to reduce the present prices concurrently with a reduction in the markets elsewhere. We know that prices will come down in a very short time, so that there is not much in the offer made by Lysaght Brothers not to increase their present high rates unless the price of their raw material be increased. ' It is our duty as protectionists to look at the"" value of an industry.",64
486,Mr MAUGER,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"Every industry, if it employs only one man, is worth having.",64
487,Mr BATCHELOR,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,I have never been able to take up that attitude.,64
488,Mr SAMPSON,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,Would not a duty stimulate local competition?,64
489,Mr BATCHELOR,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"We are confronted by the fact that Lysaght Brothers succeeded in establishing a good industry, . and in turning out an excellent article, without a duty. . Sir WILLIAM LYNE - They on.",64
490,Mr BATCHELOR,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,I do not wish to give a free-trade vote on this item without stating my reason for doing so. these cases we must look at the magnitude of the industries affected by a duty and at the magnitude of the industry which may. be built up under its protection.,65
491,Mr STORREB,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,Canno t we make wire in Australia ?,65
492,Mr BATCHELOR,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"If it were proposed to establish the wire-making industry, I should be prepared to vote for a duty for its protection; but I have no sympathy with an industry which merely provides employment in the tinning of kerosene or the twisting of wire, or is trumpery in its nature, while its protection places a heavy impost on large sections of the community.",65
493,Mr WILKS,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"How many men ployed in the making of tobacco by hand, for whose advantage .the honourable member fought so hard the other day?",65
494,Mr BATCHELOR,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"That is a much more important industry than the making of wire-netting, and employs only men. No boys or girls are employed in it .",65
495,Mr MALONEY,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,Is not the industry of girls to be protected?,65
496,Mr BATCHELOR,DEPORTATION OF PAPUAN,"An industry which gives profitable employment to heads of families is of more value than one which gives employment to boys or girls, because heads of families, if adequately remunerated, can maintain their children. In any case in which it is possible to protect industries employing boys or girls I shall do what I can to protect them. ridiculous to impose duties to protect industries employing only one or two men at the cost of the whole community.
