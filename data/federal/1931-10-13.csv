1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Norman Makin) took the chair at 3 p.m., and offered prayers. HOP INDUSTRY. CONTRACT WITH GUINNESS AND COMPANY.",10
2,Mr LYONS,Unknown,"There is misconception in the minds of some persons in Tasmania regarding the terms of the arrangement made by the Government with the firm of Guinness and Company, of Dublin, for the removal of the sur-tax on imports of stout. Will the Minister for Trade and Customs make a statement on the subject for the information of those interested ?",10
3,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"In view of the agreement by the proprietors of Guinness' stout to purchase '4,000 bales of Australian hops, of which 2,500 bales was surplus from the 1930 crop, and for which no market could be found, the Government decided to remove the 50 per cent, .special duty on stout, and also to remove the restriction by which importations of Guinness' stout were limited to 50 per cent, of the quantity imported during the twelve months ended the 31st March, 1930. The tariff protection of 3s. 6d. per gallon afforded by Parliament to the Australian stout was, however, not interfered with. .Before taking this action I conferred with my colleague, the Minister for Markets, who caused inquiries to be made into the position of the hop industry in Australia, and he advised me that in the interests of that industry it was desirable to find a market for this surplus production, and, in his opinion, the bargain was justifiable. The price obtained was £5 per cwt. ci.f. English currency, or a total of £42,000. Owing to the high exchange rate this amount will involve a payment of £57,000 in Australian currency to Tasmanian hop-growers, and enable many of them to continue operations which would otherwise have been curtailed, or, possibly, would have ceased altogether. In view of the foregoing facts the Cabinet, after mature consideration, decided to authorize the necessary action to enable Tasmania to dispose of its surplus hops. NA BODIES. CONDITIONS: QUEENSLAND MEAT INDISTRY.",10
4,Mr WATKINS,LOANS TO LOCAL GOVERNING,"The Treasurer stated in the newspapers that, with a view to relieving unemployment, the Commonwealth Bank was prepared to make advances on advantageous terms to municipal councils and other local governing bodies. I ask the Treasurer whether it is a fact that the bank refuses to make any advance unless it is satisfied that the work upon which the money is to be expended will be absolutely reproductive?",10
5,Mr THEODORE,LOANS TO LOCAL GOVERNING,"The impression I gained from my conversation with the chairman of the Commonwealth Bank Board was that the bank was prepared to consider applications from local governing bodies having power to borrow for useful works. I did not understand him to say that the bank would restrict advances to works that would return a profit. The conditions were that the works upon which the money was to be expended should be of a useful character-the extension of a sewerage scheme, for instance-and that the borrowing authority should be in a sound financial position, and be able to meet its obligations in respect of both the interest and the principal. I would be astonished to learn that the bank had imposed any greater restrictions than those. If the honourable member is aware of useful works involved in applications by local authorities which have been rejected by the Commonwealth Bank, and will let me have particulars of them, I shall be glad to discuss them with the chairman of the bank.",10
6,Mr MORGAN,LOANS TO LOCAL GOVERNING,"In regard to the statement that £65,000 is to be made available by the Commonwealth Bank lo the Queensland Meat Industry Board, I ask the Prime Minister whether his attention has been directed to the following pronouncement, by the Premier of Queensland :Mr Moore said that it was extraordinary to road that £65,000 was to be made available. He could not understand it . Perhaps, when the hoard went to the Commonwealth Bank and sought un overdraft it mentioned a possible limi t of £<J5,000. It was amazing to him that an ordinary business overdraft transaction should be put in as u loan from the Commonwealth Bank to the Commonwealth Government. It is ordinary banking business, said Mr Moore, and this is really divulging the private business of the bank. Has the Prime Minister's attention been directed to that paragraph, and if so, has lie any comment to make?",10
7,Mr SPEAKER,LOANS TO LOCAL GOVERNING,"Hon. Norman Makin). - 1 take this opportunity to inform, honourable members that, in future, questions requiring explanation by references to newspapers must be brought up on the adjournment, and riot at question time. This subject was raised by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Latham) on Friday. On this occasion the question may be asked.",11
8,Mr SCULLIN,LOANS TO LOCAL GOVERNING,"I have not seen the paragraph referred to. My comment upon it is that the Premier of Queensland has misconceived the whole position. None of these loans is from the Commonwealth Government. No statement, has been.made either by me or by the Commonwealth Bank authorities ruggesting that. Mr Mono AX - The Premier of Queensland does not say Ihat any such statement has been made.",11
9,Mr SCULLIN,LOANS TO LOCAL GOVERNING,"-The paragraph read hy the honourable member is to that effect. It has never been suggested that the Commonwealth Bank is making these loans available to the Commonwealth Government. What we did was to ask the Commonwealth Bank to make loans available to State governments and local-governing bodies direct. In the announcements of the Treasurer and myself to the House, it was clearly stated that the Commonwealth Bank was making these advances direct to local governing bodies, and that is the position. WHEAT BOUNTY.",11
10,Mr GREGORY,LOANS TO LOCAL GOVERNING,"In view of the fact that in some States this season's wheat will be harvested at the end of November, and that speculators may be busy acquiring wheat to the disadvantage of producers, will the Minister for Markets introduce and endeavour to have enacted, before the approaching adjournment of the House, the Goverument'3 proposal for the assistance of wheat-growers?  working to that end. NA OF NEW SOUTH WALES. Mr E. RILEY - I ask the Treasurer whether it is true that the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales holds £30,000,000 worth of Commonwealth stock. If so, cannot the Commonwealth Bank redeem that s|ock, and thus provide funds for the relief of old depositors in the State Savings Bank who are unable to draw upon the funds lying to their CTGcl it s",11
11,Mr THEODORE,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK,"The Government Savings Bank of New South Wales holds a large amount of Commonwealth Government, securities which have not yet matured, and haying regard to the present position of the loan market and the funds available, it is not practicable for the Commonwealth Bank to take over from the State institution immature stock. In addition to Commonwealth securities, the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales holds securities issued by the Government of its own State, some of which have matured, but for the redemption or repayment of which neither the State Government nor the Loan Council can make provision. NA MONASH.",11
12,Mr WHITE,LATE GENERAL SIR JOHN,Will the Government consider the erection in Canberra of some fitting memorial to the late General Sir John Monash?,11
13,Mr SCULLIN,LATE GENERAL SIR JOHN,The Government will consider the matter. SWEATING IN CLOTHING TRADE.,11
14,Mr HOLLOWAY,LATE GENERAL SIR JOHN,Has the Prime Minister yet received from the Federal Industrial Registrar a report regarding better methods of policing awards m order to prevent sweating in the textile trade ?,11
15,Mr SCULLIN,LATE GENERAL SIR JOHN,"The Attorney General has received a report, and wfil make it available at an early date. OIL COMPANIES. APPLICATION FOR ""WAGE REDUCTION.",11
16,Mr JAMES,LATE GENERAL SIR JOHN,"The following paragraph appears in the Sydney Morning Herald:Chief Judge Dethridge said that the court was not inclined to reduce wages when the only result of that reduction would he inflation of profits already adequate. The tremendous fall in the national income had brought about a f all in labour costs, as well aa in other expenditure. It was of no benefit to the community in a time of distress to transfer from the wage-earners to the shareholders, the 10 per cent, reduction if the profits of the shareholders were already being sufficiently filled . . Mr Derham said that he was appearing for the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited and eighteen or nineteen other respondent companies. I ask the Prime Minister what is the attitude of the Government's representatives on the hoard of directors of the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited in regard to this application, before the court?",12
17,Mr SCULLIN,LATE GENERAL SIR JOHN,"I entirely agree with Chief Judge Dethridge that no good purpose can be served by taking from the workers' pockets to add to the already adequate profits of any company. That is, however, a matter for the court to determine - With regard to the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited, I have already made it clear to the House that under the existing conditions the Government has no control over this company. We were not even consulted or notified when a change was made in the general managership. The agreement gives the company four representatives on the board as against three government representatives, and, therefore, we have no control; but we have appointed a new director to the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited. He is a trusted officer of the Treasury, and because of this appointment we shall be kept in closer touch with the Board of Directors and be able to put our views on any specific question before it. NA GOVERNMENTS. REFERENDUM.",12
18,Mr NAIRN,ABOLITION OP STATE,"Is it a fact that the Government intends to take a referendum on the question of the abolition of State governments, and if so, will taken in conjunction with the next general election, or separately?",12
19,Mr SCULLIN,ABOLITION OP STATE,"Some time ago the Government introduced three bills, which were passed by this House, representing the Government's policy on constitutional reform. They were sent to another place, and rejected. They will again be sent to another place for submission to the people. REGULATION OF FOOD PRICES.",12
20,Dr MALONEY,ABOLITION OP STATE,"the Prime Minister, upon n-oticeI n the event of the British Government passing legislation to prevent profiteering, will he request his Cabinet to consider a bill to check the prices of foods such as bread and meat, with the object of providing that bread sold over the counter shall be sold at a fair price based upon the selling price of wheat, and meat sold over the counter shall be sold at a price fairly proportionate with the wholesale price of meat in the carcass, such prices to be based on the monthly average of sales of wheat and meat?",12
21,Mr SCULLIN,ABOLITION OP STATE,It is not considered that legislation for the regulation of prices of bread and meat would be within the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth. SYDNEY GENERAL POST OFFICE. SICK LEAVE GRANTED TO STAFF.,12

COINAGE ISSUE. Air. MACKAY asked the Treasurer, upon notice I. What is the value of the silver coins issued hy the Commonwealth Treasury for each of the last five years ended 30th June, 1(131, and the estimated profit on such issue? 2.

(o) No. (b) A special review of old-age and invalid pensions was rendered necessary by the provisions of sections 34, 35. 30, 38, and 39 of the Financial Emergency Act .1931. The special review of invalid pensions was also necessary to give effect to the altered conditions relating to the reduced standard of adequate maintenance, foreshadowed in Parliament by the Treasurer in his speech on the Debt Conversion Agreement Bill . Suitable instructions were issued accordingly. (c) No. 2. Sue answer to No. I PROHIBITED LITERATURE.",13

What are the titles, and who are the authors of each of such books? 3. Who decided that these books should be denied admission? 4. Have any protests been received respecting these prohibited books?",13
26,Mr FORDE,ABOLITION OP STATE,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :-1. 132. 2. A list of the books will be handed to the honourable member. Publication of the list is uot considered advisable, us it would tend to advertise the books. 3. The Minister decides whether a book is to be treated as a prohibited import. 4. Certain protests have been made, but in no case has the importer had the courage to challenge the decision in the courts, which can be done in a very simple manner. Coin Issued. Profit. £ £ CANBERRA FOUNDATION STONE. 104.770 Mr BLAKELEY - On the 9tb 70.24S October, 1931, the honourable member for 32,704 Melbourne (Dr Maloney) asked me the 131,104 following questions without notice:1. Is it a fact that the foundation stone laid at Canberra by the Prince of Wales has been removed from its original position ? 2. If so, where is it hidden? 3. Further, was permission refused from England foT its removal, and, if so, who was the person who ordered its removal in spite of such refusa 1 ? I am now in a position to supply answers to his queries as follow:.1. Yes. 2. The stone is at present held in storage in safe custody. It was removed to prevent damage by vandalism and by quarrying operatious carried on in the immediate vicinity. It is proposed to replace it with proper, protection upon completion of the quarrying operations. 3. No. INTEREST ON MORTGAGES. v",13
27,Mr SCULLIN,ABOLITION OP STATE,"On the 8th October the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr. Riordan) asked me a question without notice, as to the action taken by the Queensland Government to give effect to the decision of the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers regarding the reduction of the interest rate on mortgages. As promised, I have made inquiries into the matter. The Financial Emergency Act 1931 passed by the Queensland Parliament, provides for a reduction of 22^ per cent, in interest rates on all mortgages with a minimum rate of 5 per cent, per annum. Provision is made for the mortgagor to apply to the court failing agreement between mortgagor and mortgagee. The act follows generally the lines of the draft bill prepared at the conference. NA",13
28,Mr THEODORE,AUSTEALIA N CONSOLIDATED,"On the 8th Octobertbe honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Latham) asked me how many of the dissentients in the recent Commonwealth conversion loan have converted portions of their holdings. It is evident from correspondence received at the Treasury and from reports from the inscribed stock registries, that many persons who dissented from conversion have converted portion of their securities. No special record of such cases was kept by the registrars of stock, and it is regretted further particulars cannot be secured without a detailed examination of the records of all cases of dissent. This would involve considerable labour and expense. RICE INDUSTRY.  18th September last the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Crouch) asked the Minister for Markets the following questions, upon notice:I . Was Mr Ambrose Pratt commissioned by the Government to investigate rice-growing and possibilities of imports into Malaya? - 2. Did lie represent that Caloro and Colusa rices are not liked by the Malays, and are unsuitable for export to them9 3. Did he report that China, Japan, Malaya aud many islands of the East Indies no longer produce enough rice to feed their people and are obliged to import? 4. Are the Caloro and Colusa rices almost entirely the varieties produced in Australia! 5. Is there a difficulty in marketing the surplus Australian rice crops this year? 0. Does he propose to take any steps to encourage the growth of varieties acceptable to countries which have to import rice? I now desire to furnish the following replies to the honourable member's questions :1. Advantage was taken by the Government of Mr Ambrose Pratt's visit to the East last year to ask him to make inquiries regarding the rice-growing indnstrv. 2. Yes. 3. No. 4. The Caloro variety of rice is practically the only variety grown in Australia. Very little of the Colusa variety is now grown. fl. Inquiries made by lny department have elicited the information that there will be no difficulty in marketing the surplus Australian rice crop this year. 0. I am bringing to the notice of organizations, such as the Rice Marketing Board of New South Wales, the irrigation authorities of New South Wales and Victoria, and the Murray Biver Advisory Committee, all the inSTOCK formation obtainable regarding the varieties of rice acceptable to countries having to import rice. WAR SERVICE HMS.",14
29,Mr THEODORE,AUSTEALIA N CONSOLIDATED,"On the 8th October the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Marr) asked if the Government had further considered allowing the purchasers of war service homes to meet their commitments with respect to those homes by selling Commonwealth bonds, and if it had not, would it do so? It is regretted that arrangements cannot be made for the acceptance of bonds in payment of moneys clue by purchasers of war service homes. If bonds were so accepted it would be necessary for the Treasury to turn them into cash, and the Treasury has no means for doing this except by sale on the market, which would be undesirable. PAPERS.

Tellers: Bill brought up, and read a first time. Ward, E. J. NA BILL (No . 2). SECOND READING.",15
32,Mr THEODORE,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,"Dalley-Treasurer ) [3.31] - I m o v e That the bill be now read a second time. There are two measures upon which I propose to address the House, the bill of which I am now moving the second reading, and that of which the second read.. 46 ing will be moved tomorrow, which is 4 ancillary to the measure now under consideration. 42 The outstanding public debts of Australia were considered in regard to a financial rehabilitation plan the particulars of which were settled at a conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers held in Melbourne in June last. plan involved among other thing'sincluding the reduction of private interest rates on mortgages and bank loanseconomies in governmental expenditure by the reduction of salaries, wages, invalid, old-age, and war pensions, and also in relation to certain classes of fixed money claims, a very substantial portion of these claims being the interest that had to be paid on Government securities. To effect a saving i u the annual interest bill of the governments of Australia, it was necessary to provide for the conversion of all the outstanding loans under terms which would reduce the interest rates. As no cash subscriptions were to be invited, was obvious to those attending the conference that the conversion or redemption of 100 per cent, of the debts could not he expected. Usually, when a loan matures, action is taken to provide for its redemption by issuing a conversion loan, and inviting cash subscriptions at the same time. .'<nd the cash subscriptions are sufficient to meet the unconverted portion. course was impracticable in this case, because of the magnitude of the necessary conversion and the disturbed condition of the Australian money market at the time. It was held that the conversion could be justified on the ground of national necessity, or by obtaining the sanction to it of the large body of holders of government securities; but we could not hope to obtain the sanction of every one of those bondholders. For one thing, it was impossible to get into touch with them all. There were more than 300.000 individual holders of government securities of various kinds, and they were scattered throughout the Commonwealth, and some were abroad. By no conceivable means could their consent be obtained in advance. But we could approach a substantial part of these holders by offering conversion terms, aud allowing them to express their willingness to convert or their intention to dissent. That was the course adopted. When the details of the scheme were being considered at the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers, the consensus of opinion was that compulsion would be justified; but it was recognized that there were advantages in providing for conversion upon a voluntary basis, giving to bondThis holders the opportunity to participate voluntarily in the sacrifices involved in the rehabilitation plan.",15
33,Mr JAMES,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,Why did not. the Govornmcnt give the same opportunity to the pensioners?,16
34,Mr THEODORE,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,"If the honourable member puts that question seriously, my reply is that there was no contract between the pensioners and the Government. Pensioners-old-age , invalid, ex-soldiers and others-enjo y their rights under acts of this Parliament, and although what was done by amending these acts may have inflicted hardship, it cannot rightly be held to be a breach it of contract. On the other hand, a definite contract was entered into between the bondholders and the various governments, to which they had lent their money. As I have said, the consensus of opinion at the conference was that, because of the financial emergency, the various governments might be warranted in providing for compulsory conversion, thus setting aside the terms That of the contract with the bondholders. It was, however, thought that a conversion could be carried out on a voluntary basis, though there was the tacit understanding that if a substantial portion of the loan were left unconverted, that portion would have to be dealt with somewhat in the manner now proposed. The results of the conversion plan will be best understood by the consideration of the following figures:£ Total internal public debt at 31st July, 1931 .. 557,998,904 Conversion applications notified .. 610,331,153 Dissents notified . . 10,055,769 Conversions effected automatically (in absence of notification of either conversion or dissent) 31,011,982 557,998,904 The amount held by dissentients was thus a little less than 3 per cent, of the total outstanding public debt. This being ao, it must be recognized that the conversion loan was a complete success, the response being equal to the most sanguine anticipations. This has justified the proposals of the conference for the conducting of the conversion. A little more than 97 per cent, of the holdings were converted, and the cost of the conversion operation was only about £50,000, a very small amount compared with the magnitude of the loans converted-of which about £19,000 was spent on advertising, and the balance in printing forms of application, and bonds, on postage, and on the services of various persons who assisted in the conversion operation. Tho annual savings in interest to all the Governments for a full year in consequence of the conversion will be about £6,500,000, taking into account the £16,655,759 worth of securities hold by dissentients. The following table shows the total number of conversion actually lodged:TOTAL' CONVERSION APPLICATIONS ACTUALLY LODGED. State. Number. New South Wales .. 06,592 Victoria 84,436 Queensland 31,242 South Australia 28,227 Western Australia . . 10,507 Tasmania 9,635 Treasury-Canberr a 8 Total .. 230,647 Grand To t a l Conversion applications actually lodged at Registries .. Treasury Bills converted Conversion applications notified to Treasury by trustee companies but not yet recorded at Registries . . Grand Total .. Several problems connected with the conversion operation were fully discussed by the Premiers Conference in June, and the decisions in regard to them incorporated in the Debt Conversion Agreement Act which was passed by Parliament a few weeks ago, and was the basis of the conversion operation. Among those problems was what should be the maturity dates of the new securities. The general Mr Theodore. plan of the Debt Conversion Act provides for the amounts converted being spread equally over ten maturity dates, which range from 193S to 196:1. Authority to vary this mode of allotment was given. It was provided, for instance, that the method could be varied in respect of holders of amounts not exceeding £1,000. Such amounts could be allocated to two or more maturity dates. Authority was also given to deal separately with the holdings of trustees. Other classes of securities affected were those in respect of which there were special circumstances, those held by savings banks, and those in the nature of overseas trade money investments. In respect of holdings of £1,000 or less, the following maturity dates have now been fixed:-Firs t £200, 1938; next £300. 1941; next £500, 1944. Particulars showing the result of this applications allocation are not yet'available. Many applications were received from the trustees of hospitals and charitable institutions, pensions funds, sinking funds, and other trust moneys for special Aiuouriti. consideration in respect of holdings of larger amounts than £1,000. The trustees concerned either desired allocation over £ early maturity dates, or to special dates. 170,957,801 Sympathetic consideration has been given 148,057,811 to all tliese applications, and so far as pos59,862,008 sible, the desires of the trustees have been 50,290,664 20,573,099 met. Approximately £3,000,000 has been 14,781,694 specially allocated on behalf of trustees. 9,087,350",16
35,Mr BEASLEY,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,"Why was special con473,611,153 sideration given to the holders of tax-free securities ? £ Mr THEODORE - The holders of tax-free securities were entitled to hold . . 473,611,1.53 . . 21,720,000 their securities free from taxation until their date of maturity. If the tax-free security matures at any time up to the 31st December, 1934, such stock . . 15,000,000 will be automatically converted, and . . 510,331,153 other maturity dates fixed for it, the holders of such securities receiving new securities which will be taxable. The holders of tax-free securities who have notified their intention to convert have preserved their right to freedom from taxation for the remaining period that the stock has to run. For example, if 1933 is the maturity date of a tax-free security, it will be free of taxation until that time, but the new security which will replace it will be taxable.",17
36,Mr MACKAY,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,Then there is no concession ?,18
37,Mr THEODORE,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,"No ; there is merely the preservation of existing rights. The variation of maturity dates on the ground of special circumstances was subject to approval by the Loan Council. The council has agreed to later maturity dates being arranged in all cases where the holders so desired. In a number of other cases it has agreed that special circumstances warranted the allocation of securities to early maturity dates. In the case of all savings banks, including the trustee savings banks of Tasmania, die existing maturity dates of the old securities have been maintained. Authority for this was provided in the Debt Conversion Act. Special consideration has been given to an amount of £3,800,000 of oversea trade money investments held in Australia, and, in all cases, except one, maturity dates have heen arranged to the mutual satisfaction of the Treasury and the oversea traders concerned. Traders generally desired the right to early redemption, whereas the Treasury desired some deferment of the old maturity - dates in order that the redemption of the bonds could be so spread as to enable payment to be made from the sinking fund. The maturity dates of the old securities were1931-32 .. .. 1032-33 . - .. 1.453,000 193334 .. .. 193435 193530 .. .. 193037 .. 193738 193839 ami after .. ..

Tho fixing of new maturity dates for in vestments representing overseas trade money presented an easier problem than the fixing of such dates for some other investments, and, with one exception, the arrangement made is satisfactory to the parties concerned. . [231",18
38,Mr GABB,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,That arrangement will limit the amount available for the relief of Australian bondholders who may be in need of financial assistance.,18
39,Mr THEODORE,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,"The honourable member points out that because of the use of the siuking fund for the earlier redemption of overseas trade money investments, there will be less available for the relief of necessitous bondholders domiciled in Australia; but it is not possible to ease the situation for certain bondholders without encroaching upon the privileges of others. I do not know whether the honourable member thinks that we should not have made any attempt to meet the special requirements of overseas investors whose trade money was tied up in government securities.",18
40,Mr GABB,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,"My complaint is that, iD this conversion operation, the Government is showing preference for cases overseas, while overlooking the claims of needy Australian bondholders.",18
41,Mr THEODORE,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,"That is a cheap gibe. The matter was full y considered at the Premiers Conference, and all governments represented at that gathering agreed to the basis upon which it should be settled. We had also to make provision for treasury-bills held by the Commonwealth Bank and other banks, against overdraft accommodation provided for the various £ governments, and the Debt Conversion 1,010,000 Act provides that securities issued to a 51,000 bank in exchange for treasury-bills out770,000 standing at the date of the commencement til,000 of the act shall be discounted at the rate 292,000 of 4 per cent., the bills to be subject to 4,000 153,000 such other conditions as the Loan Council may determine. The act provides, further, that these treasury-bills shall not be subject to the other provisions relating f to the conversion of old securities. 204,000 Although the Debt Conversion Act was not assented to until the 6th August, and 932.000 did not come into operation until the 10th 422,000 August, the reduction of the interest rate on treasury-bills was effected as from the 31st July. Treasury-bills totalling £21,720,000 matured on the 31st July, but the banks agreed to renew them at 4 per cent., without waiting for the Debt Conversion Act to be brought into operation. As previously, those bills had been discounted at 6 per cent., the reduction of 2 per cent, in the discount rate reprethat sented £434,000 per annum. All be made. treasury-bills issued since the 1st August have been discounted at the rate of per cent. Treasury-bills are, therefore, not referred to in the bill now before House. .Before speaking about the unconverted aimpossible securities, I wish to refer to the success of the recent conversion loan. Its version loan to lay down success was due largely to the recognition by the great majority of bondholders of would their obligation to participate in the of sacrifices of the nation, and to co-operate attempt with the Government in its attempt to reupon store the financial stability of the Comwas recognized monwealth. Doubtless, also, they had in would have to be taken to deal, in a more mind the mutual advantage that would accrue from this course because of the fact that a successful conversion would refused mean that the national finances would orable be placed on a sounder basis, and the nature of the bondholders' security would thus be improved. All bondholders who converted voluntarily acted with much prudence and with great consideration for the interests of the Commonwealth. I should also express, on behalf of the vernment, its highest appreciation of assistance given by the National Executive, which attended to so many matters necessary to ensure the success of the loan; to the many public men who gave so freely of their services; the various banks and savings banks, Treasurer which not only converted their own holdings, in most cases without hesitation, also made available the services of their staffs to assist the Government; to the stock exchanges, which, by creating a favourable atmosphere, materially to the success of the loan; to the life and other assurance companies which converted their holdings without hesitation, and otherwise assisted; to the newspapers and broadcasting companies which gave favourable notices and publicity to the operation; and to the trustee panies-, which were faced with a very difficult problem because the conversion of their holdings was the conversion, of their own investments, but the converI sion of the savings and investments of those for whom they are trustees. The Government appreciates all that was by these varions organizations and Sir. Theodore. individuals, and I think it is due to them proper recognition of this should now The problem of the unconverted loan 4 now remains to be attended to. It was recognized, at the outset, that it would the arise when the main conversion plan had been carried through. Nobody anticipated 100 per cent conversion. But it was eminent settling the atconditions the time when we were of the main conconditions that apply to the unconverted portion the public debt. Any such attempt would have been construed as an to bring pressure to bear the bondholders. Yet it that some action or less drastic manner, with those who to convert. I notice that the honmember for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) is smiling at Avhat I am saying.",18
42,Mr YATES,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,"That is because the Treasurer is now using the big stick, although he declared that this would not be done. Why not be honest about the matter?",19
43,Mr THEODORE,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,I am trying to be Gohonest. I do not know whether the hon the orable member suggests that I am not Appeal honest in this matter.,19
44,Mr YATES,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,"Then why twit the honourable member for Fawkner with smiling; to he is smiling because he knows that the is "" putting it over "" the people.",19
45,Mr THEODORE,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,I was not twitbut ting the honourable member for Fawkner - I was congratulating him. If the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Yates) smiled a little more frequently we should contributed get along much better.,19
46,Mr MAXWELL,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,"I am concerned with the position of those bondholders whose "" poverty and not their will "" dissents.",19
47,Mr THEODORE,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,"That is something which we have to consider very carefully. comI t is also a matter which the Premiers Conference which was called subsequent to the closing date fixed for the convernot sion appeal, had to take into account. have said that 97 per cent, of Australia's internal debt was voluntarily converted, the holdings of dissentients done amounting to only £36,655,769. Those who converted have willingly made sacrifices of income, and perhaps incurred hardship through the deferment of be payment of principal, and it would by be unfair to that overwhelming majority of our bondholders if those who dissented were placed in a more favourable position. This fact was recognized by those who attended the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers, and there was no disagreement regarding i In Melbourne, for three weeks, we were engaged mainly on the discussion of this problem. We adopted, tentatively, schemes which were subsequently abandoned i favour of others after the examination of every possible phase. Let honourable members now consider what are the alternatives to what is being pi'oposed by the Government in regard to the unconverted portion of the debt. It is not sufficient to criticize the ment for having decided to use compulthe sion; our critics should state what they would do in the same circumstances. The Governmeut could have followed any one of three courses. First, it could have taken no action, merely allowing the converted debt to stand as it. is now. It selfishly. could have accepted the conversion account of those who volunteered to convert, and allowed the dissentients to hold their present securities receiving on them the full rate of interest, and the principal on the due maturit y dates. Secondly, it could have taxed the holdings of dissentients with the object of subjectand ing them to a sacrifice at least equal to that suffered by those who had converted. As a thir d course, it could have converted all the holdings of dissentients, and that what we propose to do. If the Governwas ment had followed the first course, and had admitted the right of those who dissented to continue to enjoy the full rate sentients. of interest payable under the old bonds, and their right to repayment on the due date",19
48,Mr YATES,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,"In other words, if the Government had honoured its compact.",20
49,Mr THEODORE,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,"*Yes , if it had tract. honoured the compact in full-let us put it in that way.",20
50,Mr YATES,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,The . Government would who not have heen asked to do more than that.,20
51,Mr THEODORE,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,"No it would not, stands. but a man may, though asking for no conversion, more than the honouring of the compact. favour guilty of the grossest selfishness when, refusing to convert, he fails to accept his proper share of the national sacrifice.",20
52,Mr YATES,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,Because he will not submit to repudiation!,20
53,Mr THEODORE,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,"I have already pointed out that there are factors of t . mutual benefit associated with this conversion, factors which benefit the bondholder on the one hand, and the Government, that is, the nation, on. the n other. The nation benefits by having to pay a reduced interest bill, and by obtaining easier conditions in regard to the repayment of the loans. On the other hand, the bondholders, though asked to accept a lower rate of interest, and to wait longer for the redemption of their principal, are getting, so we hope, better Governsecurity for the eventual repayment of money borrowed. In my opinion, those who could afford to accept a lower rate of interest, but refused to bear their share of the sacrifice in which their fellow citizens were involved, due to the unpresent financial emergency, have acted They have not taken info the difficulties of the nation, or the difficulties of their fellow citizens. They are not prepared to make any sacrifice; they stand for their pound of flesh.",20
54,Mr LYONS,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,"Hav e not some bondholders converted part of their holdings, dissented in respect of the rest?",20
55,Mr THEODORE,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,"Yes , that is true of some bondholders. I proposed to exis plain that aspect of the matter, but 1 drawn off by the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Yates), who appear? had to be making a defence for the dis",20
56,Mr YATES,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,"No , I am not.",20
57,Mr THEODORE,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,I hope the honourable member is not.,20
58,Mr BEASLEY,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,He is merely talking about the Government honoring its con,20
59,Mr THEODORE,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,"Let . the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley), is so concerned about honoring contracts, now say definitely where he Is be in favour of a and if so, does he the compulsory conversion of that portion of the debt regarding which dissents have been lodged? It would bo most inconsistent of the honourable member to complain of the action of the Government in bringing in a bill for the compulsory conversion of the public debt-and , therefore, for the partial repudiation of the contract with the bondholders-whe n the very essence of the honourable member's own policy, the policy which was fathered by the Premier of New South Wales, and supported by him, is the reckless and unrestricted repudiation of every kind of contract.",20
60,Mr YATES,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,Was not the Treasurer a party to the sending of that telegram to the Prime Minister,21
61,Mr SPEAKER,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,Hon. Norman Makin). - Order !,21
62,Mr YATES,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,"Whic h invoked one of the replies with which "" Brennan Moloney concurred ""?",21
63,Mr SPEAKER,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,I shall name the honourable member for Adelaide if he continues to interject.,21
64,Mr THEODORE,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,1 may discuss that with the honourable member some other time.,21
65,Mr SPEAKER,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,"Honourable members must realise that while the Treasurer is speaking I shall require them to behave in an orderly fashion, and if they persist in interjecting after they have been called to order, they will be summarily dealt with.",21
66,Mr THEODORE,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,"The Government could uot adopt the first method which I outlined, because it could not have found the money to redeem the securities when they fell due.",21
67,Mr GABB,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,"Do a great many of the securities fall due together, or are they fair l y well spread out?",21
68,Mr THEODORE,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,"A very considerable portion of the unconverted securities are maturing this year, or in 1932. In the present state of the money market it would be impossible to raise funds to redeem those securities, some of which fell due on the 10th August last, and others mature on December next, while still are due for repayment in December of next year. If we raise the money in Australia, we shall exhaust market, and make it impossible to secure funds for the relief of unemployment, and the rehabilitation of industry. It would need practically all the available resources of the money market to redeem the securities of dissentients. The second proposal was to tax the holdings of dissentients, and in that way to force them to accept their share of the national sacrifice. Most of these securities mature so soon, however, that the Government could not, even if it imposed a tax of as much as 100 per cent, on the interest payable for the remaining period, obtain from the dissentients as much as will be sacrificed by those who have converted their holdings. For that reason the taxation proposal was not regarded as reasonable.",21
69,Mr MAXWELL,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,"In any case, it would and have been merely giving with one hand, and taking away with the other.",21
70,Mr THEODORE,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,"There are those who contend that we could tax interest heavily, even, possibly, up to 100 per cent., without involving ourselves in a breach of contract; but I do not say that that is-, a sound argument. Of course, it is quite impracticable to raise by. taxation sufficient to redeem the securities fallin g due in December next. Even if we taxed to the fullest extent the interest now payable, the taxation would be on only a half-year's interest. If those security holders were paid off, and their interest were taxed, they would not have contributed in anything like the same measure as those who have converted. The only effective way in which an equivalent sacrifice could be brought about would be to impose a capital levy upon unconverted bonds; but it is thought by the Government that a better course to follow is that adopted under this bill, that of compelling conversion in the terms arranged for the conversion of the main 2 ° l i c debt of Australia, and ,u endeavouring to ,meet cases of hardship, to particulars of which I shall refer later. If we can make proper provision to meet such cases, these can be no real the 15th complaint about the policy adopted others at the Premiers Conference, and the action of the Government in seeking to enforce the conversion of the whole of the the unconverted stock. There is a point which honourable members must keep in mind, both with regard to the real measure of sacrifice made by the holders of the old bonds, aud with regard to the nature of the hardship that some holders who are forced to convert may suffer. say that it is wrong that we should compulsorily convert certain holdings, because the owners of those securities may need their money. It is true that if the maturity date is altered to a much later date, we may inflict hardship upon the bondholder, that is to say, he will be deprived of his money for a longer period; but most of the cases of hardship that are usually alluded to in this connection are those in which the maturity date is an early one-this year, next year, or the year after. The bonds had a certain market value before the con version was provided for, and they will have a market value after compulsory conversion has taken place. have a market value today. If honourable members will consider the case of the person who is holding long-dated securities, and is complaining of being compelled to convert, it will be seen that he is really no worse off today than before, with regard to having access to his capital. Nor is there a great difference between the market value of the present securities and that of the old. If the bondholder wanted his money under the old security, he had to sell it, and accept the market price for it, and he will have to do the same under the new security.",21
71,Mr WATKINS,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,Will not the Commonwealth Bank make advances on the new security ?,22
72,Mr THEODORE,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,"Yes ; the bond or stock is just as good a security now as it was before the conversion operation. Whether the bank has funds with which to make advances is another matter; but I think that the new security is an infinitely better one, for the purpose of bank advances. To compare the old with the new market values, I have had worked out the average not prices of the 51 per cent, stock maturing in 1936, 3 93S, 1939, 1941, 1942 and 1943. I take the 5 i per cent, stock because, with the s 22i per cent, reduction, the net interest is brought down to about £4 Is. 4d. per cent., and this stock is, therefore, comparable with the present 4 per cent, stock. The average mid-month prices on the Stock Exchange were-April , £92 Os. 4d.; May, £S8 10s. Sd.; June, £S0 Some 17s. 7d.; and July, £78 Ss.' 6d. The average price in the last two months was a little under £S0 for the 5 i per cent, stock. Now, take the net prices of the 4 per cent, securities in the new loan. We find that on the 12th October, the 1938 stock was quoted at £S4 5s.; the 1941 stock, at £S2 8s. 9d.; the 1944 stock at £S1 Ss. 9d.; and the stock of later dates was from £7S os. to £80 Os. I d . The lesson to be . learned is that the market value of the existing securities, even with the reduced rates of interest, is about, on a par with the market value of the old securities.",22
73,Mr SCULLIN,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,"It shows that the new securitv is the better one. They Mr ""THEODORE - Yes .",22
74,Mr BELL,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,"The Treasurer has given the quotations after it was known that the compulsory conversion was to be brought, about.",22
75,Mr THEODORE,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,"That may have had sonic effect on the market price; but it should not have done so. Even if we take the earlier months-April , May, and June-ther e are higher prices, the average being about £90. But what would be the trend of the market today if there had been no rehabilitation plan, and no conversion loan ?",22
76,Mr BELL,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,We do not know.,22
77,Mr THEODORE,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,But we can make a. very good estimate.,22
78,Mr SCULLIN,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,Look at the rise of nearly £.16 in the price of Australian securities in Loudon in the last fortnight.,22
79,Mr THEODORE,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,"Yes . The prices of Australian securities, at the present, time are sound, and are bound to improve, so long as we continue to manage our financial affairs properly, and maintain sane government in Australia. Under the rehabilitation plan, including the conversion loan operation, I think that the value of our securities will be enhanced aud not reduced. The number of bondholders who .dissented from the conversion is 29,113, and the amount of their holdings is £16,655,769. The following table shows how these bondholders are distributed throughout the Commonwealth:State. Number. >iew South Wales . . V i c to r is Queensland South Australia Western Australia . . Tasmania Total By February, 1933, about £9,600,000 of the holdings of dissentients would ordinarily have matured. It will be agreed that great difficulty would be experienced in the next three years in redeeming the maturing bonds. It is certainly impossible to meet the securities maturing before the end of next December.",22
80,Mr MAXWELL,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,What is the average holding of the dissenting bondholders?,23
81,Mr THEODORE,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,"I have an analysis of the dissentients, and the securities falling due up to 1938 and after.

We must consider 1,659 777,842 these facts in our attempts to act fairly towards all bondholders in any scheme 29,113 16,655,769 of compulsory conversion. I want now to show how rhe Ministers at the Premiers Conference endeavoured to meet the various problems involved. On the 1st September, 1931, after the conversion operation had closed, and when the results were fairly well known, a statement was issued by the Prime Minister on behalf of the Premiers Conference. That statement, which is included in the printed report of the conference which has been tabled today, readsThe Premiers Conference considered the progress results of the National Debt Conversion Loan, which showed that conversions totalling £450,000,000 had been lodged and that CommonState Total. dissent had been notified in respect of Securities.

Conference was unanimously of opinion that persons who have dissented cannot he placed in a more favourable position than those who have converted. Advices received by the loan authorities showed that the postponement of dates of maturity under the conversion loan will cause personal hardship in certain cases of individual holders. This hardship is most acute in the cases of small investors whose entire savings have been invested in shortCommondated government securities, and who were State Total. dependent upon repayment, of these securities Securities. Securities. on the due date in order to provide for their necessary maintenance. £ £ £ The conference is of opinion that these cases J,626,762 4,273,872 can be met by a proportion of the Govern561,051 2,040,321 ment sinking funds being made available from 354,161 2,386,211 time to time for redeeming a proportion of 0,600,404 the holdings of individuals whose circumstances . 343,084 1,051,506 necessitate this form of relief. 1,286,027 2,341,217 160,074 431,334 Correspondence received indicates that many 9,950 1,208.620 small holders who dissented would not have 628,912 1,002,682 dissented if they had known that provision 4,871,U27 16,655,769 would be made to meet genuine cases of personal hardship. They also are accordingly f February. invited to withdraw their dissent. ""When the conference re-assembled on the 2nd September, the chairman reported the progress that had been made with the loan conversion appeal, and after discussion it was agreed that an appeal should be made to dissentients to send in natice of the withdrawal of their dissent not later than the 7th September. that notification appeared in the press, 2,740 notices of dissent were withdrawn, the amount involved being £2,565,62S. Those figures are not included in the totals I have given regarding notices of dissent. On the 4th September, the chairman laid on the table of the conference - A draft agreement, and later it was resolved- That, in view of the fact that holdings., !I7 per cent, of government securities have been voluntarily converted, the conference agrees that the small proportion of securities which have not been converted, lie converted on the same terms as the others, and that legislative action accordingly be taken. Jt was after that unanimous decision of the Premiers Conference that the proposed new agreement was drawn up by the Solicitor-General for the Commonwealth in consultation with (.Vown Solicitor of Victoria. agreement was carefully considered by the Premiers and other Ministers attending the conference. It was regarded only as a tentative agreement, subject to alteration after consultation between each of the. Premiers and their respective Crown Law authorities; but, with that exception, the agreement was signed there and then by the representative of each of the governments. As a result of consultations between the Crown Law authorities of the Commonwealth and some of the States, it was found that modifications were necessary, and, consequently, it was decided to substitute a new agreement for the draft agreement then approved. The agreement which I now submit to the House for ratification differs from that accepted by the Premiers only because of representations made by the legal authorities mentioned. I have indicated took place at the Premiers Conference to show the unanimity which existed among the Governments of Australia. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Lyons) asked whether any considerable number of persons who had agreed to convert a portion of their holdings were included among the dissentients. While it is impossible, at this stage, to say what proportion of dissenters come within that category, it is evident, from correspondence received by the Treasury,, the banks, and the inscribed stock registries in the States, that some bondholdersAfter have agreed to convert a portion of their holdings while dissenting with respect to the remainder. I do not know the amount involved. After a full discussion, the Premiers Conference decided that the only logical way to deal with dissentients was to compel them to come under the conversion loan plan in the same way that those who voluntarily converted their holdings of did. At the same time, it was recognized that casesof genuine hardship would have ro be met. That such cases were not confined to dissentients, correspondence received by the Treasury, the various banks, and the registrars of stock showed clearly. Those'Cases - were carefully considered. The Treasury examined 491 case3 of dissent with a view to ascertaining the reasons for not converting. The the following statement shows the reasons The given:No. (a) Elderly persons whose holdings represent their life savings .. 225 (ft) Widows with or without dependent children 32 (c) Invalids requiring constant medical attention and nursing 34 (d) Unemployed persons (and families) in straitened circumstances .. 38 (e) New South Wales Government Savings Bank depositors . . 32 (/) Small property owners whose incomes from rent have been seriously depleted, and who will be affected by New South Wales Ejectments Postponement Bill .. 10 (<l) Persons engaged in grazing industry affected by low prices, droughts', and high costs . . 3 (70 Mortgagors of homes where mortgage falling due 17 (t) Miscellaneous cases of trust moneys .. 70 (;) Miscellaneous cases of financial what difficulty . . .. 32 Total ..401  cal of a large number of dissentients?",23
84,Mr THEODORE,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,"The dissentients number over 20,000. I propose to give the House a few typical examples to show the reasons why bondholders were unwilling to convert their holdings. first is that of a bondholder who had invested £300 in 6 per cent, bonds maturing in December, 1932. The investment represented the life savings of an elderly couple, who stated that they would be deprived of sustenance if their holdings were converted. A second case is that of a man who voluntarily converted £500 out of a total of £800. He is 70 years of age, and, being unable to work, desires to retain £300, to be paid to him in instalments, if necessary, in order to meet living expenses. Another is a case in which a widow has bonds to the amount of £1,600, maturing in 1937-3S. Her husband is dead, and she has four young children to rear.

86,Mr THEODORE,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,"Yes , and they are typical. They undoubtedly indicate the necessity for special consideration where the circumstances warrant it .",25
87,Mr GABB,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,Are they cases of the kind that will receive consideration ?,25
88,Mr THEODORE,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,"Yes . If the honourable member will have patience, he will shortly learn the class of consideration that it is proposed to extend to them. I have already indicated that when the Premiers met in conference in Melbourne, Another it was realized that cases of hardship would result from the conversion. I m mediately after the loan had closed the Prime Minister made a statement to the Sav- effect that action would be taken to meet eases of real hardship, and, on that assurpurposes. ance, people were appealed to to withdraw their dissent.",25
89,Mr JONES,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,"Is it not possible that requirthere are many similar cases that have not notified the hardship they are suffer' "" ' Mr THEODORE - Yes . Relief will be granted to those who have converted as well as to dissenting bondholders, where hardship is proved. When considering claims for relief, requirements for maintenance must take precedence, and next, will come unalterable commitments, for mortgages on homes, & C. T Each case will be dealt with on its merits. Generally speaking, the payments for The bonds arc not desired in lump sums, but can be made in small amounts, to meet needs, periodically.",25
90,Mr BEASLEV,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,Will the Minister She decide the matter?,25
91,Mr THEODORE,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,"The final responsibility is always with the Minister. The scheme which the Government is propounding will enable the administration spine, to be done by the Commonwealth Savings Bank, which has offices throughout the Commonwealth, and whose officers are experienced in dealing with a similar class of business. Where cases of special difficulty arise, which involve consideration as a separate class, the question whether such classes can be met will be referred the Commonwealth Treasurer. The Treasury will devote £1,250,000 up to the 30th June next out of the accruing sinking fluids to meet cases of hardship, and not Itiss than £1,000,000 per annum thereafter for several years. The Government has consulted with the Commonwealth Bank, and the details of the scheme are now being completed. I believe that if it is found that cases of real hardship will require the disbursement of a greater amount than I have mentioned, it w i ll be possible to arrange with the Commonwealth Bank to provide additional funds. I have discussed the matter with the chairman of directors of the bank, and he agrees with me that that should be possible. The bond scheme that is contemplated will be a thoroughly sound one, and should be satisfactory to bondholders.",25
92,Mr BEASLEY,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,To whom will claimants apply ? The Commonwealth Savings Bank?,26
93,Mr THEODORE,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,"Althoug h they have been considered in draft, the details of . the scheme have not yet been completed. Bondholders will make a declaration as to their circumstances, the nature of the bonds held, amount, when acquired, and so on. The Government has no information to go on except such statements, but it does not wish to subject bondholders to an inquisitorial investigation. Applicants are merely required to convey the facts to the officers who have the discretionary power of deciding claims.",26
94,Mr LYONS,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,Would this be a proper way to invest sinking funds?,26
95,Mr THEODORE,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,"Yes , but it is first necessary to obtain the sanction of the trustees of the National Debt Sinking Fund. As chairman of that body, I have convened a meeting to take place in Canberra on Thursday next, when I shall submit the proposal to my colleagues. It is not strictly in accordance with the usual practice of the trustees, who invest the funds where they will earn most money, either by the retirement of existing securities or by some other means of investment. However, as the Commonwealth Government has no other fund to draw upon for the purpose, I am of the opinion that the trustees will agree to the proposal. It is in conformity with the to legislation governing the administration of the sinking fund, as it will secure the retirement of an equivalent amount of outstanding loans. I admit frankly that the trustees could retire a greater proportion of the funds by using this £1,250,000.to buy stock at a discount upon the market. At the same time, I do not think that any honourable member will quarrel with the proposed use of the sinking fund. The agreement incorporated in the bill does not bear the signature of the Premier of Western Australia, but I anticipate that by the time we are in committee I shall be able to substitute for the present schedule another bearing the signatures of all the parties to the agreement. There will be no alteration of the text of it. As set out in the schedule, it is the agreement accepted by all the parties. Wc are still awaiting the signature of Western Australia.",26
96,Mr COLEMAN,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,Has the agreement been ratified by all the State Parliaments ?,26
97,Mr THEODORE,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,"No ; but it will not come into force until it has received ratification in all the seven Parliaments. Like the first debt conversion agreement, it will be followed up by a Commonwealth Debt Conversion Bill , to carry into effect the terms of the agreement. The State of Victoria has been told by its legal advisers that as additional w i ll authority for the Commonwealth legislation, it is prudent that the Statee should also pass legislation referring the subject-matter to the Commonwealth Parliament, or empowering it to legislate to give effect to the agreement. The Commonwealth Crown Law authorities do not agree that it is necessary for the States to do this, but if the States are willing to take the action which the legal advisers to the Victorian Government have recommended it will make assurance doubly sure.",26
98,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,This measure has already passed the New South Wales Legislative Assembly.,26
99,Mr THEODORE,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,"Yes , but the agreement is not yet signed. The position is exactly as I have explained; we are still awaiting the signature of the Western Australian Government, which, I anticipate, will come to hand before this bill {rots through the committee stage. I suggest that it would be convenient 'find would save a good deal of time if the debate on the bill I am now moving, and that on the Commonwealth Debt Conversion Bill (No. 2) were taken together. 'The subjects covered by both measures are inextricably interwoven, and there can be no difference in the elements of debate on cither.",26
100,Mr WHITE,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,In cases of hardship will the bond be redeemed at par?,27
101,Mr THEODORE,DEBT CONVERSION AGREEMENT,"If the arrangement witli the bank is that the Commonwealth Savings Bank will take over the bond, creating a deposit in the name of the bondholder, it will be done at par. But the condi; tions have not yet been full y settled, and I ask honourable members to refrain from asking for further information on the point until I am able to submit to the House the full details.

This bill and the Public - Works Committee Bill are small measures brought into carry out a promise I gave to Parliament during the discussion of the Estimates that I would consider the matter of reducing the size of the Public Works Committee and the Committee of Public Accounts, and I suggest that a general discussion on both bills may be taken on the first. Honorable MKMISKKS - Hear , hear!",27
104,Mr SCULLIN,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,"The only question raised by these measures is whether the membership of one committee should be reduced from nine to seven, and that of the other committee from ten to seven.",27
105,Mr WATKINS,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,Why not abolish both conimittees?,27
106,Mr SCULLIN,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,"That matter has been considered; but both committees serve a useful purpose, and I do not think that it would be advisable to abolish them. These are not government measures in a strict sense; they cover a matter which comes under the control of Parliament, and are being introduced to enable Parliament to declare its views upon it . Personally, I think that both committees should be retained. I was rather inclined to- to a membership of five, and I discussed for the point with the chairmen of the committees, who, in turn, discussed it with their members. It was demonstrated !o ine that there were difficulties in the way of reducing the membership to five, made hecau.se of the need to maintain party from both chambers. 1I have, therefore, suggested that the number should be seven, which is a big drop from-ten in one case and BILL. nine in the other. Section 3 of the Public Works Committee Act provides for the appointment of nine members for three from the Senate and six from the The rates of remuneration fixed by the act have already been reduced by 20 per cent, by the Financial Emergency Act. When this matter was previously before the chamber, the chairman of the Public Works Committee (Mr Lacey) urged the reduction of the number of members of his committee to seven, and intimated his intention to move an amendment to that effect, but he refrained from doing my undertaking to go into the whole matter. During the same debate the honourable member for Lilley (Mr . Mackay) expressed the opinion that the membership of the committee should be reduced to five, and I bel/eve that it is generally considered that both committees should be reduced to seven or five members. The honourable member for Angas (Mr Gabb) moved that the committees should be abolished, but that was defeated. Accepting that vote as a direction front the House, the Government submits the two measures now before the House. The Works Committee recently recommended that its number should be reduced to seven-tw o from the Senate and five from the House of Representatives. After full consideration, the vernment decided to give effect to that recommendation, and the bill makes provision for four to form a quorum. The Public Works Committee recommended also that the act be amended to provide that the Governor General-in practice, the Cabinet-should , from time to time, appoint one member of the committee as chairman, at a fixed remuneration of £250 per annum, but the Government does not propose to adopt that suggestion. It is interesting to recall that when the Public Works Committee Bill was being dealt with in committee, in 1913, Mr . Boyd, then member for Henty, suggested a committee of six-tw o from the Senate and four from the House of Representatives. Sir Willia m Irvine, who represented Flinders, thought that the number should be eight-tw o from the Senate and six from the House of Representatives. The Prime Minister, then Sir Joseph Cook, moved an amendment to that effect, which was carried. Subsequently, the Senate amended the bill to provide that that chamber should have three representatives and the House of Representatives five. A compromise was eventually reached by providing for three members from the Senate and six from the House of Representatives. In New South Wales the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works has seven members, three from the Legislative CouuciL and four from the Legislative Assembly. The Victorian Parliamentary Standing Committee on R a i l ways consists of six members, two from so on the Legislative Council and four from, the Legislative Assembly, whilst iru South Australia the Public Works Committee, which was appointed under the act of 1927, has seven members, two fro m the Legislative Council and five from the Legislative Assembly. Besides effecting economy, it is thought that the reduction j f the membership to the number now proposed. Avill make the committee less unwieldy. The Government confidently recommends the bill to honourable members.",27
107,Mr BAYLEY,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,"Oxley) |""4.52'|- I am glad that the Government has decided to reduce the membership of both the Public AVorks Committee and the Public Accounts Committee. This alteration is Go- long overdue. The honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) will recall that when he was chairman of the Public Works Committee, and I was chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, we waited upon the Government of the day and suggested that the membership of each body should be reduced to six. I realise that so long as party considerations in fluence appointments to the committees, six is an awkward number, but there is no reason why the committees should be elected on a party basis. During the six years for which I was a member of the Public Accounts Committee, and you,"" Mr Speaker, served with me, partisan considerations had no influence upon our work. The alterations now proposed will not save much money, and I am confident that the Government, in introducing those bills, is not actuated primarily by considerations of economy. The main objections to the present numbers are that they make the committees unwieldy; smaller committees will do much better work, and I hope that the Government will yet agree to reduce the number to six. Surely it is not beyond our power to make an arrangement between the two chambers for the election of committees on a hasis that will be satisfactory to all.",28
108,Mr WATKINS,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,Tlies e committees deal with the expenditure of public money. Why should the Senate be represented upon them?,29
109,Mr BAYLEY,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,"So long as we have joint committees, the Senate must be represented, but I see no reason why these committees should not be appointed by the popular House.",29
110,Mr BELL,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,The Senate also is very popular.,29
111,Mr BAYLEY,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,"It is at the present time, because the check it imposes upon the legislative machine has been the salvation of the country in recent months. We, in this chamber, represent the people, whereas senators represent States. If the Government will agree to a proposal for an amendment of the act in order to confine the representation on the committees to this chamber, I shall support it .",29

113,Mr BAYLEY,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,"I appreciate that difficulty, but if the representation were confined to this House, each committee could bo reduced to five members. The Prime Minister did not state whether the Government intends to give immediate effect 'to the proposed alteration.",29

119,Mr BAYLEY,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,"I am glad to have that assurance. The Public Works Committee is practically in recess, because no new public works are at present being proposed.",29
120,Mr GREGORY,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,"Swan) [ 4 . 5 9 ] - I agree with the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Bayley) that the membership of the committees should be reduced to six. In 1921, when the right honourable member for No r t h Sydney (Mr Hughes) was Prime Minister, I , as chairman of the Public Works Committee, wrote to him urging that its membership should be reduced to six. Later the honourable member for Oxley, who was chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, aud I attended a meeting of the Bruce-Page Cabinet, and again urged that the numbers should be reduced. I believe that if the chairman were appointed by the Parliament-whic h would mean in practice, the Government of the day-and were given a casting as well as a deliberative vote, a committee of six members, two from the Senate and four from the House of Representatives would be most effective. The election of all the members from one chamber would create a bad precedent, and cause complications with the Senate. Senators also represent the people; they are elected on the same franchise as we, and by larger constituencies.",29

125,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,Did they get paid for that?,29
126,Mr GREGORY,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,"Yes ; the chairman has no power to withhold fees from them. Undoubtedly meetings are held occasionally for the purpose of drawing fees rather than to do work; whereas if the chairman received an annual salary, and was, in effect, the representative of the Government, he would convene meetings only when there was public business to be done.

135,Mr GREGORY,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,"I withdraw the word "" u n t r u e "" ; the honourable member's statement is incorrect. Por one year while I was chairman the fees amounted to only £9S0, aud in another year to only £1,200, although £2,000 was provided on the Estimates. Some honourable members do not appreciate the value of these committees. I have had no experience of the Public Accounts Committee, but I have read some of its reports, and to say that they are valueless would be most unjust. As a result of my own long experience as a member of the Public Works Committee, and having no interest in what I am now proposing, I suggest'to the Prime Minister that a committee of six members presided over by a chairman elected by the Parliament, and having a casting as well as a deliberative vote, would function well and economically.",30
136,Mr MACKAY,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,Is the honourable member suggesting a chairman in addition to the six members?,30
137,Mr GREGORY,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,"No ; the Government would nominate the chairman for election by this House.

138,Mr GREGORY,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,"No ; but the Ministerial party appoints a majority of the members of the committee, and, in practice, a ministerial nominee becomes chairman. The Government, which has to bear the financial responsibility for the work of a committee, has a right to appoint a chairman in whom it has confidence, and who can be trusted to conduct the investigations with due regard to economy. I have no axe to grind in this matter, and I S23eak with great experience of the working of the Public Works Committee. This committee has no work at present, and this year it is costing the country nothing. While there is no work for its members they are not receiving fees. W it h regard to the Public Accounts Committee, the Prime Minister (Mr Scullin) knows best whether the work that it is doing is essential. I am not associated with that committee, and 1 know nothing of what it is doing. If my proposal were adopted, these committees would be more effective. I repeat that the work of the Public Works Committee has probably saved this country £1,000,000. Mr ARCHDAL E PARKHILL - It s members are a lot of numskulls.",30

When I interjected that the expenditure of one committee was £2,000 per annum, the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) said that I was misinformed, but I notice that last year the vote for the Public Works Committee was £2,165, of which £1,942 was expended. Therefore my statement was approximately correct. Last year the vote for the Public Accounts Committee was £1,605, and the expenditure £1,806. The estimate in that year was greatly exceeded. I should be ashamed to be in the position of the members of that committee who arc drawing between them £1,806 in addition to their parliamentary salaries, while the poor unfortunate old age pensioners have had their pensions reduced. The Government would be taking a step in the right direction if it suspended these committees for at least twelve months.

Surely the fact that there is no work for this committee is a clear case for its abolition. The honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) has stated that the Public Works Committee has saved this country probably £1,000,000, but that is an absurd statement. Any government that is responsible for an obvious waste of expenditure of £1,000,000, which can be pointed out by a number of amateurs, should meet its fate on the floor of this House.

I am opposed to retention of the committee on The honourable . member for Swan gave good reasons for abolition of this committee. He said some of its members attend meetbe ings, hear the minutes read, walk out, then draw full fees. In order to prevent the abuse of the public revenue, he suggested that the chairman should be They given a salary, so that he might in check the artifices resorted to by the ordinary members to ensure the collection of fees.

Its members set out to examine the disabilities of South Australia, and its chairman conducted an in quiry into Australia House. Of what value is either report, and what qualifications did the members hold which would enable them to make a proper examination into either sphere of activity? As the weather is getting warm, the time is opportune for a further investigation by this committee into the disabilities of Tasmania. Such duties should not be allotted to members of this Parliament; they are properly the function of an interstate commission, which should be a permanent institution in our public life as provided by the Constitution. It may be said that that would be more expensive. I agree that it would. But the work would be done properly, aud we would be supplied with really valuable information, instead of with reports upon such matters as the administration of Australia House.",31

158,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C," Any person selected to contest that seat would defeat the honourable member. What was wanted in connection with Australia House was, not pettifogging alterations and triflin g economies, but a definite statesmanlike policy in relation to the representation of Australia in Great Britain . That has been needed for many years. Nothing that this Government has done has improved the position in any way. The duty of inquiring into the disabilities of different States should be undertaken by impartial persons who are not members of this House, There have been times in the history of the Commonwealth Parliament when more than half of its members have been drawing fees in addition to their parliamentary allowance, if we take into consideration the Ministry, the whips, Mr . Speaker, the Chairman of Committees, and the members of the Public Accounts, Public AVorks, and Other committees as well as payments ma.de ta other members. That is not right, and it was never intended. How can parliamentary institutions be properly conducted when there is such an incentive to a person to retain his position in Parliament no matter how it may be conducting the business of the country? No country can tax itself into prosperity. The only way in which Australia can regain prosperity is by lightening the burden of taxation; and in existing circumstances that can be done only by reducing public expenditure. B y abolishing these committees we can reasonably, legitimately, and honestly meet the public demand for a reduction of expenditure, without doing a scintilla of harm to our parliamentary institutions, and thus improve to some extent the financial position of this country.

At the present time particularly, there is no need for either of these committees. I can say of the Works Committee, at any rate, that it has a very able secretary. He could carry out all the investigation that is required, and obtain as much information as can the committee. As a matter of fact, I believe that he marshalls the evidence under existing conditions. He could examine witnesses, and make whatever recommendations were necessary. I have read very carefully the report of the Public Accounts Committee on the disabilities of South Australia, and believe that in the-maiu it has been compiled from other reports on the subject. There was not the slightest need for the members of that committee to take a trip across to the west coast of South Australia to obtain the information that it gathered. This bill is the outcome of a promise chat was made by the Prime Minister when the Estimates were under discussion, to counter the move that was then launched to wipe out this committee. The right honourable gentleman has said that this is not a party question, but that it is a matter for the House itself to decide. I hope that he will not rally his supporters behind it , but w i ll allow each member to vote as he thinks fit. Mr Scni.i-JN - I did not make that promise with a view to preventing the honourable member from moving his amendment. He did move it , and the matter went to a division.",32
160,Mr GAKB,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,"But as a result of the Prime Minister's saying that the number of members on these committees would bo reduced, lie obtained support that oinerwise would have gone for their abolition.",33
161,Mr SCUUAN,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,[ took the opinion the House on it .,33
162,Mr GABB,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,That is so. right honourable gentleman alienated support from the abolition proposal by stating his preparedness to bring in a bill to reduce the number of members.,33
163,Mr SCUIXIN,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,That showed that honourable members were in favour of reduction and not abolition. We have been guided by that vote.,33
164,Mr GABB,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,"The Prime Minister'? statement is correct; but victory for him was made possible only because he had the support of every member of the M in istry, and, unfortunately, every honourable member who at that time held a position on one or other of these committees, and did not want to lose it. It would have been more to their credit then had the matter been left to the decision of those who were not financially interested, and the same principle will operate when this vote is taken. I have long held the opinion, based on what I have heard and seen, that positions on these committees are in the nature of consolation stakes for those members of the Government party who fail to obtain ministerial rank. It is high time that these consolation stakes were withdrawn. The honourable  expressed the correct view when he said that tliese committees could be abolished without in j u r in g in any way either the work or the prestige of this Parliament. The present is the time to practise economy. It can be practised in this case without causing harm, because the loss of the 30s. for each sitting day that, members of the committee receive would not mean hardship to them, seeing that they are in receipt of £S00 a year.",33
165,Mr COLEMAN,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,"Reid) [5.33] - B y one who accepted the inaccuracies and tinfacetious remarks of the honourable mem statements of fact, it might well be considered expedient, in the interest of economy, for a motion to be submitted to abolish this Parliament itself. By that means an enormous sum could be saved, and much useless discussion avoided. We should not then have statements made with a reckless disregard for truth.",33
166,Mr SPEAKER,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,"Order ! The honof orable member is not entitled to make that observation. But the Mr COLEMAN - I withdraw those words, and say that the statements I have in mind are made with a reckless disregard for accuracy. No r are they in keeping with the dignity of this House. The manner in which mercenary motives are attributed by one member to another causes a bad view to be held by the public in regard to this Parliamen I, and I deplore it. If evil motives are continually attributed, the public will begin to feel that the Parliament is permeated with mercenary instincts, and will condemn the institution. 1. have been a member of the Public Works and Public Accounts Committees. They were established by the Cook Government in 19.13, because it was felt that this Parliament did not exercise an effective control over the Executive Government in regard to expenditure on public works, and in connection with matters affecting general administration. It was because it was considered that Parliament should exercise that control, and be vested with a measure of responsibility, that these committees were established. It is from that stand-point that uninformed members of this Parliament should approach this question, instead of indulging in more or less cheap jibes, and submitting arguments which are not based on fact3. The British Parliament, upon which our parliamentary institutions are modelled, has standing committees established with the object of eontrolling the Executive, and preventing the development of cabinet despotism which is condemned by administrative authorities throughout the British Dominions today. It is a matter of indifference to nic whether fees, if they may be so termed, are, or are not paid to members of the two committees under consideration; it is the principle underlying the establishment of the committees that is valuable, and should be extended in this Parliament. We have the anomalous position of honourable members opposite seeking to make political capital out of this proposal, while the members of the party with which they are associated in another place are urging the establishment of additional standing committees. To ensure proper recognition of individual and collective responsibility in regard to public nnance and administration, the committee system should be extended. Instead of having two committees, we should have a number, the work of which would educate members of this Parliament, a number of whom 1 submit need educating in the principles of parliamentary government and administration. If they were associated with such committees they world not make statements such as they have made from time to time in this chamber aud elsewhere. I presume that on the motion for the second reading of this bill I am entitled to discuss the work of not only the Public Works Committee, but alsotbat of the Public Accounts Committee. In the matter of attendances, I .admit that, there have been individual cases of abuse; but not by members of the present Accounts Committee of which I am the chairman.",33
167,Mr JAMES,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,Of course not.,34

170,Mr SCULLIN,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,"I shall take prompt action if you, sir, adopt such a course.",34
171,Mr COLEMAN,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,"I have known of individual cases of abuse, but there is abuse in connection with the attendances of some honourable members of this Parliament. Some honourable members, while drawing their parliamentary allowance, have been absent week after week, and mouth after month. The Parliament should have the power to deal with such persons, or the Standing Orders should prescribe the terms and conditions under which members are entitled to receive their allowance. 1 would favour the payment of a sitting fee to ensure a more regular attendance of some honourable members. Some honourable members have criticized the committee system merely because they think that in so doing they are expressing public opinion. 1 agree that no member of such a committee should be entitled to collect a fee unless he attends throughout the whole meeting, and that the fees should not be paid to any member unless the meeting extends over a specified period. But the value of the committee system is not affected by merely isolated eases of abuse. These committees were established at a time when Parliament was conscious if the need to assert its right and authority in controlling governmental expenditure. It is impossible for the members of this Parliament, as a whole, to examine minutely questions of administration, but it is ridiculous, as the honourable mem did, to suggest that a committee of Parliament is incompetent to sit'in judgment on. the desirability of undertaking certain public works and to determine the amouut to be expended on such works.",34
172,Mr AKCHDALE PAKKHTLL,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,"For instance, on automatic telephone exchanges!",35
173,Mr COLEMAN,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,"I agree that there are cases when references to the committee may be unnecessary. there are proposed public undertakings into which the Public Works Committee has inquired aud prevented, such as the Yass-Canberra railway, the construction of which should not have been left to the Executive or government officials to decide. In the main, the Public Accounts Committee has, over a period of years, been carrying out a number of valuable inquiries for the Government. It is interesting to note that since the first committee was appointed in 1915, there have been 37 inquiries. Of that number, eighteen were referred to the committee by the Government, and nineteen were initiated by the committee. In addition, there were three other inquiries which partial references, as the committee was asked by the. Government to report on certain aspects of investigation initiated by it. No fewer than 50 reports, covering 37 inquiries, have been submitted to Parliament since 1915, and the committee's recommendations have been adopted in 30 instances. The honourable member for Warringah referred to the inquiry conducted by the committee with respect to the disabilities of South Australia. That matter was referred by the Government to the committee, which, after all, consists of members of both Houses, and is representative'of nil political parties. The honourable member's suggestion that the committee is incompetent to inquire info sti^h n subject is a reflection upon the aggregate intelligence of Parliament itse'f. We are apt to throw these insults around: hut it should be remembered that the public will appraise us at our own valuation. It is the responsibility of the parties in this Parliament to see that the best men are appointed as members of these committees. The Public Accouuts Committee conducted an extensive investigation into the financial disabilities of South Australia, which asked for a graut of £1,950,000; but the committee's recommendation of a grant of only £1,000,000 was accepted by the Government. The recommendations of the committee saved considerable discussion in Parliament, because there was complete unanimity on the committee, upon which South AusBut tralia is represented. Surely the saving of time and the securing of unanimity on important matters of public policy is something to be desired. It has been suggested that some of this work which is being undertaken by the Accounts Committee should be the responsibility of an interstate commission appointed for the purpose of determining the relative claims of the different States. That is a proper function of such a committee. The inquiries upon which the Accounts Committee has been engaged have not been a frivolous waste of time. The members of the committee enter upon the work with earnestness, and a desire to produce the best results. were Mr MAXWELL - The honourable member does not suggest that had the committee not recommended a reduction in the grant to be paid to South Australia the full amount would have been given by the Government?",35
174,Mr COLEMAN,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,"Certainl y not. But the fact that there had been a full inquiry, and that unanimity had been reached on the committee upon which all parties wore represented was the means of relieving the Executive of a good deal of responsibility. Such recommendations, when adopted, become a decision of Parliament through a committee of Parliament. It is impossible for Parliament to examine in detail the various aspects of such matters. It is interesting to note that the overwhelming preponderance of the recommendations made by these committees has been adopted by the Government. This Parliament would be stultifying itself, and strengthening cabinet control, if it were admitted that these committees are not serving a useful purpose. I admit that Parliament in a general way controls governmental expenditure, but the committee system exercises a measure of direct control which prevents abuse. To depart from this principle of committees, which is adopted throughout the British dominions, would be a retrograde step. To leave the work now undertaken by these committees to an official bureaucracy on the one hand, or cabinet despotism on the other would be most undesirable. ""We should extend the committee principle, and assert our right to express our views on matters of public policy in a non-party way. In the first Public Accounts Committee Bill provision was made for a committee consisting of seven members of the House of Representatives, to be appointed under the Standing Orders of Parliament, similar to the Accounts Committee now operating in Great Britain . The bill was sent to the Senate aud that body insisted on its right to representation-as it would again if the suggestion of some able members were adopted-and the personnel of the committee was increased to nine. That proposal was accepted by the Government; but under the Hughes administration, owing to a difficulty in the matter of party representation, the number of members was increased fo ten. It is now proposed to the membership on the committees to seven, which would mean the Accounts Committee would lose three members, and the Works Committee two members. Provision has already been made for a 20 per cent, reduction in fees, the staff salaries have been reduced, the statutory appropriation has been reduced, and a smaller committee will result in further economy. The honourable member for Warringah  on the administration at Australia House. That investigation was not undertaken by me on behalf of the Accounts Committee, and discussion upon it is therefore irrelevant, but my recommendations have resulted in a saving of approximately £30,000 per annum. I leave others to determine whether the time. I spent in London was wasted or not.",35
175,Mr MAXWELL,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,"What does the honourable member think of a committee of six ? Mr COLEMAN"" - My committee recommended that the committee should consist of seven members. The Senate will demand pro rata representation. Under the party system the different parties expect representation on such committees, and in the circumstances I consider seven a reasonable number. Originally the Public Accounts Committee was modelled on the lines of the British Public Accounts Committee, but unfortunately it has not functioned in the way intended. The duties of the committee under the Accounts Committee Act are(a) To examines the accounts of the receipts and expenditure of the Commonwealth, and to report to both Houses of the Parliament any items in those accounts or any circumstances connected with them to which they think that attention should be directed. (6) To report to both Houses of the Parliament any alteration which the committee think desirable in the form of the public accounts or the method of keeping them, or in the mode of receipt, control, issue or payment of the public honormoney; (c) To inquire into and report upon any questions in connection with the public accounts which are referred to them by either House of the Farliament; (d) Any other duties assigned to the committee by joint Standing Orders approved by both Houses of the Parliament. I ask critics of the committee and honreduce orable members generally to give some consideration to the wide ramifications of that these functions. The committee was appointed to carry out somewhat similar functions to those of the British Public Accounts Committee, which has operated since 1857, and has had tribute paid to it by succeeding administrations, including those of Gladstone and Disraeli. It had been generally felt that it was necessary to have.an adequate check upon governments, and the Public Accounts Committee of Great B r it a in has provided this check. In order to indicate the kind of work that the British committee has been doing, I cite the following illustration from a British parliamentary book entitled Epitome of the Reports from the Committees of Public Accounts 1857 to 1925, which has been described as '-' The case law of government accounting and public administration "", which indicates the far-reaching powers of this committee, and also gives a fleeting glimpse at the importance and extent of its work. The quotation is as follows:EXPENSES OV SPECIAL MISSIONS. We trust no effort will be spared rigorously to curtail the outlay on all missions by restricting the numbers sent and the rates ot allowance. In particular we would urge that the practice of allowing actual expenses (of which instances still occur) should bo altogether abandoned. A conspicuous instance of this practice is seen in the Colonial Office vote in the case of the visit of the Secretary of State In this ease a scale of allowed expenses per day was at first fixed by the Treasury, but in response to a telegram from the Secretary of State from Cairo they waived this regular practice and agreed to allow actual expenses in lien of the allowance, i.e., not to impose a limit. In reply to our questions we were told by the treasury representative that this "" would have been unusual before the war, certainly: 1 cannot say that it is unusual now"". 11 seems to us that it is very undesirable for unlimited power of spending to be given to any mission, and equally undesirable for a cabinet minister to set the example of asking it . It will he seen from that statement that government expenditure is very closely scrutinized hy this committee. We all know that a general complaint about the system of parliamentary government in this country arises in consequence of the incurring of expenditure on public works without proper supervision. A certain public work is put in band at, an estimated cost of, say, £30,000. It may actually cost a great deal more than that amount; but there is no subsequent parliamentary investigation to ascertain why the estimated expenditure was exceeded. What is everybody's business is nobody's business. When estimates of expenditure are before Parliament, there is not anything like the investigation into them that there should be. Two or three members of each party may show a keen interest in the subject, but there is no direct sense of personal responsibility. On this account, expenditure on public works has very often gone far beyond the estimate, far beyond a reasonable sum, and far beyond what it was intended to spend. Yet no investigation has been made, into the subject. Every economist in Australia today condemns the laxity of parliamentary control of expenditure. These men are urging Parliament to be true to itself, and to discharge its duties fairly to the public; yet when it is proposed that a ifr. Coleman. committee shall exercise some oversight of public expenditure-and a parliamentary committee at that--w e find honourable members saying "" Away with the committee and more power to the Cabinet"".",36
176,Mr GABB,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,The committee has no power over Parliament.,37
177,Mr COLEMAN,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,"The honourable member is dogmatizing as usual. The to Cairo. Public Accounts Committee and the Public AVorks Committee have power to make reports to Parliament, to direct attention to improper public expenditure, and to propose reforms. I give credit to 95 per cent, of honourable members for possessing a sincere desire to do their best to see that public money is properly expended; but 1 feel disgusted when I hear some honourable members sneer and jibe at other honourable members, and charge them with ulterior motives when they are honestly endeavouring to do their duty. It makes one feel disposed to retire from parliamentary life altogether. Those who make such remarks usually receive their deserts in the long run. An examination of the cost of making inquiries into various subjects by means of parliamentary committees shows thai this is an effective and economical way of conducting investigations. Such inquiries also have the result of informing honourable members on many important public questions. To show the comparative cost of inquiries by royal commissions and by the Public Accounts Committee, I quote the following figures:£ Cost of royal commission on Western Australian finances . . 5,fi81 Cost of inquiry by Public Accounts Committee into the finances of South Australia .. 1.882 Cost of investigation of the Development and Migration Commission into the economic position of Tasmania . . 14,973 Cost of inquiry of the Public Accounts Committee into the general question of Tasmania's disabilities . . 1.524 Yet some honourable members evidently desire to revert to the old practice of appointing boards, tribunals and commissions which are beyond the control of Parliament, to make inquiries which parliamentary committees could make with more effect and at less cost. It is surely bettor foithis Parliament to cause inquiries to be made by bodies which are under its direct control. Such statements as have been made this afternoon in regard to public committees anger me, and force me to speak warmly. An honourable member has said that I am speaking in defence of the Public Accounts Committee from fear that I might lose my position as chairman of it. It would not matter to me personally if the committee were abolished. But I assert, without hesitation, that it would be a sorry mistake for Parliament to destroy a body of such proved usefulness. Only the other day 1 read a recently published book entitled Bureaucracy Triumphant by Professor Allen, in which he pointed out that under modern parliamentary democracy there has been a tendency towards indifference, ignorance or apathy in respect to the rights of Parliament, and that this has gradually had the result of causing executive governments to assume wider and wider authority over finance, administration and legislation. In my opinion the committee system provides a salutary check upon the growth of this tendency. Committee members arc imbued with a sense of personal responsibility. Xhey are given a task to do and they do it. In these circumstances it is surely worth the while of this Parliament to maintain this nucleus of members to make inquiries and submit reports on subjects of primary importance. I have pointed out. that the Public Accounts Committee has power to initiate inquiries. Out of the 37 inquiries it has made, 19 have been initiated by itself, including those on such important subjects as the sale of the Commonwealth Government line of steamers and the Pacific Islands mail services. These two inquiries were of great national importance. They resulted in the effecting of widespread economies aud notable if controversial reforms. People who criticize the work of the Public Accounts Committee do not understand what it is doing. While the Public Accounts Committee was making its recent inquiry into the finances of South Australia it discovered that between the years 1906-07 and 1929-30 the State deficit was £6,682,000 greater than was revealed by the annual statements of accounts presented to the State Parliament over that period. This coupled with other information, impelled the committee to enter upon its present inquiry into the need for uniformit y in government accounts. The committee having due regard for economy has avoided unnecessary travelling between State capitals, and has received many statements by post in preference to incurring the expense of calling witnesses to give sworn testimony. It is following that practice in connection with its current inquiry into the necessity for uniformit y in the presentation of government accounts, the manner in which the reports of the Auditors-General, the budget papers, Estimates and Treasurer's financial statements are submitted to Parliament. This is a most important inquiry, which has been commended by many people-no t by cynics who are prepared to charge the members of the committee with the paltry desire to draw fees, but by such men as Professors Giblin, Copland, Bland, Melville, and Hytten. These men have said that this examination is highly desirable. So have the Auditors-General of New South Wales and Victoria., and such citizens as i l r . Westhoven. the Public Service Arbitrator, and Dr Earle Page. Many others have also testified to the necessity for adopting some uniform system of preparing public accounts, in order that Parliaments may have a more effective control over, and understanding of, public expenditure. Instead of talking about lowering the prestige and authority of such a body as the Public Accounts Committee, this House should insist upon the committee being given freedom to carry out its most responsible functions. There should be a similar system of accounts committees in operation in every State, as there is in South Africa , in the United States of America, and in Great Britain . One of the objects of this committee is to operate as a check upon executive governments. Consequently, I am surprised that there should be any hostility to it . Honourable members should hesitate before they pronounce adversely upon the work of the committee.. In a few week's time, the Public Accounts Committee will submit proposals for the securing of a 'greater measure of uniformity, and a greater degree of clarity, in the presentation of public accounts to the Commonwealth Parliament and the Parliaments of the various States. Over a period of years we have paid away millions of pounds in State giants, and now, in conformity with the financial agreement, we have certain statutory obligations in regard to payments in lieu of the per capita payments, and it is highly desirable that Parliament should know exactly what it is doing in connection with these matters. It is impossible for a parliament, in the aggregate, to make a detailed investigation into subjects of this description. The work should be entrusted to small committees. At the recent Premiers Conference, a desire was expressed for a clear statement of the comparative financial position of the various States; but the experts who were asked to compile this iuforrnation reported that it was impossible for them to do so, because there was no basis upon which the various accounts could be properly compared owing to the absence of uniformity in government accounting. The Accounts Committee, in looking into this subject, has found that this was the case. There was no uniformity in the accounting methods of the Governments, and it is consequently impossible to make any reliable comparison. Appreciating these facts, the members of the committee, with a high conception of their public duty, set about trying to devise some means of introducing uniformity into the various government accounting systems. The committee is also now dealing with the important subject of the form in which the Estimates are submitted to Parliament. Hitherto, as I have pointed out, it has been impossible for the committee to undertake such work, because various Governments have requested it to make investigations into other specific matters of great importance. As honourable members have objected in the past to the adoption of rhe policy of referring matters to expensive royal commissions which are beyond effective criticism by Parliament, and as the Accounts Committee has been given the statutory power to make such in31r. Coleman. quiries, it should be left free to make them. Dr Earle Page has admitted the importance of this work, and numbers of people who have appeared before the committee have agreed that what is everybody's business is nobody's business. Another matter to which the committee is directing attention is the practice of aggregating expenditure in one large amount, and submitting it to Parliament without any details. The committee thinks that, in some cases, many unnecessary details are given. But it is also acknowledged that Parliament is entitled to be presented with accounts properly arranged and clearly presented. When such men as Professor Bland, Professor Giblin, and others commend work of this kind, honourable members should surely bo willing to admitits value. We certainly should not revert to the old system of drift. It is essential, particularly in these times, that parliamentary accounts and all financial statements issued by public authorities, should be published in such a way that they may be clearly examined and understood. Take, for example, a document like the annual report of the Commonwealth Auditor-General and the Treasurer's financial statement. If such a statement were presented to a private company it would be closely examined by the shareholders, and they would insist upon satisfying themselves that all the figures it contained were reliable and unchallengeable, and they would deal with the auditor's criticism. We all know that there have been differences of opinion between the Auditor-General and the Commonwealth Treasury in regard to various matters. A haphazard and unsatisfactory procedure has developed which, personally, I am anxious to see checked. There should be some proper system for the presentation of the Estimates, so that they may be discussed in an intelligent manner in this House, instead of as so often happens, being rushed through without consideration. Very few honourable members concern themselves with the details of governmental expenditure. On more than one occasion the Treasurer (Mr Theodore), when in Opposition, urged that our Standing Orders should be amended in order that a definite time could be set aside for the consideration of the various items in the Estimates. 1 agree that this should be done, but it is not enough. A group of members, such as the Public Accounts Committee,- should be delegated to examine the .Estimates and report to this House. In this way it should be possible to prevent leakages and extravagances in expenditure. 1 repeat that, personally, I should not be much concerned if the Public Accounts Committee were abolished, but 1 feel sure that such action would mean a great deal to this Parliament. I , therefore, appeal to the superficial critic to defer his judgment. B y examining the position carefully, he will realise that the in abolition of the Public Accounts Committee would be a retrograde step, out of keeping with modern parliamentary procedure, and in direct opposition to the expressed views of every expert financial and economic authority who has given consideration to this subject.",37
178,Mr WHITE,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,"Balaclava) [ 6 . 8 ] - I support the amendment because, while the direct saving in expenditure might be regarded as trivial, it is a step i u the right direction, and this measure of economy could be effected without inflicting hardship upon anybody. I do not deny that these parliamentary standing conimittees have done valuable work. The honourable member for Reid (Mr Coleman) has submitted an extraordinarily good case for the retention of the Public Accounts Committee. I do not allege rhat the members of cither body have been actuated by the desire simply to draw . fees and travel the countryside. I merely assert that good as their work has been, these are extraordinary times, calling for the strictest economy in all government departments. Expenditure must be curtailed where this can be done without inflicting hardship. Other committees, acting in a purely voluntary capacity, have clone good work in the past, and I suggest that this system be extended. One honourable member has alleged that one-half of the members of this House receive extras in the form of allowances as members of a committee or as Cabinet Ministers. If these committees are necessary, as the honourable member for Reid has urcred, they should be reconstructed, and continued on a purely voluntary basis during this period of depression. I should like to Bee the appointment, of a royal commission to inquire into all government expenditure. This course was adopted in Victoria about four years ago, when an outside auditor was called in to assist the State auditor in an examination of all items of government expenditure. Their report was an exceedingly valuable one, and, although it was shelved for some time, certain of their recommendations were adopted with advantage to the State. Business methods for the conduct of Commonwealth departments are urgently needed. If the services of an outside auditor were utilized to assist the Commonwealth Auditor-General an overhaul of Commonwealth expenditure, I feel sure that the resultant report would contain a number of valuable recommendations. Without in any way reflecting upon officers of the Public Service, I can say that when largess is distributed in the form of such foolish proposals as a fiveclay week, and when, wo have so much overlapping of Commonwealth and State services, it is obvious that reform is urgently needed. Some time ago Afr. Jones, the Minister for Public Works in Victoria, directed attention to the overlapping of the Commonwealth Health Department with its plethora of medical men, who have little to do. The activities of that department could very well be curtailed, except that portion of it which deals with quarantine. The honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory), who has had long experience as chairman of the Public Works Committee made what appeared to me a somewhat amusing suggestion. Apparently his idea of economy is to reduce the number of members, thus saving expenditure on sitting fees, and to pay the chairman a stated salary, the idea being that he would see that the committee did not meet, too often! At the moment, the Public Works Committee has nothing to do, because there are no Commonwealth public works in progress, so that the committee is not costing the Commonwealth anything by way of members' fees. Yet he suggests a fee even when the committee is not sitting. Both parliamentary committees could very well carry on voluntarily for a time. Further economy might be effected by paying members of Parliament sitting fees only. We should then see whether the attendances would he better than under the present arrangement. I suggest that a business commission be appointed to report on all phases of governmental expenditure. The need for this has been persistently urged from time to time in all the States, but members of Parliament seem to be deaf to the appeal. The Auditor-General has on numerous occasions directed attention to these much needed economies, but, as the honourable member for Reid (Mr Coleman) pointed out, his comments have given rise to very little discussion in this House. If an outside board of business men, including accountants, were appointed to mate an inquiry along the lines of the Victorian Royal Commission, I feel certain that it would recommend many economies, including possibly the abolition of the parliamentary standing committees, and other costly and superfluous Public Service activities. Silling suspended from G.12 lo S p.m.",40
179,Mr BEASLEY,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,"West Sydney) [8.0] I am inclined to agree with the opinions expressed by those honourable members who say that these committees should be done away with. I have no desire to speak disparagingly of those who have served on the committees. I have not been associated with the work of the committees in a direct sense, and I am convinced that the committeemen have approached their tasks with the desire to do the best for the country in the circumstances. Neither do I propose to refer to any monetary reward which members of the committee may have obtained. If they have received any remuneration for their work, good luck to them; I leave it at that. I believe, however, that the committees should be abolished, for the reasons stated by the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James). It is not many months ago since the private banks of Australia, through their representat vp on the Commonwealth Bank Board, ; directed this Government to reduce its expenditure in certain directions. The Government agreed to do what it was told. I am not influenced by the arguments of the honourable member for Reid (Mr. Coleman), who spoke of the need for maintaining the dignity of this chamber, nor by the arguments adduced by some other honourable members this afternoon that the abolition of these committees might create the impression outside that even this Parliament might be abolished. If I accepted the view that this Parliament, or, at any rate, this chamber ought, in order to justify its existence, to be really in control of the Government of Australia, then I should be compelled to advocate its abolition because, as a matter of fact, it is not governing. We, the members of this chamber, may call ourselves the representatives of the people, elected to give effect to a specific policy hy means of the legislative machinery at our disposal, but we are not doing it. We are being governed by other forces, and we should admit it, and not be unduly disturbed by what may be said of us for making this two fact widely known. If we accept the decision of those who have declared that government expenditure should be cut in the direction of reducing old-age, invalid and soldiers' pensions, then we should carry that policy a little further, and effect a further saving by abolishing these committees. That is why 1 support the amendment. I have had some practical experience of the work of one of these committees, although not directly represented on it. As an Assistant Minister, I had to do with the carrying out of a resolution passed by this House in connection with the construction of a lighthouse vessel at Cockatoo Island. The proposed work was referred to the Public Works Committee for investigation and report. I shall be frank, and inform honourable members that the decision to build the ship was arrived at before ever the proposal was referred to the ' Public Works Committee. In order that the Government might be properly informed in regard to the matter, it called into consultation the Director of Navigation, and the officer in charge of lighthouses, who advised the Government as to the most suitable kind of vessel for the class of work which has to be done on the coast of Western Australia. It was after the Government had obtained all that information that we realized the necessity, according to legislative requirements, of referring the matter to the Public Works Committee.",41
180,Mr FENTON,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,"Unde r that section of the act which requires that proposed works costing over £25,000 shall be referred to the committee.",41
181,Mr BEASLEY,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,"Yes . Our having to refer it to the committee caused some delay and irritation, because it was our desire to get on with the work so as to provide employment for those in need of it.",42
182,Mr GREGORY,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,"I suppose the fact that the vessel could have been built abroad for £50,000 less did not affect the honourable member at all.",42
183,Mr BEASLEY,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,"The honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) would probably have been affected by that consideration, but we looked at it from the point of view of providing food, clothing And shelter for those engaged in the in dustry here, and, having that in mind, I am pleased that I was associated with the proposal. Well, flic proposal was referred to the Public Works Committee, whioh conducted its investigation. It - called the same officials into consultation as we did, and in due course presented a lengthy report. The report was submitted to this House, and, after being discussed, the committee's recommendation was adopted, and the report was printed. Subsequently, to my astonishment and dismay, I learned that, although this House had agreed that a certain type of vessel should be built, certain departmental heads concerned had met in. conference, and decided that a different type of vessel should be constructed. Mr ARCH DA i.io PARKHILT. - That shows the value of the committee.",42
184,Mr BEASLEY,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,"It shows that those honourable members who blame the workers for the high cost of certain undertakings would be fairer if they blamed the departmental heads who changed their minds after everything had heen decided upon, and radically altered the designs. In this instance, the change of mind on the part of departmental heads involved the switching over from a single screw vessel to a twin screw, and, incidentally, the scrapping of £800 worth of blue prints, as well as the alteration of the registration at Lloyd's, and the general construction of the vessel. Mr AROHD.\.T,E PARKJIILL - Who the responsible Minister?",42
185,Mr BEASLEY,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,"Senato r Barnes was the Minister for Works, but I had a good deal to do with the matter, because the resolution, authorizing the work had been passed by this House in the first place. Naturally, I believed that when this House carried a resolution, and after the Public AVorks Committee had inquired into the matter and made certain recommendations no other power had the right to make alterations. I believed that the will of this House should prevail, and I refused to allow the design to be altered, because of some petty difference between departmental officers. I directed that the vessel should be built according to the original design, and that was done. I have not been associated with the affairs of this House for a sufficiently long period to have gained any further experience in regard to the work of these committees. Honourable members who have been here longer may quote other instances in support of their arguments, but that experience convinced me that the Public A\ orks ComT mittee was called into the matter only because, as the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) prompted ine, the act stipulated that, because a certain amount of money was to be spent, the proposal had to be referred to it . The honourable member for lleid (Mr Colcnian) put up an enthusiastic defence ef these committees, but I wish he had been as enthusiastic in defence of the interests of those persons who have suffered as a result of the reduction of government expenditure undertaken at the direction of authorities outside Parliament. He supported economies at the expense of those who cannot defend themselves; namely, the old-age, invalid, and soldier pensioners; I am. prepared to go a step fur ther, and support the present amendment, so that an economy may be effected by the abolition of these committees, because no hardship will be inflicted.  congratulate the Government on bringing down tliese two bills, but I cannot support the amendment of the honourable  that the committees be abolished. I am not, at present, a member of either comwas mittee, but I have been a member of one, and I recognize the value to this country of the work they do. I notice that those who have most to say against the committees, and are most in favour of their abolition, know least about them. mover of the amendment said that be knew nothing about them, so that, on his own admission, he is totally to criticize them. The honourable member for Warringah heartily supported sale of the Commonwealth Line of Steamers, because they were costing the country £500,000 a year. proposal for their sale was submitted to ihe Public Accounts Committee, reported in favour of it. The honourable member for Reid (Mr Coleman) to that matter. I agree with the statement of the case submitted in this House by the present Chairman of the Accounts Committee. When I was a member of that committee, we had occasion to inquire into matters pertaining to war service homes. If all the facts that matter were known, honourable members would admit that, as a result of the inquiry, hundreds of thousands of pounds were saved, particularly in regard to timIIIT contracts. It is imoossible Government, without the assistance of such committees, to examine as closely as is necessary, the expenditure of large sums of money. These committees are the cheapest machinery the Eederal Parliament possesses. The sum of £2,000 a year allocated for their expenditure is a mere bagatelle compared with the good they accomplish. The committees are appointed on non-party lines, selected from all parts of the House and, because of their constitution prevent log-rolling in connection with contracts. They have a most effect, and any sensible should be glad to have the advice of a body of men who are able to call before them the most able witnesses in the Commonwealth, and who can make a close inquiry into the books and of firms with which the ment is concerned. The work of these committees is of value to the people of The proposal that the membership of these committees should be reduced to seven is a reasonable one. Occasionally, a member may abuse his privileges by attending merely for the sake of the fees to be collected; but, during the eight years for which I was a member of the Public Accounts Committee, I saw little ifr.

186,Mr WARD,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,East Sydney) [S.16| referred I am rather surprised at the arguments advanced in favour of the payment of the members of these committees. I am not prepared to say that they do not perform valuable work; but there seems to be a conspiracy between members on both sides for the purpose of keeping the truth regarding regarding the position from the people.,43

If he cannot obtain a bounty on wheat, he probably hopes to get some other benefit. The leaders of parties find the appointment of certain members to these comaccounts mittees a convenient way to placate their Governmembers, and so to solidify their forces as to prevent the breakaways that have inestimable occurred in this House recently. In one Australia. instance, a member of the so-called Labour party was offered the position of Chairman of Committees; in fact, he was selected by the caucus to occupy the position. He was to supplant the present Chairman of Committees, the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCG r at h ) ; hut, hocnuse of the fact, that the Government did not have aa many supporters in the House as it would like, it was not able to make the new appointment. quently, the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Cunningham), who was the selected Government candidate for the chairmanship of committees, had to wait until there was a vacancy in the Cabinet.",43
190,Mr WHITE,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,He received a prize.,44
191,Mr WARD,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,"Of course. When the tariff was under discussion in this chamber, it was stated that there was a conspiracy between the trade union representatives and the manufacturers to keep the truth from the consumers; but, in the present case, there seems-to be a desire in the House to hide the truth from the public. It has often been stated, in reply to questions, that members of this House receive only £800 per annum. I shall endeavour to obtain a list of the sums actually received by members, so that the people may be informed precisely what their remuneration is. If members think that they are not sufficiently paid at the present time, let them honestly advocate an increase in their salaries. If they are sincere in their desire to do the work of the nation, as it is termed, they should be prepared to carry it out, at least during the present period, without extra payment. It has been argued that the payment"" received by members of the committees merely represents out-of-pocket expenses. I have never been a member of one these committees, and I am willing accept the statement that they render good service. Some members declare that i unjust to infer that they come to Canreporters, berra from mercenary motives; but I whether the object of their visit is merely to recuperate their health, or whether they come to the Federal Capital because they occupy highly-paid positions.

194,Mr MACKAY,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,"Lilley) [ 8 . 2 4 ] - I congratulate the Prime Minister (Mr . Scullin) on taking this early opportunity of carrying out the promise made by him when the work of the committees was previously under discussion. My only complaint is that the bill does uot go far enough. I would much prefer to see the membership of each committee reduced to five. We all well know what the procedure is at the meetings of these bodies. When a witness is called, he is examined by the chairman, and each member in turn is entitled to submit questions to him. This means that after the first two or of three members of the committee have to made their inquiries the rest of the examination is mainly repetition. All the t is evidence is taken down by official and is printed. I am entirely ask opposed to the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Warringah  think that he does not understand the functions of either of the committees. When the tariff was under consideration, if the honourable member ranged from the textiles to machinery, aud from whisky to agricultural products, aud to do him justice, I admit that, he discussed them ably, but he relied to a great extent ou information with which he had heen supplied. I do not imagine that he would memclaim to' have a sufficiently wide knowledge of the subjects under discusto enable him to supply the detailed information with which he furnished us. I think that the honourable member has been unjust to the members of the committees in regard to the work performed by them from time to time. I had the privilege of being a member of the Public Works Committee for eight years, and my experience of its activities is that its members discharge their duties conscientiously and most efficiently. But no member of either the Public Works Committee or the Public Accounts Committee would pese as an expert. The departmental officers come forward with their proposals, and the very fact that these are subject to close examination by members of the committee makes the officers exorcise the greatest care. 1. do not suggest that the officers arc not reliable; they are most reliable and capable; but it is a good thing that their proposals should be discussed before a committee which acts as a j u r y and decides whether the proposals are well founded.  take evidence from outside experts.",44
195,Mr MACKAY,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,"Yes ; professional men in various walks of life are called into criticize the departmental proposals, and much good results. L rose, particularly, to draw the attention of the Prime Minister to the anomaly due to the fact that members of the Public Accounts Committee are paid what are termed travelling expenses, while members of the Public Works Committee receive what are described a3 fees. Por ordinary meetings members of the I'ublic AVorks Committee receive 30s. per day, and £1 per day extra is granted as a travelling allowance. I understand that the members of the Public Accounts Committee are paid £2 for each meeting, irrespective of whether they sit in Canberra or elsewhere.",45
196,Mr COLEMAN,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,"That is not the position. The members of the Public Accounts Committee receive no travelling allowance for meetings held at Canberra when Parliament is in session. such meetings they receive 25s. per day, loss 20 per cent.",45
197,Mr MACKAY,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,"I am perfectly well aware that they do not receive a travelling allowance when sitting at Canberra; but they receive fees. I understand that the members of the Public Accounts Committee do not pay income tax on their fees. That also is an anomalous position. The members of both committees do important work, and 1 think that they should be paid alike; but they should not be exempt from taxation. The honourable member for Warringah  Committee had an expensive staff which was operating at the present time. If that, is so, the position should be altered. In Mr Whiteford the committee has a most valuable officer who has had large experience in various Commonwealth departments. Since he is a highly-paid officer, he should be transferred to a position in which his duties would be more in keeping with his ability. An officeion a lower salary should be made secretary to the committee. I think that the House would be ill-advised if it supported the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Warringah. Mr E. RILEY (South Sydney) [8.30]. - The honourable member for Warringah  Public Works Committee costs a good deal, it does no good. I was a member of that committee when it was first appointed, and 1 know that many important matters came before it. for consideration. One of them was the proposal of the designer of Canberra, Mr Burley Crriffin, that each settlement in the Federal Capital should be provided with a septic tank. That proposal was so abhorrent to Parliament that the matter was referred to the Public Works Committee for investigation, with' the result that it was rejected in favour of the present sewerage system. Had that proposal not been referred to the Public AVorks Committee, septic tanks with all their attendant dangers to health, might have been installed in Canberra. Another proposal in connection with the Federal Capital was the provision of a lake to cost about £900,000. The Public Works Committee investigated that proposal, and recommended that the lake be For not constructed. That decision, besides saving the country nearly £1,000,000, obviated the risk of large areas of land being swamped. I was chairman of the committee for three years, and I know that its recommendations have saved the country hundreds of thousands of pounds. If time permitted, I could give instanoe* of some of those savings.",45
198,Mr COLEMAN,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,"The bill constituting the committee was agreed to unanimously. Mr E. RILEY - On e important result of the appointment of the Public Works Committee is that departmental estimates of the cost of public works are prepared with greater care than was the case formerly. Previously it was not unusual for a departmental estimate of cost to be exceeded; but now the departmental officers, knowing that their estimates will be the subject of an inquiry, are more careful.",46
199,Mr GABB,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,".But their estimates are still exceeded. Mr E. RILEY - That may be so in some cases. The honourable member for Lilley (Mr Mackay) pointed out that the departmental estimates are now also subject to review by outside experts. During this period of depression the Public Works Committee might, perhaps, go into recess. I understand that it has done so. That is a matter for the Government. As there is no work, being done by the committee its members draw no fees. Speaking from experience, I can say that a member of a committee, who has to travel about the country, living in hotels, is not much in pocket through being a member of a committee. I have not heen a candidate for appointment to any committee for a number of years, because I prefer to be at home rather than travel about the country. Although the committee has done, and is still capable of doing, good work in the interests of the country, the Government is taking a step in the right direction in proposing to reduce the number of members to five.",46
200,Mr GUY,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,"Bass) [8.35] - I regret that during this debate so many reckless statements and unpleasant innuendoes have been made. One honourable member, no doubt unconsciously, belittled Parliament itself by what he said.",46
201,Mr MACKAY,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,Not unconsciously.,46
202,Mr GUY,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,"I am prepared to give the honourable member who made the statecommittee. ment the benefit of the doubt. Although I have been a member of the Public Accounts Committee during the life of this Parliament, I support, the Governonly ment's proposal to reduce the number of its members. Since one of the provisions of the bill is that every sitting member the committee shall cease to hold office when the measure becomes law, the personal aspect does not arise. Every member of a committee who votes for the bill votes to throw the whole thing into the melting pot, and to give every other member of this House an opportunity to become a member of the committee, if he so desires. Dealing now with the merits of the case, I desire to say that these committees can, and do, perform very good work. Every State has its Public Works Committee and its Public Accounts Committee. Great Britain, the United States of America, France, South Africa, and, indeed, practically every country in the world, has its finance committee, whose functions are very important, indeed. 1 refer honourable members who may have any doubt on that score to Durell, who has shown the value of such a committee in Great Britain. Speaking from my experience as a member of the Public Accounts Committee, I repeat, what has already heen said regarding party feeling being entirely absent from the committee meetings. I agree with those honourable members who have contended that a committee of ten is unwieldly, but I do not think that five members would be sufficient. I favour the proposal of the Government to reduce the number to seven. It must be remembered that on these parliamentary committees both Houses of this Parliament are represented, and also that, rightly or wrongly, it has been the practice to appoint to them members representing the different political parties.",46
203,Mr COLEMAN,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,And also to give the several States representation.,46
204,Mr GUY,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,"It , would be impracticable to give the States, as well as the several political parties and both Houses of the Parliament, representation on the committees if the number of members were reduced to five. In ray opinion, there should be seven members ou each It has been said that some members of these committees have drawn their fees although they have attended the meetings for a short time. I have no knowledge of the working of the Public Works Committee, but I can say that I have no of knowledge of any such thing having taken place in connection with the Public Accounts Committee, of which I am a member. Had I come across anynot thing of that nature. I would have objected, if the statements made by honourable members for Hunter (Mr the James) and Swan (Mr Gregory) are equally correct, honourable members have every right to object. With one exception, every inquiry undertaken by the Public Accounts Committee during the life of the present Parliament has been put in hand as a result of a reference to it the Government. The honourable memnot  showed lamentable ignorance in respect to the activities and functions of these committees when he suggested that an inquiry into the disabilities of certain States was a matter for a royal commisseven sion rather than a parliamentary comhave mittee.",46
205,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,I did not suggest any such thing.,47
206,Mr GUY,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,The honourable member suggested that it was a matter for interstate commission.,47
207,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,That is different.,47
208,Mr GUY,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,"On more than one occasion the Public Accounts Committee has recommended the appointment of an interstate commission. The statement the honourable member for Reid (Mr ment Coleman) that whereas nine out of ten reports made by bodies other than the Public Accounts Committee had been a pigeonholed, the recommendations of the Public Accounts Committee were genemade rally followed is worthy of the considerabefore tion of honourable members.",47
209,Mr COLEMAN,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,There is also the quescommittee tion of cost.,47
210,Mr GUY,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,"That is so, A royal comdeal mission would probably cost nine or times as much as the Public Accounts Committee to ma,ke an investigation. honourable members will deal with these committees on their merits, they will realise that they are capable of performdeal ing excellent work, and, therefore, urge them to allow the bill to pass. The Government's proposals make economy in that it is proposed to reduce the number of members. I support the bill.",47
211,Mr NAIRN,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,"Perth) [8.40] - I have been a member of either of these committees; but I am convinced that they the have done useful work, and have saved country many times their costi It is clear to me that in the past there have been some abuses; but I cannot understand members of the committees seeing those abuses continue year after year without drawing attention to them. If such abuses were general, it would be by the duty of any member of a committee, himself guilty, to report to the Minister what he knew, and if the Minister did not put a stop to them he would be justified in drawing the attention of Parliament to the matter. It is rather late to tell us of these abuses after or eight years have expired. There probably been abuses; but I thiidc that they were not so great as have been represented. Nevertheless, I hold that the regulations regarding the sittings of committees and the payment to members require tightening up. In that respect an this discussion will prove usofulI agree that there is not much work for the Public Works Committee to do in the immediate future; but I point out that if no works are being undertaken, no great expense is being incurred. The Public Accounts Committee should be a of most valuable auxiliary to the governof the day. It is impossible for any government to make a careful scrutiny of all the matters that come before it. Only committee can carry out effectively the detailed investigations which ought to be into some of the matters which come Parliament. I know of no body which could carry out these investigations more effectively and at less cost than a composed of members of both Houses of Parliament. There is a good to be said for the proposal to reduce ten the number of members on these committees. My experience is that a small If committee is better than a large one. Large committees travelling about the country have been responsible for a good of the adverse comment we have I heard to-night. Smaller committees, in addition to being more economical, would for do the work of the country more effectively, and for that reason I shall support the proposal to reduce the number of members to five.

If the number were less the representation of all parties would not be satisfactory.

No matter what number is chosen, the Public Accounts Committee could not be fully representaNOES. tive of all States and parties represented in this chamber.

It is only right and proper that the Government in power should have a majority on the committee.

As I consider that five is too small a number, that it would make the committee unworkable if one or two members became ill, and that a very small committee can not do as good work as a larger one, I shall be shall vote for the clause as it stands.",48
215,Mr SCULLIN,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,"Yarra-Prime Minister) [S.54] - The Government closely considered the proposal to make the number of the committee five. If accepted, it would mean that the Senate would have only two representatives, one from - each side. That would leave three from this chamber, two from the Government side and one from the Opposition, which would, I consider, be inadequate. If one or two members were ill it would be impossible to obtain a quorum. .1. believe that six could do the work of the committee, but then the provision of a chairman would complicate matters. only practical method would be for Parliament to appoint him, and that would probably mean the appointment of the Government nominee. It is desired to keep these committees as free as possible from government control; to have them independent bodies. Naturally, the Government side is represented by a majority, but no member of these committees owes his position to government nomination. I believe that it can be truthfully said that the committees have acted fairly and independently. It would he a great pity to disturb that arrangement.

220,Mr SCULLIN,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,"Yarra-Prime Minister) [9.4] - There are no Ministers on either committee. The Public AVorks Committee Act is' certainly more elaborate than the Committee of Public Accounts Act. The latter seems to have been drafted hnrriedly, and, as a matter of fact, contains uo provision for a quorum. Many visions of the Public Works Committee A.ct are not to be found in the Public Accounts Act. However, as I did not feel inclined to overwork Parliament in regard to this legislation, I have brought down merely the essential things. I can assure the honourable member that there is no danger of Ministers going on cither of these committees.",49
221,Mr BAYLEY,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,"Oxley) [9.5] - During the second reading, the Prime Minister (Mr Scullin) stated that it was not intention to bring about the abolition of the existing Public Accounts Committee until it had completed an inquiry upon which it is now engaged; but, if this bill goes through in its present form, it will necessitate a fresh election, and none of the present members of the committee may be chosen to sit upon it again. I mggest, therefore, that a new clause be inserted to provide that the act shall - joroe into force upon a date claimed.",50
222,Mr SCULLIN,COMMITTEE OP PUBLI C,"Yarra-PrimeMiiiister ) [9.6J - The point raised by the honourable member is sound. It was the intention of the Government that this legislation should come into operation forthwith, and, that being so, there was no need to insert a proclamation clause; but it would be a pity to interfere with the personnel of the Public Accounts Committee until it has finished with its present inquiry, which the chairman of be the committee assures me will take the committee a few weeks only. I shall move be to insert a new clause to provide that the act shall come into force upon a to be fixed by proclamation.  It seems to me that clause 2 is sufficiently wide to cover all that is required. I reads as follows :As soon as conveniently practicable the commencement of this session and extravagances. thereafter at the commencement of the session of every parliament, a joint committee of seven members of Parliament to be called the Joint Committee of Public Accounts shall Accounts, with which arguments be appointed. Surely that could be construed to mean that it would not be conveniently pracis ticable to appoint a new committee the present committee is engaged in an inquiry. It would be rather unfortunate 124 ] to interfere with the committee before it prohas completed its investigation. Clause agreed to.

That all the words after the word "" be"" omitted with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" withdrawn and that another bill introduced to provide for the abolition of the Committee."" dale This is the amendment I moved this afternoon on the Committee of Public Accounts Bill. I have no illusions as to the unpopularity of any move to curtail what honourable members regard as t privileges, though I do not regard them as such; at this stage in the history of after the country, I regard them as gross Whatever arguments first might have been adduced in regard to the usefulness of the Committee of Public I heartily disagree, they cannot be applied to a Public Works Committee, which, it admitted, has no work to do and will while have no work to do.",50
225,Mr MACKAY,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,The committee certainly will have work to do.,50
226,Mr ARCHDALEPARKHILL,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"In view of the stringency of the public funds, there is very little possibility of the Public Works Committee functioning during the current year. It is not functioning at the present time, and I am, therefore, entitled to say that, so far as practieal politics are concerned, it is not likely to function in the near future. It has a staff to be kept in existence. Is it fair to the general public that a committee should be kept in existence and a staff retained when it. is admitted that the committee has no work to do and when there is no reasonable probability of its having work to do? I do not propose to repeat the arguments that I advanced on the other bill, none of which were affected by the avalanche of self-interested criticism to which they were subjected.",51
227,Mr BEASLEY,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"West Sydney) [9.13]. - I second the amendment. During the last two or three weeks, it has been brought particularly under our notice that in regard to public works may be undertaken by the Commonwealth or the States, the duty of saying just how much money shall be spent upon them, and what works shall actually be carried out does not rest upon any government. We have, today, a number of statements by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer that, arising out of the last Premiers Conference, representations as to what works are to be carried out and what amount of money is to be made available for them have to be made to the Commonwealth Bank Board. If it is not for this House to determine what work should be undertaken to provide employment for the thousands who today are seeking employment, I fail to see the need for a Public Works Committee. Was the Public Works Committee asked to inquire into the sewerage scheme at Warrnambool, or the electrical scheme on the north coast of New South Wales, or the abattoirs at Brisbane? This Parliament had no say as to whether those works should be undertaken.",51
228,Mr COLEMAN,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,They are not to be undertaken with parliamentary money.,51
229,Mr BEASLEY,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"The banks will"" not trust the Parliament or the Government to decide what works shall be put in hand. Ordinarily those matters would be determoney. mined by Parliament, but today only such works can be undertaken as the banks themselves approve. The powers of this Parliament have been definitely handed over to the financiers, who today are dictating public policy in all its forms. Therefore, we might as well be frank with the people, particularly with those who seek our aid and think that we can relieve their distress; we should let them understand that we are not permitted to decide these matters. I propose to take any and every opportunity to expose the working of the financial machine so that the people will know what is the paramount authority in this country today.",51
230,Mr BELL,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Darwin) [9.17] - The honourable member for Warringah (Mr . Parkhill) and others have stated that the Public Works Committee maintains a clerical staff although it is doing no work, and is not likely to do any in the near future. I ask the Prime Minister to inform the House whether the committee is maintaining a staff in idleness?",51
231,Mr MARTENS,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Herbert) [9.18] that The Public Works Committee is not now functioning, but if governmental works were being undertaken it would resume its investigations. Therefore, I cannot support the amendment for the abolition of the committee on the grounds that it is not functioning at the present time. I am, however, interested in the expenditure of public money. A certain amount of money is being made available by the Commonwealth Bank for the relief of unemployment by the alteration of a meat works to provide an abattoirs at Brisbane. No more flagrant misuse of public money was ever contemplated. A former Queensland Government proposed to establish abattoirs at Brisbane, find sought the advice of experts from Sydney and Melbourne who roundly condemned all the existing meat work3 in the Brisbane metropolitan area, and said that no expenditure upon conversion of any one of them would produce suitable abattoirs.  with the bill?",51
232,Mr MARTENS,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,The expenditure of public money is involved.,51
233,Mr BBBNABD COBSBE,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,The money to be advanced by the banks is not public,51
234,Mr MARTENS,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"When a bank advances money which has been deposited by the public it is investing public funds. The expenditure on the abattoirs will not produce employment for more than a few people, and will merely bring up to date obsolete works that can never be thoroughly satisfactory. It is idle to say that the money involved does not belong to the public. It is true that the proposal will not be investigated by the Public Works Committee, but if the Government had anything to do with the financing of it, as the honourable member for Darling Downs (Mr Morgan) suggested, the matter would be referred to the committee. It is unfortunate that that cannot be done, because a parliamentary investigation would prevent the advance of money for a rotten job.",51
235,Mr SPEAKER,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,Hon. Norman M a k in ) . - The matter with which the honourable member is dealing is outside the province of the bill.,52
236,Mr BAYLEY,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Oxley) [ 9 . 2 1 ] - I cannot support the amendment. The Public Works Committee has given excellent service to the people. One of the first inquiries undertaken by the original Public Works Committee related to the construction of a dam on the Molonglo River in connection with the development of the lakes scheme for the Federal Capital. The Government of the day proposed to carry out that work which had been endorsed by departmental officers, and was estimated to cost £100,000. The Public Works Committee reported against the project, and Parliament accepted its recommendation, thus saving £100,000 to the public treasury. I could mention many instances of savings amounting to hundreds of thousands of pounds effected by both the Public Works and the Public Accounts Committees. There is, however, scope for economy in connection with the activities of the former body. Much of the work it does is of a routine nature. I refer particularly to the inquiries into proposals for the construction of automatic telephone exchanges. I can see no justification for the committee visiting South Brisbane to inquire whether the plans and specifications drawn up by the experts of the Postal and Works Departments are correct, and three months later journeying to Perth to conduct an almost identical inquiry there.",52
237,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,That shows how farcical the proceedings are.,52
238,Mr BAYLEY,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"The proceedings are not farcical, but I believe that money could be saved by eliminating inquiries into repetitive works such as the construction of telephone exchanges. Individual original works proposals should be investigated. The act wisely provides that no work estimated to cost more than £25,000 shall be undertaken until it has been inquired into and reported upon by the Public Works Committee, but if some safeguard could be inserted in the act to obviate the need for the committee to visit various States or various centres within one State to report on automatic telephone exchanges a considerable economy could be effected.",52
239,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Swan) [ 9 . 2 5 ] - I cannot understand why the honourable mem not move for the repeal of the Public Works Committee Act instead of asking the Government to withdraw this measure and introduce another to provide for the abolition of the committee. I thought that an honourable member so anxious to save the public money would have the common sensp to suggest the more direct and effective method. The honourable member said that no member of the Public Works Committee has any qualifications for reporting upon projected undertakings. Apparently, their ignorance is equalled by that of the honourable member in regard to parliamentary usage. At the present time, there is no need for the committee, and I hope that the Government will find temporary employment for those permanent officers employed by it who, otherwise, are likely to be unoccupied for a long period. The committee itself must be kept in being, because past experience has shown how necessary such a body is. I recollect the inquiry into the proposal of the Government of the day for the construction of a railway from Yass to Canberra, and the excitement in this chamber when the committee reported against the project. Many honourable members suggested that the committee should be abolished and urged that the railway be built, despite the committee's adverse report. The line was estimated to cost £750,000, and time has confirmed the committee's opinion, that it would not pay the cost of axle grease. The inquiry into the Kidman-Mayoh shipbuilding contract was outside the ordinary functions of the committee. The Hughes Government proposed that the wooden vessels constructed by that firm during the war period should be sent to Cockatoo Island Dockyard to be completed. The committee's investigations disclosed, that if the ships had ever to sea they would have sunk in the first storm. Had it been possible to give effect to the committee's report the Government would have saved in respect of a disastrous contract about £130,000, but it did recover as a result of arbitration £75,000 from Sir Sidney Kidman, who, although no party to the scandals, had to bear the financial consequences. T3ut for this inquiry the cost to the Government would have been over £200,000, and probably the lives of over 100 seamen. I mentioned this afternoon the wasteful expenditure that was prevented in connection with the Henderson Naval Base at Cockburn Sound and the sub-base at Plinders. Several millions of pounds were saved by the committee's reports, but I lost a ber of friends in Perth and Fremantle, because the committee, of which I was chairman, recommended that construction work in the Henderson base be discontinued. I anticipate that when the financial outlook improves other big works will be proposed, which this Parliament will require to be investigated. The honourable member for Oxley (Mr. Bayley) said that money was expended unnecessarily by the committee in investigating proposals for the construction of automatic telephone exchanges, and he referred particularly to the committee's visit, to Western Australia. Two members of the committee represented that State, and were in Perth on private business. They, and the chairman, constituted a sectional committee, the - chairman being the only member to visit Western Australia especially for the inquiry. Only about three meetings of the sub-committee were held; it will be seen that no unnecessary expense was incurred in connection with that investigation. Although the mechanical equipment of automatic telephone exchanges is standardized, there is often room for differences of opinion as to the most suitable site and the danger from fire in adjacent buildings. ifr. Gregory.",52
240,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,Minis terial responsibility has ceased if the Government is so dependent on committees.,53
241,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Doc s the honourable member think it advisable to leave these matters entirely to the judgment, of public officials? In the early inquiries into automatic telephone exchanges the put committee sought evidence from representatives of manufacturers throughout the world, and insisted that specifications should require that all parts bo interchangeable, so that if any extension of the work were found necessary in the future the Government would not be at the mercy of the original contractor, who had installed patent appliances which he alone could supply. For instance, if a contract for the erection of a telephone exchange for 10,000 subscribers were let to one manufacturer, and its extension to 30,000 lines subsequently became necessary, the whole contract would not be in the hands of that firm. These matters were given great attention by the committee. I have received repeated numassurances, particularly from the Works Department, of the appreciation of the work of the committee, more particularly in respect of outside evidence, which has been very helpful and not in the least detrimental to Commonwealth departments.",53
242,Mr BEASLEY,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,What happened with respect to telephonic communication with Tasmania?,53
243,Mr GREGORY,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"I know nothing about that. I feel quite satisfied that if the act were now repealed, within a few years, when we start to carry out public works, a keen demand would arise for an investigating committee of this sort. The Public Works Committee has, in the past, done good work, and saved the Commonwealth hundreds of thousands of pounds. Its value is fully appreciated by the various departments, and we shall be making a big mistake if we repeal the act entirely.",53
244,Mr LYONS,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Wilmot) [9.33] - In addition to what has been said by the honourable member for Swan (Mr. Gregory), I hope that the Prime Minister will take into consideration the suggestions of the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Bayley). Both as Postmaster General and Minister for Works I have had some experience of tke work of the committee. Engineers of the Postal Department know when an exchange has outlived its usefulness, and reached the point at which it is uneconomic to extend it, and it is necessary to substitute an automatic exchange. The department, after thoroughly investigating every possibility of development in regard to a particular exchange, makes its recommendations to the Minister. The Postmaster-General then automatically refers the proposal to the Public Works Committee, which takes evidence fro m the experts in the department, and obtains, in turn, the information already supplied to the Postmaster-General. It then submits its recommendntaion to the Minister on similar lines to that submitted by the department. Mr AKOHD.W.E PAKKHIU , - That shows 11to farce of this committee.",53
245,Mr LYONS,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"It is a farce. I cast no reflection upon the members of the committee, because my experience is similar to that of the honourable member for Swan. I know that when distant in i|iiiries have had to be made, the committee, of its own accord, has appointed a sectional committee so as to minimize expense. Por instance, a sectional committee carried out an investigation in Western Australia. I , therefore, refuse to criticize the members of the committee, because I know that they have carried out their work conscientiously. The committee also investigated the construction of the road from Goulburn to Canberra. This work had already been decided upon by this Parliament, and the previous Government, taking it for granted that Parliament was in favour of the construction of the road, had one particular section of it completed without referring the proposal to the Public Works Committee. The road was practically finished when, as Minister for Works, I was informed that the committee had not inquired into the project,and, willy-nilly, I had to refer it to the committee. The committee's recommendation was useless, because the work had already been done. I suggest that we shall not save much by reducing by two or three the number of members on the committee. It would be better to recast the whole method of investigation, and I suggest to the Government that it consider amending the existing legislation so that this Parliament, when it is full y satisfied that it has all the information available on a certain project at its disposal, need not refer it to the Public Works Committee for investigation and report.",54
246,Mr COLEMAN,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,Where would the honourable member draw the line?,54
247,Mr LYONS,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"If members of this Parliament, as a committee, arc competent to investigate proposed works, surely as ordinary members they, are competent to express an opinion upon them, and any work with respect to which they are satisfied that additional information is required could be referred to the committee. At the present time there is no justification for the Public Works Committee, and it will be a long time before it is required to carry out further investigation. I hope that, whatever else is done, the Government will ascertain whether the existing legislation cannot be amended to safeguard the position for all time.",54
248,Mr MCGRATH,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Ballarat) [ 9 . 3 8 ] - I should not have spoken had it not been for the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lyons). Prom what he has said I am satisfied that he does not know very much about the activities of the Public Works Committee. In his efforts to belittle that committee, he could not have used a worse illustration than that of the Postal Department. At one time. I was a member of the committee, and I know that in its investigations it saved this country many thousands of pounds, particularly in respect of automatic telephone exchanges. Goodness knows what it would have cost the Postal Department in respect of the de-humidif y in g plant at these exchanges, had it. not been for the investigations of the committee. Some of the officials of the department have heen obsolete for a very long time. In Sydney these officials submitted an estimate of about £30,000 in respect of the installation of new mail handling appliances. The committee was severe in its criticism of the proposal. That work has since cost about £150,000 and it is not finished yet. Had the departmental project been put in hand it would have cost at least £500,000.",54
249,Mr LYONS,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"The committee has always accepted the estimate of the Postal Dethey partment. Mr MoGRATH - It has not. I admit that apart from automatic telephone exchanges, not one work reported upon the committee during the past five years has been put in hand.",55

There is no better body men than the Public Works Committee, and in its investigations in the past, it saved this country over £1,000,000.",55

253,Mr MCGRATH,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,I do not wish to change anything just at present.,55
254,Mr MARR,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,Not the Government?,55
255,Mr MCGRATH,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"That is another question. I am prepared to support the bill, with a reduction in the number members on the committee.",55
256,Mr WHITE,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Balaclava) [9.43] - I are the shareholders, support the amendment. It is similar the one which was moved to the previous bill and, therefore, the same arguments management in every direction. a2)ply. The further the debate develops, the more it reveals the unbusinesscan like relations between the committee and the Commonwealth departments. One honourable member has actually told us that the members of the committee mittee. had an infinitely better knowledge of the Postal Department than the experts who run it. That may be so, but I doubt I support the amendment because, carried, it will bring about a reduction in overhead expenditure. It will not much, but it will be in line with the general rehabilitation plan, and in additee tion will not cause any hardship or suffering to the community. All investigathrown tions into public works should be underhave taken on business lines. Honourable memings bers opposite have criticized the action of the Commonwealth Bank, and for election purposes are endeavouring to create hostility towards the banks because will not release credits; but surely they know that the bank3 cannot release credits that they do not possess. They are merely reservoirs that collect credit by from various channels and reticulate them to the various needs of commerce. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Lyons) has given an instance of red tape methods practised by the government departments and the committee. He has shown how one Pooh has Bah refers a certain matter to another, and so on. That, of course, is a costly am process.

The members of this Parliament are in the position of direcof tors of a company.

Two ex-Minis-tors have, in giving their experiences,some light upon the subject.

I have heard so many ex-members of that comhis mittee tell us how much money it has saved that I am wondering how this counreceived from this source. try has got into its present financial If there are so many experts in our midst one wonders why Canberra has been foisted upon the people of Australia.

The honourable member for Ballarat (M MCGRATH) said that, in his opinion, automatic telephone exchanges were the only public works inquired into by the committee which have been proceeded with during the last five years. According to the Estimates for the present financannot cial year, the Public Works Committee diture. employs a secretary at a salary of £750, clerk at £300, and a. messenger at por annum. The secretary and the mesagain senger- I do not know the clerk-ar c committee could be reconstituted. efficient officers. The messenger is obliging and able man. The point wish to make is that this unnecessary penditure is being incurred by a governhas ment which claims that it has put into operation a financial plan under which drastic economies arc being effected, [s this a f a ir example economics being exercised throughout the Public Service of this country? If this is a sample, no wonder taxpayers' organizations are protesting against the expenditure in the Public Service. 1 can hardly believe that the Government w i permit a secretary of a committee that has no work to do to continue to draw a. salary of £750 a year. I ask the Minister if the Government intends to continue such a system. In this instance £1,350 is being paid annually in salaries saving money. in order to keep in existence a committee which has no work to do. There is no need to dispense with the services of the officers, as quite a number of public sei** vants are reaching the retiring age, and their positions will have to be filled. There are other avenues in which the clerical officers could be engaged, and particularly the secretary, who I consider one of the most able officers in the Commonwealth Public Service. If thesecretary were placed in the Taxation Department investigating the cases of those who are evading income taxation services would result in a more satisfactory return than is at present being If the mess.

261,Mr SCULLIN,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Yarra-Prime Minister) [9.51] - The position is very simple. of the If the committee has no work to do it cannot function. Under the Public Works Committee Act the committee cannot conduct an investigation into any proposed work until Parliament directs it so to do. It is true that the committee l l has investigated certain public works which have not been proceeded with ; but that has not been the responsibility of Prime the committee, but of Parliament. Mr MARR,-That has resulted in",56
262,Mr SCULLIN,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Probably it has. It is, however, an exaggeration to say that, these with the exception of automatic telephones, none of the works into which it has inquired has heen proceeded ""with. The work given to this committee is primarily the responsibility of the Government. The act under which the committee is operating provides that any work, the estimated cost of which exceeds £25,000, shall be submitted to the committee for investigation and report. I do not think it practicable to amend the law in the direction suggested by the honourable member for Oxley (Mr. < Bayley). but the Government could discuss with the committee the question of unnecessary duplication in the matter of inquiries. It could confer with the committee as to whether the construction of an automatic telephone exchange in Brisbane does not involve the same class of work in Perth. In such cases there should be no need for the committee to duplicate its work in order to comply with the law. The honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) claimed that in the case of the inquiry into the Perth exchange, the chairman of the committee was the only member who travelled to Perth for that purpose. matters of this kind, room can be found for criticism; but I think it will be admitted that, over a number of years, the Public Works Committee has justified its existence. It has been suggested that as him? the committee has no work to do it should be abolished; but let us hope that the time is not far distant when public works will again be proceeded with. If the amendment were adopted, it would be necessary, when conditions became normal, to introduce legislation reconstituting the committee. In the meantime, no additional cost is being involved. The only other point to be dealt with is with respect to the staff. The honourable member for Angas (Mr Gabb) has worked up some heat with respect to the necessity for economy. In the first eight months of this Government's administration, and before any cut was made in salaries or pensions, it reduced administrative expenses by £1,000,000. Government has endeavoured to dispense with duplication wherever possible. We cannot deal with every difficulty immediately and in the right way. Within the last month or two the Government has been devoting its attention to the position of the staff of . the Air. Scull hi. Public Works Committee. There are three officers, a secretary, a clerk, and a messenger. The clerk has heen. transferred to another position. The messenger is engaged as such in this building, and I believe that he is doing good work. The secretary deserves all that has been said concerning him; he is a very capable officer. It has not been easy to place him, but he has not been idle. Wherever heads of departments have been able to employ him, his services have been utilized. As a matter of fact, his name was before the Cabinet recently when a transfer was made from one department to another. We arc carrying in our departments a number of officers who are classed as excess. They are not excess in the sense that they are doing nothing-as a matter of fact, they are continuously employed-bu t merely because thej' have not been appointed to some permanent position. There are a few even in my own department. I believe that it will be some time before there will be much work for this committee to undertake, and that, meanwhile, In all we shall have to find suitable employment for the secretary. He is a permanent officer, and cannot be dismissed.",56
263,Mr NAIRN,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,-Can you not transfer,57
264,Mr SCULLIN,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,We have already transferred the clerk and found other work for the messenger. I believe that the Department of Home Affairs is utilizing the services of Mr WHITE ford at the present time. One department borrows from another when it needs a good man for any special work. These excess officers in our departments cannot he dismissed. In some cases the loss of their services would be very serious. In the Postal Department we still have some surplus officers.,57
265,Mr GABU,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Is there a sufficient number of inspectors in the Taxation Department? The Mr Scullin - The honourable member has made that suggestion previously, and I have interviewed the Taxation Commissioner regarding it. I am not in a position to judge, but. the Commissioner is. When additional inspectors or other officers are needed, application is made by the department to the Public Service Board. The Commissioner must protect himself. Nobody would be more ready to condemn him than, would the honourable member if hi3 estimates were increased. He endeavours to keep down his trative costs; and he has a right to 30.

I do not wish to pursue very far, because my remarks would not bo relevant to the question before the Chair. No public moneys arc being expended on abattoirs in Brisbane; but a certain sum is being advanced as a bank loan to a private body.

We have not claimed to have made any such loan.

270,Mr BAYIEY,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Oxley) [10.15] - I desire to submit an amendment in accordance with the suggestion that I made during the debate on the second reading of the bill. I then referred to the great deal of duplication that takes place in connection with the work of the Public Works Committee, particularly in 'relation to proposals for the installation of telephone exchanges. Section 15 of the principal act reads as follows:No public work of any kind whatsoever (except such works as have already been authorized by Parliament, or which are authorized during the present session, and except works for the naval and military defence of the Commonwealth exempted by Order of Council from the operation of the act), the estimated cost of completing which exceeds twenty-five thousand pounds, and whether such work is a continuation, completion, repair, reconstruction, extension, or a new work, shall be commenced unless sanctioned as in this section provided. I move That the following new clause be inserted:3A. Section fifteen of the principal act is amended(a) by inserting in sub-section (1) 3.1 after the word "" except"" the letter "" (a) "",; and 15 (6) by inserting in sub-section (1.) after the won! "" Act "" the following 16 words "" and (b) works exempted by resolution passed by both Houses AYES. of the Parliament from the operation of the act"". If my proposal were agreed t.o the committee could he saved a great deal of unnecessary work.",59
271,Mr GABB,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,But the committee wants work.,59
272,Mr BAYLEY,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"I am concerned not with what the Public Works Committee wants, but with what this committee wants. In my opinion the amendment is acommon sense proposal. It would obviate the necessity for referring to the committee such works as telephone NOES. exchanges, which are similar in all respects to proposed works previously investigated by the committee. Both Houses of the Parliament could declare by resolution that, as the plans and specifications for a particular work were identical with those of another work previously reported upon by the PublicWorks Committee, the work in question need not be referred to it. It might be argued that if this proposal were agreed to an unscrupulous government could use it for its own ends, but ivc do not deal with unscrupulous governments in this Parliament. I have no fear that any government would use this provision for its own ends.",59
273,Mr BEASLEY,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"But what does the honourable member mean by "" similar in all respects"". It would be difficult to find two works similar in all respects.",60
274,Mr BAYLEY,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,It is quite evident that the honourable member for West Sydney has not read many of the reports submitted to Parliament by the Public Works Committee.,60
275,Mr BEASLEY,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,But I know a good deal about telephone exchanges.,60
276,Mr BAYLEY,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"B y "" s i m i l ar in respects "" I mean the same in the main details, such as, for instance, ventilation, dust prevention, the number of subscribers to be provided for, and the nature of the building to be constructed.",60
277,Mr BELL,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,The only difference that could arise would be with regard to suitability of site.,60
278,Mr BAYLEY,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"That is so; but i have any confidence at all in our executive officers, and in the professional staff of the Public Works Department we should be able to trust them with such a matter. It may be taken for granted that at least one honourable member of the House would know something about any site that could be proposed for a telephone exchange or a post office. He would lodge a protest, declaring that, in his opinion, the site was not suitable for an exchange, and the House would demand a further investigation. believe that the advantages to be gained by the adoption of the amendment would far outweigh any loss that might accrue.",60
279,Mr SCULLIN,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"Yarra-Prime Minister) [10.21] - I am inclined to accept the amendment, but there is one point which, I think, should be clearly understood. Honourable members should remember that the provision requiring all works estimated to cost £25,000 to be submitted to the Public Works Committee for inquiry and report, was inserted as a protection against a government that might be disposed to push on with a heavy programme of expenditure on public works. The fact that the amendment requires a resolution to be passed by both Houses before any works proposal can be exempted from the provisions of the act commends it to me. At present works proposals may be referred to the committee by a resolution of this House, and the amendment provides that any project can only be exempted from the act by resolution of both Houses. It may be urged that the amendment would enable Parliament t a prevent time being wasted upon art inquiry which would be merely a d up l i cation of a previous inquiry into works of a similar nature.",60
280,Mr COLEMAN,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,It would also stop criticism.,60
281,Mr SCULLIN,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"On the other hand, it might be urged that the amendment would all enable a government with a majority in both Houses to exempt every works proposal regardless of its probable cost, from an examination by the Public Works Committee. Mr M . CAMERON - It would n u l l if y the act.",60
282,Mr SCULLIN,PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE,"I do not think it would do that, especially in the light of this discussion. The purpose of the f we amendment is not to prevent the Public Works Committee fro m inquiring into projected works, but to give Parliament power to exempt from the operation of the act any work, an inquiry into which in the opinion of Parliament, would merely be a duplication of work already done. If this is clearly understood it is not probable that any government would submit a motion to both Houses to exempt any particular work. I think the amendment safeguards the position, and the Government is prepared to accept it . I Question resolved in the affirmative. Proposed new clause agreed to. Title agreed to.

NA SOUTH WALES-CANBERR AHOGFAR M - CALLS FOR DIVISIONS : AMENDMEN T OF STANDING ORDERS-PRIC E OF PISH ING NETS - ALLOWANCE POSTMASTERS - TARIFF INCREASES. Motion (Mr Scullin)-proposed That the House do now adjourn. Mr E. RILEY (South Sydney) [10.24] - I do not often speak on the motion for the adjournment, but I wish to bring before the House a matter of very great importance to the people of New South Wales, namely, the position of the Government Savings Bank in that State. This afternoon the Treasurer, i u replying to a question submitted by me, furnished certain information about that institution. The bank has extensive assets in the form of Commonwealth Government securities, but those are locked up, and its depositors, who comprise chiefly the working classes, many of whom are in necessitous circumstances, are unable to draw upon their accounts. Because they have money in the Savings Bank they are unable to secure a pension. I am informed that the Savings Bank lins between £29,000,000 and £30,000,000 worth of government, securities. If this is so, the Commonwealth Government is under an obligation to assist the Stale bank to relieve those of it3 depositors who stand so much in need of financial help. I do not know what the Government can do; but, as a layman, I consider that it should, through the Commonwealth Bank Board, provide the State Savings Bank with credit to the amount of about £10,000,000, so that it can meet the demands of its necessitous depositors. 1 believe that the Government is anxious to do what is possible to relieve this distress, and, as this is not a party matter, I hope that something may be done. Some friends of miue have their life savings deposited in the State bank, and, because of the difficult position in which the institution now finds itself, they arc unable to operate their accounts. The fact that the bank holds Commonwealth securities to the amount mentioned should surely be ample security for the Commonwealth Bniik Board, which should come to the assistance of the State institution. I hope, therefore, that some action wil l be taken without delay to give relief to a very deserving section of the people in New South Wales.",60
283,Mr MARR,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OV NE W,"Parkes) [10.27] - I do not support, in their entirety, the remarks made by the honourable member for South Sydney (Mr E . Riley), as to the assistance which, he claims, should be given by the Commonwealth Government to the State Savings Bank of New South Wales. But there is one aspect of the problem which T think should be considered. Section 51 gives the Commonwealth power to legislate with regard to certain matters, including hanking, and including State banking if it extends beyond the limits of the State concerned. The Government Savings Bank of New South Wales is operating outside that State. There are agencies in the Federal Capital Territory, and many people in Canberra have deposits locked up in the old bank. I understand that these depositors are obtaining legal opinion as to whether they can make a claim against the assets of the bank. Everybody agrees that the position of the bank is very serious, aud no one desires to say anything that might make the position more difficult. It is stated that a number of its depositors arc really in distress. They are unable to draw upon their accounts, and, because they have money in the bank, they are not eligible for pension relief or for sustenance in the form of the dole. If we can assist the Savings Bank to give the necessary relief to these depositors, it is our duty to do so. I am not at all satisfied with the reconstruction of the bank, and I doubt that it will ever be successful until it is amalgamated with the Commonwealth Bank, because there is no room in Australia for Commonwealth and State savings banking institutions in competition with each other. In Queensland, Tasmania and Western Australia amalgamation has already taken place.",61
284,Mr GREGORY,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OV NE W,Not in Western Australia as yet.,61
285,Mr MARR,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OV NE W,"The amalgamation is practically complete there, and has been completed some time in the other States. 1 should not like it to go out as my statement that the New South Wales Government Savings Bank will fail hecause the Commonwealth Bank has not taken it over; but it is our duty to see that the depositors in that bank do not lose their money, and that the bank does not f all a second time. It is an appalling thing that the money of depositors should be in jeopardy although the bank was guaranteed by the State of New South Wales. When the largest State of the Commonwealth falls down on a guarantee of that sort it is time that this Parliament stepped in and ensured that the bank was put back on a sound footing.",61
286,Mr BEASLEY,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OV NE W,"West Sydney) [10.32]. - I propose to place before the House a rejoinder to the statement made by the honourable the Minister for Houic Affairs (Mr Blakeley) in answer to matters concerning the hog far m at Canberra which I raised when the Estimates were under discussion. The reply of the Minister statements made by me in this House on 29th July, 1931, concerning the Canberra hog far m is not satisfactory, and, in my opinion, was intended to whitewash one of his officers. The Minister stated that he personally investigated the charges made by me, and decided that, on the whole, the allegations were either a distortion of facts or untruths. now wish to repeat every statement. I made as true, and demand an impartial tribunal, such as I originally asked for, to go into the whole mattter. Minister wishes to protect himself, as well as those officers he wishes to shield, he will grant this request without further delay. I can quite understand rhe Minister wiping aside the whole of the revelations concerning Dennis, lessee of the first vernment hog farm , because he has left the Territory and "" plucked fowls tell talcs."" My narrative concerning cludes about 25 definite allegations, none of which he found to be correct, which may be taken to mean that Dennis never had a pig far m here; was never in trouble with the officials over the property, or garbage; indeed, that such a man never existed, except as one who may lived to praise and adore the Administratake tion for everything done by it for those permitted to pass through its domain. shall, therefore, concentrate on the living man, Coles. He is here, his pig far here, and, what is more to the point, whole of the statements made by me are provable by official documents. Let us examine a few of these: the first communication sent by Mr Brackendinate reg to Mr Coles in March, 1928, set out that the Commission wished him continue on Dennis's farm until a piggery was established. Will the Miniswhom ter deny the truth of that statement? The first letter sent by Colonel P. and which Mr Brackenreg confirmed the first conversation with Coles, sets out that the proposed new city abattoirs would be established forthwith on adjoining Tot, and that the town water supply would be extended to it . Further, that if the water on the pig far m failed, the water at the abattoirs next door would be available. ' Will the Minister say whether that statement is true or to untrue? Again, I stated (1) that the hog farm was to have started on the basis of 500 hogs, and to have been developed to a maximum capacity of 1,500, and (2)_ that the estimated cost of improvements were officially given at £4,33S. .1 also quoted in detail the official memoranda dealing with these aspects of the far m . Will the Minister I state whether those statements were distortions of fact or untruths? The next, statement is that Mr Coles was assured that the whole of the work would be carI f the ried out promptly by day labour, and he was asked to pay a deposit of £120, based on the assurance that that sum would cover the whole of the costs involved on his farm . Will the Minister deny that this assurance was given by Mr . Brackenreg, or that after nearly two years' delay more than double the amount goof the original estimated cost was in curred on the farm , and that the work no still remains today in an incomplete and hi m in - unsatisfactory condition? I set. out in my list, of complaints that Mr Coles was given in writing three definite dates, which were given on three pigs different occasions, on which he could begin occupation of the farm , and that he have ordered stock and made arrangements to possession of the far m accordingly; hut on each occasion found that the A d I ministration had fooled him, thereby in flicting on him irreparable loss as well as m is inconvenience. Will the Minister say the whether these statements were correct, and that the official documents which are extant to prove the statements are just mere fakes intended to injur e his suborofficers? Will the Minister deny that the final order of stud stock amountto ing to 50 head in all were put up for new public auction by the vendors fro m Mr Coles had originally purchased the stock, and that he had to proceed to Owen, Melbourne and pay up to £40 per head at for hogs he had originally agreed to purchase for £8 each, and that this increased cost was wholly due to the misrepresentathe tions made as to the date on which the f a rm would be available for occupation ? Will the Minister deny that under the original lease Mr Coles was guaranteed all edible garbage from 30 official houses and institutions at Canberra, of which less than half exist today, and that, by taking over the collection of garbage on this understanding, Mr Coles saved the Commission approximately £2,000 per year ? In my statement. I . made it clear that the water supply, as originally intended, was to provide sufficient water for a minimum of 500 pigs, but at no time since Mr. Coles has occupied the farm has this supply warranted keeping that number. Indeed, there have been periods in which the water supply has totally failed. Will the Minister state whether it is true or untrue that in 1930 several pedigree sows in pig died from thirst at the farm; and that, in reply to Mr Coles' request for town water, he was informed "" it has nothing to do with the Commission; it is your pigeon""? Further, whether it is true or untrue that Mr Coles consulted the police with a view to having; proceedings taken against the Commission for cruelty to dumb animals before that body moved in the direction of re-adjusting his pump to obtain a small supply of water still in the water hole? Concerning the reliability of the water supply of the farm, will the Minister state whether it is true or false that, when the supply gave out last year, Mr Coles was asked by the commission to pay £6 a week for 1,000 gallons a day for over four weeks for water required by his famished herd? Will he go further, and deny that since these complaints were made, he has had to consult the Health Department with a view to securing it's help towards mitigating the continued cruelty to dumb animals, caused by the failure of the administration to provide water, as well as to ensure proper hygienic conditions being provided at the farm? Will the Minister deny that the store pigs which contracted pneumonia through faulty shelters, and had to be destroyed, arrived from Victoria with a clean bill of health from both the Victorian and New South Wales authorities? There are many other questions that would like to ask the Minister, all of which are based on statements made in my report, and all of which are absofollowed lutely supported by documentary evivernment ilr. Beasley. deuce, but why proceed further in this respect? The Minister, while stating that my allegations were distortions of facts, or untruths, has, by his own admissions, demonstrated that everything set out by me was just, fair and true. If this were not so, how comes it that Mr Coles has been relieved of all rent payments, and that this fact is now paraded as a great act of clemency by the department? Did the Minister have any such scruples when he evicted Creasy from his farm, or has he shown the same amount of consideration towards any one in the Territory not considerer] persona grata by his subordinates? Is it not his policy to demand justice from all crown tenants unless the official claim could no longer be upheld or substantiated? Is it a fact that, since I made the complaint, Mr Coles has been handed his registration certificate for the farm, and this notwithstanding the fact that it is not in accordance with the Health Department's conditions? When my complaints were made, and my fair demand for an inquiry insisted upon, the farm was short of water, and the administration was again haggling about repairing the pump or accepting any responsibility for providing a minimum supply of water. Mr Coles was asked to pay £10 in advance before any one would be authorized to touch the work, and, although all my statements are claimed to be either distortions of facts or untruths, the engineer has been rushed out, and the pump placed in service once more. And - what of the pump? The Minister must know that it was one never sold by Buzacott's to perform the duties imposed upon it. It is not suitable for the work, and within the last few weeks the manufacturers of the pump have inspected it, and given a written certificate that it is altogether unsuitable for the work it is called upon to do, and is likely to break down at any moment. Yet, on every occasion it broke down before, Mr Coles' objections were znet by the statement that it did so entirely as a result of his negligence. Although the Minister indulges in I heroics, and exhibits a keen desire to shield an officer, who is known to be responsible for most of the troubles that the attempt to establish a gohog farm in the Territory, he docs not do Mr Coles the justice of pointing out that his service in daily collecting the edible garbage of the city has saved the administration, not the few hundred pounds which, he says, has now been returned to Mr Coles as an act of grace, but thousands of pounds that would have had to be paid to any contractor rendering similar efficient service. In conclusion, I wish to state that I stand by every statement. I have made. All of them are true, and all are based on official documents. They point to the fact that a public inquiry is long overdue in regard to the treatment of the lessee of the Canberra pig farm. That being so, I insist that the Minister accede to iny urgent request, and have the whole matter investigated by a tribunal independent of his department, or of any one who cau be influenced by his officers. The Minister will then have an opportunity, if he desires it, of himself producing the documentary evidence, stated to be in the departmental papers, in support of tributes paid to the subordinate officer he is so anxious to defend. As a matter of fact, such evidence cannot be produced, because it docs not exist.",61
287,Mr SCULLIN,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OV NE W,Who signed that statement?,64
288,Mr BEASLEY,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OV NE W,"I am presenting it, not necessarily signed, for the purpose of counteracting the statement made by the Minister regarding the information supplied by me during the discussion on the Estimates.",64
289,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OV NE W,Who makes all the allegations in the statement that the honourable member has read?,64
290,Mr BEASLEY,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OV NE W,"I am replying to the statement made by the Minister, which was, no doubt, prepared by the departmental officer. I ask that my charges be inquired into, in order to see whether they are true or otherwise. The Minister said that they were untrue, and it is for him to prove it.",64
291,Mr NAIRN,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OV NE W,"Perth) [10.41] - It has been suggested by the honourable member for South Sydney (Mr E. Riley) that the Commonwealth Government should provide funds for the succour of those who have had their money locked up in the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales. I think that we all have sympathy with the plight of Mr Lang's victims, but they are not properly the care of the Commonwealth Government. Mr E. RILEY - Ye t they are citizens of the Commonwealth.",64
292,Mr NAIRN,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OV NE W,"Yes ; but the effect of the honourable member's proposal would be to transfer liability for the acts of the New South Wales Government from the people of New South Wales to the people of the Commonwealth. The Government Savings Bank of New South Wales is purely a State institution, and the difficulty should be remedied by the State authorities. The people of the rest of the CommonAvealth should not have any more burdens foisted on them because of the troubles of New South Wale3. If the Government of that State can give securities, and submits a business proposition, it can be considered, but it is a matter for the CommonAvealth Bank Board, and not for this House. Some time ago a proposal was made for the amendment of the Standing Orders to prevent repetition of the practice which has become common of tAvo or three honourable members of the House holdingup the business of this chamber by uselessly calling for divisions. The proposal Avas set aside on that occasion in the hope that the Avaming given Would be all that Avas required to meet the situation; but UOAV the practice has"" been resumed in a worse form than before. I noticed that the Votes and Proceedings of the last all-night sitting comprised over twenty pages of printed matter, and consisted for the most part of division lists, in A\'hich from 40 to 50 members voted on one side and only three or four names were recorded on the other. I protest against the time of the House being wasted and unnecessary printing being caused by a few members insisting on calling for divisions AA'hen they are in a hopeless minority. I urge the Government to consider amending the Standing Orders so that an honourable member may not insist on a division being taken unless five other members support him.",64
293,Mr HOLLOWAY,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OV NE W,"Flinders) .[10.46]. - I desire to bring forAvard two matters which may seem unimportant, but which are of considerable moment to the groups of people directly concerned. From the shores of the Morningtou Peninsula, and, in fact, all along the coast of Victoria, fishermen have sent representatives to me complaining of the increased cost of one of their principal tools of trade. I desire the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Forde) to inquire into the matter, and see if he can help these struggling fishermen, because it seems to me that exploitation is taking place. A price list dated September, 1930, showed that a type of net in common use-it is of 1^-in. mesh, 60 yards long and 400 meshes deep-wa s obtainable at £6 12s. 6d.; but in February of this year the same net was priced at £8 6s. The arguments used by the sellers of these nets is that primage duty, sales tax and exchange are responsible for the increase; but, so far as I can gather, the primage duty and the, sales tax cannot be said to be the cause of the increase, though some of it may be due to the high exchange rate. Will the Minister make an investigation into the matter?",64
294,Mr SCULLIN,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OV NE W,Do these nets carry any duty?,65
295,Mr HOLLOWAY,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OV NE W,"Not a great, deal.",65
296,Mr GABB,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OV NE W,There must be primage duty.,65
297,Mr HOLLOWAY,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OV NE W,"When the price lists were published the primage duty did not affect the cost. Owing to the depression, the fishermen are not selling so much fish as previously, and the price of their commodity has fallen. This is a serious matter to thousands of families, and an inquiry into the matter would do i:o harm. If the granting of duties is lo result in reduced wages and increased prices, my advocacy of the protectionist policy will be weakened. Since costs have fallen both in Australia and in Scotland, the tendency ought to be in the direction of lower prices. Throughout Australia there are many postmasters who arc classified as allowance postmasters. Although they have bad their salaries reduced, I make no complaint in that connection, because there has been no discrimination; but I do complain that they are paid only Is. an hour- a sweating rate-for any duties they perform between the hours of 0 p.m. and 8 p.m., and that they receive no holidays at all on pay. When they take a holiday they have to pay some one to relieve them. There may be reasons for the department's action, although it appears to me to be a case of sweating in the Public Service. I hope that the Minister will investigate this matter.",65
298,Mr FORDE,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OV NE W,"Capricornia-Minister for Trade and Customs) [10.51] - Refer ence has been made to the alleged duty on fishing nets and other nets from Scotland. The increased price of these goods cannot be attributed to any protective tariff, because the fishing nets used by fishermen in the Flinders electorate are free of duty.",65
299,Mr WHITE,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OV NE W,They bear a primage duty.,65
300,Mr FORDE,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OV NE W,"It is true that they are subject to a primage duty; but that duty would not make much difference to their price. The increased cost is due chiefly to the exchange rates, - which have increased considerably of late.",65
301,Mr GABB,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OV NE W,Are not fishing nets made in Australia from imported material?,65
302,Mr FORDE,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OV NE W,"No . They are imported from Scotland, and come in free of duty. This is one of many instances in which the tariff is blamed for increased prices, altliough in many such cases the articles in respect of which complaint is made are free of duty.",65
303,Mr BLAKELEY,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OV NE W,"Darling-Minister for Home Affairs) [10.54] - The honourable member for West Sydney (Mr. Beasley) has read a long statement which obviously came from the same source as another statement which he did not read, but which occupied twelve pages of Hansard some weeks ago. The political and personal vendetta against certain officers of my department, of which the honourable member has allowed himself to be the vehicle, has been going on for some years in Canberra. 1 regret that the honourable member has allowed himself to be used in this way. I shall not take up space in. Hansard by replying to the statement which he read. During the period that the honourable member was a member of the Cabinet, he was my colleague for several months, and heard frequently of the hog farm; but, being then a member of the Government, he took no action, nor did he make any inquiry regarding the treatment meted out to Mr Coles. I have had this matter in mind constantly. The persons responsible for this vendetta do not care what vehicle they use, or by what means they achieve their ends, so long as they can liosiriircli the character's of officers who are unable ito defend themselves in this House. On a previous occasion when this matter was referred to, I said that I had made n personal investigation. I was compelled to do so because, during the past, two years, probably twenty attacks of n, similar nature have been made. My personal investigation enables me to know what is true and what is not true in the allegations made. I can assure the honourable member that the statement that ho has read is far from the truth ; gross distortion of facts. The reasons for this vendetta have nothing whatever to do with the hog far m ; but, in order to injure some of my officers, the hog farm is used as a vehicle, even as the honourable member himself is being used, J have no doubt that the statement which the honourable member has read to-night is already in type for publication in the local press. I shall answer the statement, but not in Hansard. I shall send a letter to the honourable member, and also forward a copy of it to the local newspaper, and I have no doubt that it , also, will be published.",65
304,Mr WHITE,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OV NE W,"Balaclava) [10.57] 1 should not have spoken bad it not been for the remarks of the honourable member for Perth (Mr N a i r n ) . I-heartily support the proposal to eliminate useless divisions. I agree that, where only two or three members want a division, it should be sufficient if the heads arc counted. But the honourable member for Perth referred to a recent all-night sitting. Obviously he obtained his information from the Votes and Proceedings of' this House. Had he been here on the occasions referred to, he would have participated in many divisions; but, like many others who ought to have been present, he was uot in attendance. During the all-night sitting referred to, many injustices were done in connection with the tariff. The Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Forde) put through that iniquitous tax on cotton wool used in hospitals.",66
305,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OV NE W,Hon. Norman M a k in ). - Order II cannot allow that expression; the honourable member must withdraw it.,66
306,Mr WHITE,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OV NE W,"May I substitute the word ""scandalous""?",66
307,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OV NE W,That word ulso would be out of order.,66
308,Mr WHITE,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OV NE W,"Then I withdraw my statement, and say that, during the all night sitting last week, the Labour party made its contribution to hospital week by passing a duty ou cotton wool, which is largely used in hospitals. Honourable members who had previously opposed the duty withdrew their opposition, because of an assurance that the price would not be raised. I say that the protest by the it is a honourable member for Flinders (Mr . Holloway) regarding the tariff is somewhat belated as there were at least 100 items concerning which a similar complaint could be made.",66
309,Mr FORDE,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OV NE W,The article complained' of by the honourable member for FlinderB is free of duty.,66
310,Mr WHITE,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OV NE W,"The most flagrant case of injustice was that in which the Minister insisted upon increasing the duty on glass lamp chimneys merely because he had bscn informed that a certain Continental firm was likely to establish a factory in Britain . It is a great pity that Gilbert died so soon, as otherwise lie could have shown the world, in his whimsical way, how tariffs ore made in Australia.",66
311,Mr JAMES,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OV NE W,"Hunter) [11.0] - Agai n I bring before the Government the matter of granting assistance to depositors in the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales, particularly to those who are aged. On a previous occasion the Treasurer intimated that if I could state specific cases he would be prepared to deal with them. I have presented some such cases to the honourable gentleman, one of which concerns an aged couple of about 69 years of age. The amount of their deposit in the bank is £900. They undertake that, if the Commonwealth Government will grant them a pension to enable them to exist they will repay the amount advanced by this Government when the State Savings Bank makes their money available. The Treasurer has not replied to my letter on the subject. I admit that he is a very busy man. He has been particularly engrossed lately coining attractive phrases about "" low-browed, leather-lunged"" individuals, and so on. I think, with the honourable member for South Sydney (Mr E. Riley), that the Eederal Goverxuuent should grant some assistance to the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales. It is well known that that institution was subjected to systematic political propaganda on the part of enemies of the Labour party, designed deliberately to destroy the political existence of Mr Lang. The attacks of the ex-Premier and the ex-State Treasurer of New South Wales, also of the Federal Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Latham) were especially virulent. Following an irresponsible statement by the last-named gentleman a rush was caused on the bank which resulted in £3,000,000 being withdrawn from it the following day. Eventually the bank had to close its doors. However, the New South Wales State Government possesses Commonwealth bonds to the value of £30,000,000. Surely that is sufficient security to warrant this Government stepping in and assisting suffering depositors who have their life's savings locked up in the bank. I plead with the Government to do something, and in the meantime to grant pensions to aged depositors who undertake to repay the amount they receive v/hen the bank resumes payment. .It cannot again be said that any people are suffering more from the depression than those in my electorate. The Prime so. Minister has been through it, and he must be aware of the conditions that exist. The mine at Minmi closed down seven years ago, that at Redhead five years ago, while those at South AberdaTe and Stanford Merthyr ceased operations four years ago. On top of other troubles there were sixteeu months' lockout.",66
312,Mr NAIBN,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OV NE W,The men would not work. Starvation will do them good. They destroyed their own trade.,67
313,Mr JAMES,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OV NE W,"The honourable member does not know what work is and would not work if it were given to him. His statements are unbalanced aud irresponsible. I appeal to the Federal Government to grant some assistance to the unfortunate people in my electorate. Ou many occasions the Minister for Defence has been liberal in this respect. Probably he can go no further, and I , therefore, address my appeal direct to the Prima Minister. Tliese people particularly need boots. In many cases in my electorate these unfortunate people have to go barefooted. There are considerable-stocks of boots in both our military and naval stores, which could be put to good use if distributed to the unemployed. I appeal to the Prime Minister to use these surplus stores and perform a humane service that would be worthy of any government.",67
314,Mr SCUILIN,GOVERNMENT SAVINGS BANK OV NE W,"Yarra-Prime Minister) [11.7] - The honourable member for South Sydney (Mr E. Riley) has raised a very important question to which the Government has paid considerable attention, the suspension of the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales. I do not agree that the matter must be confin ad entirely to one State. It affects the whole of the Commonwealth of Australia. Admittedly the bank was guaranteed by the State Government of New South Wales, and it is primarily the responsibility of the Government of that State, but whatever the Commonwealth can do to relieve the position should be done. There is DO power in the bunds of the Commonwealth Government to deal with the matter directly, but representations can be made to the Commonwealth Bank. However, it is not fair that I should,make a statement on so important a subject St this late hour. I shall address myself to it again, .in the course of a day or Question resolved in the affirmative. House, adjourned at J1.9 p.m.",67
