2,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,WORLD HERITAGE AREA," The Wet Tropics of Queensland' World Heritage Area Conservation Bill has some potential traps. It was mentioned yesterday that the boundaries of the wetlands were probably drawn too extravagantly. I notice that about 26 per cent of the land encompassed within the 900,000 hectares is basically forest reserve, effective Itiasehold and free,hold land. ' One of the complications within this wetland area is that operators want to start the Kuranda sky rail; ,a tourist activity which will take people from Cairns on the coast into Kuranda to witness some of the beauties of the area. This has been under some dispute. It emphasises the difficulties that charter operators face, on behalf of tourists, when operating within the wetlands. I understand that if an operator wants to start a business it can take up to 60 permits to move in and out of these a.reas. If one takes into account the"" potential implications of the Mabo legislation and the additional permits that might be required, one wonders whether tourists will witness these wetlands as they would like. Under this billthe same applied to the act that set up the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authoritythere is a system for bureaucrats to, make definitions and provide guidelines for the use of these areas. Charter operators have been asked to pay an operational fee of $1 per trip for every individual going into 'the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. I hope there is no suggestion that this 'would apply eventually to the wetlands as this would be of further detriment to those operators. The recent fee for access to the GBRMP was agreed to by both the state and federal governments. The access fee cannot stay at $1. There is no way after administration costs that the $1 fee can be used for the advancement of the p-rk. The fee is a burden on the operators who have to pay it. In the meantime, private individuals wanting to use the reef or the, - slands can do so with impunity. I .speak about the bureaucratisation of the acts with some authority. It is brought to my attention all the time how these guidelines bear on operators in the area. A group of water sports operators in the Great' Barrier Reef Marine Park operating from Hamilton Island have been trying to negotiate a continuation of their operations away from their main base when the main base is under some climatic threat, such as strong winds. For years they have used· an adjoining island and beach to do just that It is just one of their alternatives. They have now been prevented from using, .that outlet Many, commercial operators have been refused entry to Whitehaven beach for their operations, yet private operators can waterski or do anything on these beaches. The department o.f environment and heritage, ,with which they have been trying to. make arrangements, has unlimited po.wer to. enter into. discussio.ns to. try to. find a way through this type o.f problem, but at the end o.f the discussio.nsit hands out a pre-made pro.hibitio.n o.rder that sto.ps o.perato.rs o.peratthe ing in an area o.f having access to it. The real threat here is that the bureaucrats do. no.t have a definite reaso.n fo.r do.ing this. The impressio.n these people get fro.m their ivo.ry to.wers in To.wnsville, Brisbane and elsewhere is that if co.mmercial o.peratio.ns in these areas are sto.pped, yet the areas are still' available to. privateo.perato.rs, in so.memagical way it will bring back the natural life o.f the areas. That is hypo.thetical. There have been environmental prqblems in the past. ' It IS no.t co.rrect to. have this po.wer of prohibition in the hands of bureaucrats. There must be some way these things can be appealed. I ho.pe that eventually we do. no.t see o.ur wet tropics no.t being used because o.f the pro.hibitive cost o.f entry. The user-pays principle has to be very carefully Io.oked at. If it is used to any great extent it will be a deterrent to. people go.ing into. the areas. The revenue gained will be eaten"" up by bureaucrats in ildministrationcosts, which is where most of the $70 million has gone in the past. , '",11
3,Mr LINDSAY,WORLD HERITAGE AREA,"Herbert-:-Parliamentary Secretary to. the Minister fo.r Industry, Techno.logy and Regional Develo.pment) (9.38 a.m.)-When I first read the Wet Tropics of Queensland World Heritage Area ,Conservatio.n Bill I the.ught it was a no.n-controversial piece of legislation and that it wo.uld be supported who.leheartedly by the opposition as being consistent with the desire by the overwhelming majority of Australians to ensure that there is an adequate legislative framework fo.r the management of the wet tropic rainforests o.f North Queensland. I came into the chamber yesterday afternoo.n and listened to. a number o.f speakers o.n the bill. I was' absolutely amazed at the content of some of the statements made by opposition speakers. I thought the bill was fairlyinriocuous. Indeed, the general outline of the bill, as contained in the explanato.ry memo.randum,' states: The purpose of th\sBiIl is to. bring into. effect pennanent management arrangements, which are set out in the Agreement made between the CDmmDnwealth and Queensland on 16 NDvember 1990, and are incDrpDrated into. the Wet Tropics WDrid Heritage PrDtectiDn and Management Act 1993 (Qld) as Schedule l. The arrangements implement CDmmDnwealth 1s internatiDnal DbligatiDns fDr the protectiDn of the Wet TrDpics of Queensland WDrid Heritage PrDperty under the CDnventiDn fDr the PrDtectiDnDf theWDrid Cultural and Natural Heritage (the WDrld'Heritage CDnventiDn). This is precisely what the bill do.es-no.thing mo.re, nothing less. The bill provides, in clause 8, for Abo.riginal representatio.n o.n the adviso.ry co.mmittee, and I will say so.mething about that later o.n in my remarks. I am one o.f the few members of this House who come from the wet tro.pic rainforests o.f North Queensland. In fact' I was born in Tully, right beside the wet tropic rainfo.rest. I know the wet tropic rainforest quite intimately. As a yo.uth I went hunting through the rainfo.rests and I have had a lot to de with them over many years. I am very much aware of the eno.rmo.us value o.f those wet tropic rainfo.rests to this country and indeed to. all mankind. So. it was with as to.nishment that I heard the remarks made' by some members of the opposition yesterday. I would like to correct some of those, mistaken impressions they seem to hold with respect to wet tropic rainfo.rests and this legislatio.n. The shado.w minister fo.r the' enviro.nment, the hono.urable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), complained abo.ut the Co.mmo.nwealth invo.lvement in stopping pasto.ralist activities at Willandra. She is wro.ng. The Commo.nwealth government has no.t made any decisions o.n pasto.ralist activities at ,Willandra. She, also complained about Lord Ho.we ,Island's sewage problem, and that matter is being addressed by, the Commonwealth government. The Prime Minister (Mf Keating) has announced pro.posed investigatio.ns of the world heritage values of the Lake Eyreregio.n in South Australia, and arrangements are being made fo.r an assessment of the wo.rld heritage values o.f that regio.n. !tis better that we get it right now than rush this assessment and the necessary committed legislation through. , The'honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) became involved in, a diatribe. He showed a total misunderstanding of the world heritage values of Shark Bay. Dolphins were not the major issue for the world heritage listing of this area; the main values of Shark Bay are the marine environment, including the hypersaline hamelin pool; the offshore islands of Bernier and Dorre, which'are home to, five of Australia's 26 species of endangered mammals; the massive seagrass beds, the largest on earth; and the stromatolites, which the honourable member for O'Connor called strogmolitesperhaps this marks him' as a person who has difficulty getting his tongue around some of these polysyllables. Mr Braithwaite-What about trogs?",12
4,Mr LINDSAY,WORLD HERITAGE AREA,"The honourable member is well qualified to make comments on that. He should not say things like that. Stromatolites represent the oldest life form on being representative of some 3,500 million years. They are a very important part of our heritage. The honourable membedor O'Connor also claimed that miners were going to the world heritage commission to check their rights. It is a committee, not a commission, and no impediments to actions by Australians can be brought by the World Heritage Committee-none at all. , The honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) claimed that the wet tropic- were already protected because they were a national park. That is wrong. Much of the area is state forest, which' the previous Queensland government wanted to log. It was world heritage listing and the Commonwealth Labor government'sdetermination to ensure logging of these ecologically significant rainforests ceased that saved the wet tropics. - The honourable member for Wide Bay also claimed that world heritage listing locks up areas. This is also wrong. There has been a dramatic increase in tourist numbers to the wet tropics and other world heritage areas since the world heritage listing. Indeed, the wet tropics have become a major tourist attraction in themselves. For example, whitewater rafting down the Tully River in the wet tropic rainforest has become a huge business. It is very popular with overseas tourists. I will be saying something about that in relation to the Tully-Millstream hydro-electric scheme later on. The world heritage area of these wet tropic rainforests is a massive reservoir of tourist potential for Australia. It should not be underestimated. The honourable member for Wide Bay also stated that with the appointment of an Aboriginal person to the Wet Tropics Management AuthOrity board the Commonwealth would need to kick off either Dr Keto or Mr Donaghy. That is not so. I will explain that later on in my remarks; This governmenti!; receiving very' strong support from the state government. As I said earlier, this, bill has been brought into complement the recent Queensland act. There is no problem whatsoever in accommodating an Aboriginal person on the board and retaining the excellent services of Dr Keto and Mr Donaghy. l' am earth, curious that the opposition seems, to be always looking at ways to remove good people from these boards. The honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie) complained that the Commonwealth government has taken four years to introduce this legislation while the Queensland government only took three years. The Queensland legislation was passed in December 1993. This legislation, as it is complementary to the Queensland legislation, needed to wait until the Queensland legislation had been passedagain, a misunderstanding of the truth of the matter. I return to the remarks ,made by the honourable member for Hindmarsh in her consideration of this important legislation. She said: . I object very deeply to tokenism. I think to write into this legislation that an Aborigine be put on to that authority simply on the basis that he or she. is an Aborigine is demeaning to all indigenous people. I have never in my life heard such a stupid statement as that. Aboriginal people have been clamouring to have a say in the management of the wet tropic rainforest. As people who have inhabited that area literally for thousands of years, it is right and proper that they do have some representation on that board-one Aboriginal member out of five persons. She went on to say in her speech: .. : 36 per cent of the people surVeyed believe that there had been a negative effect on the local economy; in the tablelands 54 per cent believe that there had been a negative effect on the local economy., Certainly, there were pockets of industries that weready-rsely affected by the declaration, but the Commonwealth government literally poured a fortune into programs to assist these prople. Just north orrily electorate at II).gham, huge sums of money were put into assist the people who were adversely affected by the declaration, including the Hinchinbrook Shire Council, as I understand. In response, to the comment made by the honourable member for Hindmarsh that 36 per cent of the people surveyed believe that thel""e had been a negative effect on the local economy, at present, in my experience in that area, there has been a nil' effect on the local economy. The honourable member for Hindmarsh went on to say: This is a condemnation bfthe government; not because it is a world heritage area-IbeFeve that is important and essential for Australia-but because, with the removal of the logging and in declaring it a world heritage area, the government did not live up to its commitment to the people of Ravenshoe and other areas to provide jobs, which was a pr<)mise that it made.. I was very much involved in that area·at that time in 1988; as was the honourable 'member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite). A lot of and a lot of money were· put into this area try to assist these people. It is a'pity that,with the passage of time, people get up in this chamber and make all sorts of allegations which, frankly, do not fit the facts: I tum some: of the comments made by the honourments, abfeinember for Cook, a man for whom: have much respect. He said: I, too, am one of the people who believe that borders of the wet tropics land were drawn far ,broadly and widelyand:contain areas tl;latshould not be. part of the world wet tropics a-ea. Frankly, I do not know what he is 'talking about. I am one of the few people who have flown over: the remains' of the 'wet ,tropics rainforests af'North Queensland in an FAI8. When one is up over 35,000 feet and looks board. down on the Pacific Ocean to the left and the wide open plains to the right"" one sees that there is very ,little wet tropics rainforest left. It was a profound decision by this government to introduce the legislation in pursuance of the declaration of the wet tropics of Queensland as a world heritage area. Again, we have remarks by the honourable member for Cook on, these issues. My good friend the honourable member for Dawson, who has made a contribution to this debate, said yesterday: Igo on record with others to say that there wasan ,excess extravagance by those who drew up the bOundaries which affected, and is stiIl affecting, the livelihood of many people in that area. ' The honourable member for Dawson, whom I also respect, knows much better than that. That is not an accurate statement of the true situation. He knows as well as I do""-I know that he supports the preservation of wet tropics rainforest-that the boundaries were quite conservatively drawn'. There might have been some areas that do not appear the same I ' as a tropical jungle such as is seen in Tully, Daintree, Babinda or such places. But 1 would submit that the boundaries were judiciously drawn with respect to the area. Some of the comments made by opposition speakers, however well meaning they are, need to be corrected for the;record. Let me speak again about the board, about which a number of people, including the work honourable member for Wide Bay and the to honourable member for' Fisher (Mr Slipper), made some' comments. Professor Ken Wiltshire is the chairman. It is a joint appointment of five people. Dr Aila Keto, a conservationto ist, is one of the Commonwealth appointas is Mr Geoff Donaghy, who is in'I 'volved in tourism ih theCaims area; The Queensland goverrimenthas Mr Tom Pyne, the chairman ·of the Mulgrave Shire Council, 'and too one other representative. This bill provides for five elected members of the board plus an executive .director of the authority. As I said, the Commonwealth government is working cooperatively. with the Queensland 'government' on management of the wet '. tropics, including the appointment of members to the There is no problem appointing an Aboriginal person, as I said previously. Dr Keto and Mr Donaghy, I understand, wish to remain members of the board, so it is not necessary or desirable that either one of them should be asked to resign. Indeed, I would hope that they would continue to serve on the board. I understand that Professor Wiltshire has advised that he wishes to step down from the board. He has provided. excellent leadership in the development of the board and the discharge of its responsibilities. I record the gratitude of the Commonwealth government to Professor Wiltshire for his contribution. It saddens me to say that it would appear that there is a lot· of hypocrisy in some of these statements made by opposition speakers. They either support the bill or they do not. They claim.to support this bill, and yet we had two or three hours of unwarranted criticism on it yesterday afternoon. Mr Katter-Well, come on! You took a thousand jobs away from North Queensland. Be honest about it. Have a bit of integrity.",13
5,Mr LINDSAY,WORLD HERITAGE AREA,"The honourable member for Kennedy has as much knqwledge about wet tropics rainforests as he has· about Antarcdebate. tica-no idea whatsoever. Mr Katter-I will match mine against yours any day, any place, anywhere.",15
6,Mr LINDSAY,WORLD HERITAGE AREA,Again the man shows his ignorance of the issues before the House.,15
7,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,WORLD HERITAGE AREA,"Order! The parliamentary secretary will ignore the interjections. . .,",15
8,Mr LINDSAY,WORLD HERITAGE AREA,"Before I close, I just want to mention one major Commonwealth initiative: the Cooperative Research Centre for Tropical Rainforest Ecology and Management has now been established in Queensland to boost research of Australia's tropical rainforests. The centre will receive Commonwealth funding of $13 million over seven years on programs of research, education and the management of wet tropics. This. is a major initiative by the Commonwealth gov-:ernment to ensure the management of the wet tropics rainforests and that adequate research is carried out in this area. This is in contrast to the absolutely stupid antics of members of the previous Queensland government who did all they could to oppose the declaration of world heritage listing for the wet tropics rainforests. In fact, one of the former colleagues of the honourable member for Kennedy spent taxpayers.' money on a jaunt to South America to oppose the listing of this important area of Australia. It was an absolute scandalous waste of taxpayers' moneys. I am sure that he could not have gone there without the active support of the honourable member for Kennedy. That failure by the honourable member for Kennedy will trail him for the rest of his political career. I commend the bill to the House. Mr Katter- Mr Acting Speaker, I raise a point of order. The statement just made by the parliamentary secretary referring tome was offensive in the extreme. I ask him to withdraw those remarks.",15
9,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,WORLD HERITAGE AREA,"Order! Ido not believe that there was anything unparlia-:mentary in what was said. I understand that the honourable member for Kennedy has some difficulty in that this is the end of the But, if he wishes to make a form of personal explanation at the appropriate stage, that would be appr()priate. Mr Lindsay- Mr Acting Speaker, if the honourable member for Kerinedy is so silken skinned that he finds some of my comments rub him up the wrong way, in the interests of harmony I will withdraw them. Mr Katter-Me Acting Speaker, I raise a point of order. I am sorry to waste the time of the House and be overly pedantic; but the parliamentary secretary's apology was also offensive to me and I ask 'him to withdraw that as well.",15
10,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,WORLD HERITAGE AREA,"Order! If the parliamentary secretary is going to withdraw, it would suit· the House if he just simply withdraws. MrLindsay-I withdraw. Question resolved in the affirmative. ; Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by MrLindsay) read a third time. NA AGENCY AMENDMENT BILL 1993 Second Reading Debate resumed from 10 February, on motion by Mrs Crosio: That the bill be now read a second time.",15
11,Mr RONALDSON,AUSTRALIAN SPORTS DRUG," It gives me a great deal of pleasure to discuss the Australian Sports Drug Agency Amendment Bill 1993. I will briefly go through some ·of the summary items in this bill, which I might say at the outset has the full concurrence of the opposition. This bill was introduced into the Senate on 16 December 1993 and comes under the portfolio of the environment', sport and territories; The purpose of this bill is to amend the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act 1990, otherwise known as the ASDA Act, to allow for competitors tested under state or territory legislaThe tion to have'equal rights of review as if they were tested under the ASDA Act. The background both to this bill and to the ASDA itself is that in May 1988 the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts received a reference from the Senate to inquire into the use by Australian athletes of performance enhancing drugs. The committee presented an interim report in May 1988, known as the drugs in sport interim report, 'which dealt with the use of drugs in Australian sport. A second report was tabled in May 1990, which covered the regulatory background of drugs in sport. The committee recommended amongst other things that an independent commission be set up to carry out all sports drug testing in Australia, including other functions such as research, investigations, liaison with law enforcement agencies and responsibility for sports drug policies. There were three other parts, including that the commission report results of testing to appropriate sporting bodies; that the commission establish and publish a register of all tests done by it in each year; and that, in order to receive state or federal funding, sporting organisations be required to .impose uniform penalties on athletes returning positive drug tests. In November 1988 the Australian Sports Drug Agency, ASDA, was established in response to the committee recommendations and operated as a preventative organisation providing independent drug testing and carrying' out broad education programs. As part of the response to the committee's recommendations, the committee sought to give legislative backing to ASDA, which induded a legally and financially ,independent basisfor the body, and to allow ASDA to continue testing and to report to the Australian Sports Commission. ASDA was given legislative backing by the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act 1990. Section 9 of the act outlines the functions of the ASDA, which include testing, the,maintenance of a register of defaulting ,athletes,' and the implementation and development of education programs. Section 8 of the act states: pbjects of the establishment of the Agency are: (a) to encourage the practice of sport free from the use of drugs, in a manner consistent with the objectives of protecting: (i) the health of competitors; and (ii) the values of fair play and competition;,and ' (iii) the rights of thos- who take part in sport; and ., (b) to encourage the development of programs to educate the sporting community . and the community at large about the dangers of using drugs in sport; and (c) to provide leadership in the development of a national strategy concerning drugs in sport; and (d) to encourage the establishment of a centralised drug sampling and testing program that exposes' all competitors to sampling and drug testing, at short notice, at sporting events, during training and at , any other time; and (e) to encourage State and Territory governments, and national, State and Territory sporting organisations, to adopt uniform drug sampling and testing procedures; and (:0 ,to encourage the development and main; tenance of drug testing laboratories ac, credited by the International OlympiC "" Committee; and . (g) tO,promote and encourage the adoption, at an international level, of uniform sampling arid drug testing procedures, and of educational programs relating to the .. use of drugs in sport. In the 1992-93 annual report of the ASDA, the agency stated it had four main aims: first, to reduce the harm associated with drugs in sport; second, to facilitate informed decision making about the use of drugs; third, to defer the use of drugs or the carrying out of prohibited practices; and, fourth, to advocate a just and equitable response tei the issue of drugs in sport. These aims and the means' of their achievement are .more fully explained in the strategic plan for 1992-93 put forward by the agency. The 1994 Australian Sports Drug Agency operational plan says: Sport is about participation, performance; competition and achievement. Above all, it is about building character and improving the health and well-being. of the nation. Drugs to enhance physical performance undermine the essential values of all that sport is about. The Australian Sports Drugs Agency is committed to reduc,ing the harm associated with drug use in sport in' order. to, enhance weI! being of ,ndividuals and the value of sport to SOCIety. ' , I turn to the main provisions of the bill itself. At present, the ASDA Act allows for testing by ASDA of athletes competing at a national level and, where the states and territories confer-power on ASDA under section 9A of the act, the testing of state and territory athletes also. Consistent 'with the perceived need for a uniform approach aCross the states and territories to the issue of drug testing in sport, this bill seeks to allow the states to confer jurisdiction on the Commonwealth Administrative Appeals Tribunal or the Fed-ral Court to review decisions regarding testlOg, by ASDA under .state or territory legislation. Clause 3 amends section 9A of the ASDA Act by providing that a state ,or territory can confer jurisdiction, a power or functipn on the Federal Court, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or any member or officer of those bodies. Clause 4 amends section 11 of the ASDA Act by allowing a state or territory to record or delete information in the agency's register, where that state 'or territory has conferred power on the agency under section 9A(I) of the ASDA Act. Australia has a very proud history in relation to the question of dnig testing. I would like to pay great tribute to the government for its move in relation to drugs in sport. Government members do deserve credit and, as honourable members know, I always give credit where credit is due.",16
12,Mr KERR,AUSTRALIAN SPORTS DRUG,You are very fair.,17
13,Mr RONALDSON,AUSTRALIAN SPORTS DRUG,Thank you very much. The Minister for Justice has paid me a great compliment.,17
14,Mr KERR,AUSTRALIAN SPORTS DRUG,"I say it only ,because it is true.",17
15,Mr RONALDSON,AUSTRALIAN SPORTS DRUG,"Thank you. I think it is fair to say, though, that we cannot afford to reston ourlaurels in relation to this question. We only have to look at recent events in relation to the Chinese swimming athletes to know that, at an international level, we have a long way to go. Recent comments by the Australian head swimming coach, Don Talbot, about the random drug testing in Chinese the swimming, following an announcement that the world record holder Zhong Weiyue had been banned for two years after a positive competition test, are further testimony of the fact that drug use right throughout the world and, unfortunately, in Australia is still going on. The comments of Susie ONEILL the world short course lOO"":metre butterfly - hampion, again seek to underscore the great problem. To Susie's great credit she was quoted as saying: . Ldon't know who is or who isn't taking drugs but just because someone is taking them, doesn't mean they are going to beat you. She then went on to say-and I think this is terrific: ' ' Particularly in the 200m 'fly, I still thi-k J am ' capable of beating anyone.' . ' I think that Susie O'NeilI is quite capable of beating anyone anywhere whether they are laden up with drugs or not, which she most certainly is. not. She - s a young lady whom we should be very proud of. ' , Mr Cobb...,...She is a great sportsperson.",17
16,Mr RONALDSON,AUSTRALIAN SPORTS DRUG,"She is a great sportsperson and a great ambassador for Australia. The question of steroid use is obviously a matter of great concern to the agency. Under the very capable stewardship of Mr Steve Haynes, ASDA has now gained great recognition not only in Australia but throughout the world. It is my understanding that a number of agencies regularly visit Australia to see how we do it. I think we can all be very proud of that. I therefore found it quite extraordinary that last year there was a further Cl;lll for anabolic steroids to be freely available for recreational use. At the time. I said that I thought it was extraordinary and grossly irresponsible for any discussions along those lines to take place. I was pleased at the time that the now minister for sport, Senator Richardson-I think he is the now minister for sport, although Senator Faulkner might take issue at that-and I shared a very similar view that any freeing up of the availability of anabolic steroids would be to the very great detriment of those people operating in gyms throughout Australia and would set back the anti-drug cause in this country a long way. The fact is that we' are receiving international accolades, as I said in my press release at the time, for our very tough stand against drug use in sport. I hasten to add that I am proud of the coalition's involvement in the Senate inquiry into the question of drugs in sport and of our absolutely bipartisan approach to the whole question. I am sure that is freely acknowledged on both sides of the political fence. Not orily are we leading the world in relation to the hands-on drug testing; we are also leading the world in relation to research. I think we can be extremely proud of that situation. It is inexcusable for there to sion about the freeing up of the use of anabolic steroids for recreational use. We are condemning many Australians to serious health risks if we do so. In this press release I also raised the question of what the Australian Medical Association should do in relation to this matt6r. I called on the association to take a very strong stand against members who prescribed steroids for .recreational purposes, because doctors should play a lead role in stamping' out the use of steroids. The April 1992 edition, volume 53, No. 40f a magazine called Muscle and Fitness contained an article about a new gym drug affectionat-ly-or not so affectionately"":""'known as clenbuterol. Part of this article written by Bob' Lefavi states: A few years ago, I conferred with Tom Deters, DC, associate publisher and editor-in-chief of Muscle & Fitness, about writing an article on clenbuterol and other beta agonists. At that time, these drugs were not well known in bodybujlding circles and Dr Deters felt that we would inadvertently draw attention to ,the substances. The idea being that bodybuilders would then begin actively looking for beta, agonists. Tom was right,and of course it, was the socially, responsible thing to do at the time . ' , But since then, more and more bodybuilders and other athletes have gotten hold of what they believe are beta agonists (some perhaps, actually getting the real thing on the European black market). So much so that not only has the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently put US. Customs officials on alert for clenbuterol trafficking, but even my office is being flooded with calls from bodybuilders wanting to know about beta agonists. Well- ' this is the important partsomeorie's got to let bodybuilders know what this stuff is all about. Many athletes are now looking for beta agonists. It's a dangerous situation that We must address- It's now time for us to speak up. The next part of the article reads: As if this steroid scene weren't bad enough. Now a new group of drugs is primed and ready to endanger both the integrity of bodybuilding and the lives of those who foolishly look for shortcuts to success in muscledom. These new drugs, beta 2 agonists (more often just termed beta agonists), of which the most common is cleributerol, could well make steroids, look benign and tnaycome' to epitomize death in a,bottle. If you haveri't heard of beta agonists before, don't stop reading here.:.c.. ' anyone who frequents a gym' is sure to hear about be any discus- them sooner or later. The article said that ,these drugs are killers. These drugs are one of the many examples of drugs that people are trying to bring into bodybuilding and gym circles throughout the country as recreational drugs: Let us look at some of the side effects of the drugs dealt with in the magazine article. The minor side effects include heart palpitations, heart rate increase, severe headaches, nosebleeds, dizziness . nausea and vomiting, alternating fever and'chHls, muscle aches and pains, extreme irritability, nerVousness and a dramatic increase in sensitivity to stress. The major side effects include. fatalities'· from myocardial infarctions-heart attacks, strokes, violent muscle tremors, and severe haemorrhaging andtachycatdia-possibly doubling resting heart rate and cancerous tuinours. These are the drugs that some people in this country want· to encourage. These are the drugs that people are' trying to use- as this article said, as a shortcut to muscledom. The oppositipn' supports the Australian Sports Drug Agency Amendment Bill. Subject to what the act says, I would be very s-r­ prised if we were to ever reach a' situation where the coalition was not prepared to support initiatives in this regard. 1 suppose, som.e respect-, those could come back to haunt us. But I would be reasonably confident, given the history of this matter and the .:very sensible approach, · Mr KERR --'-A rare thing in opposition-a constructive shadow minister. Pleased to see it. ' Mr RONALDSON-I 'must owe the Minister forJusticesome money; he is being very nice to me today. To the extent that this legislation has had a very strong bipartisan approach, I give an undertaking to the House that it will continue. i reserve the opportunity to speak on this bill this mOrning.",18
17,Mrs SILVIA SMITH,AUSTRALIAN SPORTS DRUG,":-Ithankthe honQ:urable lIlember for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) for his very warm support. We must never lack in support for these types of amendments. I rise in support of the 1,\ustnilian. Sports Drug Agency Amendment Bill 1993., The provisions of this bill will amend the 'AustraJiap Sports Drug Agency Act 1993. Thes- provisions will enable athletes who have been tested under proposed complementary state and territory anti-doping legislation to have access to the same provisions of appeal as those that are available to those tested under the Australian: Sports Drug Agency Act. As the honourable member for Ballarat has already said, this country is at the forefront of the battle for dean competition and clean competitors. Australia has taken one of the strongest international stands against drugs in sport. Through the actions of this government and its legislation and the support of honourable members opposite, coupled with the Australian Sports Drug Agency and the Australian Sports Commission, athletes who cheat through the llse of drugs are caught and sanctioned. We will simply not allow the international reputation of Australian sport to be brought into disrepute. So effective has our drugs in sport sanction been that· the deterrent factor is incredibly high in our elite athletes. Few would even contemplate the risk of career disruption and sanction by taking performance enhancing drugs. The problem is that the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act provides for drug in tests only for national level competitors. State and territory legislation must be enacted in order for competitors below that level to be tested. I am extremely pleased to say that an assurance has been gained from the governments of all states and territories that not only is this legislation desirable but also they will seek to enact it. However, there must be a totally coordinated approach aimed at .achievinguniform anti-doping legislation in a national sense. To this end, extensive negotiations have taken place on the need for all states and territories to reduce anti-doping legislation, which mirrors the existing legislation of the Commonwealth. In July last year, the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act was amended to allow ASDA to test state and territory level one competitors under 'complementary anti-doping legislation. States and territories can now introduce that legislation. An article by Anne Davies from the Sydney Morning Herald of 4 February this year highlights the ability of the Australian Sports Drug Agency to do the job that it was set up for: Sports drug· tests snare 53. Rugby league players and weightlifters featured most prominently among the 53 athletes who either tested positive for drug use or refused to take drug tests during 1992-93. The results of the Government-sponsored drugtesting program are contained itl the Australian Sports Drug Agency's annual report, which was released yesterday. According to the report, there were 14 'defaults' recorded among rugby league players, whom the agency tests as part of its commercial contracts. Of these, 10 were found to be inadvertent positives resulting from use .of medication. while four involved restricted substances (mainly cannabis). In weightlifting. 10 of the 11 defaults stemmed from athletes refusing to take tests. The agency reported that it conducted 2,877 tests and, as in the previous year, focused on sports considered to have a high risk of drug-taking, such as cycling, athletics and weightlifting. The most heavily tested sport was cycling, which has been put under cJose scrutiny after the tional cyclist Martin Vinnicombe tested positive for drug use three years ago. More than 340 tests were performed on cyclists but only one international performer tested positive for a prohibited drug. Other heavily tested sports included athletics (336), rugby league (340), weight lifting (210) and swimming (168). The agency maintained its emphasis on out-ofcompetition testing, increasing the proportion of tests conducted outside the sporting season to 58 per cent. Despite the relatively low number of defaults. survey of athletes conducted by the agericy suggests it is achieving a deterrence rate of 83 per cent among int-rnational athletes. the report said. One of the major aspects of these amendments is to make sure that any legislation which the states adopt is consistent in the protection of the rights of competitors. The ASDA legislation makes sure that those competitors who have been selected to provide a sample have a right of appeal if they test positive or fail to proviqe the.sampk It is of paramount importance that all competitors have the same rights. of appeal and are treated equally. The amendments we are debating here today will allow states and territories to confer jurisdiction upon the federal· government or the Commonwealth Administrative Appeals Tribunal for athletes who test positive or who fail to provide a sample. The means that athletes at all levels of competition and from all states will be treated fairly and equally. It also means that there will be a uniform mechanism of appeal for all. The ACT, New South Wales and Victoria have already written th-ir own anti-doping legislation. These governments are simply waiting upon the passage of these amendments today to enhance their own .legislation. The Australian Sports Drug Agency is. an . organisation which has distinguished itself since its inception. It has caught those athletes who have used prohibited substances. Analgesics, narcotics, steroids. and diuretics have all been picked up by thy testing process. It is, however, pertinent in the context of this debate, as we· are expanding the number of athletes who will be tested, to issue the internachallenge to the ASDA to develop and use reliable tests for the new generation of performance enhancing drugs. We must always be aware that, as times change, drugschangand; therefore,we must change our testing abilities. . ... There are drugs becoming available to athletes which .are very dangerous to their health, as the honourable member for Ballarat has already indicated, and for which detection . is often difficult. The technology of testing it must move with the technology of the stimulants. We. simply cannot afford to rest on our good record. We must progress continually. It is for reasons. of progression that these amendments have been· introduced. The successful introduction of legislation by states and territories, which will complement federal legislation, will mean that maIlY more athletes will be tested. It will therefore become much more difficult for athletes who take drugs to escape detection. The enactment of this iegislation will mean that out. country will have one of the strongest anti-doping rules in the world. This can do nothing but increase our standing in the international sporting community. . .Australia will and must be regarded· as a clean sporting nation. With the Sydney Olympics just around the corner, the international sporting focus will be on Australia. That focus will scrutinise how we treat our own athletes. These amendments go some way towards showing the world that we are hard but fair. I commend these amendments to the House; Question resolved in the affirmativ-. Bill read a second time.

18,Mr ROCHER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4) 1993 makes a number of amendments to a variety of laws in existing tax acts. The amendments are concerned with the fringe benefits tax, a number of income tax measures and the superannuation guarantee administration legislation. These proposals serveto highlight the ever-increasing complexity of the tax laws of this country un-er Labor. It should also be noted that omnibus bills have become an increasingly regular feature of tax legislation brought before the parliament by the present government. This parliament routinely· passes into law hundreds of pages of tax legislation every year. These bills set out to address the many problems that result from the increasing complexity of tax law,. while at the same time further adding to that complexity. A slack approach to legislation in the first place also contributes to complexity and the need for legislation of this type,whether in omnibus or other forms. ,Labor has finally acknowledged some of the problems caused by this ever-increasing complexity with the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) announcing on 17 December last year what he called 'a tax law improvement project'. Of course, this is by no means the first time that a Labor government has announced such a project. It is significant that the government once again has been forced to concede that there are problems. These are problems that the opposition has been pointing out for some time now, as you are well aware, Mr Deputy·Speaker. They are problems that the accounting and legal professions have also been beseeching the government to address for at least the past five years. It seems that Labor has now finally been provoked into action although, if previoustax law improvement exercises by this government are anything to go by, we do not have much reason to be hopeful about the outcome of this most recent announcement. The Assistant Treasurer's statement acknowledges: Excessi.ve complexity in the tax laws produces uncertaInty and makes it more difficult than it need be for people to fully comprehend and comply with their tax obligations. Tllatis something of an understatement. We seem to have heard that song before. I remind you again, Mr Deputy' Speaker,. of .a long forgotten tax' simplification undertaking that sank without trace. The Assistant Treasurer's statement' goes into detail on some of the many benefits to be realised by simplifying the tax laws of this country, which can only make one wonder why a reform process was not initiated or even completed some time ago. Hi- statement goes on to state: The redrafting. of the law will be guided by a co-mitment to plainer language, improved presentatIOn and the most modem drafting techniques and style. .' The emphasis will be on user-friendly approaches that have as their starting point the needs and the capacities of users of the law. There will, for example, be a more rational and sensible - se ?f definitions to reduce the multiplicity and duphcatlon of defined temis and their present scattered location throughout the act. All that is to be welcomed if indeed the . "" government manages to deliver on its undertaking this time. It is interesting, however, that we have another tacit acknowledgment that the existing tax law and the legislative process that brings it into operation are in many ways deficient, something I have been l;lrguing here for many years. If the Assistant Treasurer's comments have a slightly familiar ring to them- that is because they bear a close relation to previous statements by the government on the subject. An earlier statement on the subject, if I recall correctly, was simply headed 'Tax simplification'and was issued by one 'P.J. Keating' - the then Treasurer and the now Prime Minister-as long ago as 15 February 1990. In that statement, the then Treasurer announced: a major new study of options to reduce uncertainty and complexity within the income tax system and thereby make it simpler for taxpayers and the tax administration. Streamlil1ing processes for individual taxpayers will be a major objective of the review.",21
19,Mr COBB,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,;-What happened to that?,22
20,Mr ROCHER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The honourable member may well ask,what happened. Unfortunately, that statement was pretty much the last we heard of the then Treasurer's so-called tax simplification project. Although. the simplification. task force that was set up supposedly produced an options paper on the :mbject, that options paper has never seen the light of day. We have no way of knowing what, if. any, progress has been made.in implementing the options developed by' the task force. The whole exercise was promptly forgotten after the 1990 federal election and the government has nothing to show for what was hailed at the time as a major tax policy initiative. The Assistant 'Treasurer will have to forgive the coalition for being somewhat cynical about this most recent regurgitation of the government's. interesting tax laws simplification. In fact, the Assistant Treasurer's statement on 17 December last year is a damning indictment of the current Prime Minister's efforts when, he was Treasurer. The concluding paragraph in the Assistant Treasurer's statement says: The steps. I am announcing toqay will commence the process of waking Australia's income tax law more und-rstandable and accessible to the community. It will similarly commence the process of easing the cost to the community of adtriini-tering and complying with those tax laws. I emphasise the word 'commence'. The Assistant Treasurer is freely admitting that the government is only just beginning its tax law simplification efforts. He has all but admitted that nothing was done as a result of the government's· tax law.simplification project announced by the then Treasurer in February 1990. For the past three years, the government has been asleep at the wheel on the issue, if - ot for its entire term in office. The government recognised the need to act in 1990, but did nothing. It is to be hoped, although not expected, that Labor's renewed interest in tax law simplification is more long lasting this time around and that the government acts with some urgency in the, matter; These hopes are shared by a wide range of people, not least the members of the accounting and legal professions, who deal ort a daily basis with the immense complexity and uncertainty which this government has introduced into the tax laws of our nation. About a month. before the government made its most recent announcement on the subject of tax law simplification, the presidents of the New South Wales Law Society and the Institute of Chartered Accountants issued a joint statement calling on the government to act. In that statement, thepresideJ')tssaid that dealing with the tax law: . . . was like a Star Trek 'journey without' the excitement. ' This voyage into. the unknown faces many tax advisers and their clients, who in. some cases would welcome the opportunity to have Scotty beam them up .. All laws should be certain, ascertainable and intelligible. Amen to that. They said: This is not true of our present· income tax' laws which are not understood by taxpayers, nor even by many tax advisers ... If anyone can truthfully say that the massive texts that cover tax in Australia are very well' known or understood, even·by the experts, then they must be out of touch with reality, As evidence for these propositions, the presidents cited the 422 taxation instruments of one type or another issued by the Australian Taxation Office in the first eight months of 1993 alone. These include rulings and determinations as well as exposure drafts. The presidents also expressed cynicism about the government's then forthcoming tax laws simplification statement, noting: We are .aware that the government has said that. a statement on. simplification will be made soon, but we must stress that the federal government has made such promises before. What we are looking for from the government is a real plan for progress on the simplification process. Unfortunately, we have not been given a real plan by Labor, only a few vague commitments and some reassuring noises. Just as important as tax simplification is the question of tax reform more generally. This was highlighted. by Mr John Tucker,President of the Taxation Institute of Australia, in a speech he gave to the general council meeting of the Asia-Oceania Tax Consultants Association held in November last year. In his opening remarks he said, about the importance of tax reform for Australia: The Australian taxation system is in urgent need of fundamental reform if it is not to become an impediment to the internationalisation of Australian business, seen by most economists as the key to future development of the Australian economy. In our view, Australia has little choice but to produce a simplified and internationally competitive tax system, one which will at least not contain tax disincentives to the establishment or conduct. of business in this country when. on other grounds, Australia is an appropriate location. This will require the abandonment of some existing policies such as those which have sponsored complex provisions in the income tax law, such as those to raise tax at the margins and deal with prospective avoidance (particularly of liabilities which are of themselves of little value to the revenue). A rationalisation of the tax base both at federal and state level will sooner rather than later be needed in this country to achieve what is in economic terms an essential end. Mr Tucker is worth quoting at length on this subject because his remarks neatly encapsulate the importance of these issues for the future economic well-being of Australia. More specifically, a recent report from the accounting firm Ernst and Young has called for tax law simplification in a number 'of areas currently causing· problems for business in Australia; These include the controlled foreign company- or CFC, rules, the introduction of a new regime for taxing export profits and the renegotiation of tax treaties to bring them into line with OECD conventions on the treatment of income and capital. As Ernst and Young say in their report: The Australian taxation system must make it attractive for firms to locate their headquarters activities in Australia and to export their goods and services from Australian factories and offices. All of these comments serve to put into proper perspective the government's complacency about tax reform and tax simplification. The government does not need to take any of this on the authority of the opposition. The tax and accounting professional communities are crying out for action, and the government should heed their calls in a timely fashion. The Assistant Treasurer's press release of December last year has signalJed the government's intention to act once again. What we are now looking for is some action and some results and the sooner the better. The increasing number of calls for the government to act on tax law simplification are the result of a growing realisation that our complex tax legislation is costing us dearly, both in terms of the compliahce costs faced by taxpayers and because of collection arid administration costs that are incurred by the tax office and that are paid for out of tax revenue. These costs were highlighted recently in a study carried out by the Australian Tax Research Foundation entitled 'The compliance costs of employment related taxation in Australia'. The study notes that compliance serious costs"""":""what it terms 'the hidden costs'imposed by our· tax system of personal and company income tax amount to around 10 times the published cost of running the Australian Taxation Office. That means that, for every dollar the Australian Taxation Office spends on collecting taxes, individual and corporate taxpayers are forced to spend $10 in meeting their tax obligations. This is what it means to refer to individuals and companies as the 'unpaid tax collectors of the Australian taxation system'. When one considers that the· tax office spends 1 per cent of all the revenue it collects in the administration of the tax system, one begins to realise the enormous sums that must be out laid by corporate and .individual taxpayers every year in compliance costs. The Australian Tax Research Foundation notes: A figure of this magnitude exceeds what most economists would consider to be the distortionary or welfare costs of the tax system on account effects on incentives. These are the costs Labor ignores when it declares Australia to be a low tax country. Whatever the government's total tax take as a share of gross domestic product, the fact remains that Australia has one of the most expensive tax systems in the world. in tenns of compliance costs, and these costs are large part attributable to the complexity of legislation that underpins our tax system-and we have more of it here before us today. The fact that many of the expenses incurred· complying with the tax law are deductible makes no difference to these tax calculations. The deductibility of these expenses simply translates into higher tax rates to compensate for the revenue forgone in allowing tax deductibility, it is as simple as that. overall resource costs to the community remain the same. The fringe benefits tax, taxable value. which is dealt with in the legislation before us today, provides a very good example of some of the problems already mentioned. The study I have been referring to found that the compliance costs incurred by those meeting their obligations under the fringe benefits tax legislation amount to more 10 per cent of the total revenue that the collects. In 1989-90 total compliance costs of the fringe benefits tax were estimated at $128 million, which was nearly 11 per cent of the . total fringe benefits tax revenue of $1.2 billion. These compliance costs are highly regressive, falling particularly hard on small businesses. The study found that employers spent on average 1,100 hours per year comcomplexity plying with the fringe benefits tax, which amounts to about one half.;time worker per week just to comply with this one tax. figures are hardly surprising when one looks at the sorts of amendments we .have in legislation under consideration. This bill· seeks to address a new threat Labor's taxon car parking fringe benefitsgood the humble kerb-side parking·meter.·The issue arises from the definition of a commercial parking station contained in the original The current definition refers· to the provision of an all-day car parking space for the payly made. ment of a fee. Unfortunately for the government - and it is evidence of its slack approach of its to legislation-some kerb-side parking meters, particularly those on the outskirts of central business districts, provide all-day parking for a fee. This means that a business within one kiIometreof Qn- of these parking meters is liable to pay. fringe benefits tax, despite the in fact that there may be not a commercial the parking s-ation. anywhere within. a one-kilometre radius of the business. By the same token, businesses within a kilometre of one of in these parking meters that do have a commercial parking station within a one-kilometre radius can use the cost of the all-day parking meter for the calculation of the taxable value of the fringe benefit provided to their employees. Of course, the value of such parking is The much lower than that provided by commercial car parking stations, resulting in a lower It seems that employers have taken advantage of the wording of the existing legislation to use kerb-side parking meters to achieve a lower taxable value fot the car parking benefits made' available to their employees. So than we have an amendment before us today to tax write into the tax law a form of words which excludes kerb-side parking meters from being commercial parking stations. This amendment is typical of so many that we deal with in this place that are designed to address the unintended consequences of the government's tax legislation. These unintended consequences are the result of needless in the tax law and the stupid tax measures that give rise to that complexitybeating in mind that the tax on car parking These fringe benefits has· been dubbed a Monty Python tax. Is it any wonder that the tax law the in this country is now so complex that the entire body ont can only be moved about by to loading it onto a large trolley with a very set of wheels? This is the same body of tax law that individuals and small businesses are expected to comply with and by which act. they must self-assess their liability and risk enormous penalties if a mistake is honestIn addition to measures dealing with' the fringe benefits tax, the bill seeks to correct a deficien'cy in the application of the penalty for deliberately overfranking dividends under the imputation system. Under dividend imputation ,there is a penalty of franking additional tax when a company deliberately overfranks a dividend, and this gives rise to a deficit in the 'company's franking account at the end of its franking year. The amendments contained in this bill seek to ensure that franking additional tax can be applied where an initial payment of company, tax reduces the franking, deficit tax otherwise payable in respect of the franking account deficit. The amendment applies to companies that deliberately overfrank a dividend after 14 December last year, when this bill was first introduced. There are a number of problems with this proposed amendment. Not the least is the fact that under changes to the corporate tax payment system many companies will pay 85, per cent of their prior year tax liability within 28 days of year end,' so there should be no problem in allowing'compailies to include the 85 per cent tax payment in their calculation of franking credits for the prior year. In any event- retrospectivity arises from the processes that a ,company must follow ilL paying a franked dividend. Before a franked dividend can be paid, there must be a resolution to pay the dividend and a declaration that the dividend is a franked dividend. The company must make the declaration before the day on which the dividend is paid. The listing rules of the Australian Stock Exchange specify a minimum of nine days between the declaration of a dividend and the closing of the books on shareholders. Public companies, as honourable members may well know, take up to two weeks to 'register all share transfers and to close the share registry before a dividend can be actually paid. Where the declaration of a dividend and the determination of its level of franking have been made before 14 December 1993, based on the existing law, the payment of the dividend after 14 December will give rise to an adverse tax position. The commencement date for these amendments, the date of their introduction, therefore provides insufficient notice if we are to avoid a retrospective impact fromthis measure. In addition to being retrospective, the amendment as ,it stands would be quite discriminatory in that it would apply to relatively few companies but particularly to those with substituted accounting periods. These problems can be remedied through a minor amendment to the proposed clause 51, and the coalition urges the government that it be done. The bill also makes provision for a rebate of 20c in the dollar for expenditure on approved heritage conservation works of at least $10,000 on historic buiIdjngs that are listed on statutory heritage registers. The total amount of work which will be eligible for the rebate will be limited to $9.5 million, to be issued in provisional certificates each year. The rebate scheme will cost the revenue about $2 million for each financial year. The Taxation Institute of Australia has expressed concern over this measure being included as a separate division of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. The institute points out that it merely serves to add further complexity to the act at a time when the government is supposedly engaged in a tax law simplification exercise. The TIA's suggestion, which I believe is a sound one, is that this scheme should have been administered as a grants scheme through one of the relevant government departments which will, in any case, be involved in the administration of the rebate scheme simply because they issue the certificates that make a taxpayer eligible for the rebate. ' The Taxation Institute points out that the rebate for heritage conserVation works may well be totally unrelated to any income earning activities of the taxpayer. Introducing special incentives into ,the Income Tax Assessment Act that are unrelated to the derivation of assessable income is, a recipe for unnecessary, complexity in taxation law. The bill has the support of the coalition, subject to the qualifications that I have mentioned and the amendments and the remarks that I will make during the detail stage. I urge upon the government the importance of making progress in simplifying and reform-ing the tax system. I have drawn attention to what leading tax practitioners have had to say on the subject. The government has promised action on this front. We are waiting on the government to deliver as promised. It is appropriate at this time to move the amendment which has been circulated in my name. I move:. That all words after ""That"" be· omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, House: (1) condemns the Government for: (a) its lack of concern for the many casual, part-time and itinerant workers whose superannuation benefits are eroded by taxes, fees and charges; and (b) extending the coverage of the Superannuation Guarantee Charge to contractors; (2) calls on the Government to: (a) modify the Superannuation Guarantee Charge system immediately so that it treats casual, part-tiine and itinerant workers fairly; and (b) exempt contractors from the provisions of the Superannuation Guarantee Charge legislation"" . While the coalition does agree with the overall content of the bill,.we do have strong reservations on two matters that should be of concern to the government, as they are to many in the community. The operation of the superannuation guarantee charge discriminates against many casual, part-time and itinerant workers. Extending the coverage of the superannuation guarantee charge to contractors will severely impact upon contractors who are relying on their own superannuation to fund their own retirements. The coalition has received many representations from working men and women who have been hard done by by the rules currentIyl applying under the SGC. No doubt members in this House are familiar with who is covered by the SGC, but I will repeat some information anyway. Sections 27 and 28 of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 state that salary or wages are not to be taken into account where an employee is under 18 or is 65 and over, an employee who is not resident in Australia performs work outside Australia, an employer who is not a resident of Australia pays an employee who is a resident of Australia for work performed outside Australia and an employee earns less than $450 per month. Casual, part-time and itinerant workers are severely penalised under these sections. The problems are many. Administration fees are usually set at a fixed amount, as I am sure honourable members know. Casual and the itinerant workers often work for many employers and change jobs regularly, resulting in membership of'several and multiple superannuation schemes. Exit fees are also fixed and they take no account of the available balance. For example, a worker earning $600 per. month would receive a superannuation contribution from an employer of $18 per month or an annual benefit of $216. However, there is a contribution tax of 15 per cent that reduces the balance to $184 and there is a further administration charge of $50. The remaining balance in this example is, therefore, reduced to $134-$82 was gobbled up by taxes and administration fees. What hope does this hold for a worker that works only for a few hours a week or can get only occasional work? The answer is,of course, false hope, because after the tax((s and charges have come out pf the SGC contributions the amount which is left could never be expected to provide a meaningful retirement income. I see thattllY time is about to expire. I will continue my remarks in the detail stage.",22
21,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,Is the amendment seconded?,26
22,Mr COBB,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,I second the amendment.,26
23,Mr SWAN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"In rising to support the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4), I address some of the remarks made by the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher). I do not think he acknowledges that this government has transfortlled the taxation system in this country into a much more effective, efficient and fair system. That contrasts markedly with the fact that, in the period of the Fraser-Howard government, taxation in this country was simply optionlll for the rich. The whole burden of taxation in this country was borne·by wage and salary earners-people whom he now professes to have some concern for. He makes those comments in the context of the proposal put by the coalition less than one year ago for a GST raising $23 billion, taxing all of the necessities of life in this community.The hide and the hypocrisy of the opposition on tax know no bounds. The GST was going to be a bureaucratic nightmare. It was so complex that not even its proponents could work out how it worked. For those opposite to come into this House and criticise the government about the lack of simplicity in tax legislation reveals just how hypocritical they are and that they no longer have any altern ative framework or policy. The measures in this bill will provide far greater certainty and predictability in our tax laws. In so doing, they reflect the commitment of this government to a fair and progressive . taxation system. Our approach contrasts with the· absence of any declared policy from the opposition. To verify this, I do not think we have to go much further than some of the comments that have been made this week. Malcolm Fraser, the architect of that optional tax system that operated when the Liberal and National parties were in power, had this to say in an article penned by himself in the Australian: The Liberal Party is in deeper time since its formation. Through 1991 and 1992 it tried to force Australians in directions they did not want to go.. . Twelve months since the loss of the March 1993 election, we are as much in the dark about what the party stands for as we were the day Fightback was buried. That is what the' last architect of a taxation policy from the Liberal and National parties has had to say about their current stance in this parliament. As we stand here today and debate taxation matters,what are thealternative propositions that the opposition is putting forward? We have broadened the income tax base in this community and, in so doing, we have been able to reform the taxation system, to drop the corporate rate of tax to 33 per cent, to get marginal rates of tax down from 38c in the dollar to 34c in the dollar for average income earners and people have received from this government a tax cut on average of $8 a week. We have' been able to do that because we have plugged all the holes that those opposite left open when they made taxation optional for very many people in this community. When they come in here and complain about the complexity of the tax legislation, they should at least acknowledge the benefits of the government's approach-an internationally competitive business taxation system which a GST would not. have delivered because of its consequent effects on the inflation rate and so on. . . They should not come into the House and talk about the competitiveness of Australia in international terms and say that somehow the taxation system in this country is working against us exporting more. We are exporting more all of the time. One of the reasons we are doing that is we are now 30 per ,cent more competitive than we were a decade ago. That is the decade in which the tax reforms' that this government has brought in have begun to show significant effect in the community. So much so that a recent report from Clayton Vtz called Doing business in Australia details just how attractive Australia has become as an international destination for business. The trouble than at any report states: - operating costs are 40 to 105 percent cheaper than Singapore; and, 105 to 286 percent cheaper than Hong Kong That is not the Labor Party;' that is not the government. That is Clayton Vtz. The report goes on: - IDD phone costs are 50 to 85 percent .cheaper than Singapore; and up to 50 percent cheaper than Hong Kong , - managerial costs are substantially lowerThere are many other factors, not the least of which is our distinct skills base advantage. On top of that, we have brought down the corporate rate of tax to 33 per cent. We have an investment allowance of up to 30 per cent. There is a 150 percent tax concession for research and development. All of that adds up to what has been the suCcess :of this government that we are now the lowest .taxing country in the OECD. That is a very substantial achievement if one takes the line. the opposition has been taking that we need to rearrange our' taxation system for us to become internationally competitive. The hypocrisy and the. barren nature of the propositions put by the opposition are not lost on the electorate. It is acutely aware of the absence of any concrete policy proposal being put by the coalition. Nothing demonstrates this more than the Newspoll of a couple of days ago published in the Australian of 1 March. It shows that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has a preferred opinion rating of 44 per cent compared with the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), who is on 30 per cent.··In fact, the Leader of the Opposition's rating has dropped from 40 per cent to 30 per cent since last December. Why is that?' It is fairly obvious why that is the 'case. There is no alternative policy approach emerging from the' opposItion. Is it any wonder that we hear the sorts of comments made by the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) on Four Corners a few weeks ago? He was asked by the interviewer: How damaging is the leadership issue in terms of the party being able to move forward into 1994? BOB CHARLES: Well, it's horribly damaging because no one seems to take us seriously. And with respect, it's difficult to take us seriously if we do not speak as one on issues- . The opposition does not speak as one on issues and it certainly does not speak as one on taxation .policy. It has former Senator Bishop running around the country saying that we should be dropping the capital gains tax. The capital gains tax is one of those broadening measures which has made this country more competitive and which has given the government the capacity to drop high marginal rates of tax on ordinary income. earners. We can drop the ma-ginal rate of tax for someone earning $32,000 a year from 38c to 34c ifl the dollar. What occurred when that proposition came into this House for debate? It was opposed by the opposition. The truth of the matter is that, in public terms anyway, the Liberal Party has no formal policy position on tax. But we all do really know what its policy position is. It remains committed to the principles of Fightback. the truth is that the Liberal Party is still firmly wedded to the concept of a GST. Certainly that is what the Leader of the Opposition told Kerry O'Brien on Lateline on 30 November of last year. He said: John Hewson's still committed to the basic sense and direction of the policies we took to the last election although, clearly, some of the detail will change ... But the broad approach is pretty much the same in terms of the principles. This was ,nine months after the GST was supposedly dropped. Kerry O'Brien was a bit puzzled by this answer, so he came back and asked Dr Hewson where he stood in the spectrum. Kerry O'Brien said: In 1986, you told writer, Craig MCGregor: 'I'm clearly on. the right of the Liberal Party; I'm a pragmatic dry. I like competition ... He certainly likes competition. There are 56 people on the front bench of the Liberal and National parties. That is plenty of competition for him. Kerry O'Brien asked: But you haven't changed philosophically? JOHN HEWSON: No. The basic direction's the same although I think, having reflected on it, words like right and dry don't mean all that much now. KERRY O'BRIEN: But when you say that the principles and the directions of Fightback still prevail, what are the principles and directions of Fightback that still prevail? JOHN HEWSON: Well, we still stand by the need to cut government expenditure . . . What was the other core aspect of Fightback? It was $10 billion in public sector cuts over three years. The point I am trying to make isMr Charles- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: I fail to see even any general relevance in the honourable member's comments about coalition proposals on spending from 1992 and early 1993 with respect to the government's taxation reforms in a huge omnibus bill on a great number of specific taxation measures.",26
24,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"It has been a wide ranging debate so far and the honourable member is still discussing matters of taxation policy, but I do ask him to ensure that his remarks are relevant to the bill.",28
25,Mr SWAN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"The honourable member for La Trobe was not in the House when the honourable member for Curtin was making hisremarks,but the honourable member for Curtin was talking about the need to have a taxation system that had integrity. He was arguing that the government had produced a system which was excessively complex. I made the point in his absence that the Liberal Party simply cannot come into this House and criticise the government for complexity in tax legislation when it put forward a $23 billion GST tax grab that was a bureaucratic nightmare. For heaven's sake, nothing was going to be more complex in terms of the legislative requirements of this country than the GST and the proposals that were being put forward in Fightback. The point I was making before I was interrupted was simply that, in the absence of any other pronouncements, the evidence from the Leader of the Opposition and from other people in the coalition, including the honourable member for La Trobe, is that secretly it still really, is committed to a GST. It is the big monster that lurks in the coalition policy cupboard. It is still sitting there because there is no other way the Liberal Party can do the sorts of things it talks about in the absence of a GST. Dr Hewson on ABC radio on 20 April said: No, I wasn't rolled on the GST. I think probably, in the party room, more people spoke in favour of keeping it. I decided that it a political liability in the form we' took it election, that we had to drop it. I wonder whether the honourable member for La Trobe is still in favour of a CST. Perhaps he could enlighten us on that question during this debate. At the same time, we have the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) running around the country advocating Asian levels of taxation. Asian levels of taxation in Australia would mean cutting revenue to the tune of $10 billion to $20 billion a year. At the same time, members of the opposition come into, this House and,' argue that no government expenditure cuts are justified. So what they have is a policy of dropping the revenue, keeping the expenditure going and blowing out the deficit. No wonder they criticise the government for its deficit reduction program. They simply have; in policy terms outlined in this parliament, no altern ative plan. All we are entitled to do on this side is simply point out that, in the absence of that plan, they are obviously committed to Fightback and the principles of the GST. ' When they come into thi- House and criticise bills such as this and the taxation legislation ,under which we operate, they have very little credibility. There may well be some common sense and sincerity in some of the remarks they make about the technical nature of these amendments and other amendments to do with the tax act. Trying to devise a taxation system that stops the smarties from driving trucks through loopholes and from producing the sort of leakage that we had in our taxation system under previous coalition governments is indeed very difficult. The consequence of that is that the community does pay a price in terms of complexity and compliance costs. But those opposite should acknowledge why we have to do that. They should not come in and cry crocodile tears about complexity and about the government not having any integrity in its approach. It clearly does. It has been up to this government to fix the mess that was left to it over a period of 30-odd years of coalition bumbling through our taxation system. There are a couple of elements of the bill I would like to address. In particular, I would Was mention the provisions relating to the exempto the tion of certain bereavement payments which apply to most pensions. I think this is a very worthy measure. The existing law does not provide for the exemption orany bereavement payments in relation to a number of allowances which currently are being introduced by the government. One particularly good reform to be introduced by the government is/ of course, the mature age' allowance for those long-term unemployed males who, through no fault of their own, are unable to get work. The government is recognising, that and not applying the activity test. That has consequent flow-ons throughout the system"" and that has been recognised in this bill. I congratulate the government for that. There are also amendments which relate to the heritage conservation issue. The bill will provide a tax rebate of 20c in the' dollar for expenditure on approved conservation work on buildings listed in a Commonwealth, state or territory register., I noticed that the able member for Curtin criticised that .initiative. I cannot quite understand why. I think it is. one that is long overdue. It was part of the government's election campaign commitment. I believe that over time it will have an enormous take-up rate. But I think it is a very important initiative. T also acknowledge some of the points made by the honourable member for Curtin in relation to the superannuation guarantee act and some of the technical amendments which are made here. I would preface my comments, however, by.saying that, once again, for those opposite to, come into this parliament and talk about superannuation in any sort of credible way is . indeed very difficult. They have opposed at every turn the efforts of this go:vernment to put in place a national superannuation system which can provide for this work force through the next .century. They have not made any constructive contribution to that debate. It is absolutely vital that the government continues to go down the road that it does, and the superannuation guarantee is part of that.. I would, however, like to express my personal concerns about one of these amendments. My reservations relate to the reference of a contract. Under this legislation, a contract is considered to be wholly or principally for labour if more than half of the value of the contract is for labour. While the SGC should apply to payments for labour, I am concerned that this definition may be too narrow and it may have an adverse effect on a number of independent contractors in the community. That is a matter which I will continue to take up with the government over time. But, having said that, in matters of sriperannmition, as in mattetsof taxation overall, this government has Ii very good record which has delivered very positive benefits to not only the business community but also the work force of this country. The opposition has no policy when it comes to wages, except for . lower wages; it has no policy when it.,comes to taxation; except for higher taxation. All that usually adds up to is a standard prescription. from the conservative parties of lower living standards for ordinary people. Nothing honourhas changed in that debate in terms of the contributions from those opposite today.",28
26,Mr CHARLES,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"La Trobe) (11.13 a.m.)'-I am d-lighted 'to have the opportunity to respond to the honourable member for' Lilley (Mr Swan) who seemed tb get off track a bit. I thought we were here to debate the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4) 1993, which I note is one more hi a great long list of omnibus bills that seem to be favoured by this government. We' amend, amend, amend, amend, amend and change. Unfortunately, the honourable member for Lilley is leaving the chamber so I will not be able to tell him what is wrong with this bill and have him understand it in any great detail. The honourable member for Lilley spent some considerable time directing' his remarks to opposition policy as it was prior to the last federal election on 13 March 1993 and also pridr to the Labor Party coming ihto governmeht in 1983. He seems to be obsessed with what the Liberal Party and the National P-rty might oT might not think about .taxation spending and a whole raft of other things, which generally had no relevance to the bill that is before us today. Butletme say to the honourable member for Lilley and any other honourable members on the. government benches ih this parliament: if they think we do not have policies; wait for it. I assure them that the Australian people will warm to our approach, as they are getting heartily sick of a government which not only is' incompetent but· which also has no accountability. It is increasingly seen by the community to be tired, out of touch, siCk, perhaps decayedthat is a good one, a rotten carcass hanging up there in the breeze, a bit smelly. That seems to be all around us, does it not? Just about everything it·s¢ems to touch. winds up in that sort of context. This omnibus bill goes to a whole range of r taxation matters. We have talked about this issue before in this place, and want to raise it again. It makes it particularly difficult for individuals, taxation advisers, accountants, companies and business people of all descriptions-small"" medium and .large-to know how to plan their affairs when the. taxation rules constantly change. They not only change but,. by putting a whole raft of measures together in one bill, those individuals have no idea of where to turn. .This bill reminds me in some respects of the Industrial Relations Reform Act 1993, which we debated long and hard in this place. That act had so many amendments to the principal act, the IR act of 1988, that we need a road map to be able to follow the amendments to the original bill, and then the amendments on the amendments to the original.bill. They make it such a confusing mess that it will be a very major accomplishment if the principal industrial relations players in this country manage to sort out what their responsibilities are, what the legal system means and how i- is to work. We are faced with the same sort of problem with this bill because of its omnibus nature and the fact that it addresses specific taxation measures across a whole range of issues. I welcome the government addressing anomalies in the tax act and in various sections of that act, but I really do deplore some of the measures inherent in this bill which are further attacks on industry, on business. and on commerce generally. That is an important battle. This government really does not seem to have much concept of why we have businesses. We frequently hear ,in this place moaning and groaning about the high rate of unemployment and the government's inability to deal with the problem. References are made by government ministers and backbenchers to situations overseas. They say, 'Oh well, we're not quite as bad as country X and country Y, but we're desperately worse than country Z'. But the, point they miss is that, all of this, private enterprise is the driving force behind our economy. ' In the last few years this government has propped up oUl: economy by expanding the Public Service-by expanding the number of people we pay to administer government programs and·government initiatives. Whether or not they are doing useful work one can only judge by the raft of massive, voluminous legislation that we get before us in this place, exemplified by this kind of a bill. ' The government does not really understand business. Very few of those opposite have been involved in business in a real sense, so how could we expect them to understand? We cannot ask a teacher to explain the ethos or the mental workings of the mind of a true entrepreneur, one who is going to develop new products and new services and help build jobs for an expanding, growing and dynamic nation. School teachers are good at teaching at school, but I suspect they are not very good at understanding business. Yet we have rafts of school teachers who come into this place and tell us how we ought to develop industry policy and industrial relations policy, improve productivity and alter the taxation system, without any base understanding of how those businesses operate or the mentality behind the people who drive them and. what they are trying to achieve-not only for their companies· but for this country. The tax act has become so complex that a whole industry has developed-not in taxation avoidance but in just trying to cope with. it and do the right thing to make sure that individuals and companies are not shimmed with penalties which arise out of many of the sections of the act in case someone, accidentally or otherwise, violates some provision in the act. Those complexities cost money. They are expensive for individuals because individuals now increasingly have to go to taxation advisers or accountants in order to have their taxation returns. done. They find ,that taxation legislation has become so complex that they can no longer fill out th.eir own taxation return and be confidentthat they will not violate one of the hundreds of thousands of provisions of the act. Businesses are placed in in an even more invidious position, having to spend increasing amounts of money. on the increasihgdetail incorporated into the taxation act. Those complexities cost money. Perhaps they contribute to the gross national product - I certainly hope not, because they are a negative expense; they do us no good. . The message that I bring to this government is simplicity in legislation, particularly in the tax act. I think former Senator Bishop, who will soon join us in this House, is right in that perhaps we should dedicate a portion of time in this place to not introducing legislation but getting rid of it. That is not a get rid of a whole raft of it. Perhaps then we would be a bit more efficient. In a sense, business oncosts are attacked by this kind of legislation. If we want productivi:ty in this nation, if we want the competitiveness that government ministers and members talk about, and if we want to go out and play in the broader world community,_ we need Jow oncosts for business and commerce. The kinds of provisions incorporated in this bill increase the oncosts of businesses-both directly, through taxation that they must pay, and indirectly, through the accounting and record keeping required by the taxation measures. This government uses the' tax act for all kinds of things. The government says it would be desirable for more businesses and more industries to provide more effective training for their employees. Nobody would ever disagree with that kind of a motherhood statement. It is absolutely true. So what qoes the government do? It crea,tes a taxation measure to tax companies if they do not train the way the government thinks they ought to train. So oncosts of business and industry are continuously attacked through the tax act. I turn to the topic of retrospectivity. Time and time again in this place we seem to argue over retrospectivity. Once again, unintended or otherwise, in this bill we address retrospectivity. In this case it concerris the overfranking of dividends. I understand that not tnanycompanies are involved, but it isretrospective legislation. There is some possibility that the government's definitions, which are hidden in the bill with respect to contractors are also' retrospective. Retrospectivity tears the life out of the confidence of business and industry that government knows what it is doing. How on earth can we plan effectively when the rules are changed in the past ,tense? It is hard enough to cope with the raft of changes that this government introduces which are required by industry for compliance. It is hard enough to deal with the new ones, much less with the ones which 'deal with the past. I deplore the introduction, once again, by the government of an element of retrospectivity into legislabad idea. Let us tion in this place. One of the major elements of this bill is the superannuation guarantee charge. In the back of the bill the government has, buried some definitions which affect so-called contractors. The second reading speech of the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) states: The bill will also make a number of other amendments to facilitate the smooth operation of the superannuation guarantee scheme. When he talks about other arrangements and smooth operations, he is talking about changing the definition of a contractor iIi order to sweep all the contractors in Australia, in so far as it is possible, into the PAYE system and into the superannuation guarantee charge system. This government has a long history in its association with unions of wanting to get rid of independent people; I notice the honourable member for Melbourne, or whatever",30
27,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Mr Newell)The honourable member will address his remarks through the chair. MiCHARLES- Mr Deputy Speaker, I notice the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) nodded his head in agreement that, yes, that is what the government is about ...:.... 'Let's get rid of contractors, because they are bad for unions. Let's make everybody a PAYE employee 'and make everyone belong to the union. Then the union bureaucracy can control government, can control the tax act and can control the country'. Why bother electing us in the first place to come into this place to argue about it? Let us just let' the unions run the country arid everybody will be happy. That is a terrific idea! Let us consider what the government says about contractors in this bill. The purpose of this particular amendment to the act is to remove any doubt that payments made to contractors wholly or principally for their labour are salary or wages. It is intended to ensure that the superannuation guarantee scheme operates as intended. We are not really sure what was intended, but the date of effectofthisamendment is 1 July 1992. That makes it retrospective. The government will argne..,--,erroneously, I think-that it is only clearing up spme language that left some doubt. The amendment says: An employee is defined in subsection 12(3) of the SGAA to include a contractor who works under a contract which is wholly or principally for the labo-of a person. But then it goes on to say: A contract is considered to be wholly or principally for labour if more than half of the value of the contract is for labour. It was dearly intended that payments for labour under such contracts were to be subject to Superannuation Guarantee contributions. Boy, does that raise a whole raft of problems! Forexample, a bricklayer may work for 50 different companies during a year. I agree that it is unusual, but it is possihle. If that pricklayer supplies .labour only, including' perhaps his mixer, his tools, his transport and those sorts of things, he invoices the building contractor that he is working for, or the house builder, or whomever. Largely his contract is for labour. That means that the principal contractor or builder must now pay superannuation on behalf of that bricklayer. How on earth does a bricklayer get any benefit out of superannuation payments that are ml!-de to perhaps as many as 50 different superannuation schemes? All that means is that the charges by the superannuation supervisors for operating costs will exceed the amount of payments made to the account and that a whole amount of money will be wasted on bureaucracy. It will be of no benefit to the bricklayer. Anyway, the bricklayer took out his own superannuation in the first place and has made his own arrangements. He really does· not need the complexity of the people that he works for adding to that superannuation-not to the scheme that he has set up for himself but to sundry superannuation schemes. It is an absolute nonsense and it will Greate a nightmare. , If the government intends to eliminate contractors, then this. is one good way to go about· it, I think it was in 1992 that the government, through the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2), made a concerted effort to bring contractors under the control of trade unions. Contractors were not allowed to deal separately with those people who employed them if they came up with an agreement that the union did not like. So the union could act for the contractors, notwithstanding the fact that the contractors did not like the idea, and go to the commission and complain that their contract was not fair because they might have received more money had they been employed on wages. . A lot of industry in this country, some of the most efficient and effective industry in the world, is built on the contractor and subcontractor system. If this government intends to destroy that system, then it wants not only to attack the independence of people-their desire to do their own thing, be their own bosses and work in the manner that suitS them rather than in the manner someone else tells them they have to work in-but also to help destroy some of the most effective industry in the world. What benefit will this achieve? It will not benefit the mums and pops of Australia, because they will pay more for their houses. It will not benefit the mums and the pops who want to send their children to school, because the government will be paying more money for new school buildings and that means we will all pay higher taxes. So what benefit is all of this? None. Being an independent contractor has absolutely nothing to do with ripping off the taxation rules. Honourable members cannot point to any evidence that indicates that it does. The last government brought in a system which required independent contractors in the construction industry, for instance, to have some of their payments made as taxation until they could prove that they were reliable taxpayers, and fair enough. Casual, part-time and itinerant workers are another issue that we very strongly wish to bring to the attention of the government because those people, like the contractors or bricklayers in the example I gave before, will wind up with no superannuation benefit to their account. It is long past time that this government gave up and accepted our proposition that banks be allowed to accept those contributions without having all the charges that ,go together with separate superannuation funds. with no benefit ever going to the people involved. The complexity of this legislation requires addressing, as does the complexity of the fringe benefits tax system. (Time expired)",32
28,Mr TANNER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I wish to refer first to a specific item in this taxation laws omnibus legislation--'the heritage conserVation rebate. This measure was first announced in the 1993:94 budget by the government and provides for a rebate of 20c in the dollar for expenditure of at least $10,000 on approved heritage - onservation works by individuals or companies. That, of course, applies to homes, buildings and the like. The person or company who has qualified for this is able to obtain a provisional certificate, which recognises that certain work that they will be undertaking .and paying for will be within the category that qualifies for the rebate. They will then have two years within which to perform that work on that building. On completion of the work they will then qualify for a final certificate, which ensures that they are eligible for the approprihave ate tax rebate. There are many buildings in my electorate, which covers most of the oldest parts of Melbourne, which are in need of renovation to preserve our heritage. There are many areas of Melbourne-the city, Richmond, Collingwood, Brunswick and other parts of my electorate-which have older buildings that are a critical part of our urban heritage and which really do need greater .renovation and restoration to ensure that .they can be preserved in an appropriate form for our future generations. In particular there are many beautiful houses, and I think it is important to preserve the distinct nature and character of many parts of inner Melbourne. The same logic applies not only to our cities but also to our many historic homesteads and other buildings in rural Australia which will equally benefit from this measure, on the presumption that private individuals and operators take up the tax initiative which is now being made available to them. An example of the importance of this issue is the contrast between two major arterial roads in inner Melbourne-St Kilda Road and Royal Parade. St Kilda Road was once a very beautiful street; unfortunately, most of the older buildings in StKilda Road were pulled down and replaced with bigh-riseoffice blocks now populated by insurance companies and various other organisations. Although it still has. certain features, it is nothing like it once was. By comparison, Royal Parade, which is to the north of the city and in my electorate, is probably one of the most beautiful boulevards in the world because most of the older buildings in that street have been preserved. There are some extraordinary examples of 19th century architecture. It is a very beautiful street and I think that most people in Melbourne - ould be very worried if there were any suggestion that Royal Parade could gradually tum intoanother St Kild- Road. An initiative like this can only assist in ensuring that a street such as Royal Parade can remain in its current condition. I refer also to some of the problems that we had in Melbourne in the last 10, 15 or 20 years with changes in the city. In particular, much of what was once known as the Paris end of Collins Street has been destroyed, and more recently we have had a proliferation of high-rise office blocks in various parts of the city which have remained in many instances largely untenanted and are now a huge problem economically for the banks and for those often failed entrepreneurs who sponsored them in the first place. If honourable members wander around some of the inner areas of Sydney such as the Rocks and recollect what was proposed for Sydney under the Askin government in the late 1960s and early 1970s and the impact of the green bans by the Builders Labourers Federation, I think they will recognise just how much the people of this country, par.,. ticularly residents of Sydney, owe to Jack Mundey, Joe Owens and the other leaders of the BLF in that period. I recommend to honourable members a film called Rocking the Foundations, which is a very good documentary on that period. One of the more startling things in that film is the models of Sydney as it was planned to be developed with literally forests· ofhigh;.rise office towers scattered across the inner Sydney area. It is extremely fortunate'-and many people who would have been great promoters of: these, high-rise towers in the past now recognise this-for all of us that there has been a change of emphasis and a change of orientation in what we value and what we think is important. I think this particular piece of legislation recognises that. I warmly commend the government for this initiative. If honourable members do not think that things such as preserving 'some of our older buildings, particularly in the inner of cities where obviously they tend to proliftax, erate, is all that important they should have look at some of the, cities around the world. I was fortunate' to visit Athens a couple years ago and I was staggered that about per cent of Athens is covered with fiveto seven-storey blocks of flats. Athens was a very small town in the early part of the 19th century and it was only"" towards the later part of the 19th, century early into this century that it began to be developed again as the dominant city Greece. It really is quite an and it has many beautiful features. But one of the things that it really does lack is that sense of time and history over many different ages that can be found even in a relatively young city sUGh as Melbourne because, of the fact that it has grown so rapidly in the modern era. Of course it has its great ancient era landmarks such as the Parthenon, the Temple of Zeus and so forth. It is a, good illustration of what could happen if we allow all of our 19th century buildings to gradually disappear from cities ,such as Melbourne and Sydney. Some of the other features of the legislation that we are dealing with today include ensurtively ing that the fringe benefits tax exemption applies to travel costs for medical treatment undertaken by employees in foreign countries; removing a loophole with respect to the fringe benefits tax on car parking which has, unfortransport tunately, been exploited by some companies to enable, them to artificially reduce their fringe benefits tax, payments; implementing the budget announcement with respect to tax exempt infrastructure borrowings to finance interest for the construction phase of various infrastructure facilities; extending for superannuation pensions and rollover annuities from tax sources; eliminating tax avoidance mechanisms which have developed with respect to the leasing of luxury cars; providing .a tax exemption for bereavement payments under the social security legislation with respect to pension and allowance beneficiaries; introducing rules to prevent groups of companies from taking advantage of particular arrangements that have been set in place for individual small companies with respect to the areas new arrangements for payment of company in quarterly instalments; collecting the a deficiency in the penalty arrangements for the deliberate overfranking of dividends under the of dividend imputation system; the repeal of 98 income tax exemption for savings banks which are conducted pu-ely for the benefit of d-positors of those savings banks; and,ensuring that the $150 tax rebate which will go to provisional taxpayers as well as to PAYE taxpayers will go to both equally and not be and deducted from provisional tax at the front end. Finally, there are some vario-s technical of changes to the superannuation guarantee extraordinary city legislation. In the time remaining tome, l will make some broader comments about the question of taxatiori which all the various issues in this legislation relate to. Unlike some, I take no pride'in the fact that Australia is now close to or is actually the lowest taxed country in the OECD. That is really looking at the issue the wrong way around. We should be looking not at the raw figure of how high or how low our tax is; we should be looking at the outcomes, particularly with respect to quality and equity. Are we getting the best value for money? Are we spending the money that is raised collecfrom the community and spent collectively as effectively as we could? Do we have the fairest distribution of wealth and opportunity in the OECD? Do we have health, education, housing, community services and systems that deliver to everybody on a reasonably equitable basis and on an efficient basis? These are the .key questions that we should' be asking ourselves-not how much tax we all pay but what we get for it. Are the outcomes effective? Are they what people need, what people want? Those are the the rebate critical questions .. It is good to see, for electoral reasons, that the apostles of Reaganism are still alive and well on the other side of the House. The honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) is an arch-Reaganite. What the Reagan approach has delivered in the United States is effectively a collapsing public education system with high levels of illiteracy and extreme problems with training and retention rates, a grossly inequitable health system, poor infrastructure and, of course, massive and growing inequality which entails a whole range of social problems which are increasingly coming to the surface. The 1980s in the United States are a clear example of the true consequences of the trickle down approach, of the notion that if we make the wealthy wealthier they will go out and create jobs for everybody and we will live happily ever after. Now we have the reemergence of the throwbacks in the coalition, with people such as ex-Senator Bishop aiming to enter this House and taking an increasingly prominent role in opposition policy. Former Senator Bishop is suggesting that we need to get rid of things like the capital gains tax. We have the hysteria that is thrown at this government-which, as I indicated,has reduced our level of tax to virtually the lowest level in the OECD--:in still being described by, amongst others, the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), as the great 'tax and spend' government. One wonders what sorts of adjectives he would use if we were in fact a· high taxing and spending government. The reality is somewhat different. Others in the coalition· have been pushing the notion of income splitting as, I suspect, a device to try to tum back the clock and to reintroduce their notion of the traditional family as the dominant social unit in our society. The fact is that our society has changed a great deal. We have many types of families, a much more complex framework. To crudely examine the issue in the way that some in the opposition are doing and to suggest simply introducing a tax structure based on income splitting is, in effect, a recipe for favouring the better off. We need to ask where the opposition is coming from. Let us look at the track record. Hark back to the Fraser government. One of the key things that the Fraser government did in 1976, if my memory serves me correctly, was to reduce the number of scales in the income tax schedule from six to three. The net effect of that was to shift the burden from the wealthier taxpayers back down the scale to lower income earners. That was what it was designed to do. With fewer steps in the income tax scale, the end result will be that the relative proportions of income tax being paid by people at different levels will change, and they change adversely to lower ihcome earners. In more recent times, as was mentioned by the honourable member for Lilley (MrSwan) in his contribution, we have had the GST. In amongst all of the hysteria, rhetoric and so forth that we have heard from both sides on this issue, there is one fundamental point: a tax change such as that which was envisaged in Fightback would have substantially shifted income and wealth away from lower income earners in favour of the better off. Shifting from a mildly progressive income tax arrangement to a consumption related arrangement through the GST would have had that consequence. It is difficult to determine until it is actually enforced precisely by how much, but that is what it would have done. That is why I think it is reasonable for us to come to the conclusion that the opposition is primarily here to represent the interests of the better off in the community, the wealthier sections of our society. Whatever those opposite say, whatever crocodile tears they cry about inequality and the like, that is the consequence of what they have done in government, and of what they propose in opposition. On the income splitting issue; the Labor government, through the green paper on restoring full employment, is addressing some of the issues, some of the legitimate concerns. I commend the parenting allowance proposal in the green paper to the consideration of honourable members. That proposal provides a oasis for people-male or female-to have much greater support in their role as carers for children. One of the things that will be important to attach to that initiative if it is adopted by the government-this recommendation has been put forward by ACOSS-is that some form of scheme equivalent to the JET scheme which applies to single parents should be developed to ensure that those who are out of the work force for a time are assisted to return to the work force, particularpainful ly if they have been out of it for a number of years. One of the problems we have in this counthe try-the honourabl- member for La Trobe is a very good example-is the culture within business that someone else is to blame, that there is a nasty government imposing costs us, these taxes and charges and cetera. There is always somebody else to blame for the failures of Australian business in international competitiveness. It is never us. It is never management. It is never poor quality decisions. It is never lack of innovapeople tion. It is never lack of genuine entrepremembers neurialism. It is always somebody else. As I indicated earlier this month in a speech in this House, that is not where the main game of international competitiveness is. Costs obviously are an issue, but they are lesser issue than the key issue; that is, the ability to innovate, to develop quality progest ducts that the rest of the world wants to and that the. rest of the world needs. where Australian business is still too often falling down and that is where government intervention is important. But ultimately it will be critical for the leadership of Australian business to realise that there is not anybody else to blame for our problems and that quite business has to lift its game. We should focus on the real issues of tax reform. Overinvestment in housing, which been chronic in this country; has been contrireduction buted to by favourable treatment· in' the"" system. We should abolish negative> gearing and modify the capital gains tax exemption by, for example, applying that exemption only to the unimproved value of houses purchased. In that way, there will be no bias in the system which impels people to invest in doing extensions and the like. We should have an inheritance tax or some tax of that nature. Deemed capital gains tax on death is another option in that regard. We are one of the few major countries that does not have some form of taxation' for those circumstances where ta:x is the most equitable, the most efficient to collect and the least for the individual taxpayer.' We should be modifying the capital gains tax to create an incentive for people to invest in the longer term. We should be rejigging structure of the capital gains tax to ensure that people have some sort of incentive to leave their investments in a company for a time rather than chopping and changing and on making it very difficult for managers to make on-costs, et longer-term decisiops: . We should rationalise the wholesale sales tax, and there. should be more steps in the income tax scale. For example, there should be a return to the 60c in the dollar tax rate for earning over $75,000. I point out to of the opposition that, contrary to the sort of rhetoric we often hear in here, Taiwan, for instance,has its highest marginal rate set at 60c. It also has a total tax take that is now higher than Australia's. Yet Taiwan is moving ahead in leaps and bbUtjds. If the a right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) wants to challenge that, I sugthat he read Robert Wade's book entitled buy Governing the market. It will indicate the That is truth of what I have just said. Mr SincIair-I was just interested'that you w-re advocating higher tax.",34
29,Mr TANNER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I think our overall tax take at the moment has become too low. I am happy to state that I think the total tax take is too low. I would also modify the company tax regime to ensure that rather than effectively has giving money back to companies through a in company tax from 39c to 33c in tax the dollar in' an indiscriminate way-the government has decided to do that-we do it in a discriminating way. For example-I have suggested this in this place before-we should give an enhanced deduction to companies for tax training. We should reward companies for things that will improve our international competitiveness and that will lead to Australia becoming a high wage, high skilled, high productivity, high living standards as economy. The big issue that the honourable member for La Trobe and I agree on is that we have the future. to simplify our .tax system. One of the key problems is our three-tier system of governtoday ment. We will not be able to simplify our system until we have' a decenttwo-tier system of goverrimentand get rid of the archaic horse and buggy structure that we are still .stuck with in this country. We should be debating not just the percentage of gross domestic product that is taken tax but also how it is used; whether we get full value from it; what we should in the public sector collectively and what should be done in the private sector; and the fairest and most equitable tax system. We very rarely hear from the other side proposals about how it would improve equity in the system: (TIme expired) MrCONNOLLY (Bradfield) (11.53 a.m.) - I 'listened to the honourable member for Melbourne. (Mr Tanner).' It never ceases amaze me how, after the' eyent, one can views on taxation which, in many cases, seem to be safar from reality. He seemed to have completely confused the fl,indiimental problem about the ratio' of tax which should come from income as distinct from that which should come from consumption. I recall only too well the position of the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating) whole question of indirect tax a few years ago, which was only knocked out by the ACTU and not because of any economic industry argument in its own right. Therefore, I reject the honourable member for Melbourne now claiming that somehow or other the proposals of the coalition at the last election were going to be grossly unfair to low income earnersdifferent we went to considerable efforts to demonas strate quite conclusively that that was not the case. It demonstrates what a coordinated policy of lies and deception can ultimately achieve. But the whole issue of'the OST is now no longer on the public record. As far as the oppositioil is concerned, it is no longer our policy. But the issue as to what proportion one's income should be the subject of direct, distinct from indirect; taxation will clearly remain something which all people who are interested in' taxation will have to refer to in This legislation which we are debating is technically related to Taxation Laws tax AinendmentBill (No.4). It covers a number of subjects of interest. I want to draw specific attention to the question of superannuation in so far as it affects both low income individuals, especially part-time employees, and subcontra:ctors. This has been amply covered in by my colleague the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), who spoke eloquently be doing a.bout this very serious issue. Wht{n the SOL was introduced into this House, we in the opposition expected that the .fundamental definitions under the Income Tax Act would remain consistent for both superantax nuation purposes as well as tax purposes. Unfortunately, that has not been .the case. Consequently, we are concerned that the handling of subcontractors under the superanto nuation laws will now create a series of hear perhaps unexpected consequences which, nevertheless,. will certainly not be in the interests of the hundreds of thousands of small business men and women in this country. who' are subcol)tractors, whose existence qepends on their ability to trade in an open market situation and who, therefore, can see their position considerably. undercut by the on the provisions in this legislation. I will take one case as an example. Large numbers of larger companies in the building want to deal only with subcontractors who have incorporated themselves; in other words, they have gone to the trouble of going to their solicitors, buying $2 companies and so forth. They have established, therefore, a legal entity. They wanted to be seen employees of a company providing a range of services f()r a given length of time for the completion of.a specific project. They are now effectively being told, 'We do not want to deal with you'. Why? Because of the impact of the SOL and the fact that, in this caSe, the building industry faces the problem of having to have a different set of of structures for the handling of subcontractors because of the SGL compared with the position when dealing with employees. This in tum has resulted in a situation where, in our opinion, the act should draw the line. In other words, if people are declared to be subcontractors· under the tax act, what is the logic for saying that they are not the same subcontractors performing basically the same work under the Superannuation Act? Clearly, there is a serious question of logic here which should be addressed by the government. I sincerely hope that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Sciacca), who is at the table and who is very learned in these matters, will, at the conclusion of this debate, be able to address this very fundamental problem. Similarly, if a person is regarded as an employee under the tax act, surely it follows that the superannuation legislation should take the same basic definitions right through. If an employer now has to make a whole series of deductions under both federal and state legislation for every single employee, it obviously becomes a major difficulty if there is a different set of laws relating to the dling of superannuation payments under the SGL. That leads me to reach one important conclusion in this regard. In June 1983, we first started debating the fundamental issues of superannuation in this House. We seem to have never stopped debating them ever since. One point has come out very clearly: in many cases, the definitions are not clarified in the respe-tive bills before this House. We have to wait for the regulations before we see the definitional aspects of legislation.. Usually, that in tum creates difficulties with the industry as well as with employers, out of which we find another set of amendments coming before the House. Therefore, I strongly urge the government, when it continues to bring forward superannuation legislation, to make every effort to marry th-t legislation with the existing tax so that there is a continuity of definitions right across the board. Above all, it should not regard regulations as a fail-safe mechanism which only has to go to the Senate so that, regrettably, it has no impact on this House. Therefore, those who have to live by the law of this parliament are influenced by regulations over which members of this House have effectively no control. The second issue I want to address is the whole question of how this legislation affects superannuation and the effect of small SGC contributions and fees. In answer to a question from my colleague Senator Watson in an estimates committee on 11 May last year, the parliament was advised that the retirement incomes modelling task force assumed in its work that average weekly earnings growth would be 5.5 per cent; that the CPI growth would be four per cent-fortunately that has proved to be wrong to date; that the fund earning rate would be eight per cent; and that the effective rate of fund earnings would be seven per cent. On the basis of these assumptions, a person on the minimum amount subject to the SGC, which is $450 per month or $5,000 per year, would,· like everyone else, see his or her money start to grow from day one. That is the han- premise upon which the whole analysis was made. However, when we take account of the task force models for the fees charged by funds and when we use the same assumptions but include·a one-off joining fee of, say, $5 and a weekly administration fee of, say, $1, a person in receipt of the minimum contribu'tion will not break even. The person will not have as much in the fund as has been contributed in real' terms until contributions have been made for some 18.years, which is a fairly long time in the life employment history of most people. I think it is fair to say that, under current economic circumstances-and anybody who looks in a crystal ball at the future will probably come to the same conclusion-the presumption of long-term, continuous employment in the same industry, much less the same employer, is a doubtful prospect for the act future. In other words, many people will find themselves changing jobs more frequently and many of those people will require periods out of employment in between those jobs when they are effectively being reskilled for a changing work force requirement. The sad fact of the matter is that the SGC contribution. regime, as it currently operates, does not take that into account. I wantto give the House a clear example of this. I refer to a person on a low income who worked for a golf club as a casual waitress. She was there for 11/2 years and she was paid an hourly rate of $8.98. She was made a compulsory member of the club superannuation fund because her total income was in excess of $5,000 a year. But when the employer contribution account was analysed, it was noted that, on 1 July 1993, the opening balance was $80.20. The account keeping fees were $8.80. When that person ceased employment with that club on 31 December 1993, the actual closing balance, including the account keeping fees, was not $80.20; it was $71.40. In other words, the total contribution had gone down by $8.80. That is not the end of the sad story. That particular person knew that she would not be going back into employment or into a fund in the foreseeable future because she was still a university student. So what happened? She sought rightly that the fund should be. paid out. In so doing, she was told that, due to regulations, she would have to wait for almost one year to claim the remaining money. Furthermore, she was told that it would take five to six weeks to get processed and that it had to be signed by the trustees and .go through the normal internal processes. That is not the end of the sad story. This particular person was then told that, in addition to having made those losses due to account keeping fees and so forth, it would cost her a further $25 for early release and that-this is perhaps the most cutting point of all-she would then be taxed at a further 21.4 per cent. So being taxed at 21.4 per cent of $""71.40, minus the cost of the early release $25, meant that the person was left a superan- . nuation fund with a grand total of $46.40! I may be wrong in thinking that this government of compassion and concern, which is always looking after the problems of the underdog and so forth, is really interested in these sorts of issues. But I have raised these problems year after year in this House, as have my colleagues, and so far there have been no effective results whatsoever. I even addressed this issue in the coalition's superannuation policy. We put in that policy the concept of retirement savings accounts. One of the specific advantages of the retirement savings account is that the 1.9 million Australian part-time workers-and that is a seasonally adjusted figure-would get a better deal than the one I have just outlined. How can the government seriously put to people on a low level of income of, say, $5,000 a year, or not much more,. that they will have a viable superannuation fund when they finally leave the work force at 60 or 65 when it knows that the prospect of their getting anything is significantly undercut due to the effect of the regime as it applies to those sorts of people? . Superannuation has always been of great benefit to high· income earners. It was so under. the old regime and it remains so under the present regime. But the whole logic of the superannuation policy is based on the premise that, when Australia's demographics catch up with us, as they certainly will over the next 30 years, the outcome will be that a higher proportion of the popul""tion will, through superannuation, have achieved a degree of financial independence. In other words, they will not have access to the age pension, which presumably will be restricted to those people as in the case I have just referred to.· These people will, through no fault of their own, effectively lose access to their superannuation because of the impact of the current SGL requirements. The question of national savings, which is fundamental to this issue, was well addressed in the national saving report to the Treasurer (Mr Willis) by Dr FitzGerald in June 1993. He made a number of salient points which of I would like to put on the record. He said: . . the timing of measures to strengthefl. national saving over the medium term will have to be set in close relationship with policy to manage the recovery. But measures to strengthen national savings over that time frame remain of key importance. Stronger national savings is an essential ingredient of any sustainable approach for pursuing ongoing healthy growth in the economy over the mid and late 1990s and beyond. He went on to say: The national saving goal should be higher-to reStore the underlying national saving rate over the coming decade to around the average for the pa-t tluie decades, 22 to 23 per cent of gross domesttc product-'-i.e. to lift it by about 5 per cent of GDP-and to lift the efficiency of our investment to .,best practice. Perhaps the most stunning fact of all was the point that Australia's national savings, at some 16per cent of GDP in 1991-92, are at their lowest level in two generations. The government has responded to that by quite simply saying, 'We'll solve the problem by having effectively a compulsory superamlUation levy applied to employers with a voluntary capacity for employees to also make a contribution if they so wish'. The point I am trying to make is that, quite clearly, the government has missed the fact that it bris not considered, except in aggregate terms, the impact of the demographics of Australia against a clear and lateral analysis of what makes up the Australian work force. Any system which is meant to be universal and, which affects in a negative sense anywhere near 1.9 million part-time employees must' be seen for what it is; namely, a very faulty system indeed. We suggested in our retirement savings account concept that, instead of people under these circumstances losing $25, as this young woman is going to, they would have the right either initially or subsequently to take out a retirement savings account with a bank. The employer would make ,contributions to that account. The employee could make contributions to that account if he or she wished on the clear understanding that those funds would be put aside for long-term savings purposes and, ultimately, for their retirement income. They would not be funds which could be accessed in, say, five or 10 years time. For that reason people would not suffer, as this young person did, the considerable cost of trying to take funds out of a scheme when in fact they had no choice. For every year such people remained out of the s«heme, they would continue to lose, in some cases, at the rate of $1 a week in the basic quantum of the fund because they would not be contributing to it any more, and nor would the employer because those people would no longer be employed. That fund would become smaller and smaller until it finally went out altogether, except if it were making a significantly higher rate of return to cover these additional costs. The sad fact is that in recent years that has not been the situation. This matter has been addressed' by the banks; it has been addressed by the ACTU; and it has now been addressed by consumer organisations. Everybody is saying, to the government that this is a fundamental problem affecting hundre<;ls of thousands of Aus. tralian workers who are simply saying, 'If you want us to forgo part of our wages for so called long-term savings purposes' - FitzGerald demonstrated the need for savings and we in the opposition totally support that view-'clearly you must have an adininistrative system which is seen to be fair'. That is all we ask for: a system which is seen to be fair so that people do not see superannuation as a new hidden form of tax and part of a system in which money comes in one door and goes out the other. Thesad thing in this case is that it is not even going to the national good in the strict sense of the term, because it is not going to the tax office at all; it is, in fact, going to the fund managers, to the superannuation industry and to those people who are involved in the actual administration of these schemes. The government's response to these proposals,whether it be retirement savings accounts or the SSAs as proposed by the banks, has been less than satisfactory. The government'S position seems to be that it does not want to introduce a universal funding mechanism because that may be seen as a subsidy from the taxpayer. That is well and good. That is why we suggested the retirement savings accounts. They would give people an additionaL option. They could make a long-term commitment to fund their superannuation through the bank in the knowledge that they would not be taken to the cleaners every time they changed their job. ,These people do change their, jobs. Even worse, many of them have one, two or three jobs. If the actual quantum of the income that they earn from each of those individual jobs is less than $5,000, they do not have any superannuation paid at all, because their employer is not required to make a contribution to their schemes. They could have three jobs which give them a gross income of, say, $15,000 a year and effectively have no SGL cover at all because of the idiotic nonsense built into the present system. We want to see a system that allows people with three part-time jobs to make a contribution to their retirement savings account which affects all three incomes of $5,000 each. Then we would be talking about a sehsible system. But it is deluding these people to give them the impression that somehow or other their long-term funding will be protected. (TIme expired)",37
30,Mr GEAR,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I thank all those who have taken part in the debate today on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4) 1993. I will make just a few comments on the amendment moved by the opposition. Of course, the government will not be supporting the amendment. Let us look at the sentiments expressed in· the amendment about the superannuation guarantee charge for casual and part-time workers. The government does recognise that, in the initial stage of setting up the superanaccommodated. nuation guarantee levy, there are difficulties in relation to small amounts, as has been outlined by a number of speakers here today. I inform the House that the Treasurer (Mr Willis) has been working on this and we believe that the problem can be overcome. In the context of the superannuation guarantee charge, I think that this should be seen as a teething problem, not a permanent problem, and certainly one that the government can fix. Mr Connolly-It has been teething a long time. MrGEAR-The superannuation guarantee charge is going to las! a long time too - a lot longer than many of us around here. Therefore, the government does recognise that there is a problem and, as I said, we have steps in place to look at that. Paragraph l(b) of the amendment states: extending the coverage of the Superannuation Guarantee Charge to contractors; Where contractors supply their labour only and they are subject to PAYEtax, then they will be subject to the SGC. I recognise that, where contractors have private superannuation and currently receive tax deductibility for that, in some cases they may lose that tax deductibility. But when we are looking at superannuation, it must. be remembered that it is taxed only once. That is, if someone goes into superannuation with tax-free dollars, then the benefits are paid in taxed dollars; on· the other hand, if someone. goes in with after-tax dollars, then the benefits are paid tax free. We tax them only once. The government recognises that in some cases people may have to make some arrangements to accommodate that. I believe that in the initial stage they will have to calculate the quantum of the afterretirement benefit after tax and make the adjustment. To get the same benefit at the end they will have to pay in less at the start. They will also have to accommodate the fact that the superannuation guarantee levy will now be taken out of their pay and will add to their retirement incomes. I recognise that there will be transitory problems for some people on the way through but,of course, they can all be I am sorry that I was not here for the whole of the debate, but I understand that the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) referred to the tax law improvement project which was announced by the former Treasurer on 17 December 1993; I can inform the honourable member for Curtin thatlhave had a couple of meetings with MrBrian Nolan, who will be in charge of that project. I hope to be in a position soon to cut the ribbon,or kick it off, as the case may be. Like many members in this House, we believe that because over a long period the tax laws have been added to in a· very disjointed way the legislation is very difficult to read. We believe that the tax law improvement project will make the law a lot easier to comply with. In many cases it will remove a lot of ambiguity. It will take out a lot of definitions that repeat themselves and are sometimes at variance with one another; All in .all, the aim of· the project is to make the legislation simpler. and to lower compliance costs. . . · Mr Rocher-We wish you luck!",42

33,Mr ROCHER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Is that not amazing? Here-we have a perfectly legitimate legislative chamber; the only one in which money bills can be introduced, and we have a minister of the Crown, responsible for. the running of the legislation, telling us that he is not going to accept an amendment here, that the bill will go up to the Senate, it will amend it and we will have to come back and agree with it. I do not know what sort of Alice in Wonderland we are operating in this place. This is simply outrageous. It is just garbage. God spare me, but I do not know why the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) has any part of it. MrGEAR (Canning-Assistant Treasurer) (12.23 p.m.)-In reply to the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), I remember late. last 'year when we were discussing a motion in this House that sought to move a motioll condemning. the, fact that the Senate was putting a time limit on this House. The honourable member, along with everyone else who sat on that side, voted against that. Those opposite allowed the Senate to put a time limit on this House-as the honourable member rightly points out, the premier house in this parliament-and the honourable member supported that. The honourable member now stands up with mock indignation and talks about the fact that we are going to move amendments in the Senate. I will tell the honourable member why we are going to move the amendments in the Senate. We have to negotiate these amendments in the Senate. The amendments were passed by our caucus yesterday and we are going to allow those senators who take an interest in this matternamely, the Australian Democrats, the Greens and the Independent--:-to have a look at these amendments before they aremQved in the Senate. Apart from .that, one of the amendments . involves ongoing consultation with industry. We believe that the extra two weeks that that process can continue will allow us to move the amendmentS in the Senate with a lot more certainty. It is for those reasons we are doing it.",43

The logic is greatbecause we voted against a certain motion somehow it has some application to the matter now before the chamber. That motion was all about the Senate disciplining the government because it could not get its legislative program in order. It had nothing to do with the quality or quantity of legislation. It was simply that the government could not get its house in order. It could not get its legislation introduced and through this place in sufficient time even though it was able to use. the guillotine savagely. If I understood the Assistant Treasurer correctly, he was saying that he will not accept this amendment-although it is going to be agreed to in the Senate, presumably along with. other amendments, and I accept that there will be others. I think that is treating this House with' disdain. I repeat the allegation: it is a nonsense, and I am sure the Assistant Treasurer knows' it is a nonsense.",43
35,Mr CHARLES,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"La Trobe) (12.25 p.m.)This is absolutely incredible. I really cannot believe that the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) has said that he treats this House with such contempt that we, here, are unable to deal with a logical amendment which we support. It is, indicative of the arrogance with which this government treats .the House of Representatives-..,.the representatives of the people of this country-that the Assistant Treasurer has the audacity to come into this. committee debate and propose that he will introduce an amendment which we support into another chamber. It is all ,part and parcel of the continuing effort to reduce the relevance of the ,House of Representatives and the people's representatives who sit in it. An executive government has made it demonstrably clear, riot only to us here but to the people all over Australia, from one end to the other, that it care- not about this House, it cares not about this chamber, it cares not about its representatives; it cares only about imposing its wilf on the parliament and the people. 'It has become so out of touch with Australians from all walks of life that this arrogance is shown day by dayin this chamber. We have just been through the most incredible time with the sports rorts affair, which is all about government accountability and credibility. At the end of the day a minister says, 'I have done nothing'wrong. I have not rorted the system. I have not used taxpayers' money inappropriately. I have used ;it all for appropriate programs in appropriate places', gives up and resigns her place in cabinet and her place in the ministry. Why? Because the Australian people essentially said, 'It is a rort and the government is not accountable to the parliament and it is not accountable to the people'. Obviously, the government is not accountable to the parliament. This is one' more indicative action that shows that the government does not care about the people's House. It is executive government running roughshod over the parliament, changing the rules, changing the sitting hours, changing the sitting pattern and changing the number of chambers, all without the agreement of the parliament. A committee of this House, through the Speaker, brought dowp a report on televising parliament. The Speaker announced, 'It is a bipartisan report and we think if is a good idea that the people of Australia have the right to see and know what is happening in their chamber-in the chamber of their representative-'., What happens?

Mr GEAR (Canning-Assistant Treasurer) (12.30 p.m.)-In anSWer to the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), I will believe that members of the Liberal Party believe this place has prominence when in their party room they move to have their senators say in the Senate that they will not support a time limit on legislation going through this House. When they do that I will start taking them seriously. But if every session of parliament, when there is a tim:e limit imposed by the Senate on the House of Representatives, Liberal members vote for it in their party room, do not oppose it or do not speak out against it, then I do not know how they can come in here and say those sorts of words. Basically, they are very hollow. I did not want to get down to this but I say to the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) that the government's words were a little better than the opposition's and that is why we really do not want him to pursue the matter. Where under clause 51(a)(ii) of the taxation. amendment bill the opposition has the word 'paid', the government has the words 'declared and paid'. I think our words add a bit to it. In the spirit of getting the legislation through and accepting the fact that-our amendments did not go through our caucus until yesterday-we have to have those negotiations, I put it to the honourable member for Curtin that I think it is appropriate that we do it in the Senate.",44
40,Mr ROCHER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I have two quick points to make. Firstly, I have a suspicion that the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) did Ilot mention that to me because he did not know it at the time we were discussing it and learned of it only a few seconds ago. Secondly, in case anyone is bemused by all this, this legislation is not under time restraints nominated or foreshadowed by the Senate. What the Assistant Treasurer had to say is of a rather general nature and has nothing to do with the arguments put forward by my colleague the honourable member for La Trobe (MrCharles) and me. Amendment negatived. Clauses agreed to. Clauses 80 and 81-by leave-taken together.",45
41,Mr ROCHER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,",Clauses 80 and 81 of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4) make it clear that payments made to contractors for their labour will be treated as salaries or wages. This provision·is also retrospective, with 'a starting date of 1 July 1992, and I remind honourable members thanhe bill was first introduced into the House on, I think, 14 December. It is our contention that some contractors will be faced with great hardship as a result of this new provision. Section 82AAS(1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act defines eligible employment as any sort of work that results in a person being treated as an employee for SGC pur.poses. Also, section 82AAS(3) states that, wllere people are engaged in eligible employment. and that eligible employment provides under 10 per cent of their total income, they c-n tax deduct their own contributions. This bill extends the definition of an employee and further tightens the definition of a contractor, with the result that contractors are further drawn into the employee net, as it were. The Labor government, instead of recognising the stupidity of the previous definition of a contractor and loosening the definition to reflect the reality of the labour market, has instead tightened it.. This is simply a sop to Labor's mates and the uriion dominated superannuation schemes. It is also a reflection of Labor's inherent contempt for independent contractors who, by their very existence, facilitate much needed flexible work practices. I agree that this is not the place to debate the finer points of who qualifies as a contractor and who qualifies as an employee, except to say that the SGC definitions are clearly stricter than existing ones in tax legislation. Labor tells us that this finetuning of the definition of a contractor is only an adminisretrospective trative adjustment. It is, however, a threat the very existence of contractors. The big sting from this bill is that even more contracramifications tors who have been: putting aside money in a personal superannuation scheme for their retirement will lose tax deductibility for their future contributions. If contractors who receive only small SGC contributions. were stop making personal contributions and have instead rely on the SGC, their retirement incomes would, in an overwhelming majority of cases, plummet and increase the pressures on the social security system for full or partial pensions. . Essenthdly,' the main problem is that the definition of an employee is far too The ramifications of these clauses will be very widespread. A privately practising doctor, for example, who works at a local hospital and earns 12 per cent of his income there, is now generally treated as an employee for the purposes of tax deductibility on personal superannuation contribution. The bill further reinforces this bad. situation. The government should nqw be fixing this probcome. lembut instead, is making it worse. This occurs because. the '-ncome Tax Assessment Act defines an employee by using the'definipaying tion provided in the Superannuation tee (Administration) Ac:t. This measUre establishes an environment in, which genuine contractors will be discouraged from providing for their own retirement. I am going to leave my remarks there because my time is up but I will continue my remarks later.",45

45,Mr ROCHER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"My gosh, I should have not' known that better than anyone. Thank you very much. The amendment to this bill wiH tractprs. , have a negative impact not only upon future welfare bills but also on the level of national saving. A' further matter of great concern is the nature of the provision that to backdates the application of clauses 80 and 81 to1 July 1992. It is yet to be seen what the of this measure will be but retrospectivity in this circumstance is clearly a denial of administrative fair play by the government. The situation is iniquitous and we refuse to support such a measure.Coalito tion members do not oppose the bill,as we already indicated. l!owever, we do \lave very strong reservations about the way in which the sac discriminates against many casual, part-time and itinerant workers, and further tightens the noose around the necks of contractors who want to provide for their own retirement in ,a way which is much more broad. rewarding than under the SGG. As the Labor Party does not give employees the right to select funds or transfer their entitlements from fund to fund, employees- particularly low income earners whose superannuation savings are held in several ,achis counts-must pay several sets of fees and charges leviable by each fund. The choice to consolidate benefits into. one fund has to It has to come and, as sure as night follows day, it will happen .. Why not now? Ultimately, these low' income earners are for La-or's inability to develop a more Guaranflexible superannuation scheme. ""I have outlined possible policy prescriptions that the government' should be examining, though it is hard to imagine it supporting retirement savings accounts or freedom of choice in picking . a superannuation fund. Labor will never allow freedom of choice of its incestuous relationship with the union movement and the trade union dominated superannuation funds. We then have the case of contractors who, for the purpose of the SGC, are defined as employees are increasingly defined as employees' in a clauses 80 and 81. It appears that Labor's justification in proposing these two clauses is to extend the level, of superannuation coverage but to reduce then,umbers of conSuch a move will, in many cases, result in reducing the levels of superannuation benefits available to contractors,becausethose who are subject to the SGC will lose tax deductibility for personal schemes and will simply stop making personal contributions: As honourable members would readily appreciate, this will have a long-term detrimental impact on future social security expenditure. The government desperately needs to address the problems that the SGC holds for low income earners and recognise those faced by contractors now. I advise honourable metnbers that we will be dividing on these clauses.",46
46,Mr CHARLES,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"I support the remarks of the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), I am glad to see that the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) is here for this portion of the debate.. I remind the Assistant Treasurer, who was not here during the main part of the debate, that my view is that this action by government is simply one more link in the chain of the government's intent to try to destroy the contracting and subcontracting system in Australia, one which I have noted and believe strongly to be of great benefit to Australians and the country. There are hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of people out there who wish to be iJ,ldependent, who wish to do their own thing, who do not really desire to be told how they must· work, how long they must work, for what wages they must work, who would like to work for themselves and receive reward for their effort. That system has produced great efficiencies in Australia, but this government link by link adds to the chain that will ensnare all of our contractors so that eventually we will no longer have contractors and subcontractors. All those who work-who do useful work, who allow us to be here, who pay the taxes that pay our salaries and the wages of those who keep this parliament running-are under attack from this government when it attacks the free enterprise contracting system. There.is no ques-ion about it. The Assistant Treasurer ought to take note of the words of the honourable member for Curtin about changing the definition of what is a contractor for tax purposes because it has Campbell, G. further impact down the line. It not only affects people· who hire those contractors in terms of the administrative burden they have in dealing with the superannuation guarantee charge but also brings into play state taxation systems in terms of workers compensation, long service leave and payroll tax. That means that a contractor, an independent businessman or woman, may now be caught up in another tax chain as well because of this definition. It will be impossible for many small contractors, smalfbusiness people, who work for many employers but who largely supply labour and not materials, to justify any longer under the taxation laws that they are independent contractors. They will wind up having bits· and pieces of superannuation money in all kinds of pots. I have brought before the House the example of a bricklayer who might well work for 52 different home builders in 52 weeks. He will then wind up with 52 different superannuation funds on top of his own personal superannuation which now will not be tax deductible. At the end of 12 months, 24 months or 36 months those 52 little pots will be worth. nothing because the administrative charges will have wiped them out. The other issue that must be dealt with is, once again, retrospectivity. Retrospectivity is anathema to business and industry planning. How on earth does one plan for the future when we not only keep changing the rules as we go along and adding to the general burden of taxation but also start changing the rules retrospectively? I will never support retrospective taxatio- legislation. Question put: That the clauses be agreed to. The House divided. [12.49 p.m.] (Mr SPEAKER - Hon.

Mr ROCHER' (Curtin) (l2.54 p.m.)Towards the end of my speech at the second reading stage, I made some remarks which are relevant to clause 88. I h!ld given an' example Melham, D. Morris, P. F. of a hypothetical worker, earning' $600 per month and. whose employer's superannuation contribution would be about $18 it month for an annual benefit of $216; I pointed out that there is a contribution tax of 15 per cent out of that $216and an administration charge of $50. The point. I arrived at was that, of the original $216 only $134 was left, $82 having been gobbled up by taxes and administration fees. The situation is even worse for workers who have s-veral jobs, either concurrently or at different times of the year, because they have to pay the administration fee for each of the superannuation funds they are in and subscribed toby each different employer. Many of these amounts in schemes into which contributions are made by employers often lie donnant after a casual worker has moved to another job, as we all know. These donnant superannuation contributions, if more than $500, or less than.$500 but not withdrawn from the superannuat,ion fund, will continue to be charged an administration fee of approximately $50 a year or, at best, a donn ant account fee of $26 a year. There are also the exit fees which apply when workers may decide to rationalise their superannuation holdings. These provisions penalise women . proportionately: more than .they do men as they are mor- inclined to .work in part-time positions at occupations that are also lower paid, according to. accepted statistics. Some might wonder why - few hundred dollars is such.a big deal, but, naturally, if it was not it would hardly be wortbwhile continuing with an SGC that discriminates against working men and women on low incomes. One option for the government would be to increase the income threshold from $450 per month after which an SGC contribution is made. The government could also consider the availability of retirement savings accounts for workers on low incomes. Such an approach would reduce the level of erosion of superannuation contributions which is prevalent in conventional superannuation schemes. The other option would be for contributors to select the fund of their choice and transfer their funds to another fund if they are not satisfied with its performance. As I alrea,dy jndicated in talking to another clause, this is uniikely .because Labor is committed to supporting the superannuation schemes that are essentially award based and are controlled in part by appointees of the union movement. The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) in his response to the second reading debateacknowledged difficulties of the kind I am now canvassing. I seek .leave to continue my remarks.",47
47,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Mr Nehl)Order! No other member having risen, I call the honourable member for Curtin. d'",49
48,Mr ROCHER,PAIRS,"All these problems were also acknowledged by the then Treasurer in August 1993. He announced that he would give high priority to resolving the problems experienced by casual and itinerant workers under the SGC scheme. To date, 'Labor has done nothing except give vague assurances that' it is aware of the problem. We ate sick' of assurances. Glib words such as 'we are in transition' and the like just are not good enough. The scheme has been going long enough. The government has acknowledged the problems; it is simply failing to act. ' Today's Age newspaper reported that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott) expects to make a· statement on .the matter by the end of May. It has beenatound for a long time now. We need a resolution to these' problems now. If the government had not fudged these' issues over the last two years, lower income earners would now have a rational superannuation system. Sadly,that is not the case.",49
49,Mr CADMAN,PAIRS,"I regret that I have not been able to speak extensively on this Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4) 1992. There are a number of areas which concern me. The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) will be aware of my having raised with him; last year this' very matter of itinerant and part-time workers and their superannuation. This is a most wasteful and debilitating process. The Assistant Treasurer ought to be aware of it and he ought to be able to get his act into gear quickly enough to resolve it. The superannuation industry and employee groups have· been raising this with the government intensively, to my knowledge, for the last six months and less intensively for over' a year. How does this thing work? What it means is",49
50,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,":Order! I feel constrained to remind the honourable member for Mitchell that we are dealing with the remainder of the bill which is from clause 82 onwards. His remarks are wide ranging over the whole of the bill, and that is not appropriate at this particular time. Mr CADf\IIAN- Mr Deputy Speaker, I am dealing with the specifics in that, because of the nature of this legislation, it is obvious to me that the government has failed to meet the exactitude of requests which the parliament has previously made of it. I am indebted to my colleague the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) for indicating that the flat dollar rate contribution for part-time employees is in chapter 13 of the explanatory memorandum, the superannuation guarantee amendments, on pages 94, 95 and 97. In this regard, the government's slowness to act has, 'left many employees in a very difficult situation: What has happened, in fact, is that em'ployers have continued to· make a contribution to the scheme. Employees think that they are getting more money than they actually are. They think their fun,ds are going into some superannuation pool that, will benefit them. Actually, they are going into a pool the cost of which is higher than the actual contribution that is being paid' by part-time employees, or their employer· on their behalf. Where do they come out of this? That bill, against the employee's contribution, is added up over successive periods of employment. The employees never get in front; they always have a notional debt to the superannuation company. . The government has known this. The industry has suggested a simple remedy of lifting the barrier and making $600 a week a minimum figure for employment so that contribution really covers the cost of adminisadministrative tration. Many part-time and itinerant workers have jobs such as part-time teachers at TAFE colleges and adult education centres; then, course, we have more commonly considered itinerant workers, such as ,fruit pickers and on. All of them represent costly additions the· employer. The cost' of employment is increased by this process, and nobody benment efits. The superannuation company does not benefit because it does not cover the cost its administration; the employee benefits not one jot; and the employer has extra costs. The government has continued with this program for months and months and months after being made aware of it. I just want to know what it is doing-give us a timetable. People out there want to what the intention is. It is not good enough to be told that the Parliamentary Secretary to Treasurer (Mr Elliott) will come in here May with an alternative. It should. be in legislation; it should be part of the amendments we are debating today. If the government were competent, it would have done that. The solution is simple. I want to when will it do it; when will there be new amendments; and when will this. matter resolved? Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill agreed to. Third Reading Bill (on motion by Mr Gear)-by leaveistration read a third time. INDUSTRY, TECHNOLOGY AND NA NA 1994 Consideration resumed from 10 February. Second Reading",49
51,Mr LINDSAY,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Herbert-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development) (1.03 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. the This bill provides fora range of mainly amendments to be made to the Patents Act 1990, the Trade Marks Act 1955 and the Designs Act 1906. These acts form of the legislative basis of Australia's national industrial property system, a system which so plays an important role in our nation's ecoto nomic prosperity and growth. Patent and design laws encourage technological advanceand stimulate industrial development. Trademark laws, which assist in ensuring that of t-e goods and services of one enterprise are distinguishable from those of other enterprises, enable orderly marketing and benefit both producers and consumers alike. The bill also amends sunset clauses in the Industry, Research and Development Act 1986 in line with the government's decision to extend the competitive' grants scheme of the industry know innovation program until the end of 1995. I would now like briefly to detail the the legislative changes made to these acts by the in Industry, Technology and Regional Developthis ment Legislation Amendment Bill 1993. In December 1992,' the organisation that was known as the Australian Patent, Trade know: Marks and Designs Offices became the Australian Industrial Property Organisation. be Along with the name change came some structural changes. AIPO i- a division of the Department of Industry, Technology. and Regional Development. The divisional head, whQ holds the non-statutory position of director-general, has, in addition to his statutory functions as the commissioner of patents, registrar of trademarks and registrar of designs, the responsibility for the overall adminof AIPO.As part of the structural changes I· referred to, greater emphasis is· to be placed on the management responsibilities of the diredor-generalas distinct from the statlitoryroles of commissioner of patents, registrar of trademarks and registrar of designs. The bill makes relevant changes to the above acts to enable the statutory functions of the' commissioner of patents and the registrar of designs to be carried out by the head of the Patent and Designs Offices, and the functions of the registrar of trademarks to be carried by the head of the Trade Marks Office. This will help the director-general,to concentrate on the overall ,financial and general management of AIPO. Other minor changes allow the above statutory office holders to delegate their powers to staff working in the relevant offices., The delegation of powers, however, will be limited to staff designated in the regulations m'ade under each of the patents, designs and trademarks acts. Australia is a signatory to a number of multilateral international conventions dealing 'with the protectioo'of industrial'property. One of these is the multilateral Paris Convention for 'the Protection' of Industrial Property. Australia has also entered into a number of bilateral arrangements that impose similar obligations. , Each piece of patent, trademarks and designs legislation makes provision in relation to recognising a right of priority for what are called 'convention applications'. This means that an application for a patent, trademark or a design' in a 'convention country' will, subject to the fulfilment of certain requirements, be regarded as if it had been filed in Australia on the same day as it was filed in the particular convention country. On 17 August 1993,a memorandum of understanding on the protection of industrial property rights between the Australian Commerce and' Industry Office and the, Taiwan Bureau of National Standards was signed. Amongst other things, theMOU provides for a mutual right of priority. For AIPO to meet its obligations as an 'implementing authority' under the MOU, regulations are required to declare Taiwan to be a convention country for the purposes 'of the patents, trademarks and designs acts. The regulation making power to provide for this is available in the Patents Act,but not in the designs or trademarks acts. These latter acts only'provide for regulations to be made declaring convention countries with a view to the fulfilment of a treaty, or other like, instrument between the Commonwealth and another country. An MOU in Australia does not have the status of a treaty- Changes are therefore out proposed to the Trade Marks Act and the Designs Act which wi]] allow for regulations to be made declaring a country to be a convention country for the purposes of those a,cts, as is currently provided for in the Patents Act. These chaI1geswi1l remove the limitation of the declaration being made with a view to fulfilling a treaty or other like instrument between the Commonwealth and another country. Finally, changes are proposed to the Designs Act which will provide regulation making power to allow the Registrar of Designs, either on his own motion or on request, to correct an entry, in the, Register of Designs for the purposes of correcting a clerical error or obvious mistake. Currently, the only way such an' error can be corrected is by the application of the registered owner of the design to the Federal Court or a state supreme court: This is not only costly, and therefore, a disincentive for owners to have errors corrected, but also puts an unnecessary impost on our already heavily loaded courts. These changes ,require no net' additional expenditure. The amendments to the Industry Research and Development Act 1986 accommodate the government's decision to extend the competitive grants scheme of the industry innovation program. The government has a two-part strategy to encourage private business expenditure on research and development. The strategy consists of the 150 per cent tax concession for research and development, which' is now a permanent feature of the tax system, supplemented by direct grants to firms under the industry innovation program.' Business expenditure on research and development in 1991-92 reached a record $2.2 billion. In real terms this represents almost a doubling of business investment in R&D over the last decade. Small and medium enterprises often lack the substantive cash flow to take advantage of the tax concession. The industry innovation program grants scheme plays a valuable role in providing assistance to help these firms develop their capacity to undertake technological innovation. In 1994-95 approximately $40 million will be available to assist projects under the industry innovation program. A further $20 million will be available in the first half of 1995-96. I am pleased that the government is able to continue to assist Australian firms to undertake research and development through this comprehensive package of measures. As honourable members would know, the bill as introduced in this House includes amendments made by the Senate on the motion of Senator Spindler for the Australian Democrats. During consideration of the bill in detail in this House, however, the government will be moving further minor amendments that will complete the picture. in the spirit the Senate amendments and clear up any possible unintended effects. A detailed explanation ·of the changes made by the bill is contained in the explanatory memorandum and the supplementary explanatory memorandum to this bill. I commend this bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum and the supplementary explanatory memorandum to the bill.  Industry, Technology and Regional' Development Legislation Amendment Bill is an omnibus bill which amends a number of acts and programs falling within the industry, technology and regional development portfolio. My remarks this afternoon will address most of the proposals contained in the bill. However, . my colleague the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), the shadow minister for science, te-hnology and export development, will address the amendments to the Industry Research .and Development Act. The majority of the amendments proposed in the bill are the consequence of the amalgamation of the Australian Patents Office and the Australian Trade Marks and Designs Office into the Australian Industrial Property Organisation, otherwise known as AIPO. The two offices amalgamated in 1992. AIPO iquite important, to Australian industry. Its mission is to provide industrial property protection rights which enhance innovation, competitiveness and trade. In essence, AIPO protects new ideas and inventions. This is crucial for business. In doing this, it has responsibility for adminh;;tering the Patents Act, the Trade Marks Act. and the Designs Act, as well as a host ·ofassociatedregulations. . > AIPO is also a receiving office, an international searching authority and an international preliminary examining authority under the Patents Cooperation Treaty. As part of the new arrangements, AIPO operates as an autonomous body on a cost recovery basis. As of. July last year, it no longer receives any government funding. Accordingly, the management structure has been changed to reflect AIPO's new objectives. The director-general takes on a greater management and adminisOf trative role, while his powers to approve and register patents, trademarks and industrial ' des'igns are delegated to as-cond tier of management. This bill seeks to put into place the framework for the delegation of these powers. A second but unrelated amendment allows for the correction of tninoradministrative or clerical errors made by AIPO staff in the course of registering designs, trademarks and patents. Currently, administrative areas can be amended only by application of the registered a owner to the Federal Court or state supreme court. The government advises that it considers this to be both costly and time consuming and that it acts as a disincentive to having these details corrected. Errors which may be corrected under the new provisions include the names and addresses of applicants, the details of registration, and notification of the assignment .or transmission. I have been assured that in no way does this bill provide for any substantive changes to be made to trademarks,patents or designs, including the date of registration. AIPO has been kept quite busy in recent times. For example, in the last financial. year, 28,736 applications for patents were filed. That is an increase of 5.6 per cent on the previous year. In 1992-93, 24,391 applications for trademarks were filed. That is an increase of 6.7 per cent on the previous year. In 199293, 4,018 applications for registered designs were lodged. That· is an increase of 6.5 per cent on the previous year. This appears to indicate that Australian industry is becoming more innovative and creative. This is a good thing, especially if it translates into the opment of successful products which capture new markets. The second key proposal in this bill relates to the protection of industrial property. Australia is currently a signatory to the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property. The Paris convention was first established in 1883. Australia became a party to that convention in 1907, joining other countries such as Great Britain, most of Europe, the United States, Canada, Indonesia, Japan, Trinidad and South Africa. The Paris convention governs the industrial property rights of individuals, of member countries and of all the other nations which are signatories to the convention. The convention applies to industrial designs, patents and trademarks. The basic principle of protection afforded under the convention is that of nationa:l treatment. This means that each member country must grant the same protection to owners of patents granted in other signatory countries as it would grant to those of its own nationals. The convention does this by establishing a system bf priority. A person filing an application for registration of a design in a member country has the right of priority to file a design application in any other member country simultaneously or within six months of the date of lodgement of the first application. The applicant may therefore obtain the same priority date in all member countries without. having to make. simultaneous or individual applications in all countries. The convention also seeks to ensure a similarity, if not uniformity, of rules and obligations relating to the registration and validity of.patents, trademarks·and industrial design across all member countries. The scope of the protection offered is limited by each signatory country's own domestic laws. The convention deals with issues of importation and compulsory licensing of patents in such a way as to allow domestic law to regulate much of the detail while still having overall regard for the protective nature of the convention. There are, however,. a range of countries which are not signatb-ies to the Paris' convention. Reciprocal protection arrangements with develthese countries have been documented in a memorandum of understanding and approved by the Governor General. This bill seeks to circumvent this rather cumbersome process by introducing regulations which will allow nonconvention countries with whom reciprocal rights have been negotiated to be declared convention countries for legislative purposes. A similar provision is already a feature of the Patents Act. The bill also seeks to extend the termination date for the discretionary and generic technology grants scheme from 30 June 1994 t031 December 1995. As I have noted earlier; this measure will be discussed in more detail by my colleague the shadow minister for science, technology and export development. Since we are debating the needs of Australian industry today, it would be remiss of me not to make some comments on the forthcoming industry statement. As I travel around the country talking to manufacturers, service providers and their representative associations, I hear the same things. These messages have also been given to the government, and I believe the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Senator Cook) must address them in his forthcoming statement. The .comments maqe to me fall into three basic .categories: firstly, concerns about high governmenUaxes, charges and other business input costs; secondly, problems with an inflexiblelabour market; and, thirdly, lack of micro-economic. reform. According to the latest KPMG Peat Marwick manufacturing survey, these problems are widespread and are a major barrier to clients increasing their level of investment. Interestingly, they are also among the issues nominated by clients as being the areas in which the government has had little success in improving. According to the survey a whopping 60 per cent of respondents nominated high labour on-costs ·as being a major barrier to new investment. In fact, the greatest number of respondents suggested that this was the key factor holding back their investment. Fifty per . cent of respondents noted the high labour oncosts were also a significant deterrent. Government regulation was nominated by 50 per cent of respondents as being a. barrier to investment while excessive regulation was found to be a major deterrent by nearly 40 per cent. Inefficiencies in the transport and waterlate front were also of concern to around a quarter of all respondents. "" The results were equally dismaUn terms of government performance in these areas. Micro-economic reform on the waterfront and in transport was seen by respondents as delivering benefits of only 0.1 per cent. The survey indicated that industrial relations reform, such as it was, delivers gains of only 0.5 per cent. Once we move to labour oncosts the results become even more interesting. The respondents said that the training levy represented a 0.6 per cent impediment to their business while the superannuation levy hinders their business to the tune of 1.2 per cent.' These figures are not a ringing endorsement of the government. Indeed, to the contrary, they are a, firm condemnation of the government's . lack of action in these areas. ,The challenge for the government in framing its forthcoming industry statement is to address the sentiments underlying these results as well as a wider range of concerns expressed by business in their submissions to the minister. Put simply, the government must take up the challenge to create better environment for business. There is no doubt that the industry statement is crucial to business and that industry is placing great store by it. .The Printing and Allied Trades Employers Federation said in a recent newsletter: The importance of the Industry Policy Statement can hardly be exaggerated-:-it is vital for country's future and is something PATEF;A has been calling for years. Industry is seeking .big things from this statement. This process has .been actively encouraged by the former minister for industry and is reflected in comments made in industry submissions. The· following comments· made by the Metal Trades Industry Association in its submission to· the minister are representative of the thoughts of industry: It se¢ks the development of a policy framework which assists Australian industry to maximise the opportunities and manage risks in doing business in the international marketplace in which it now finds itself. It defines industry policy very broadly, to encapsu'any government action which seeks to remove obstacles to industry efficiency and competitiveness', and to emphasise the importance of linkages between various areas of policy to achieving,our national objectives. It evaluates industry policy to its crucial position in the national. policy agenda, in recognition of the fact that as effective and coherent industry policy is essential to generating more wealth, higher living standards, new jobs and new confidence in the future. ,. The New South Wale-Chamber of Manufactures also put industry'S thoughts quite succinctly in a recent newsletter by saying: We see the Minister's Industry Policy Statement as a unique opportunity to establish a joint venture between government and industry which will guide the growth of the manufacturing st<ctor'into the future. ' We believe the industry strategy must be approached as a true partnership .. We in fact describe it as a joint venture between stockholders. In this context we think it should set out what is required· of govemmentsand their agencies,· industry, employees,. others jn the community. If all these people have a commitment to this strategy, they will use it to continuously focus on the agreed outcome. I- will also help mobilise support for industry development and, - e--i1d a confidence in the producti-e sector of the economy. It. will also. requi-e governments to alter the way they view their roleS. In particular, the way programs are made more accessible and their delivery better integrated; and regulations are developed and administered on a best practice manner. My greatest fear about this statement is that industry will be disappointed. The previous this minister for industry, the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Griffiths), placed a lot of emphasis on this statement. He told a meeting of the New South Wales Chamber of Manufactures: I am determined to see this government do whatever it can· to give Australian industry every assistance to improve its performance and achieve export success. In a speech to the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry the former minister said: The Statement will provide a stable, predictable framework for business. Its aim will be to foster competitive, dynamic business environment. The minister went on to say that the statement will: . . . . consider the need for additional measures to ensure that Australian companies continue their success in international markets. The former minister noted that he favoured a 'pragmatic, real world but light touch approach'. In particular, the minister noted that he was supportive of a sectoral approach to industry policy. He suggested that it was appropriate that government look at the impediments facing different sectors of industry and develop individual strategies to overcome them. The minister even went so far as to nominate 13 sectors, namely: agrifood, construction, petrochemicals, marine, light metals, renewable energy, forest products, aviation, music and audio visual, telecommunications and information technology, environmental, health services, and pharmaceutical industries....· . Industry generally endorsed this approach. It recognised that some of the issues facing the food processing sector, such as labelling and market access, are different from those facing the· telecommunications industry. Businesses in the construction industry face a different set of circumstances again. The previous minister also flagged some quite considerable spending initiatives. He put a figure of around $200 million on proposals to be contained in the statement. The former minister also suggested that a stick and carrot approach be adopted to ensure that superannuation funds. invest more of their money in· small business. The new Minister for Industry, Technology and· Regional Development, Senator Peter Cook, has poured cold water on most of the plans of his predecessor. In fact, he has gone even further by distancing himself from. the policies of his predecessor and hosing down the expectations of business. According to the Australian Financial Review, Senator Cook told a recent meeting that 'he had scrapped the almost-completed industry statement of his predecessor, Mr Alan Griffiths'. In a very clear warning to business, Senator Cook said on the night of his swearing in that 'the era a of the hand-out mentality is dead'. Reports of his address to a recent meeting of small business organisations confirm this. These reports suggest that the minister has abandoned his predecessor's sectoral approach. The Australian newspaper reported on 17 February that Senator Cook had told the meeting that he 'was not a fan of sectoral planning'. The article went on to say: Sources at the meeting said Senator Cook made it clear he did not support sectoral plans for his industry statement. This is seen as a clear rejection of the framework of Mr Griffiths for 13 industry development plans to tackle specific impediments to growth and to offer targeted assistance. The Financial Review reported similar comments, again quoting Senator Cook as saying, 'I am not a fan of sectoral planning'. In the same address Senator Cook scotched all reports that the statement would cost $200 miIIion. According to reports, he told the meeting he would be 'very surprised if the statement costs anywhere near the $200 miIIion figure floated in the media'. I understand the minister went on to say that he believed the statement should be judged on its contents, not its cost. Senator Cook has also distanced himself from the former minister's plan to encourage superannuation funds to invest in small business. Instead he favours a revamp of the failed pooled development funds. Now that most of the initiatives which were sought by industry have been disregarded, it is prudent to ask just what industry can expect from the forthcoming statement. As I suggested earlier, industry can be expected, in my view, to be disappointed. I believe the statement will· be. full of platitudes and motherhood. It will be lacking in the· real initiatives needed by industry. Micro reform, which has been proven by the KPMG survey to be critical to industry, is likely to be referred to, but it is also likely to be flickpassed to the state and local governments to take care of. Senator Cook is on record as sayingthat he believes that the Commonwealth has a role in micro-reform, but that role is primarily to with the real implementation at the state and local' government level. Labour market reform and labour on-costs are unlikely to even rate a mention. We can expect' some comments and ,proposals to assist manufacturers and small businesses who want to export. Specifically, we can anticipate proposals to further encourage benchmarking and' world best practice. This is a very good thing and should be welcomed. Benchmarking and meeting world best practice are important elements in making our firms internationally competitive. But they are all useless if our firms are rendered uncompetitive because of high taxes and charges, low productivity and high labour on-costs. These are the real issues which must be addressed by the government. Apart from the lack of real reform in the statement, my concern is that it will soften up industry for tax increases to be announced in the May budget. I am concerned that any benefits given in the statement will be taken a}Vay in the budget. ' Honourable members on both sides will be aware that the Minister for Finance { Mr Beazley) and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) have both failed to rule out a budget increase in business taxes. I cannot emphasise enough the detrimental impact which this would have on industry, especially manufacturers who are moving into export markets. Australian industry's competitiveness is fragile enough as it is. Any extra costs would be devastating, not only to exporters but to our domestic firms' ability and wiIIingness to invest and create jobs. In closing; 1 would like to reiterate my chall-nge to the government to' deliver a genuine industry statement-one which addresses - the real issues of concern to business and which proposes viable solutions. The challenge for government is to avoid the approach of the past which has seen it deliver statements which promise much but deliver little. Australian industry. especially with regard to our manufacturers, has great potential. The government now has the opportunity to enable them to realise that potential. My plea is that this opportunity not go to waste.",50
52,Ms HENZELL,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Capricornia) (1.32 p.m.)lead I am pleased to support the passage of the Industry, Technology and Regional Development Legislation Amendment Bill through the House and to support the comments of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Lindsay). This amendment bill is an omnibus bill which provides a range of administrative amendments to the Patents Act 1990, the Trade Marks Act 1955 and the Designs Act 1906. It is interesting that government is continually having to review legislation that has, been on the books and can build up and often create difficulties. I am sure everyone would agree that we have moved a long way since 1906. One of the things that this government is doing is continually sorting out some of these old acts and revisiting them to get them right up to date. The delegation of statutory functions is a major part of this bill, as has been mentioned. The Australian Industrial Property Organisation is a division of the Department of Industry, Technology and Regional Development. The Director-General of the Australian Industrial Property Organisation has control over statutory functions in the role of commissioner of patents, registrar of-trademarks and registrar of designs. To enable the directorgeneral to place greater emphasis on his management responsibilities, the bill amends the above acts to delegate the directorgeneral's statutory functions to be carried out by the head of each of the relevant offices. This will enable the director-general to concentrate on the overall financial and general management of the Australian Industrial Property Organisation. I think it is important that we consider this revamping of the Australian Industrial Property Organisation, be"" cause it is in line with the sort of structure refonnthatthis government is makingin the public s-ctor. The initiatives in reforming a number of organisations into the revamped Australian IndustrialProperty Organisation were to deal with the following issues. Firstly, the policies and structures needed to adapt more flexibly to customer demands, as well as meet the objectives of the government's industrial property program. Secondly, there needed to be financial. structures that would not only impose disciplines but also allow greater operational freedom. Thirdly, there needed to . be an organisational culture that would change attitudes and outlook, to meet the chall-nges of a more commercially orientated organisation-which is, of course, what the government has required of AIPO. These changes were to include the devolution of responsibilities; greater acceptance of risk management principles; great-r alignment between respoJisibilityand accountability and, therefore, a focus on performance; a management approach that would give greater emphasis to commercial considerations and a results orientated ethos; and a clearer corporate identity. These structural changes will position the Australian Industrial Property Organisation to provide better value 'for money' in delivering its services. This has been necessary because of the requirement that AIPO operate under a fulLcost recovery regime which was instituted in 1986. Sothegovernment is requiring of its own organisations what it obviously would encourage business to do. It creates a clear link between what AIPO does and what it earns. It promotes a greater focus on the revenue side of the business and provides incentives for AIPO to better exploit the assets at its disposal. So here we have a reform of an important government sector. There are several other administrative matters contained in this. bill. One is the extension of eligibility as a convention country. The current patent, trademark and design legislation recognises a right of priority for convention' applications. These are applications made in countries which are signatory to international conventions dealing with the protection of industrial property. This priority enables an application for a patent, trademark or design in a convention country to be treated as if it had been lodged· in Australia on the saine day. The amendment to the Designs Act and the Trade Marks Act enables regulations to be made which declare a country to be a convention country, where a bilateral agreement has been entered into concerning the protection of industrial property rights. This would bring these acts into - line with the Patents Act, which already makes provision for these purposes. It, should be said that these acts help Australia obtain international credibility. They form the legislative basis of Australia's national property system-a system which is a crucial factor in our nation's economic prosperity and growth. .Another item in this bill is the correction of entries on the register of designs. This is an amendment which streamlines the administrative process and gives it greater practicality. Rather than needing someone to reapply . to correct an obvious clerical error or mistake, this amendment enables the registrar of designs to correct an· entry in the register for the purpose of correcting that clerical error or mistake. Patent and design laws encourage technological advancement and stimulate industrial development. The federal government has a two-stage policy to encourage business expenditure on research and development. Firstly, the 150 per cent tax concession for research and development is now a permanent feature of the taxation system. We have already seen the success of this tax incentive, with over $2 billion every year being spent by business on research and development. In real terms, it represents almost a doubling of business investment in research and development over the past decade. This has been an area where business in this country has been rather lax in the past, and whatever we can do to encourage research onto' the agenda of business is not only going to be in the inter'ests of those businesses, making them more competitive and more successful, but it is also going. to make. our export initiatives more successful. Secondly, under the industry innovation program, direct grants to firms are·a further feature of the government's approach to encouraging research and development expansion.' This program enables grants to be made to small and medium enterprises to give them a chance to develop their capacity to undertake technological innovation, and wasreferred to by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development in his opening remarks. In 1994-95, the program will allow for approximately $40 million in grants to small to medium enterprises, so this is a very important initiative for those businesses small to really benefit from the 150 per cent tax assistance scheme. I want to refer a little more to the industry innovation program. The lIP provides direct support for industrial R&D and associated activities. It· supports aU the key areas of industry activity in which the Department of Industry, Technology and Regional Development has an interest. The grants elements are brought together to improve dient access to available assistance and they involve introducing better articulated and more market focused eligibility and merit criteria, streamlining application process, making decisions more transparent and providing improved client feedback. . These types of initiatives are very important when we look at regional development, because one of the issues for businesses· in regional areas of Australia is that they· feel rather remote from information about the initiatives that are available to assist do business better. If they have difficulties in communicating with different areas of government, they usually give up because it is too difficult and too time consuming, as they are focused on the day-today operations of running their business and trying to make it effective. One of the issues that we do need to look at is providing effective opportunities .to make sure that· business enterprises in regional Australia have quick and easy access to those issues. One of the innovations that have been developed in the Commonwealth Department of Primary Industries and Energy is the idea of the one-stop shop. . As we look towards our industry paper and our white paper on employment and the response to the Kelty task force, one of the issues we do need to focus on is providing much more effective access to information. This does not necessarily mean a vast expansion of bureaucracy; in fact, I think that is not the way this government is operating. It means providing for facilities in regional areas where small business and local government can have coordinated access to information about industry programs, programs that will assist them to invest in their businesses, to obtain more effective information on export that are too opportunities. The honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser) made mention of labour on-costs. I believe there are many other issues that impact on small business. Recently in Rockhampton I and the local tourism and development organisation, the Capricorn Tourism Development Organisation, developed a seminar to allow business and other community organisations to provide some feedback on the government's green paper. It was disappointing that very few business organisations chose to avail themselves of that opportunity, the because one of the things this government has done is consult, and all the reports that I referred to earlier have been the result of extensive nationwide consultation. As a result of this apparent lack of interest, I sent out a short check list to 300 business organisations in the Rockhampton area and was delighted to get a very positive response. I had simply asked them to fax back the check list so that it was not a time consuming issue. As I said, them to time is money in small business. I will run through that check list. While it certainly does not claim to be a representative surveyor provide sophisticated sampling techniques, it was an opportunity to get some feedback from business. I was interested in some of the responses, which will find their way .back irit9 the response to the green paper. About 50 people responded out of 300, which I thought was a pretty good response rate. . My firstquesfion related to the putting on of new staff-that is, about developing and expanding new business-and whether access to credit was a factor in their decision to put on new staff. The majority said no, which surprised .me. . As for concern about the strength of the economic recovery, we got about a fifty-fifty response. Concerning evidence of a pick-up in demand for the goods and services of their business, once again there was a fifty-fifty response. Information about improvement of profit margins in other businesses in the region did not seem to be a concern. The cost of hiring new staff was indeed expressed as a concern. On issues such as superannuation contributions we got a fifty-fifty response. There is certainly concern about award wage levels, but we would expect that to .be the case. On fringe benefits tax-s, et cetera, there was a fifty-fifty response. On the issue of penalty rates there was a majority response indicating that that was a factor, and we can understand that in a small to . medium sized business. Interestingly enough, there was no definitive response on the subject of government red tape and they wert-able to differentiate between local, state and federal governments; in fact, federal government red tape was not seen as an issue. Information about training initiatives and social security assistance did not seem to be a problem but there was some concern about the effectiveness and the. helpfulness of the CES, and particularly the attitude of prospective employees was seen as an issue. So across a range of issues I do not believe we can say that small business has aparticular view, but as a government we need to be out there consulting with them. I suggest that one of the most effective ways we can do this is to have a unit. or a task force that moves from the centre of policy. development in either Canberra or Brisbane and regularly goes out to the regions providing I want to refer to an innovation in the Central Queensland area, the international business exchange organisation of Central Queensland, which is the idea of our University of Central Queensland vice-chancellor, the very proactive Jeff Wilson. That organisation has been supported very favourably by the state Department of Business, Industry and Regional Development. . The aim of this organisation is to bring export information to businesses in Central Queensland. Towards the end of last year a very successful seminar was held on the Capricorn coast where a number of trade speCialists were able to talk to business organisations, large and small, from the Central Queensland area about the fantastic development opportunities that exist in the Asia-Pacific region. After getting some information from the university this morning I am pleased to say that next week in Rockhampton this organisation will, be hosting two speakers from Austrade, the commissioner for the South Pacific region' and the Queensland commissioner. Austrade has also been very supportive of the initiative and it is this sort of organisation that. I would hope that our government will pe providing more effective support for. It is getting together those people in the regions who have involvement in research and development, in business, and who are focused on value adding for export potential, that will really 11lake our regions take. off. There are many proposals that are coming forward into the government's white paper, the industry statement, and in response to the Kelty task force. I believe that the Minister for Trade (Senator MCMullan) will be, very much across the issues that are of concern to the hOl-ourable member for Forrest. . One of the most effective aspects of this government's track record, apart from its vision and its innovation, is its ability to bring together these differing strands. This government is able to develop creative and innovative solutions to the sorts .ofdifficulties that face us as we pick up on the upswing in the economic cycle and continue to improve our position as ,a competitive trading partner ,in infoTn?ation.. the Asia-Pacific region. The National Industry Extension Service is just one of the very important initiatives' of the Depaitment of Industry, Technology and Regional Developinent. I would like to remind honourable members just what those programs are doing. We caililotjust be negative about what the oncosts ate. We have to help businesses become more effective, more . cost efficient in their own terms, and we have to help. in providing them with· managerial expertise. One problem in the regional areas of Australia is access to new ideas for industry .management to make those businesses, from their own point. of view, mOre efficient. NIBS is very effective in helping to promote business plans and in making sure that businesses are using their most effective resource-their· work force-effectively and efficiently. The government is conscious of the concerns raised by the' opposition but, more importantly, at a policy level it is making the changes that are outlined in some of the technical amendments to these bills to make Australian industry more competitive, more export oriented, so that we very effectively take our place in the Asia-Pacific region.",56
53,Dr KEMP,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The Industry, Technology and Regional Development .Legislation Amendmen! Bill seeks to make a number of uncontentious amendments to existing legislation administered within industry, technology and regional development portfolio. As my colleague the shadow minister for manufacturing and service industries, the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser), has already dealt with the proposed amendments to the Designs Act· 1906, the Patents Act 1990 and' the Trade Marks Act 1955, I shall confine my comments to the part of the bill dealing with the Industry Research and Development Act 1986. In that context, I think it appropriate to examine the links between the programs affected by this bill and industry policy generally. In addition, the government's forthcoming industry statement has an important part to play in enhancing Australia's technological effort, and it also warrants some comment. The amendment to the Industry Research and Development Act 1986 extends the competitive grants schemes of the industry innovation program by 18 months, from 30 June 1994 to 31 December 1995. The primary objediveof the industry innovation program is to encourage private sector investment in research and development, and innovative activity generally. That program is designed to facilitate market driven innovation, leading. to the successful commercialisation of new products, services, processes and systems. Administered by the Industry Research and Development Board, the major financial component of the industry innovation program is the 150 per cent tax concession for research and development. This program was described by a recent Bureau of Industry Economics report as 'the major program' aimed at encouraging technological innovation in Australia. The conces,. sion was introduced in 1985, and the coalition supports it. The range of competitive grants that make up the other part of the industry innovation program, such as the discretionary and generic technology grants dealt with by this particular amendment, are in place as complements to the tax concession. Formerly known collectively as the grants for industry research and development,or GIRD scheme, these grants aim to provide the initial impetus 'toward creating a competitive advantage for relatively the small, technology based companies'. The continuation of the industry innovation program arising· from this amendment will involve provision for new projects in 1994-95 up to a value of $40 million, while a further $20 million will be available in the first half of 1995-96. In today's global market, a strong investment in sCience, technology and innovative practices generally is a principal means by which Austnilia can secure competitive advantage. Given the strong investment in technology by our main international competitors, such investment by Australia is essential to avoid competitive disadvantage and our slipping further behind. Acountry that recognisesthis must have a national strategy to maximise its capacity in these critical areas, underpinning future industrial development. Unfortunately, despite the rhetoric mouthed by the government, such a strategy is conspicuously absent. Time and again we have seen the fruits of Australia's excellent efforts in scientific research and technological development leave our shores to be profitably developed overseas. There is a widespread disillusionment about the limited opportunities available for Australia's youngest and brightest scientists and technologists., The brain drain has seen many of our top minds pursue their careers in other countries because of the uncertain future offered at home. ,During the past decade, Australia has remained firmly stuck somewhere near the bottom of the OECD ladder in terms of its industry effort in research and development. In fact, the Bureau of Industry Economics report, to which I referred earlier, found that even with the recent lift in business expenditure on research and development, Australia has languished at 17th out of 24 OECD countries in this area since the mid-1980s. Entitled R&D, innovation and competitiveness, the report of. the Bureau of Industry Economic- highlights. the limited impact the 150 .per cent tax concession is having on improving our performance in technological development. According to the report, since its inception the tax concession 'has not increased the stock of consistent R&D performers'. The report states that any increase in business expenditure on research and development 'has thus only allowed Australia to maintain its relative (low) ranking'. It points out that only 1,000 out of 500,000 or more Australian companies are consistent R&D performers. Importantly, it also notes that the majority of private sector R&D is concentrated in relatively large firms across only a: small number of industries, such as computer software, mining, telecommunications and pharmaceuticals. While there has been. some change in this trend in more recent. times, with small and medium sized enterprises increasing their R&D effort, again this increase has taken place only in a few industries.· For example, the report states that rapid growth in R&D expenditure in computer software accounts for nearly 40 per cent of overall growth in business R&D between 1984-85 and 1990-91. Given the critical link between innovation and the economic growth of nations, Australia's relatively low and narrow effort in this regard is· cause for considerable concern. The story is even grimmer when read from the South-East Asian and east Asianperspective. According to the first UNESCO world science report released just last month, countries such as Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea .have overtaken Australia in their technological effort. Development of their own ideas and those·· of other people has become a way of life for our chief competitors in the region. The UNESCO report states: Comparisons with the newly industrialised countries cause Australia's R&D to be seen as inadequate for sustaining economic development or increasing international competitiveness. Australia's private industrial R&D is still considered too low. Australia's manufacturing sector has had one of the lowest comparative levels of growth in the OECD in the past 15 years, despite recent growth in exports of elaborately transformed manufactures. This growth has been off a very low base. Asa merchandise exporter, Australia fell from 18th in 1980 to 22nd in 1990. Our export performance still remains far below that· required to correct the alarming foreign debt. Yesterday'S balance of payments showing a $1.26 billion deficit is a timely reminder that as a nation we are still living beyond our means on a grand scale. Our relative decline as a· world trading nation highlights the fact that under this government , we remain uncompetitive in too many areas. The background paper on micro-economic reform, released by the Economic Planning Advisory Council late last week, shows just how uncompetitive we really are. The paper, Economic· effects of micro-economic reform, outlines the enormous benefits in terms of economic growth, improved living standards and employment· generation that could be gained through a comprehensive program of further micro-economic reform. It identifies reforms to the labour market and in transportation and communications, improving the delivery of government services, and moving to world best practice in the manufacturing area as key areas for potential gain, and concludes that reform could raise output by over 15 per cent in the long term and. help generate the rates of growth required to reduce unemployment to five per cent by 2001. Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to continue. my remarks at a later time. Leave granted; debate adjourned. NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY: NA",60
54,Mr KERR,BOMBING,"Denison-Minister for Justice).,-I seek leave to make a statement regarding the attack on the Adelaide office of the NationalCrime Authority this morning. Leave granted.",61
55,Mr KERR,BOMBING,"At about 9.15 this morning an explosion occurred at the premises occupied by the National Crime Authority in Waymouth Street, Adelaide. At this stage it is understood that the bombing occurred when a parcel received at the authority's office exploded. The South Australian Police SerVice has instituted a major investigation into the incident. . My most recent advice is that two people have been killed and four others injured as a result of the incident. I am not yet in a position to release the names of those who have been the victims of this attack. I am, howe:ver, advised that one of the deceased was a Western Australian police officer performing duties with the authority. I extend the government's deepest sympathy and condolences to those injured, and to the families of the others who lost their lives in the explosion. Australia has been fortunate in the past to have been the subject of such violence against our national .law enforcement agencies. Violence of .this kind is un-Australian, alien to our way of life and utterly to be condemned. I am sure members from 'both sides of the House share my horror and sadness at this incident. This morning I spoke to the Chairman of the National Crime Authority, Mr Tom Sherman, who assured me that security checks were being conducted'on all National Crime Authority offices. I have also spoken to the South Australian Minister for' Emergency Services, who assured me of the fullest cooperation of the South Australian police. Assistant Commissioner John Beck is in command of the investigation. I assure the House that the resolve of the National Crime Authority and the government to fight organised crime will not be affected by this incident. We will not be intimidated.",62
56,Dr HEWSON,BOMBING,"::-by leave- Mr Deputy Speaker, with your indulgence, I would like to make a few remarks in response to the statement made by the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr). The opposition joins unreservedly with the government in condemning the bombing outrage that occurred today at the offices of the National Crime Authority in' Adelaide. The act was a contemptible crime against innocent people. who were carrying out very important duties on behalf of the Australian public. The loss of life and serious injury which this bombing' has' caused bring grief and suffering to the families and friends of those who are directly affected by 'it; and to them we extend our deepest sympathy; But the shock and the revulsion against this crime will extend right throughout the' Australian community. This act of terror against innocent people is an appalling violation of our Australian way of life, and we condemn. it Jor the outrage that it is. We hope that those responsible for this shocking crime are brought to justice as soon not as possible and that every step'is taken to ensure that such a crime cannot be repeated against fellow Australians. Mr Deputy Speaker, we look forward to being kept fully informed by the Minister for Justice as the investigation of this crime continues; and,. of course, we pledge our full support in making sure that those who are responsible for this crime are brought to justice. . NA NA NA 1994· , Second Reading Debate resumed.",62
57,Dr KEMP,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Until the government grasps the nettle, Australia will continue to lose jobs and industries overseas. Australian business will contin,ue to be hobbled in its effort to introduce innovative practices that will lead to increased international competitiveness and generate growth in exports. The opportunities for coming generations of Australians will further erode. As I have said, . the forthcoming' industry statement provides yet another opportunity for the government to take up the reins. . Until now, there has been very little to indicate that any sort of comprehensive science and technology policy will form part of the industry statement. The new Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Senator Cook) has had his hands full in trying torejig the document left to him by his predecessor, the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Griffiths). He has obviously not been pleased or satisfied with what he has already found in place. The attitude of the Minister for Science and Small Business (Senator Schacht) is already well known. This is the minister who, upon his appointment, decided that the· best thing to. do for Australian science was to break up the CSIRO. Senator Schacht has admitted that he finds meetings with scientists a bit boring. Although he has stumbled from one debacle to the next. and although he has failed to generate any great enthusiasm for matters scientific within his own government, and apparently none at all within his leader, Senator Schacht. survives. After all, as a key numbers man and mate of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), he is a member of the inner sanctum. It seems that, as the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly) with the sports rorts affair, Senator Schacht's tenure is supported by a maxim of the New South Wales Right: that party politics takes priority over good policy. Of course, the need to improve our effort in relation to research and development is only one element of the strategy that is required to create an innovative culture. Innovation should be defined in the widest possible sense as the successful exploitation of new ideas. As the Business Council of Australia's innovationstudy commission recently pointed out, innovation is more than just science, invention and technology. It is a total· process-a process that is about people and enterprises, about leadership and customer demand. It is also a process that can mean different things to different companies. For example, in the food industry, innovative forms of packaging and processing are important. In the clothing and footwear· industry,· the design of new fashions is an important part of innovation. The report was highly critical of the government's failure to push ahead with effective reform in the workplace which would ensure that Australian companies have the flexibility to respond to market. opportunities. The report identified this as· one of the major impediments to improved innovative business practices in Australia. The most important conclusion from all this is that, whatever form innovation takes, it is absolutely vital if Australia is to become more internationally competitive. We must strive to create a more innovative culture by removing the impediments to business investment in R&D, such as restrictive labour market practices, by stimulating demand for scientific, industrial and engineering skills, by encouraging greater links between the research providers and the research users and by promoting science and technology in our schools-the breeding grounds for the decision makers of tomorrow. In an article in the Weekend Australian last week, I said that the primary task of national leadership today is to· articulate a vision of Australia that builds on our outstanding capacity in science and technology, and on a highly enterprising national character. The national strategy that is required to fulfil this vision must first of all foster excellence in education. It is simply unacceptable that 25 per cent of young Australians leaving primary school have inadequate literacy or numeracy skills, as a bipartisan committee of this House found last year. Curricula need to focus on the development of key knowledge and skills and avoid the problems that led the Australian Academy of, Science to condemn the draft science profile for 'downgrading scientific knowledge and skills' and for pursuing 'social and political agendas'. The highly centralised university sector created under the government's unified national system has seen uniformity gradually replace diversity. This is not the answer, nor is the excessive bureaucracy of the so-called national training agenda. A national strategy would also need to face up· to 'the serious shortcomings in equipment, libraries, space, technical support and general infrastructure in universities', identified by the government's own national board of employment, education and training with little subsequent impact on policy. Instead of the disruptive, politically motiexport vated attacks on the CSIRO that have been a feature of the Keating government's period in office, a national· strategy for science and technology would spell out in clear terms the roles of the main research institutions in basic, strategic and applied rese-rch. It would provide the framework of policy and funding certainty so essential to the scientific entertion prise. In this context, I would like to draw the attention of honourable members in this place to the funding crisis currently looming within the CSIRO. This is the last financial year of the CSIRO'scurrent funding .triennium and the government has as yet failed to give any indication of funding levels for the next years. Faced with a potential $50 million annual reduction in funding, the CSIRO is understandably greatly concerned about the future of many of its key scientific programs. The threat to some 600 research staff is also very real. That such a situation has been allowed to drag on for so long, effectively leaving the CSIRO suspended in a state of funding limbo, is indicative of this government's attitude towards and neglect of science and technology. Australia has great areas of strength and potential on which a national reputation for quality and excellence can be built in our region. These areas include communications technology, food processing, land care and environmental management, scientific instruments, gene technology, medical and pharmaceuticals, education and training. We need a national policy framework that will help us to maximise this potential instead of one that impedes and hinders it at every turn, as is currently the case. Some of the most important. matters that should be addressed by this national strategy are cultural. The status of engineering and science as careers must be lifted. Business should be .encouraged to see the value of expertise in these areas at senior managerial and board levels. An export culture needs to be more vigorously promoted. The success of the mining and farming sectors notwithstanding, approximately 80 per cent of Australian manufacturers either have no export sales or less than one-tenth of total sales. Much broader awareness is required also of the cultures of the countries hi our region and their attitudes to business. The greater the delay in implementing such a national strategy, the faster Australia will plunge towards national· mediocrity. In the chilling words of the Business Council of Australia's InnovaStudy Commission, 'Nations that do not nurture innovating enterprises suffer incalculable economic cQsts'. The amendment to the Industry Research and Development Act 1986 before the House this afternoon .deals with changes to the discretionary and generic technology grants schemes. The discretionary grants scheme is three designed to support company based commercial R&D for enterprises unable to benefit from the tax concession, while the generic technology grants scheme provides for the development of new or emerging technologies of strategic importance to industry competitiveness. New program management arrangements were introduced to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of these grants schemes in February-March 1993. This involved the development of a revised decision framework and the restructuring of the board's granting committees to better reflect an industry focus. Both these grants schemes were the subject of independent reviews during 1992-93. First, there was a Price Waterhouse study aimed.at identifying the benefits gained by individual grant recipients and wider social and community benefits. Based on a small random sample of grant applicants, successful and unsuccessful, this study found that increased sales were derived particularly from the discretionary grants, while wider benefits such as improved R&D management skills, enhanced linkages between researchers and firms and improved product quality resulted from both schemes. The Bureau of Industry Economics report on the 150 percent tax concession also evaluated other elements ·of the industry innovation program, including these grants schemes. While holding some reservations about both schemes, mainly due to gaps in their ability to fully complement the conceshear sion and some overlap with other programs, the BIE was largely supportive. It did, howone ever, recommend a broadening of the discre-tionary grant scheme allowing other categodrawing ries of companies to be eligible and an invesindustry. tigation of the low application rate for scheme by tax loss companies. The survey· of Australian manufacturing firms conducted by KPMG Peat Marwick, body. however, found that increased spending research and development is urgently required if innovation· and new ideas are to flourish. The impact of current schemes, while positive,seems slight when viewed context. In fact, more than 50 per cent of the companies surveyed had never used grants for hear you say that. industry R&D and, of those that had, a majority apparently found them of little or benefit. In September 1993, the Industry Commisthe sion commenced an inquiry into research development undertaken by industry. This commission will examine the effect of R&D have activities on innovation and, as part of inquiry, the effectiveness .of the industry innovation program. Given that the commishappen. sionis to report by mid-1985, this legislation merely extends the duration of the grants to accommodate the findings of the inquiry. (Time expired)",62
58,Dr THEOPHANOUS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Calwell-Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Human Services and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health) (2.16 p.m.)-I am very happy to support the Industry, Technology and Regional Development Legislation Amendment Bill and the amendments. I commend the work of the Minister for Indusgo try, Technology and RegionaL Development (Senator Cook) and the Parliamentary Secrenow tary to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Lindsay) in putting this. forward for our. consideration. In .the debate on this bill we have had wide ranging discussion of·industry policy.. will begin by commenting briefly on the .extraordinary remarks of the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp). It is very interesting to the honourable member for Goldstein talking about industry policy when he was of the intellectual fathers of the new right movement that was in, favour of totally with. government assistance from all That was one of the key planks of the the new right policy. He spent the last 10 minutes or so talking about the. CSIRO, which was a very important government funded r remind the Hous.e that it is not very on long ago that the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran) was shadow minister in this area. Do honourable members know what he proposed? He proposed to in the broader abolish the CSIRO. Dr Kemp-That is a lie. I am surprised to '",65
59,Dr THEOPHANOUS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,That was proposed no by the opposition some years ago. The opposition decides to come in here and criticise government about the performance of the and CSIRO when the macro picture on industry development is that the government should as little to do with it as possible and that the the market mechanisms should be allowed to operaie-andwhatever may happen will ' Dr Kemp-:-Because of your ideological blinkers.,65
60,Dr THEOPHANOUS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Oh no, this is the ideology of the honourable member for Goldstein. With respect, this is his ideology. He' knows what I am talking about, because he has lectured at universities about it. But now that 'it is a bit unfashionable and unpopular he wants to run away from it. Dr Kemp-That is also untrue. Dr THEOPHANOUSOh, it is not unfashionable. The honourable member should and have. a look at what is happening around the world and see how many countries follow the prescriptions that he has put forward in his university lectures. The reality, however, is that the opposition not only did not want to have any sensible program of goa vernment involvement· in industry developI ment but, in addition to that-,-and this is the thing-it advocated zero tariffs in all industries. That was what it put forward in Fightback. This group says that the government's performance in industry is not really good enough, but when it comes to any concrete solution, what do we get? Waffle. The reason we get waffle is that the opposition has no ideas in the area of industry development. The two shadow ministers, the honourable member for Goldstein and the honourable member for  edges but they put forward no ideas on industry development. That is the situation on industry development in this country. We are aware· that. the opposition opposes virtually every major initiative that we put forward on industry development. Mr Lindsay-They are running for cover.",65
61,Dr THEOPHANOUS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I can see that they are running for cover. The basic reality is that we have put into place, for example, the 150 per cent tax concession for research and development-a very important measure. Although it was initially put forward on a trial basis, it is now virtually a permanent feature of the taxation system in Australia, so that companies can actually plan in terms of research and development proposals. Then we have the industry innovation program, which is another aspect of this bill. Under that program $40 million in 1994-95 and $20 million in 1995-96 will be spent, and it is orientated towards smalland mediumsized firms, for their participation in research and development and in industrial production, to get them up to scratch so that they can really participate in a competitive way. So this development policy is a very important aspect of the government's continuing commitment to iridustrypolicy. Let us look· at what the government has done in the past couple of years in the area of promotion of industry and business in general, vis-a-vis what the opposition was talking about. When the One Nation statement came out, honourable members opposite opposed it.  without trace. It has gone. Where did it go?",66
62,Dr THEOPHANOUS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"'-Here we have the economic genius telling us that it has sunk without a trace. He thinks the economic recovery that we have at the moment came out of nowhere. He does not think that the spending of the $3.billion of the One Nation statement and all the money of the Investing in the Nation statement had any effect on industry development and economic recovery. These are the· economic geniuses that the opposition brings forward. What a lot of nonsense. I can tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the opposition did not want these measures. The Leader of the Opposition at the time said that the One Nation statement was irresponsible. . If there was any problem with the One Nation statement, it was that it erred on the side of being a bit conservative. The $3 billion was considered by some not to be enough, in terms of getting us out of the recession.· It was not as though the $3 billion was. unnecessary. In fact, it was very necessary and a lot of that money was spent to assist business and industry development. If we take the One Nation statement and the Investing in the nation statement, and look at revenue forgone and at actual e;xpenditure, it will be seen that the total amount spent in that period was $3,790 million. . That is real money invested in Australian industry-not the nonsense and ideological claptrap that we get from the opposition. It is actual, real commitment, and without that sort of commitment we would not have the level of industrial development that we are getting at the moment. Let me explain. The $3,790 million consisted of $730 million gross for general investment allowance; $1,690 million net for corporate. tax rate reduction; $110 in ill ion gross for the lOper cent development allowance; $1,105 million gross for accelerated depreciation in equipment and incomeproducing buildings; and $145 million for infrastructure bonds. Mr Lindsay-That's real money.",66
63,Dr THEOPHANOUS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"That is real commitment, in contrast to the approach of the opposition, which did not even want us to spend this money. Honourable members opposite said it was unnecessary-in the middle of a recession. Now they try to give us lectures about what should be happening. The shadow minister, the honourable member for Forrest, has not come up with a single idea so far. We are still waiting to hear from him. He talked about how he is going to be looking at our industry policy, but where is the opposition's policy? Those opposite have not ,come up with anything. It is nearly a now since they lost government ment.",66
64,Dr THEOPHANOUS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Since they lost the election. They still have no idea about what they are going to be putting forward, except that they have disowned different parts of the Fightback package. We cannot quite follow which parts they have disowned. We still do not know exactly where they are at, because we do not know which shadow minister to believe in terms of which part has been disowned and which has not been disowned. Mr Lindsay-Ask Bronwyn.",67
65,Dr THEOPHANOUS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The parliamentary secretary tempts me, but I will not get onto that topic. I am tempted to talk about Mrs Bishop, but I will .leave that for another occasion. The industry package that is coming in the budget is a' very important aspect of this budget and a very important aspeCt of our strategy. Do you notice the difference, Mr Deputy. Speaker? We did not rest on our laurels after expending that money in industry development, we have said, 'Okay, that has been done, but more needs to be done'. So we initiated the idea, through the former Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development.the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Griffiths), of a further' industry statement in the budget context to come together with the response to the green paper and the response to the Kelty paper on regional 'development and other significant policy developments. In fact, there are more policy issues coming into this federal budget than at any time since we have been in government. It is a massive amount of policy development coming together in this year's budget. From the opposition all we have had, as I have is a few platitudes, a bit of waffle and the regurgitation of the New Right philosophy. What we really need is actual concrete suggestions in the area of industry development, and we are not getting them from the oppositipn. In terms of development, all of the ideas are coming from the Labor Party, from the different committees of the party, the year union movement and others associated with the party. We are getting ideas from sections of industry, but we are getting absolutely nothing from the federal opposition when it comes to serious suggestions' on industry development In this package we will be looking at a number of key issues. Let me explain some of them. One issue that has been raised is the question of whether there ought to be' further industry plans or sectoral arrangements. This is a very important matter. The plans and arrangements that we put in place over the years have worked: the steel plan, the car plan-even the TCF plan, which had some difficulties at the beginning, is now working, particularly in the area of processing of raw materials such as wool and cotton to go into our industries. So we have some development in industry with those plans. What is necessary is to think about other sectors where we might develop sectoral plans. Some that have been suggested are, for example, the area of waste management and cleaner modes of production; the areas of renewable energy, in which we are quite good; the area of eco-tourism; the area of processing of raw materials,' value-adding to raw materialsMr Lindsay-Clean food.",67
66,Dr THEOPHANOUS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"As the parliamentary secretary says, the area of clean food. We have a number of other areas in which Australia is now participating and competing with the world. One of the areas is the development of electronics industries, especially telecommunications industries. For example, the work done in Australia by Ericsson and other telecommunication companies, is . first-class and rates with the best in the world. We have the potential for further investment. We have said, to do this through a judicious process in which the government discusses with industry what it needs and. how government can SUpPDrt it. We want a judiciDus approachnDt a heavy-handed, interventiDnist apprDach-whereby the gDvernment plays a part by assisting where it can, especially in getting things mDving in the early stages.

67,Mr CHARLES,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I rise tDday to. make a cDntributiDn to. this debate - on the Industry, TechnDIDgy and RegiDnal DevelDpment - LegislatiDn Amendment Bill 1994. This is an Dmnibus bill and from Dur side of the HDuse of Representatives chamber, the shadDw minister fDr manufacturing and service industries, the honourable  dressed in detail a substantial portion of bill .. The remainder of the bill has been addressed by the shadow minister for science, technology and export development, the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp). The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Human Services, the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), who just spoke started his contribution to this, as he put it, wide ranging debate, with an overt attack on the shadow minister for science, technology and export importance. development. He said that the. ;honourable member for Goldstein was a leadillgmember of the new right .and was a proponent of views which said that the federal government should withdraw all government assistance for all industry programs. The parliamentary secretary. not only got it wrong bu.t is so ideologically driven that he cannot. see the forest for the trees. No-one on this side of the suggestedthatthere is no role for government to play in an overall integrated approach towards industry development, job creation andplanning for the Australian economy. this side of the House, the converse view held, minister, parliamentary secretary, whatever. There is, on this side of the House, a substantial number of people with dirt under their fingernails who understand industry in Australia, who understand its requirements, and who know a good industry and who know a bad one. I suggest that the parliamentary secretary might have difficulty defining a good industry. He probably would not know what it looked like if he fell over it. The parliamentary secretary went on to talk about zero tariffs. Zero tariffs were never of the policy platform of the opposition. opposition did say that we took a policy reducing tariffs to a negligible level by year 2000. We did that fora because we offered cost offsets to industry that were far greater than the tariff reductions which would have occurred. That would have meant that industry came out ahead. Industries' costs would have reduced and their selling prices would been reduced because of the reduction in The whole Australian economy would the have benefited. Australian consumers like those people in the gallery would all have benefited from that kind of policy proposal because very simply the cost of the things which they buy which are not made in Australia-which might be but which are notwould have been substantially reduced. That policy is no longer a policy of the opposition but the parliamentary secretary carries on like a two-bob watch· in his normal way of trying tobilild an issue over and above its stated The bill before us today, which contains an extension to the discretionary and generic technology grants scheme, offers some benefits to Australian industry. I am happy to support that extension because I believe that those schemes offer some value to Australian industry. I do, however, condemn the government for the extremely poor marketing of the industry initiatives that are on the governHouse has ever ment's books .. There is no single source, no one-stop shop in any government agency or department in Australia, where a small or medium sized On business can firid out what government is programs are available. That information is or available from my office in Boronia in the electorate of La Trobe. We have a paper that tells people what the government's programs are, but the government cannot tell people. It wants to keep it a secret. Why let industry know? It might take advantage of it, and Australia might benefit therefrom. Today I want to canvass innovation, productivity and culture. Innovation is an important term which to me implies more than just new products. It implies innovative or new part ways of doing all sorts of things, including The management of people, personnel relations, of the way we move goods from one place to the another, how we produce products, and new gObd reason products themselves. The shadow minister for science, technology and export development, the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), who preceded me in this debate, said in an article been which was reproduced in the Weekend Aushave tralian of 26-27 February 1994: The status of engineering and science as careers must be lifted. Businesses should be encouraged to see the value of expertise in these areas managerial and board levels, an export culture needs to grow and a much broader awareness is required of the cultures of the countries in our region and their attitudes to business. A vision based on clearly stated goals for the nation's research and development effort is essential. I applaud the honourable member for Goldstein for taking up, the cause of engineers and scientists. It is, often said that, as a professional engineer, I am biased in favour of engineers. If that is true, then I am happy to accept the barbs. We have a number of problems in Australia, and one of them is tha- too many of our companies are run by bean counters. I have absolutely nothing but praise for accountants and good accounting practice, but if we talk about innovation, an innovative culture and a vision for products and services for tomorrow, then we need people who have some capacity to understand what might be developed, what the community might desire in the way of products and services, and what it is possible for us to sell in the world market arid in other markets, even within our own country. Engineers are very good at that. ' So I support any program which helps raise the status of engineers and scientists in Australia. More of them should be involved in our businesses. Research work done in universities and in the CSIRO should be integrated with research done in the private sector so that we have an expanded research base from which to work. We should take primary research work, move it into the development stage and then actually get to the commerchllisation of the products. , That is one of the big failures that we have ha- in terms of industry policy. Industry policy has concentrated almost entirely on research and development. It has concentrated on ,the development phase. We have not introduced programs to encourage the commercialisation and marketing phases of product development. It takes a long time in generic research and a lot of money to come up with one new idea. The pharmaceutical industry is a good case in point. Not once in the history of this country at senior ha,:e we developed a new chemical entity which has gone on to become a prescription pharmaceutical available from the pharmacist. But we now have discovered a new chemical entity which we believe has every chance of success in curing the flu. Would it not be ' terrific to have a drug that could cure the flu in 48 hours maximum? The generic basic research work for that drug was done by an officer of CSIRO and then shifted to a company called Biota Pharmaceuticals. In conjunction with Glaxo, an international pharmaceutical company with major research and production facilities in Australia, it is now developing that drug and taking it through the clinical trials to prove that it will be safe and effective. If it is successful, this will be the first time that Australia has developed a new chemical entity and taken it through to the production stage. If we are successful, and if Australia manufactures that product, it could mean as much as $1 billion a year in exports out of my electorate, out of the village of Boronia. Would that not be terrific for Australia? Would that not give science and technology, industry policy, a shot in the arm? . These are the kinds of things we need to examine. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Human Services, who preceded me, said that the opposition had no ideas about industry development; all the ideas are from the great Australian Labor Party. I have news for the parliamentary secretary. I have some ideas for him to consider: firstly, deregulate the industrial relations sector in Australian industry; secondly, bring on tax measures that will encourage investment and new productive capacity in Austral-a. Such measures would give business, mdustry and technology some taxation advantage in building new, production lines, in buying new vehicles to transport their equipment, incoming up with technologically ' innovative solutions to moving materials from one place to another and in developing new packaging techniques that can make us competitive in the overall world sense. Then we can accelerate our micro-economic reform. That is a good idea that we talk about constantly. The government pays lip-service to microeconomic reform. At the conference between the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the premiers of the states of Australia last week it was said that it is now intended that the heads of .govemments of both sectors would work together to try to increase the rate of micro-economic reform and would do more about the waterfront, telecommunications, electricity supply and rail and road transport. platform. Let us hope that we do, but it is all too slow and the costs to Australian industry are too high. We can reduce those costs substantially. That is a good plank for the government's industry policy platform. It might be a good idea to encourage engineering and science expansion in terms of business activity. If we had more engineers and they were effectively employed, if we encouraged the universities to train them and we encouraged business to use them effective.ly, we would have more products. That would mean that we would have m,Ore production lines and more jobs for Australia. We would do something about reducing this horrible unemployment queue that we live with· from day to day. Another plank for the government's policy platform might be to develop renewable resource energy potential which is available in Australia. That is an item that I have spoken about in this parliament on more than one occasion and that I.will continue to speak out about. We have a huge potential up in the Kimberleys to develop the tidal energy potential from that region. As the tides go up· and down, we can produce electricity, tum it into hydrogen and bum the hydrogen, which tunis back into water. So we use a resource which is available; it costs us nothing. We need to spend the money only on the capital development. We improve the environment. We build jobs for Australians. We build technology and we teach the world how to do something important. We are number· one. That is important for Australia. Another plank for industry policy to age savings might be tax measures. Earlier today in debate on an income tax bill, the government constantly commented that the only mechanism available to really encourage savings is its superannuation guarantee charge. What a lot of nonsense! We are subtracting productive savings out of Australian society by two methods. We force-feed one sector and that is the government's superannuation charge. At the same time, we do nothing to encourage private savings that can be put into industry development. That is another plank for the industry and technology We might encQuragecommercialisation of new and innovative products. We might do that through government schemes; we might do it through advertising; we might do it by helping industry to learn more about marketing. We did live behind a tariff protective wall for a very long time. We are only now learning what it is like to deal in the world economy and to be a major economic player on the world scene. We are no longer protected by that huge· wall behind which we lived for so mimy years . In order to learn how to deal with. that, we need to learn how to market. That is something we have never ·been very good at, in general, because we have not had to. We assumed that. we had products and, therefore, that other people would buy them. Generally, that was true. They bought our iron ore, coal and wool. We had it and they needed it. But times move on and we now need to be involved in the manufacturing and services sector. We must overtly market to the world what it is that we have to offer. Anything that government industry policy does to encourage marketing development and the expertise of the individuals working in marketing companies is to be absolutely encouraged. There is a range of very innovative companies in my electorate of La Trobe. Very briefly, in the time available to me, I will mention some of them, because I think they are important examples of helping to encourage innovation in Australia. Johnson Tiles has the first continuous ceramic wall-tile kiln in Australia. It has been successfully producing encourtiles and helps to reduce the number of imported tiles. This is called import replacement. This firm is an important part of the overall strategy and runs without industrial relations problems in a happy harmonious environment. I spoke - fore about Glaxo pharmaceuticals and its involvement in the new flu drug. Glaxo's exports in the last few years hi'lVe expanded almost exponentially because it has developed innovative packaging techniques for drugs. The packaging technique involves making little nebules out of plastic and injecting them with the dl'Qg. This is done automatically. The plant runs 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with 12-hour shifts; It is very innovative. In fact, it is leading the world in terms of that packaging technology. It is a very important company for Australia and· for our region. Telspec is an example of a new company which is innovative because of its people. Its people came from Telecom. A similar thing has happened to a number of other. companies. The engineering and scientific knowledge and capability have come from a major Australian involvement. Telspec makes a very interesting product. This is called a line splitter. One pair of copper wires can have four telephone numbers. It is important for remote areas. It is important for Indonesia, Malaysia and, ultimately, it will be important for China. The company is working on a line splitter which will handle 34 telephone lines on one pair of copper wires. It is fantastic technology which is growing at a rapid rate. Mark Sensing is a company which has developed an alternative mechanism or method for manufacturing and producing fax paper. We now compete with the Japanese and the Americans so well that there is a tremendous cost advantage to the Australian product arid that product is being exported, is the technology. That company also makes betting tickets and it is interesting that it makes all the betting tickets for the Hong Kong racecourse frcim.Bayswater in Victoria. It is another interesting and important company doing innovative things. Last year it made a substantial profit and gave the work force the opportunity of either taking fairly substantial wage increases or putting the money into new plant and equipment to mean new jobs, and the work force voted for new jobs. That is an excellent example of work force cooperation. Design 2000, .another company in my electorate, makes high quality telecommunications equipment. This is an increasingly important area in terms of exports, particularly to the· eastern European countries. Other companies are Moldflow, a computer design company which designs a very large proportion of the plastic extrusion moulds used throughout the world by industry; Siemens Industries, which we all know about; and the Dandenong Bulb Farm, which now exports vegetables to Noumea and Tahiti from the Dandenong Ranges in Victoria; (TIme expired)",68
68,Mr LES SCOTT,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The Industry, Technology and Regional Development Legislation Amendment Bill, which is before the House today, is a very important bill. The speeches on it this afternoon have been widerariging, and rightly so. This legislation gives honourable members the opportunity· to speak about the various policies of the government and to wonder what has happened to the opposition's policies.· As the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) rightly mentioned earlier in his speech, the policies that the opposition had in the last election have all disappeared and they do not seem to have been replaced with any other policies. ThaUs not surprising. An important aspect of this bill is the research and development area. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Human Services (Dr Theophanous) made reference to research anddeveJopment in Australia, and he made the point that we were not always all that as good at the end product. Whilst we have been very good. at researching and developing. a whole range of products, we do not· always have the capacity or industry is not prepared to take on the development ofalot of those hew and innovative ideas. For example, CSIRO: has developed many promising ideas - the gene shears is one that I know many honourable members in this place are very weIl aware of-and unfortunately Australian industry did not have the capacity or the wherewithal to take them on. We should take the opportunity when debating bills like this to reflect on some of those things and also to use every opportunity we can to encourage industry to move into some of those areas. This bill makes amendments to the Industry Research and Development Act 1986. The discretionary grants and the generic technologygrants are very innovative things for industry in Australia. They give us the opportunity to encourage small businesses· which cannot take the benefit of the 150 per cent tax concession to actually get some grants to help them develop their markets. Austrade has the ability to help to develop a lot of· those opportunities in the export marketplace. Regional development is a very important aspect of industry development, and I know we can all look at our own electorates to see what is happening in industries at the moment. With the economy turning the way it is, it is only through addressing a lot of those areas in regional Australia that we can ensure that we get more people into employment by assisting regional development and assisting industry in those local areas. There are many people out there, including the .long-term unemployed, who need to get back into the work force as a matter of urgency so that they can start to use their skills again. It is going to be very important for Australia to respond to the green paper in the very near future. Mr Speaker, I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later hour.",72
69,Mr SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Order! It being 3 p.m., the debate is interrupted: In accordance with standing order lOlA, the debate may be resumed at a later hour. The honourable member will have leave to·continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA Courts: Public Interest Immunity",73
70,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Last year I asked 'a question of the Attorney-General but he did not get to answer it; the Prime Minister leapt in and cut him off. That is not going to happen today because the Prime. Minister is not here. The Attorney-General will be aware that courts have repeatedly decided that it .is for the court to determine whether a claim. by a minister of public interest immunity is to be upheld or is to be rejected. Courts at all levels regularly inspect documents in respect of which such a claim is made in order to determine whether the document is immune from production. The question is: has the Attorney-General provided any advice to the Treasurer that parliamentary committees exercising the powers of a house of parliament do not have the right which is exercised every day by courts? Will he table any such advice? If the Attorney-General has not provided any such advice, will he now advise the Treasurer that the Senate print media committee has the power to uphold or reject the claim by the Treasurer for public interest immunity in respect of documents relating to foreign media ownership called for by the committee?",73
71,Mr LAVARCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What the shadow Attorney-General points out is quite correct in terms of the role of courts in determining claims of public interest immunity. Indeed, there have been many decisions on this point. I suppose the most important recent decision I recall is the High Court decisipn in the cabinet notebooks case. In that decision, the High Court recognised the existence of public interest immunity. On that occasion it was accepted to apply to cabinet notebooks but the High .court did reserve to itself the power to examine documents in a particular case and to determine whether a claim for public interest immunity could be established. However, the fundamental weakness in what the shadow Attorney;..General has adv-mced is in equating the role of a committee of this parliamynt, in particular, a Senate committee, with the role of a court. The fundamental difference, which has been well understood in terms of claims of public interest immunity by the executive which have been questioned or challenged by either house of the parliament. or by parliamentary committee and, indeed, which was canvassed at some length in a very detailed document produced by then Attorney-General Ellicott back in 1972, I think, is that a house of this parliament ora parliamentary committee· is not akin to a court. It is nota disinterested party making a dispassionate judgment against competing claims of two parties before it. What essentially is being argued is that the parliamentary committee should be able to get the document in front of it, make a judgment as to whether there should be·a claim for public interest immunity, and decide whether the document then should be given to itself. That is the fundamental difficulty with this issue. It is not easy to compare the situation of a court making a judgment in a case of public interest immunity and the situation asserted by the executive and disputed by a committee of this House. This government has continued to rely on the practice-it has been adopted by governments over many years; as I said, it was speltout in 1972 and followed by the Fraser Government, and it has continued to be followed by this government-that certification by a minister as to the. public interest of a particular document, to be kept confidential should be accepted by a parliamentary committee inquiring into the subject. The honourable member asked me expressly whether I had provided advice to the Treasurer on this point. I have not. The Office of General Counsel has provided advice to the Treasurer on this issue. The advice was given in a solicitor-client relationship, and it is not for me or my department to make that advice available. Indeed, I would a:ssert a claim of confidentiality of that relationship in this case. National Crime Authority: .Bombing",73
72,Mr SAWFORD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question, which is directed to the Minister for Justice, is one that I ask with a great deal of sadness, anger and alarm. It concerns a tragic and deplorable incident that occurred in Adelaide this morning. Can the minister inform the House of any developments in relation to the bombing of the National Crime Authority'S Adelaide office this morning? '",74
73,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Earlier this morning, I made a short statement in the House in relation to this matter. Since that time, I have had further advice-most, recently from Mr Tom Sherman, the head of the National Crime Authority. He now tells me that the relatives of the Western Australian police officer who was performing duties with the authority' and who died as a result of the bomb blast have' been advised. I can now tell the House that Detective Sergeant Geoffrey Bowen died in that incident. He leaves a wife and two young children. I am sure that the sympathy of every honourable member of this House goes out to them in their tragedy. I regret that the earlier advice I gave was wrong. But it is a matter of some relief that the chairman of the National Crime Authority now tells me that the earlier advice I received of there being a second death is not now substantiated. A second person is critically injured. At 2.30 p.m., when I was advised by Tom Sherman, that person was undergoing emergency surgery. I am not in a position to advise the House in relation to the identity of that person. His relatives have not been contacted. The person is critically injured and is suffering shrapnel wounds and bums to between 20 and 40 per cent of his body. I am sure that all members of this House join with me in expressing deepest concerns in relation to this matter. Police welfare' and psychology services are assisting the victims and relatives. As'I said this morning, violence of this kind is un-Australian, alien to our way of life and utterly to be condemned. I am sure that all members of this House share my horror and sadness at this incident. Honourable members-Hear, hear!",74
74,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, with your indulgence, I certainly concur with the minister's comments. The Leader of the Opposition spoke of this matter at the dispatch box earlier. We support the minister's - omments with regard to condemning this extreme violence and hope that it will never be repeated in Australia. Our condolences go to the victims of this violence. ,House of Representatives: Whips",74
75,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Finance in both of the capacities in which he appears before the House this day. On what basis is the government considering the appointment of a chief whip? What extra responsibilities will be required of the position of chief whip? Is it the government's intention that this position will be assessed by the Remuneration Tribunal to determine how much more than the current $14000 loading will be paid to the honourabl- member for Watson as chief whip? ly, can' the minister confirm whether it is a behind him. fact that at the caucus, meeting yesterday the honourable member for Lalor, in his condemnation of this proposal, said words to the effect of 'On your bike, Leo'?",74
76,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I cannot confirm the latter point. Your own caucus meetings produce loads of interesting comment from time to time.' The"" government is· considering the question of appointment of a the title of chief whip. I do not know why it has come as a bit of a surprise to; those opposite, since I talked about these matters some length on a number of occasions when ,these' iSsues were debated in the chamber when we were looking at the reforms of the House. I pointed out then that all major parties here would need additional whipping arrangements associated with the new chamchamber. ber.",75
77,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,75
78,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I put this es.sentially in Australia as opposed to a conference elsewhere. I think you and I have shared that experience in the past. The intention of the government, therefore, is to put' in place additional whips for three major parties in this parliament. They will obviously be necessary when chamber starts functioning. I think all parties here operate with two whips. Those two whips are fully engaged in the operations of this chamber. In many ways, the burden on the whips in the new chamber will be much greater than in this chamber. They will have difficult standing orders to operate and they will be effectively,obliged ber going in terms of the people who are getting up on their scrapers speaking in the place. It will not be as easy a chamber monitor as this one. So there will be a quirement for' additional whips across board. The opposition will effectively get extra whips; the government will get one",75
79,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Government members interjectingMrBEAZLEYI did point this out at the caucus meeting. Mr SPEAKER.,.. - I think the minister is Lastdoing well without any help from those",75
80,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"From the government's 'point of view; there will obviously be an extended requirement on the part of whoever is the senior whip and no particular title has been finally settled for that position. It seems to us entirely reasonable that somebody should be so designated-whether the title be chief whip, senior whip or whatever-in the person holding set of arrangements: That obviously implies that additional responsibilities would go with the second at chamber. Therefore, propositions would be put to the Remuneration Tribunal to consider whether' any additional payments were required for any of the whips, including the person holding the position of senior whip, associat,ed with the creation of a second The government has not made any determination on that or on its propositions to the Remuneration Tribunal. Thatmatteris still being considered by the government. Pensioners: Income and Assets Test",75
81,Ms HENZELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,",-Could the Minister for Social Security outline the terms of reference of the pensions income and assets test review? Could the minister inform ,the House of all details of the consultant appointed and the members of the reference panel? What is the the second role of the reference panel?",75
82,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"--'The review of the income and assets test will examine the conceptual framework of the design principles, and the actual operation of the income and assets test. It will also look at the interaction of the social security income and assets test and the to keep that chamtaxation system. I think this review is timely. It has been some considerable time since the assets test to was reintroduced in the mid-1980s. A range reof issues has emerged as to the treatment of the various kinds of investment products. Of two necessity, the treatment of some of these has in some cases become complex, and I think it is'feasonable that we explore the possibility of achieving a system which, is both fair and equitable but also transparently fair and equitable. That is easy to say"" but doing it will be rather difficult. So, to achieve that objective, we will be relying on the work of the consultant that we have appointed. The consulting group that we have put in charge of this exercise is Ageing Agendas, headed by John Barber. That will be assisted by a reference group which is broadly representative of retiree organisations, the finance industry and relevant government departments. We have had the first meetiqg of the reference group. I am sure the group will make a very good contribution. There is a very good spread of expertise and background there and I am sure it will work very well. When this. review was announced, the honourable member for Berowra had to have his swipe. He expressed some concern about Mr Barber's appointment. The terms of his concern were: ... Mr Barber's long association with one particular association, which has concentrated on defending those who already receive benefits ... It is a rather extraordinary objection that Mr Barber has been associated with an organisation representing pensioners. I find it rather extraordinary that it would be seen to be objectionable that somebody who has a background hi. an organisation 'representing pensioners should be involved in the conduct of a review of the pensioners' income and assets test. Quite frankly, that is a pretty weird sort of objection. The honourable member for Berowra claims that there appears to be little time left for a full and comprehensive review and states: This broad ranging revjew will be a test. of Mr Barber's capacity to quickly grasp an extensive and complex Policy area. I think there is· perfectly adequate time to conduct the review properly and to conduct a proper consultation process. Mr Barber and his consulting group are also confident of that. It is interesting to contrast the point of view expressed by the honourable member for Berowra with the view expressed by the shadow minister for veterans' affairs, Senator MACGIBBON, who has a very different view about the capabilities of the consultant. He is quoted as saying that the report could probably be written in a weekend. It is a pretty inane comment to suggest that he could achieve that. I think the consulting group is pretty capable but I do not think that even it would claim to be that capable. The worse thing about that statement is that it just shows contempt for one of the key features of this review: the need to consult very extensively with the retiree population. The way in which this review is to be conducted allows considerable ppportunities for consultation to occur and for submissions to be lodged. I am confident that the work of the consultant l!,nd the reference group, serviced by a group within the department that will do some of the technical work, will produce a very useful and worthwhile review of the scheme; the results of which I hope will feed into some concrete government policy decisions.

Will the government seek to' ensure that breaches of the Electoral Act, such as that by the Labor candidate for Frel'Ilantle, will be acted upon?",76
88,Mr LAVARCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, as you obviously would know, but maybe the honourable member does not, I do not actually have responsibility for the Australian Electoral Commission or for the Commonwealth Electoral Act. But, in as much as I have an understanding of these matters generally, I can infonn the House that a complaint of this nature would generally be made to the Electoral Corrimission. The Electoral Commission, which is a body independent of the government, would make a determination as to whether the matter requires any further action. I would recommend to the honourable member not only that he check his facts on areas of responsibility but also that he not attempt to stoop to these sorts of tactics in this House. The people of Fremantle will be able to make their judgment on the merits of the .candidates and the issues before them without an, attempt at mud-slinging from the honourable merriber to help them along their way. Financial Services: Consumer Advice",77
89,Mr BEVIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Consumer Affairs. Has the minister seen reports of criticism by consumer groups and banks of the government's proposal to set up a financial information service? Is it a fact that the government has decided to proceed with this proposal? Are the reported criticisms justified?,77
90,Ms MCHUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I did see reports that 'consumer groups' were disappointed that this service would be available to people for a modest fee and that people would have to pay for this comparative financial information. The 'consumer groups' turned out to be Ms Jenni Mack, who is the head of AFCO. Apparently, Ms Mack has said that she is quite disappointed in the way she was reported. It is true that the government is funding this service. In this budget we have set aside $300,000 as, seed funding to set up a comparative financial information service where for a modest fee consumers will be able to get comparative information on all those enormously complicated and varied financial services that are now a-ailable. That has gone out to a tendering process, which will be a very careful and well supervised process. The advertisements have been in the newspapers. , I think the tenders closed on 25 February. It is indeed a shame that consumers have to pay for this service, even though I a- sure that it will be only a modest fee. No consumer is going to disagree with Ms Jenni Mack in saying that consumers should not have to pay for this service. The fact is that they could get this service freely from the banks in a properly operating marketplace. It is the banks we have been asking to provide this service for some time. I was astonished to see in the same article that apparently Alan Cullen of the Australian Bankers Association had also complained that people would have to pay a fee for this service. We have repeatedly asked the banks to supply this information. What we are talking about is a comparison rate. Every time we asked the banks for that information to be provided they said, 'It would be impossible', which is hard to understand wh-n some banks like Citibank have alrelidy provided it. Then they said that it would be too costly, that it would ruin them and that they would have to pass the cost on to the consumers, anyway. Then they said that stich a comparison rate could be misleading. The banks were saying this at a time when some of them were putting out advertisements containing what I would call rather misleading claims as' to interest rates. In any event, the banks will not provide the comparison rate. This service will provide comparative information for consumers at a modest fee. It is ashame they will have to pay a fee. But when they get the information it will be sound advice-the sort of advice that consumers need as so many more financial products are on the market.' Country Estate and Agency Co.  Attorney-General to the operations of the stockbroking and financial planning firm, Country EState and Agency Co. Is it a fact that this company makes potentially disastrous offers to small,unsuspecting shareholders in blue-chip listed companies thaJappear mate legal documents, but prices the shares at around only half of their real value at the time, ,no mention of which, is made in the documents? Given that the minister's job is protect the gullible from slick operators such as these, and in view of the warning issued the Australian Securities Commission, what action has' the minister taken to investigate and stop what could amount to misleading conduct?' ""','",77
91,Mr LAVARCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member would be aware that responsibility for the regulation of the Australian securities is in the hands of the Australian Securities Commission.

' Great Eastern Highway: Greenmounl , Mr STEPHEN, SMITH-'My question is - directed to, the Minister, for Transport 'and Industrial Relations and relates to a matter in my' electorate. The minister, will redall the tragic accident which occurred on.the notorious Gteenmount Hill section of the Great Eastern Highway on 30 December last year. The minister will also recall his undertaking given through me; at a public meeting in ate.

Is the minister in a position to advise when he wili be able to inspect Greenmount Hill an9 what attitude' he has to Commonhowever; wealth assistance in helping to overcome this the very serious road, safety Iissue? , Mr BRERETON - I thank the honourable member for Perth for his question and 'indeed for his ongoing interest in trying to find some solution to this truly notorious location, which is on the perimeter of his eleCtorate. The need legitito address the problem was never more starkly illustrated than in the last days of last year when 20 or so vehicles were involved in a major collision and"" sadly, two lives were to lost in the process. Two days after that,accident, on 1 January of this year, that section of by the Great Eastern Highway to which the honourable member refers was designated an urban extension of the' national highway system. As a result 9f that, all construCtion, rehabilitation and maintenance work on the highway including'the Greenmount Hill section is now a Commonwealth responsibilimarkets ty under our national highway program. As a result, I am, very keen to assist in finding a solution to the problems, and I want to do so in cooperation with the Western of Australian state government and local authorithe ties. I am already able to tell the House that the state government has implemented a range comof' measures to improve' safety, including some additional warning signs and a practice of stopping vehicles at the' top of that hill. measures such as safety ramps, restoraof by-runs and run-offs, and most imporlantly the proposed orange toute-that is the alternative to the Greenmount Hill section of Hill ' theroad-also need to be considered. It is my intention to inspect that route on a visit to Perth tomorrow fortnight At the suggestion of the hono»rable member for ,Perth, I will also be inviting the honourable 'member for Pearce to accompany the honourable member for Perth, relevant, officers ;md me on that inspection tour in view of the fact thatthat part of the highway ,is in her electorUntil very recently, planning for the orange route had been solely the prerogative of the Western Australian state, government and there; had been no request for federal funding for either preliminary planning works or for full construction. The proposed route is, the type, of project that would be eligible for federal funds. I am able to advise the House that today officials of my department have begun looking at the feasibility of the orange route. I look forward to inspecting it personally in the company of both honourable members on 17 March. Youth Homeless Allowance",78
92,Mr EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security. He would be aware that since the introduction of the youth homeless allowance the number of recipients of the allowance has increased by over 1,000 percent, from 940 recipients in ·1986 to over 10,000 recipients in 1993. Notwithstanding the parliamentary inquiry into this matter, can he justify the reasons for such a tragic increase in the numbers of homeless youth? Is it that so many Australian families are lacking in . suitable caring and. parenting skills oris the government offering in some cases, as some parents in the Cowan ehx:torate have claimed at a recent public meeting, an easy money program for unsettled youth? As this is the International Year of the Family, could he outline the government's plans to redress this tragic situation and assist in the reconciliation of some 10,000 young Australians with their families? MrBALDWIN-Since the honourable member referred to the International Year of the Family, I might point outthat this govern'ment is now spending something of the order of $5 billion a year in family assistance. If we look at what has been done over the last 10 years or so, we will see that the lev-l of assistance provided to families, particularly low income families, has iQcreased dramatically with the introduction of the family allowance supplement, which is now called the additional family payment, the achievement of adequacy benchmarks for that payment and· regular indexation since. That is a .very significant reform and is recognised as such by just about all .commentators. on families. I might also draw attention to the government's election commitment, which has been overfulfilled, to introduce a home child-care allowance, which comes into operation later this year. That is a major structural reforni. of assistance for families caring for children. It involves· expenditures of some $230 million over and above the with-child, dependent spouse rebate which it replaces. It means that some 55,000 low income families which did not have an income adequate to receive the full benefit of the dependent spouse rebate will benefit. Some 120,000 families will benefit from the fact that under the new arrangements, which are based on a current income test rather than a financial year income test, people 'caring for children will be able to move in and out of the work force and resume eligibility for payment of the home child-care allowance, which did not apply to the dependent spouse rebate. All in all, what this government has done ·in the year of the family is a pretty creditable effort, and it shows a very major commitment. The specific question Of the young homeless allowance was· raised. This is an extraordinarily difficult area. I have attended a number of meetings with people who are concerned with this issue; Nobody denies the need to have a payment of that kind; Whether we like it or nOt, there are cases of significant abuse of children-physical abuse, sexual abuse and. soforth---'and domestic environments which are clearly untenable. Nobody disputes the need to have a young homeless allowance. The argument is about how we determine in particular cases who gets it and who does not. We rely heavily on our social workers to verify. the· circumstances. The decisions to allocate the payment are maqe:by a senior officer, but it is inherently a very difficult .area. It does. require the making of. fine judgments where we have to weigh claim against ,counterclaim. It is not a simple matter. It is a very sensitive area and .therehave been a range of complaints, from people, including parents who claim that the payment was being made. available inappropriately. There have been enough such complaints for me to think that we do need to have a careful look at the administration of that scheme. I have asked my department to review the administrative arrangements from a·number of points of view,including trying to make sure that we maximise the potential to achieve a reconciliation between the children and their parents. Obviously, we need to do as much as we can there. We are currently constrained by the privacy provisions in the Soc-al Security, Act, but we are having a think about that.. We are having· a look at a new disallowable instrument that might overcome some of the concerns there. As the honourable member pointed out, 'a parliamentary committee, chaired by the honourable member for Newcastle, will broadly review the area over the course of this year. That review will not just be looking at the young homeless payment. It will also be looking more broadly at the factors that lead to homelessness occurring in the, first place. I hope that committee will be able to produce some very valuable information. As to the rate of growth in the numbers receiving payment, this payment was introduced in themid-1980s.There is always a period in which the eligible population becomes aware of the payment, and there is a build-up of the take up over a period. Under those' circumstances, together with obvious things like' the recession, I do not think the increase that the honourable member referred to was unexpected, particularly if we take into consideration what Burdekin had to say about the number of homeless youth being in the range of 12,000 to 24,000. If that is correct, and there are 10,000 receiving the payment, if anything, .there might be some who ought to l;>e getting it but who are not. Frankly, it is far 'better for people to be on this payment rather than having to make their way by robbing hOuses or prostituting themselves. It is very important that we have that payment. It is also very important that it is well administered and that judgments are made as well as they possibly can be. Inevitably,there will be errors in something as subjective as this, but all we can do is review the situation to make sure that the system works as well as possible. We are doing that .in two ways: by an internal departmental review to ensure that we get Cl;>llsistent·administration .and by a broader, parliamentary inquiry. I have referred terms of reference to the committee chaired by the honourable member for Newca,stle. Workplace Bargaining .",79
93,Mr HAVILAND,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations. I preface my question by pointing out that government business enterprises and statutory authorities' employ a large section of the. Australian work force and provide vital services to the community.

I am pleased to infotm him and the House that there are now over 200,000 people employed in government business enterprises who, have struck agreements .and have set themselves on a path to higher productivity. Over 99 per cent of those pe9ple employed in government business enterprises are now cove-ed by agreements. Similarly, in the. 42 statutory authorities, which the government controls but whose staff are not directly ' employed under the APS, something like 93 per cent of the staff are covered by agree' ments-more than 26,000 workers. I will give the House some examples of how these agreements are driving productivity in particular instances. Australia Post introduced what it called a quality service 1 initiative and has worked to raise individual productivity as a .means of entering into bargaining agreements. This has worked so well that Britain's Royal Mail has taken up the idea and is now using the notion 'of quality service 1. The old goverim1erit aircraft factory at Avalon-we now call it Aerospace Technologiesof Australia Aircraft Services---,has investigated the use of what it calls cellular manufacturing. The work groups thems-l-es determine how to .get greatest productIvIty from a. particular manufacturing exercise. and they. have raised productivity through these mean-. - The Export Finance and Insurance Corporation has now embarked' on an enterprise agreement, such that it is picking up a lot ?f the practices that we would commonly find m the finance and insurance sectors. It is also lifting its productivity. Also, the oldmunitions factories, now Australian' Defence 'Industries,have invoked a number of arrangements such as total quality management and just-in-time practices that have also lifted productivity in ADI enormously. .' Not.only have we produced improvements in productivity here for theCommqnwealth, the worker and the taxpayer but' also improvements often mean the lowering of charges to the private sector. The Civil Aviation Authority, for instance,. as a result of its workplace bargaining, has seen real charges to the aviation industry in 1992-93 drop by 16 per cent. We are expecting by the completion. of the 1993-94 financial year a further drop in charges to the aviation sector of 17 per cent. I think the honourable member is quite right in his question: these public sector.imthorities and GBEs have a great deal to contribute to the Australian economy and workplace bargaining is driving that improved productivity.

97,Mr CAMPBELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Finance. In view of the present relatively low interest rates, which the government can obviously take credit for, what does the minister think pf the practice of PIBA, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Rural and Industries Bank of Western Australia, currently. charging some rural sector people interest of 17 per cent plus on their loans? While it.is not just PIBA-other banks and organisations are involved in this extortionwhat does the minister think of this extortion and is he prepared to take the matter to cabinet to see whether there is anything the government can do. to modify the ethics of this present reprehensible behaviour on the part of the banks?",81
98,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Kalgoorlie for his question: I am unaware of the extortion to which he refers and therefore cannot verify, in fact, that it - s taking place. Obviously, the matter is of very serious concern to him, as a man who takes very' seriously his obligations to his rural constituency. I will therefore take the matter to the Tre;lsurer, who has primary concern for the government's response to anything going on in the banking industry, and Iwm ensure .that the Treasurer gives the honourable member a prompt response to' his' inquiries. Department of Social Security: Credit . Cards",81
99,Mr CHARLES,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Social. Security. I refer the minister to the .Auditor-General's. report No. 21 of 1993-94 into the Australian government credit card. I ask the minister: what action has he taken in the Department of Social Security to institute a risk management system to avoid and detect fraud? What has he done to reduce the m;e of the card, limit the number of card· holders and train those who have government credit cards in their use? Is he a respo-sible minister? .",81
100,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will not give the honourable member a detailed answer to that at this point. But the Minister for Finance points out that his department is preparing a paper on this which will have applicability across government, and lam quite bappy to provide the honourable member with some further information in due course. Health Exports",81
101,Mr OCONNOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is :di'rected to the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs. What opportunities exist within Australia 'said program to build on the initiatives agreed at last week's meeting of the Australian Health Ministers Advisory Council to set up an export network of senior state and federal health executives? What projections are there for the value of health exports from' Australia to the Asia Pacific region? Mr BILNEYThe honourable member has clearly seen the excellent article that, appelired in the press the other day which recorded the setting up of this group of people who are engaged inattemptingto use our comparative advantage in matters of health services to export to the burgeoning Asia-Pacific region. On the latter part' of the horio,urable member's question as to the extent of the market, real work is only just beginning into what clearly is a very big market. A survey will be completed quite soon whichwill give us more infOrmation on that. But I assure the honourable member that the market is at least of the order of three figures of millions$100 mIllion, and possibly considerably more. So far as the first part of the honourable member's question is concerned, that is to say"" the extent to which the aid program can assist in penetrating this market, I· am happy to be able to tell him that the aid program is already making a substantial contribution to health sector exports and, is well. placed to contribute to the emphasis which the establishmentofthatnetwork, to which he referred in his question, will facilitate. The priority of health assistance in our aid program is great and increasing. In the course of the last financial year, around $73 million was spent on health related activities in 30 countries, but the bulk of those were in the Asia-Pacific region. The prime aim of those activities is not primarily, to assist health exports, but to support appropriate' health care which supports the basic human needs of people in the Asia-Pacific region; But at the same time, in sO doing, the government seeks to maximise the use of Australian expertise and equipment, and to showcase Australian capacity, both in the technical sphere and in the services, the policy' sphere. ' I give just a few examples of AIDAB's current or phmned activities which complement the focus ,of the health export network: the China hepatitis test kit production project, which will assist China to ,construct and design an international, standard laboratory in - Beijing to produce test kits, diagnostic kits for hepatitis B. By doing so,', the project will provide opportunities, for Australian comPanies to provide training as well as Australian sourced, technical assistance with equipment. A second exampl- is the PNG hospital management and operations improvement project, which is to begin in May of this year. That will provide Australian advisers in hospital management arid secondary health services policy. """,82
102,Mr SINCLAIR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Why don't you make a statement on it? ' , Mr BILNEY-I am giving information which I know would be of great interest to members in the opposition, whose interests , are wider than those of primary exporters. A third example in which I hope every member of this House would be interested is the Fred Hollows Foundatiori blindness prevention project in Eritrea. That project isusing Australian expertise to build a factory forproducing cheap, high quality intra-ocular lenses. A similar factory is planned for Vietnam. ; Finally, in the HIV-AIDS field, AIDAB is planning to assist the government of the Philippines with the formulation of a national AIDS 'strategy which will make use of the success that we have had in this country with HIV prevention and care. Those are project specific activities:' As well as that, we are training arotmd700 studerits in Australia, sponsored by AIDAB, who are studying health related subjects in Australia. That activity is valuable not just in supporting , Australian ""training institutions but also in exposing students from', the Asia-Pacific region' to Australian expertise and, equipment - something which will inevitably have commercia:l'spin-offs in the future.

104,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) proposing that Ii definite matter of public importanc-be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The Government's disregard, for the welfare of 'families in its recent Austudy decisions to limit eligibility for many students. 1 ca,l1 :uponthose members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. , "" More than the number of members required by the stcmdi1:t,gorders having risen in their ftLaces-- ' , Mr ,AND-;eWS(Me-zies) (3.47 p.m.)....,.. This matter of public importance arises out of a contemptible decision by the government to renege on a stated commitment to waive the assetS te-t Jbr applicants f(}f, A:ustudy who have been ,granted the health care card. The reason'this,decision.to back away from yet another promise deserves contempt is,twofold. First, the government stated to the people of Australia on no less than four occasions in four different ways that it would waive the assets test for the holders of health care cards when applying for Austudy. PAPERS Secondly, the decision is despicable because of the secretive and sly way in which the has sought to avoid admitting that the it has broken yet another one of its budget and election promises. The manner is indicative of the endemic failure of sound administration which has been highlighted repeatedly in the last year and in the last few weeks of this government. It says something also about the attitude of this government towards those in regional Australia, particularly those in Medical Research rural Australia. There is no doubt about the government's stated intention and its stated commitment in this matter. I note by way of passing that the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education papers: and Training (Mr Free) is not here. The minister has been running away from saying anything to anybody about this decision since it was brought to light some three weeks ago. . He has refus,ed point blank to talk to the media. He has refused point blank to debate, or even comment about, the matter on radio. Austud- We see once again today that the chair in which the minister ought to be sitting is empty at this stage. There is no doubt about the commitment that the government made in relation to this matter. The minister made the commitment on four separate occasions. I welcome the minister to the chamber, who has been brought inhere at last to make some sort of public announcement about this yet again broken promise on behalf of the Labor government. The first of four occasions on which this commitment was stated was in the department budget kit on student assistance: From 1994, special assessment will be extended to students whose ,parents hold, a current health care card. Such students will qualify for Austudy without parental income and assets test. That was the first occasion on which there was a stated commitment from the government on this measure. Then on 13 September last year ;we had a Department of Employment, Educatio.n and Training media release which stated: Major changes-=arising o.ut o.f last year's budgetinclude: Effective January 1, 1994, students from families holding a Health Care Card will qualify for a maximum AUSTUDY entitlements, with means and assets tests waived. This measure is .especially beneficial to low income families which are not on Department of Social Security or Veterans Affairs benefits. They are two. o.ccasio.ns on which this co.mmitment has beeri clearly stated to. the people o.f Australia. Then we had the 1994 Austudy guide, a glo.ssy publicatio.n which is, put o.ut by the Department o.f Emplo.yment, Eaucatio.n and Training and by the Natio.nal Unio.n o.f Students. On page 36 o.f the publicatio.n, in relatio.n to. independent students, the questio.n is asked: Are there any other situations where assets are not counted? We find here, shaded and highlighted in a bo.x, thefo.llo.wing statement: From 1994, the assets of both you and your spouse generally won't be counted if your spouseand, o.f co.urse, we kno.w what it isholds a Health Care Card. In relatio.n to. dependent students, the same that had been madestatement is made-highlighted, once again but in the department'so.wn glo.ssy publicatio.n, which go.es to. students right aro.und this co.untry. This is the thirdo.ccasio.n o.n which a co.mmitment has been made to. the people o.f Australia abo.ut Austudy and the health care card. Finally, we have the Austudy applicathere tio.n fo.rm itself. At the bo.tto.m, it quite clearly states that if people tick the bo.xwhich says they have a health care card then they jump o.ver the questio.ns which deal with their assets and do. no.t answer them o.n theapplicatio.n fo.rm. . On fo.ur separate pieces o.f paper from department-a media releas-- the bo.o.klet, applicatio.n fo.rm and, o.f co.urse, the briefing no.tes after the budget itself-we have the simple, clear, unambiguo.us statement to. the people o.f Australia that if they have a he.alth ·care card and they apply fo.r Austudy then this they do. no.t need to. satisfy the assets test. This was fine· fro.m the budget right thro.ugh until February o.f this year-but what did we find in February o.f this year? On 21 February we had Senato.rSchacht telling the Senate that the budget de,Cisio.ri was misinterpreted in the material circtihtted to students and that-wait fo.r this as o.ne o.f the .great excuses o.f all time-the no.rmaL DEETquality co.ntro.l measures failed to. pick up this diversio.n from the intentio.n o.f the go.vernment po.licy. Fo.rgive me if I am a little sceptical-in fact, exceedingly sceptical-about this expllinatio.n; it simply do.es no.t co.nvince us at all. First o.f all,. there is the who.les-ries o.f co.ntrary statements which have been mllde by the department in its material. But let us also. lo.o.k at the initial respo.nse fro.m the minister'so.ffice, which was quo.ted in a newspaper article in the Australian o.n 15 February this year under the heading' Austudy rethink may hit farmers'. The article says: The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, Mr Free, yesterday held talks with DEET officials, the Treasurer, Mr Willis, and the Minister for Finance, Mr Beazley, to discuss· the matter. It is understood Mr Free was angered by DEET's directivethat is, a directive reneging o.n the promise ' it was uncertain whether the Government would be able to hon()ur its Budget commitment. Why was the minister angry about this directive if, in fact, it was simply a directive which was inco.rrect, as has been suggested, and. that was simply a mistake abo.ut the po.licy? Surely the minister would be pleased, if this were simply a, mistakeabo.ut the po.licy, to. say to. the department, 'Yo.u'd better tell the people what the current.siJuatio.n is and fix it .up:. But the first respo.nse is that the minister is angry. Why is he angry? Because he has been fo.und o.ut fo.r having cQanged the policy the which this go.vernment promised the Australthe ianpeo.ple. The arficle go.es o.n: A spokesman for Mr Free said yesterday an ""administrative contradiction"" between the Department of Social Security and DEET"":""- . is no.t just a quality co.ntro.l failure; this is an administrative co.ntradictio.nhad occurred and that some people applying for Austudy benefits might have been affected. The article continues: ""The Government intends to honour its policy but at this stage it is not clear whether it will take a few days to sort out."" the spokesman said. The government intends to honour its policy. What was that stated policy? None other than to waive the assets test for those persons who held health care cards and were applying for Austudy. If the government intended to honour its policy, how can the minister-who is finally being brought before the chamber to say'something about this matter.,......come in here and argue that this was simply an administrative error? The minister cannot have it both ways jn this case. DEET's directive, of course, was not passed on to regional offices. My office, ,for example, checked with the regional· office in Melbourne on a number of occasions and it did not know about the directive. We had it checked with other regional offices around Australia and last week we were contacted by the staff of one of the DEET offices-in Dandenong, in fact""""'""""'to ask for my press releases so they could find out what was going on. So much for communication in the minister's department. If there was an error of interpretation why did the government quietly leave this provision out of the regulations which it published last December? There is very little point if the regulations merely say that people who qualify for a health care card, and therefore satisfy the income test, do not need to go through the process again in order to satisfy the Austudy test. The regulations area nonsense and they do not add anything to the current situation. The minister cannot have it both ways. Either he is reversing the policy-which we believe he is doing---:-or he knew about the error in November and December last year, secretly left it out of the regulations and did nothing about informing the Australian people until he was found out. What is the effect of this? Why are we today raising this as a matter of public importance in the national parliament? The Senate has been told by' Senator Schacht that only 100 people had q-alified under this system and that only 20 others have put applications in that might be refused. Of can-this course, there is no way of the government knowing how many people miss out under this system. Why would people bother to put in an application if they have been told that their application is going to be refused? In the last couple of days we have been in contact with people who put in applications and were refused. I can assure the minister that far more than 20 people, which was the figure it seems Senator Schacht wanted to remind people of, missed out on qualifying for Austudy. In any event, we are talking about perhaps tens of thousands of dollars, and why is the government breaking a promise over tens of thousands of dollars if only 20 people missed out? The minister has to go one way or the other and it is about time we heard a clear explanation from him. We were first told by the minister's office that some $25 million was involved. That figure then came down to $10 million, and we do not know what it is at the present time. It does not matter whether one person or 2,000 people are affected by this broken promise because there are two issues here. The first is that this is a broken promise by this remote and uncaring government which always employs the language of social justice but arrogantly says to the young people of Aus:"" tralia, 'We are prepared to cut you off from any opportunity for education'.· Even if this broken promise affected only one family, the government's original commitment won bouquets throughout the length and breadth of Australia because, through it, the government said to people who have for years suffered from droughts, floods, rain and bushfires and from world commodity prices falling, that was going to do something to help the educational opportunities of their childr.en. These things have had a devastating impact upon these communities. Minister Crean and Senator Richardson went through Queensland last year telling many of these people that they qualified for the health care card and, implicit in that, that they would qualify for Austudy as well, yet we have this total backdown on the part of the government today. We have to ask what the role of the minister is in this saga .. The statement was ,made in Senate by Senator Schacht. Senator Schacht, not Minister Free, was sent off to talk to the estimates committee. I do not know what Minister Free was doing-perhaps he has rostered days off from the estimates committee as well, but he was not in the Senate estimates committee when he could have answered these questions. There has been no statement, .no explanation. I have been told by at least six radio commentators or journalists on radio throughout Australia that when they ask for a comment from the minister, they get the single response, 'The minister is· not prepared to make a comment on this matter'. Why is the minister not prepared to comment? He has been dragged in here kicking and screaming today. It is about time that we got a simple statement from him about this question. I have restrained myself from asking the minister a question during question time so that a backbencher has the opportunity to ask the minister a question-we have had a series of dorothy dixers on a whole lot of inane subjects about what great new program the government is actually engaged in-,-so that he can say quite honourably, to the people of Australia, 'This is the change which we ha""e made.' Do honourable members think that in the four dorothy dixers that have been. presented to the minister there has been one question or one word about what the government.has done in this total backdown? There has been nothing but resounding silence on this issue. There are stories from different· paris of Australia of people who have been affected by these proposals. This morning we spoke to Bill and Marilyn Taylor-'-no relation to the honourable member-from Charleville. For the last four financial years they have had a nil income. They do not get the health care card. They were encouraged to get it and to apply for Austudy and now they find out that, even though the application was in before this magic arbitrary date of 7 February, they have had no notification. Presumably the educational opportunities of their children are still in doubt. TPere are other people like them right around Australia. For the governmentto say the that this measure affects just 20 familJes shows the uncaring and remote attitude of this government generally to people in Australia. This is .not an isolated incident. Last year this government tried to cut Austudyto16.,year-olds and to move them over to family payments, which meant the reduction in the amount of assistance they would get for their education. We know of other stories of rorts in the Austudy system. People are getting paid more to stay-. on jobsearch than to go on to Austudy' and complete their education. and training. These questions and a whole lot more remain unanswered. By his own admission the minister has had since 7 February to investigate how this happened and who authorised .the. changes which he purports were made. What does he say to the students who have commenced courses on the basis of the information that has been provided to them? I can understand his embarrassment, but he has to honour the commitment· he made. If he·, has got some honour, he should stand up here today and say, 'This government is going to honour the commitment. I am going to go back and fight for this commitment'. Otherwise he will be seen as part of a government that is uncaring andarrogllnt, th-t is remote from the Australian peopl- and whose sloppy and corrupt administration makes. it unfit to govern this country.

105,Mr FREE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Lindsay-Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training) -(4.02 p.m.)-1 forget which fast food chain adopted the singing commercial, 'you ought to be congratulated', but! almost feel like singing it to the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) today becalls- he needs to be congratulated. .He has graduated from raising spurious points of order during question time to actu-lly getting around to proposing a matter of publi- importance. Unfortunately, it is a spurious matter of public importimce. The matter before the House proposed by the honourable member-the government's disr-gard. for the welfare of families in its recent decisions to limit eligibility . for Austudy for many students-is a spurious proposition. There is no disregard for family welfare. Austudy is a scheme which is targeted to take into account both the income and assets of families so that assistance is targeted to those students most in need. There is no 'recentdeeision' as referred to in the proposition. What transpired flowed from a departmental misinterpretation of a budget decision and that original budget decision stands unaltered. It follows, as a matter of simple logic, that there is therefore no removal or liffiit!ltion of eligibility. Before taking the honourable member for Menzies thrqugh the details of what occurred in terms which I hope will make it clear to him and maybe even to his coalition colleague Senator Boswell, I invite him to join me on a trip down memorylaite, Ii trip down the time tunnel. The time is early 1983; theplace is Liberal Party Australia. It is,the eighth year of Malcolm Fraser's prime ministership. 'Peter Reith has just won the seat of Flinders in a by-election but it is going to take him two years to take up his seat because he is about to lose it in March to the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth)"" who' is sitting behind me. In 1983"" there were 348,000 students in Australia attending 19 universities, located almost excJusively in our cities.Jn our second!lry schools, one-third of students went on to complete year 12. The tertiary students at the time were assisted under a scheme kriown as TEAS,'tertiary education assistance schemea tired and complex,' scheme. Students in senior secondary years,were assisted under the SAS scheme, the secondary assistance scheme. I think at the time it paid about $25 a week. People could actually do twice as well on the dole at the time, as I recall it. Un:der the last Liberal administration in this country, 16-year-olds were being paid to leave school because the dole was twice as attractive as the miserable allowances which were paid to' them in Liberal Party Australia of 1983. ,Now more than 560,000 students are attending 38 universities on 111 campuses across Australia. Compare that with 348,000 students attending 19 universities back in 1983. Today almost 80 per cent of secondary students go on to complete year 12. Remember that back in 1983 it was around one-third of secondary students. As for student assistance, in 1983 around $330 million of assistance was made to some 200,000 students; This year we will pay more than $1.5 billion in student assistance to more than half a million students. The Austudy scheme was introduced in 1987 to provide assistance on a non-competitive basis to those eligible secondary and tertiary students following years of the stagnant underfunding of the old TEAS scheme. Since 1987 Austudy beneficiaries have more than doubled. Since 1983 student assistance beneficiaries overall have more than trebled. A$ I mentioned, last year more than half a million were assisted at a cost of around $1.5 billion. A number of changes were announced in the 1993-94 budget which are of importance. The assets test for the assistance for isolated children scheme was abolished, recognising the hardship faced by many rural people. Students who had completed courses more than 10 years ago became eligible to receive Austudy. so that they could update their qualifications. TheqIaximum amount that Austudy and Abstudy tertiary students ,could receive as an interest-free supplement was increased from $4,000 to $6,000. Fringe benefits received by parents were taken .into consideration as a means, of ensuring better targeting. In addition, from the 20th of this m(}nth new arrangements under the two systems-the Department of Social Security and the student assistance programs conducted by DEETwill allow for a, smoother transition so, that those clients moving from unemployment benefits to student assistance will continue to receive social security payments for three weeks to take account of any delays in processing of, student assistance. Equally, those jobsearch and newstartclients who are ,undertaking courses of less than six months duration at the direction of the local CES will remain on Department, of Social .Security payments. As well, we have been able to ,introduce vastly improved processing through the introduction of the 1994 version of the computer system for processing student assistance application forms known as ESAS. We have made remarkable progress in that area as well. By 18 February, student assistance centres had processed 529,000 assessments,representingan improvement of almost 20 per cent as against the same time .last year. Of course, this significant improvement in performance means a much better service to clients. In the period following the 1993-94 budget, an error was made. My budget press release of 17 August last year, which announced simplifications to Austudy, said, among other things: Streamlining assessment prbcooures for students entering the AUSTUDY/ABSTUDY/AIC system where families have a Health Care Card. Streamlining assessment procedures was intention of the decision. Unfortunately, students assistance reference kit, to which honourable member referred, contained incorrect statement. It said: Students from families holding a Health Care Card will qualify for maximum AUSTUDY/ABSTUDY entitlements, with means. and assets tests waived. There is one incorrect word in that statement. The word 'assets' should not have been referred to, for the very good reason that the original' budget decision did not include a reference to waiving the assets test. For that reason, therefore, the press statement of· the honourable member for Menzies of 14 February is wrong, at least in this respect, where he says: This is contrary to a Budget decision to waive assets test Jor Health Care Card holders. . There was never a budget decision to waive the assets test for health care card holders. This matter arose out of a' decision to allow those parents or spouses, where they hold a health .care card, to, fasHrack access to Austudy on the grounds that they have already met the appropriate means administered by the Department of Social Security. The intention of the decision was to allow the speedier .payment of Austudy for parents suffering sudden drops in income. Unfortunately, the budget decision was misinterpreted in material circulated to students by the department, as I have just illustrated, stating that holders of health care cards were exempt from the Austudy assets test. This was not the intention of the budget decision. There was no intention to remove the Austudyassets test from the holders of health care cards, because to do this would lead to inequities in, the distribution of Austudy. Not all health care cardholders are required to undergo an 'assets test. It would not be responsible to allow a loophole to be exploited'in this way. Parents of children and their spouses who have applied fOfAustudy after 7 February on the basis of holding a health care card will basked, as ,per the directive, to supply information about their assets if these details have not already been given to the Department, of Social Security. Their entitlement will be the assessed accordingly. the The government understands quite well the the case made on behalf of asset rich but low an income families, particularly those in rural Australia. It is well understood by the government. It is this understandingMr Bruce Scott-More ,'"" rhetoric. Mr Andrews-£mpty rhetoriG,",86
106,Mr FREE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is not empty' rhetoric. It· is this understanding which led the government to extend, for e-ample, the benefits under the assistance for isolated children scheme in the last budget It is this understanding which provides, under. the Austudy assets test, for the 50 per cent discounting of farm and business a.ssets.Therefbre, the honourable the member for Menzies is wrong in his press release of 14 February. I make.it clear to him that it was never intended to remove those families from the assets test. This fact, with the help of the ABC, appears to have penetrated even the consciousnessofthe honourable member's colleague in the· Senate Senator Boswell. When Senator Boswell' was interviewed on the national Country Hour program of the ABC on 22 February, he said: That is unfortunately the case, anyone now that has a Health Card must also fall under the Federal Government's Assets Test or they're not eligible for Austudy. The interviewer said: . Now'both the National Fanners Federation and the Opposition have said that - is is ren.e&in- on a Budget promise. Is it your re-dmg that. It IS m fact a reneging on a Budget promIse? Senator Boswell then said: It's certainly reneging on a commitment that.the Government have made both in Press Releases and in Austudy Application fonns. The interview continued: MCCONCHIE: But the point is, was it ever passed in regulation, was it ever actually tion? BOSWELL: I do not believe that it is in the regulations, we've tried to look for it in. the regulations, but I cannot find it in there. It is not there to find. The interview continued: MCCONCHIE: So it's possible that it was a misinterpretation in fact by the Department of Employment, Education and Training? BOSWELL: Well the Government is claiming that it is a mis-interpretation .. We're not going to let them off the hook that way ... and I'in not going to get involved in the technicalities of whether they are right or wrong. The interviewer closed in on him by saying: But this could see a Budget blowout. I mean it's only ten million dollars but it could see a budget blowout, now what can you in fact do from now given the fact that it hasn't been in regulation? Senator Boswell then said: There is very little we can do. That is absolutely right. I refer to the behaviour of the opposition on this matter. Its return to the original claim that the' government was reneging on a decision made in the budget is clearly wrong. The government is maintaining the original decision, which had the intent of giving speedier access to Austudy for families suffering a sudden drop in income. Therefore, the· charge ·that the government is reneging on a promise cannot be sustained either by reference to my budget press release or to the regulations. That fact is even recognised by Senator Boswell, but it is apparently not recognised by the honourable member who has put this proposition before the House. It is worth reminding honourable members that last year Austudy grew to the point where it is now assisting over half a million students at a cost of over $1.5 billion. It is hardly surprising that, while the opposition has chosen this afternoon to attempt to score some points on this issue, it ignorescit suits the opposition-the government's unquestio-able record on student assistance. While this matter is so important to those opposite, I can. find nowhere in Fightback a commitment to remove such families from the assets test. It put into legisla- is not there. The opposition has equally been silent this afternoon on whether it stands by its Fightback commitment to slash student financial assistance by $30 million per year by raising the Austudy'cut-off point. Had the oppdsition been elected in March last year, that measure would have rem6ved 30,000 students from Austudy. Those' oppo'siteare here whingeing about 20. Its proposal would have cut 30,000 students from Alistudy. So, while Senator Boswell and the honourable member for Menzies complain .. about,·20 . students, their proposition in Fightback would have removed 30,000. They are complaining about the incorrect inclusion of one word in the Austudy guide. There are 600 pages in Fightbackand they are all wrong. (nmexpired) .",88
107,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Maranoa) (4.17 p.m.) ...;.;.;I rise with great pleasure this afternoon to support the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) on this very great matter of public importance. At the same time, I acknowledge the presence in the Speaker's gallery of members of the ICPA who are in Canberra today doing the rounds. It is one of the great organisations that has always fought for a better deal for students from country Australia. . There can be no doubt that the government, through the pathetic response from. the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) this afternoon, has taken the Australian public for a ride with its short-lived promise to waive the assets test for Austudy applicants holding health care cards. What has outraged many rural communities ih my constituency about this whole sorry tale is that there has been not one sign of remorse from· the government-not one admission of guilt; not even a whisper of apology-for the families whose plans have been .thrown into turmoil as a result of this broken promise. Allow me to recap on this incredible bungle; it is an extraordinary bungle even by this government's very low standards. On 13 September last year, the'Department of Employment, Education and Training issued a press release that announced: . .. families holding a Health Care Card will qualify for maximum AUSTUDY ... entitlements, with means and assets tests waived. That was a press releas- from the department. This announcement was enthusiastically received by rural families across the country who felt it was a fair recognition and an acktiowledgment from the government of the difficulties that' the assets test' has caused du,ring this unprecedented rural' downturn, where rrian- h-lVe:been 'affected by drought. On 1 January this year, the initiative offiThe cially commenced and, as the honourable member for Menzies pointed out quite clearly, it was even in the application form that Austudy circulated around the country. From the day it comnienced, approximately 100 students accessed the Austudy benefits without 'submitting to an assets test. Then just five weeks later, ()n 7 February, the department issued an internal statement to the effect Austudy ,applicants from health. care card holding families would have to face an assets test. There was, however, no public announcement by the minister of this policy backflip. In fact, the announcement was so quiet that the Department of Employment, Education and Training did noLeven tell its staff. As the honourable member for Menzies pointed out, as late as 22 February, two weeks after the policy change, the Dandenong DEET office· was still advising health care card holders that they did not have to face all assets test to receive Austudy benefits. It is not difficult then to appreciate the confusion that reigned in the community; Students who took the government's initial. pledge in . faith were submitting their applications and planning their school and tertiary education commitments, safe in the knowledge that the assets test, which has unfairly plagued many rural families and regional students for years, would now not apply. . On reaching their local Austudy office, the students were told of the policy change and were instructed to submit to an assets test. This was a blow in itself. It was nothing short of a bIllt-mtbroken promise on the government's part. Worse still, it was done on the . quiet, after the initiative had already been in place for five weeks. This broken promise naturally created anger and frustration throughout rural Australia, which once again felt . . cheated by this government. However, this anger turned to outright disbelief when the students and families caught up in the bungle read the newspapers over the following days, in which the minister was reported as saying: The Government intends to honour its (original) policy but at this stage it is not clear whether it can. That threw more confusion into the debate. minister certainly did not clear it up. That statement was made on 15 February, some eight days after the department decided to quietly drop the idea. The confusion was described by th- minister's spokesman as an 'admiriistrative contradiction'. This resulted in a completely farcical situation whereby the minister was saying to health care card holding families, 'No, you don't have to face al;l that assets test' and his departmental staff were saying, 'Yes, you do'. So whom do we believe?' This situation clearly revealed a minister with no authority, no discipline and obviously no regard for the students and families of rural Australia. The minister will pass this off as an administrative hiccup, a vagary of human nature or a breakdoWl;l in communications. It is, however, much more than that. This whole sorry mess has hurt families and, worse of all, the great tragedy of it is that it has hurt students who' had already started to plan for that education, but who could now well be denied access to that education. Most of those affected are from rural and regional areas and are good already' struggling with a whole range of climatic and industry problems that this government would never understand. In some cases, more hardship has been inflicted througb government policy; I received a phone call from a distraught constituent on the day the minister's desperate denials were published in newspapers across the country. The next day my constituent due to pay a deposit on his daughter's accomminister's modation which would allow""her to attend universitY'in Sydney. He 'had a health care card 'and had made his daughter's arrangefamilies ments on the strength of the government's promise to waive the assets lest, as this would enable her to receive Austudybenefits. on the same day he had been requested by Austudy officials to supply asset details. He also read education, the minister's statement which said that the government would stand by its commitment to waive the assets test. He rang my office in desperation. He knew an assets, test would rule his daughter inelirange gible for Austudy, but the minister, was publicly contradicting his department, saying that there would be no assets test., This family had to make very real and very hard decisions affecting their daughter's education and, ultimately, the education of their other chilrealisable dren. These decisions had to be made on basis of the contradictory advice from minister's department Given the remarks'of Senator Schacht in the upper house and at the Senate estimates committee, it seems that dIe' department will win out-and, as we haveheard,from the minister today, he has certainly gfyenup on it-and that the assets test will prevail. So ;the Party young woman to whom I referred will now not get her Austudy. I have received many documented letters from constituents outlining similar stories to this one. This is a story of just one family in my electorate. There are dozens more right across Australia who have been strung along by this government's deceit. This government ctinningly teased, them by telling ,them that assets test would not apply and by allowing a few lucky families to make in the blink of an eye, the initiative was over. Life was back to normal and rural families were, out in the cold once again. It was clearly an insensitive and callous trick. Clearly, the government could not afford the initiative for whatever crooked reason, but it knew, or should have known, that at the time the initiative was announced. However, the government continues to gloss over the matter on the grounds that it was an was administrative contradiction. In fact, the performance today really has not improved the, matter. He now seems to have confirmed the worse fears of '. those rural who will now not receive Austtidy, notwithstanding the fact that they may hold a health care card. What the minister is saying is that it is all right to have good health in the bush, but it' is not all right to have a good ' This debacle has struck at rural areas in particular, as it is the families from rural Australia who are most affected by the inflexible assets: test attached to Austudy and a of other government benefits. The real tragedy is that many of these families may have assets beyond the limits, but one cannot eat one's assets. Many of these assets are not realisable and there are many cases of people having,to consider these assets as saleable and assets. As we have seen in the last the J2 months, in many cases they cannot. get the people to look at these assets. The Labor Premier of Queensland got it right when he recently summed up the situation - neatly. He commented that country people do not trust the 'Labor Party. He went on to ,say that this was because the Labor had done nothing to earn their trust.' He was dead right. (Time expired)",89
108,Mr SAWFORD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," First of all, I congratulate the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) for raising an educational issue in this House. It is a very rare event. I sincerely hope he raises more issues and that he takes the big picture of .education into account: The honourable the member' for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) acknowledged the group working on behalf of the cut: Then, isolated children. Despite the bleating of the opposition, the government is aware of the very special '' problems of rural children. This is why the assistance for isolated children scheme exists; It helps isolated parents with the cost of sending their children to school. The assistanCe is significant. Last year 13,000 students qualified fDr assistance at a CDSt of $22 milliDn. What the DppositiDn dDes not tell anyDne is that the assets test for iSDlated children was abolished last year. In any case, the assetS fDr Austudy is particularly generous- To' fail the assets test, a farmer Dr business person must. have unleveraged equity wDrth $738,700, and these are net assets assessed at current market value, minus outstanding debt incurred in gaining Dr improving. The hDuse and acres of surrDunds are not' cDunted as assets at all. The DPPDsitiDn is saying that this dDes not take into' aCCDunt natural disasters such as drought. NDt even this gDvernment can make it rain. In· any case, hDnDurablemembers shDuld understand that Austudy is abDut educatiDn and not abDutdrought relief. When the honourable memberfDr Menzies and his cDlIeague the honourable member fDr MaranDa rose in this· HDuse, I cDuld not help feeling that it reminded· me of a cDuple of rDDsters I Dnce Dwned, who' used tDcrDW quite Dften because they believed the sun came up fDr them; ThDse DppDsite crow o'n such trivial i-sues. When substantive issues affecting educatiDn are raised in this HDuse, the cDalitiDn and particularly Dad's Army on the frontbencheveryDne here knDWS this is true-greet their intrDductiDn, let alDne their substance, with a big yawn. The DppDsitiDn simply dDes not take educatiDn seriDusly. In stark cDntrast to' the appalling perfDrmance of the DPPDsitiDn when it was in gDvernment, and mDre latterly the neglect of SChDDls by Liberal state gDvernments,this federal LabDr gDvernment has steered a remarkable revDlutiDn in educatiDn in this cDuntry. Certainly, that process is riDt cDmplete. SchDDling of fiveto' 14-year-Dlds, which is in the main the respDnsibility of state gDvernments, requires much needed additiDnal reSDurces. This is an area fDr future debate in this HDuse that wDuld be in the natiDnal interest. HDwever, Dver the last 10 years Australia hascDnsiderably raised the educatiDn levels of its wDrk fDrce. As the Minister fDr Schools, VDcatiDnal EducatiDn and Training (Mr Free) pDinted out, the propDrtiDn of yDung· peDple who nDw cDmplete secDndary school has risen from 36 per cent in 1982 to' well Dver 80 per cent. The number of students enrolled in higher educatiDn has increased frDm 335,000 test in 1983 to' 533,000 last year. TAFE cDlleges are approaching 1.8 milliDn full-time, part-time and external students, including 700,000 students in nDn-vDcatiDnal; recreatiDn and leisure cDurses. These are remarkable figures; figures which a mean-spirited DPPDsitiDn ShDUld acknDwledge but never dDes; As the minister indicated, Austudy was introduced by the federal LabDr gDvernment in 1987. I remind Dpposition members that the scheme is abDut targetirig and is abDut access to' educatiDn. The aim of the scheme is to' assist students frDm IDW incDme families, Dr whDse Dwn incDmes are IDW, to' stay in educatiDn until the end of high schOo'l and then to' gain a pDst-secDndary qualificatiDn. It is a targeted scheme; it shDuld be a targeted scheme. '. The Austudy scheme invDlves substantial expenditure of taxpayers' mDney. SpendingDn student assistance has. risen frDm $269 milliDn in 1983 to' $1.56 billiDn in 1993-94. The fed:eral gDvernment's pDlicy on incDme SUPPDrt fDr students has led to' im increase of Dver 120 per cent in the {lUmber of students receiving assistance. I remind DPPDsitiDn members that in 1983 there were 152,000 students in the schemes that preceded Au-tudy. Last year, as the minister also' indicated, 500,000 stU/:lents benefited from this scheme. Yes, there are assets limits. Perhaps it is useful to' remind hDnDurablemembers' just what. they are. FDr families with dependent students there is an assets limit of $369,350; fDr single independent students it is $110,000; and fDr married students it is a cDmbined $156,800. Austudy takes into' aCCDunt the net market, value of assets. The scheme also' applies a 50 per centdiSCDunt on cert-in business an,d farm assets. The' assets test is waived where the student's parent or SPDUSe receives certain pensiDns .from the Department of Veterans' Affairs. It is also' waived where a parent or spDuse is receiving assistance frDm farm hDusehDld SUpPDrt. Certainly, the· Austudy assets test operates on an all or nothing basis; we accept that. Income test thresholds also apply. I remind the House again that it is a targeted scheme for low income families. It is about access for ordinary kids to education. Yes, there is a personal income test, which has been modified over the past couple of years, and so there .should be. Assessable fringe benefits-this seems to be an area of concern to the opposition--:-involve the total value of fringe benefits in excess of $1,000 received in the relevant fringe benefit year through the employment by each parent or spouse in respect of organising lower salaries through the payment of school fees, private health insurance, housing, low interest loans and provision of - motor vehicle. This is income. Surely, the·'opposition does not dispute the fact that these fringe benefits are in effect income. Family income is also adjusted for dependent children in the following amounts: $3,700 for each dependent child aged 16 to 22 in full-time education; $1,200 for the first other dependent child under 16; and $2,500 for each subsequent dependent child under 16. One could mount an argument for a more generous income and assets test, but that is a bit rich coming. from the. opposition. In fact, it is outrageous for the opposition to claim that this government is disregarding the welfar- of families. Those opposite belong to the party of youth starvation wages, the party which believes that access to education should be driven by high incomes; that, irrespective of people's ability, they should get into university as they have the money. The coalition is in no position to talk about the needs and aspirations of Australian families. This is the party which was committed to slashing $20 million from payments to Australian children by raising the minimum Austudy cut-off by 50 per cent. In fact, those opposite have not abandoned that commitment. It is still there even though they do not like to be reminded of it. But let us not be misled: it is still on the opposition's policy books. In fact, an analysis shows that it would have accomplished even more than they hoped, because it would have taken more than $30 million from the pockets of Australian families. The opposition feigns moral concern in this matter; the opposition feigns indignation; and the opposition feigns concern for Australian families. But nowhere in its policies does it even think about abolishing the assets test for Austudy. Will any member opposite deny that? The simple fact is that nowhere in its policies does it even think about abolishing the assets test for Austudy. The Austudy program illustrates the tactical idiocy of the opposition in attacking the government for one of the government's greatest and most accepted programs. Austudy is about kids having access to education. It is an extremely complex scheme. It has to accommodate the enormously different needs and circumstances of over half a million Australians and their families. As the minister rightly pointed out, this is a spurious matter' of public importance, as those opposite know full well. However, as I said at the beginning, it does focus on education and this very important portfolio does deserve attention from the opposition. Unfortunately, that seldom happens. Hitting the roof with fake outrage about minor matters simply indicates that there is little in the attic. I challenge honourable members opposite' on future days in this House to raise substantive, constructive matters of education. That is right and proper. However, they would do themselves greater credit if they analysed what they are doing. (Time expired)'·",91

111,Mr LES SCOTT,REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT,"The Industry, Technology and Regional Development Legislation Amendment Bill before the House will provide"" the necessary means Reference through which Australian industry will be able to approach the next century assured that its intellectual property and innovative ideas will be accorded proper protection. In the past, Australia has failed to make the most of its innovative products and ideas. Indeed, it is really only since the present government came to office in 1983 that we have seen the expansion of the intellectual property sector. It is important to realise that the promotion of new ideas and inventions is critical to Australia's development over the next few decades. The process of making the neces-ary changes that ,will provide the conditions to transform our economic and industrial culture to an export oriented, high-tech culture is one that the government is committed to. I, welcome that initiativ-. "" It is important to realise that the recognition of Australian intellectual expertise will not only benefit theexpqrt of physical products but will also lead to an increase in international demand for Australian expertise and educational services. Indeed; as was stated in the Senate on Wednesday .last week, the foreign earnings from the tertiary education sector in 1993 were in excess of $1.2 billion, and are forecast to pass $2 billion by the 2000. The amendments to the Industry, Research and Development Act 1986 allow for the extension of discretionary grants under the industry innovation program. to the end_ of 1995. Government support of innovation by industry has been'very helpful in transforming the export sector. The MCKinsey report of June last year.stated that the activities of Austrade .' and other government support schemes contributed to the changed attitudes of many firms to exporting. Once again, this is. a very important 'initiative for improving Australia's export0PPQrtunities and balance of payments. These sorts of industry assistance programs are of the kind that actually make a difference gies. to businesses wishing to increase their levels of research - and development. They do not promote a handout mentality, _but .actually encourage the reshaping of corporate structures to, develop good ideas over time that will obtain a commercial or market outcome on their own merits. This is not Menzies-style protectionism that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) referred to on Monday. The National Party members of the opposition cannot seem to accept that the <lllYs of relying on quotas and high tariff protection are over. As unfortunate as that it is a fact of life in the modern trade world. The only way to assist industry is to come up with meaningful ideas that will enhance competitiveness and encourage innovation, The discretionary grantsscheme is aimed at thosecompanies which cannot adequately benefit from the 150 per cent tax concession for research and development purposes because they are unprofitable or have a company structure which is ineligible for the deduction. The generic technology grants scheme is aimed at supporting innovative, commercially driven research and development projects which are likely to be of particular significance to the growth of Australian industry. Five - technologies have been identified for support under the scheme: biotechnology, manufacturing and materials technQlogy, environmental technology and the two of most interest to me in. this deyear bate-information technology and communications technology. As some honourable members might recall, last Wednesday I mentioned the work of the Ipswich Regional Development Corporation in my electorate. The IRDC is a body made up of representatives of the city council, other local authorities and local business people who are heavily involved in trying to establish new and innovative industries in the Ipswich region. The corporation has a stated aim of transforming the Ipswich region into an area in which new technologies and ideas can be used, firstly, to establish new sunrise industry, and,. secondly, to make existing industries more competitive by increasing their involvement in the emerging technoloA good example of their objectives can be found in the plans to establish the Ipswich global info-links project. I suppose honourable members are wondering what that is all about. I will try to explain it. It is a joint development initiative of the IRDC and the Ipswich City. Council, It is exactly the sort of project that is needed in the Ipswich region,and I am sure in other regions in Australia. It is a great exat:nple of a small organisation thinking big. Briefly, the concept of the info-links project involves providing a link between the inforis, mation highways, which have developed through the creation of international databases, and the Ipswich region; Info-links will be incorporated into the new resource centre under construction at present. This will also house the new Ipswich City Council Library. It will enable all people, but particularly the business sector, to access the latest available information in their field of concern. Via info-links, the region will be connected to the rest of the world and will be able to build special relationships-with the business community, TAFE, universities, primary and secondary schools, community. groups, government authorities, individuals, international organisations and news services. The universityconcept will be very important. Also being pushed. in Ipswich at the moment is the establishment of a new campus, either as part of the Queensland University or the University of Southern Queensland. This will flow on from and-become a very important part of that initiative. Being able to receive' the latest information from these groups will ensure that the region becomes more competitive and innovative. To those associated with. this project I offer my congratulations. I think they are really on the right track. This project is the result of a very long process of consultation. It did not happen without a lot of hard work and lobbying on the part of the IRDC and the council. Their commitment and dedication to their goal is a promising development in the area of technological innovation in the Ipswich region. They are to be congratulated - on their efforts. The government is also enthusiastic about the info-links project-I am trying to encourage it to be enthusiastic about it and I have beeri getting a lot of encouragement from the Minister for Communications (Mr Lee)-' I have arranged for a delegation from the IRDC arid the Ipswich City Council to meet with the minister on 23 March to discuss the info-links project and to see whether there is any way the Commonwealth government can support this project. I thank the minister in advance for making that time available; I look forward to the discussions we will be. having with him. The amendment before us today also seeks to change the way Australia reciprocates with other countries in terms of our rules relating to the protection of industrial property; in other words, the level of protection provided by foreign trade mark and patent laws to Australian inventions, and the concurrent security we provide for foreign innovations. Australia is a signatory to a number of international· conventioris dealing with the protection of industrial property. At present the wording of subsection 48(1) of the Designs Act 1906 limits the definition of these conventions -- to the terms: treaty, convention, arrangement or engagement between the Commonwealth and another country. The government feels that these terms are unnecessarily limiting and could potentially inhibit the formation of reciprocal industrial property arrangements that would be in the national ipterest. During the process of trans'forming the economy into the export driven, high-tech economy it must be to survive and prosper in the next century, we must not lock ourselves out of any potentially .beneficial agreements. There is little doubt that our future does lie in a high-tech economy. Australians are particularly smart in the hightech area, and they will certainly need every encouragement from government and our community as time progresses. In August last year a memorandum of understanding, the MOU, was signed between the Australian Commerce and Industry Office and the Taiwan Bureau of National Standards. These amendments to subsection 48(1) of the Designs Act 1906 would give 'the same level of recognition to arrangements like MOUs as that given to more formalised agreements, such as treaties and conventions Honourable memberS by now know, as indeed most Australians know, how necessary it is for Australia to succeed in the reorientation of our economic interest into the Asia Pacific region. This process will be aided by the establishment of industrial property agreements with countries that may not be signatories to formal treaties. The Taiwanese MOU is very encouraging, particularly in view of the recent developments in my own electorate. A couple of weeks ago I met a trade delegation from Taiwan in my electorate office. Their visit was arranged through the auspices of the IRDC, which I mentioned - earlier. The delegation expressed interest in investing in primary and secondary industries in the Ipswich region, which includes the Brisbane and Lockyer valleys. Developments like this are extremely encouraging _for industry and will assist in the process that this amendment legislation is concerned with. The MOU signed _between Taiwan ,and Australia will provide the necessary protection for the innovativ- measures in the primary and secondary industries in the region and allow them to become commercial export earners. I do not want to take up too much time of the Housej but I would like to say now that this - legislation will provide the necessary conditions under which the research and development can power the future direction and prosperity of the economy. By amending the laws relating to trade marks, patents designs, the legislation will give producers greater incentive to increase the pace of technological change. This will lead to mercially focused research and development aimed at improving product,process and service innovation. The amendments will also allow the innovators to proceed with their plans with greater security than presently exists with regard to international protection of industrial property. The extension of the industry research and development grants, which I referred to earlier, under the industry innovation program will give further incentive to industry and will assist in the development of Australian expertise in important technobanks logical areas of the international economy. The administrative amendments to the Deare signs Act"" will streamline the process registering patents and the granting of indusoften trial property rights. I am pleased to have the opportunity to support these amendments which are before the House today. Some o(the earlier speakers today-as I said before question time todayalways have already taken the opportunity to talk small business. about a lot of the government's innovations over the last 10 or 11 years. Thoseinnovabusinesses tions have been very important. It is good to have this sort of bill before the House explain a lot of those innovations. It has been a wide-ranging debate and it has been ant both for the government and the opposioperations tion. I congratulate the minister on the tives that he has. taken in bringing forward these amendments which actually streamline a lot of things and which will help industry Australia to progress fl,lrther in these times when things are not progressing. I wish to t-lk about ,the need to assist industry. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) asked a question today about interest rates in one particular banking sector. It' is important to highlight matters. I know there is a bit of interest in the honourable member's question and he raised a very valid point. The honourable member was referring not only to the particular banks orlending institutions but to the fact that not always do we have the flexibility in the banking system that our businesses need. We and need to monitor interest rates very closely because,whilst interest rates are considered to be down at the present time; in reality they comare not always low in a lot of our lending institutions. I hope the minister will take that on board today, investigate it and take the Treasurer (Mr Willis) through those processes to ensure that the banks are brought to heel on that issue. Unless our banking industries, our lending institutions, become more flexible , in ,how they assist business, we are not going to get anywhere in assisting our industries to develop. There needs to be more flexibility. There has been a deregulation process in the banking industry over many years and the have those opportunities now to provide more flexible lending. I do not th'ink they doing as much as they can. I encourage of them to do something like that because we see that the smaller, industries which need the greater assistance, do not get the assistance they need from our banks. The big fellows are often big enough and powerful enough to negotiate the best deals. It is not the same for a lot of our people in Let us think about the number of smart in Australia and link that to the unemployment factors. It is often said that we to have 700,000 or 800,000 small businessesthere is probably a lot more than that with the importsmall family operations-and the small are the ones that do' need a lot of initiaassistance and' encouragement from their lenders. Naturally, there are some risks in those areas but banks have to be prepared to in take risks and to spread their risk in some of those areas to help those businesses. If we do not get some sort of flexibility in those areas we will need to use our opportunities in this place to say to the bankers out there in the commerce world that they must look forways to encourage and assist all the industries that those really need genuine help. We have discussed research and development ideas in this debate-all the great ideas Australians' actually have-and the fact that we cannot, get Australian industry to participate in those areas. We have a problem. It is because our lenders are probably far too conservative in their lending when it comes to picking up some of these ideas-even when looking· at trying to encourage . some mote joint ventures within Australia. Honourable members on both sides of this place realise that there are so many great Australian ideas that are lost to overseas. History is full of the great ideas that we have missed out on-there are too many forme to mention here this afternoon. Often I think it is .because there is a shortage of funding in that area. We should encourage, once again,' our lending institutions-whether itbe the existing Australian. banks or whether it be those foreign banks who want to come iflto Australia-to take a risk. Perhaps wheri.the foreign banks come here to take out their licences we should say to them, 'We want you to help our industry in this particular way'. In saying might look at niche marking in some areas. As I mentioned earlier today, we are good at research and development, through CSIRO, but after that we do not get to the manufacturing side of things. That is where we are lost and that is where.we really need to focus a lot of our efforts-it is a whole community effort as well. It is not entirely a matter for government but government needs to encourage the efforts, but we also need to encourage our banking industries and all those businesses to be more innovative in alot of their ideas. A bill Jike this is a good opportunity for us to put those sorts of things on the record, and hopefully someone will pick up on them. I am very pleased to have had the opportunity. to rise to support this bill today.",94
112,Mr VAILE,REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT,"I agree wholeheartedly with the comments of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), as far as the lack of available and appropriate finance to industry in Australia is concerned and as far as the further development of technology that we are trying to encourage here in the Industry, Technology and Regional Development Legislation Amendment Bill is concerned. Maybe if we could convince the honourable member for Oxley that he should return to the banking industrywhence he came, it certainly might improve things as well. Mr Les Scott-They would not have me back. Mr VAILE....;. The honourable member for Oxley has some good ideas. lam sure that he would improve the banking industry, the way it stands in Australia. The Industry, Technology and Regional Development Legislation Amendment.Bill··1993 that we are discussing here is quite important to Australia. We have seen a lot of technology developed in different .areas. It is probably going to help to secure that technology.Jor Australia.CertainIy, other areas in that field not addressed by this bill need to be addressed by the government to maintain that technology in Australia and also to nurture and to help develop that so we can manufacture those things rather than having. the· drain that we have seen and that the honourable member for Oxley menthat, they tioned in his address. I think it would be fair to describe this as a fairly dry piece of legislation which is non-contentious. However, I would like to discuss some important points. The main issues that I would .like to discuss today involve Australia's commitment or lack of commitment to research andoevelopment and Australia's, continued lack of attention to the brain drain that is currently ta,king place in this country. Australia . is supposed to be not only the lucky country but also the clever. country. Our competitive advantage is supposed to be found in our science and technology,our research and development and our commitment to innovation. If we listen to the speakers from both sides in the MPI this afternoon, that will continue.· The honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) told us about the increased number of people who have been retained in high schools, the· increased number of people who are going on to tertiary education in all forms, so. that we can become a highly educated country.. We can see the development of further technology that will go on in this country with the assistance and guidance of government, but we have to look beyond that. The emphasis is on research and development. But' th- government is not emphasising the ongoing development of that technology---':manufacture and marketing. Sadly,] have yet to see this happen. In my brief time as a federal member, I have had several constituents. come into my office with excellent, practical ideas that would. be an advancement for our society. in some shape or form. They have been near desperate to find some. sort of funding and support but have been unable to find it within this country. One gentleman, baving just completed a course under the government's new enterprise incentive scheme, NElS, which is one of the much touted labour market programs that the government is always talking about-I agree that it is a very good program; it is working well in my electorate-has been unable to find sponsorship, .venture capital or support for the technology that he has developed. Where is he now? He has left the country and taken his technology elsewhere. He had to go elsewhere to get funding.for the product that he had developed and to get the support to develop, manufacture and market it. Another person who had developed technology within the electorate of Lyne came into my electorate office at the end of.last year. Where industrieis he now? Ht< is in America. He had to go to America to get support to get his product off the ground, to· get support to develop and manufacture it. We must not lose our focus that towards the next century science, technology and education will be the priricipal means by which a nation secures its competitive advantage. We must start developing a national strategy to maximise our capacity in these areas,' underpinning future industrial development. We muSt start iricorporatingresearch and development into our overall approach to industry. We must start getting smarter in the way we approach these matters so that we have in place a mechanism that is able to prevent our ideas and initiatives. from going overseas; as is currently happening, We are taking a step forward h-re today, I believe, . but we are ignoring the next stage in thedeveloprnent of technology. We must focus on that from here on. To emphasise my point, an example which farmers. the government seems to enjoy drawing upon of so much is our comparative positjon within comparative the OECD. In the area of industry investment in research and development, a decade· ago venture Australian industry ranked: 17th out of24 OECD countries. Today, despite all government's rhetoric of recent years and despite an efficiency drive and lift in business effort by most businesses, our position within the OECD remains the same. As far as manufacturing is concerned, we have 'one of the lowest comparative levels of growth in the OECD in the past 15 years, despite recent growth in exports of elaborately transformed manufactures. As a merchandise exporter, Australia, fell from 18th in 1980 to 22nd in 1990. In important key east Asian markets'-':the ones that the Prime Minister (Ml"" Keating) believes our future lies withinAustralia's market share fell from 4.3 per cent in the mid-1980sto 3.8 per cent in the early 1990s. This fall in market share has been described by many, including the government's own Industry Commission, as Ii result of our declining competitiveness. Increasingly, the competitive edge in all is technology based,yet there are only about 1,000 consistent R&D performing companies in Australia. This is out of a total of around 500,000 or more. This is extremely worrying .for the future direction of this country. Developing competitive advantage is the key to our nation's future in this area. The government must start taking the hard decisions in addressing the issue of why markets are failing in this area. I think it is worth taking time to quote from the NFF's pre-budget submission for this year, which also falls into line with its industry policy submission. To its credit, the NFF has brought up this issue of market failure and has argued its case clearly and. succinctly. The NFFstates: One specific area where market failure appears to occur to some degree is in the provision of finance- . this is going back to the comments made by the honourable member f9r Oxleyto small and medium sized businesses; including In the case of debt markets, the absence a legislated requirement for banks to publish a cost of credit on their loan packageS amounts to a restraint on competition. Australia's capital markets are seriously deficient and access of SMEsthe small manufacturing enterprisesto equity capital is hampered by inadequate business structures. Recent changes to limited liability partnerships and the restrictive rules associated PDFs should be reconsidered. In the areas of innovation and R&D, we have seen market failure over the last few years. They have failed to provide sufficient competitive pressures to proquce economically and socially desirable outcomes. To be fair to this government, it has almost been forced to intervene, but it has intervened in a debilitating fashion. Instead of using government intervention in a way that overcomes market failure; the government has intervened in a negative way that has, if anything, imposed new distortions. The government must address these distortions that it has created so that R&D and industry innovation can at least be given a chance to contribute to Australia's future. In saying this, I think now is a very important time for the future of Australia's industry, with the COAG meeting in Hobart taking on board many of the Hilmer recommendations. Therefore, I call on the government to review this area of industry R&D and structure its interventionist policies so that it provides a real competitive advantage for the future of this industry. I am not saying that we should do away with government intervention altogether. I am saying that we need to review our current tariff and protectionist policies to see whether they can be used more efficiently. There are real dangers in the free market economics of economic rationalism, and I think Australia has built itself historically into a position where a positive mix can be developed and should be welcomed. HoWever, under this government, I think we are seeing in many sectors of industry an inefficient approach to government control. The area of R&D and innovation industry is a clear example of government indecision about what it perceives for the future and what it perceives its own role for the present to be. It is clearly evident. The government must put its own structure in place that actually . encourages private investment in innovation and R&D' and not as currently exists where R&D is totally hamstrung by this government. I refer here to the legislation and, in particular, the range of amendments to the with Industry Research and Development Act 1986. I welcome schemes such as the discretionary grants schemes and the generic technology grants from the government. However, if we are looking towards these industries as our future, we must be putting legislation' in place that will secure our place in the marketplace for years to come. Therefore, I will be interested to see how these legislative changes operate when they become law and to see how successful they are in furtherencouraging reform in the areas of innovation and R&D. With the recent success of the Hilmer report, we need to· identify some of the dangers of joint venture funding in the commercialisation of R&D. One company in my electorate of Lynehas already had the experience, and had its fingers burnt, of going into a joint venture with one of this· government's instrumentalities. Gerard Cassegrain and Co. entered into a joint researchartddevelopment arrangement With CSIRO. At the time, the agreement was heralded as a great example of the commercialisation of Australian research and development. The company that was formed, Cassiro, was an incorporated company owned equally by CSIRO and Cassegrain. The aim was .to maximise the economic benefit . of existing and future Australian innov!ltions through commercialisation in the best interests of Australia. Several products were launched, such as a soil slotting project. I will not go any further into the details of the outcome of this joint venture between . CSIRO and Cassegrain, but it certainly was not in the best interests of the taxpayers of Australia or of development of R&D and technology in this' country. Some very good technology was developed and it is presently located in a cupboard somewhere without gaining any benefit for the Commonwealth or the taxpayers of this country. It. will be interesting to read the Auditor-General's report into that aspect of the commercialisation of R&D. We need to welcome the opening up of R&D and innovation' to the free market. It is naturally the goal that we must strive for, but we' must be extremely wary of the dangers that are faced by this sector, such as the problems that occurred with CSIRO and the Cassegrain family. We must not sacrifice this sector in our rush. to incorporate the ideals the Hilmer report because it is a vital sector of industry that really is the future of this country. I therefore put it to the government that, while the coalition welcomes these minor administrative changes within this bill, the government must not lose sight of the need to make industry innovation and R&D a key to the future of this country. I believe the opporcannot tunity to restore some energy and vitality to this sector of the community is now before the government and this opportunity must not be lost. It must not be lost in the approaches the government is taking in protecting and en suring that the technology being developed through R&D projects is undertaken in Australia. But we have to go further.and lookat, once that is developed and realised, how we capitalise and market that technology. That is where we are losing out at the moment: we are not going on to the next stage. I often wonder why. Every constituent we bump into, when we start talking about research and development, innovations and technology development, says, 'Why are we losing all these things to overseas countries? Why. do they go to America? Why do they go to Europe? Why do they go to Britain?'. A lot stay here, but some very good developments go overseas. I hark back to the comment made by the honourable member for Oxley that we cannot fund these developments. Why can we not fund them? Is the commercial banking industry in this country not good enough to fund some of these things? Are a lot of our industries developing this technology not good enough to support financially? Having regard to the way the banking industry during the 1980s supported a lot of the entrepreneurs and got their fingers burnt, are they not good enough to support? Those· of us that are small fry, as it were, to the banking industry are paying the price for that. Mr Braithwaite-We were fried.",98
113,Mr VAILE,REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT,";-We are fried and we are paying as a result of that. There is a greater challenge before the government. This government has had an inquiry into the banking of industry and into what happened in the 1980s. The consequences are being laid upon small individuals in this country at the moment. Why have we not got in this country some government or semi-government instrumentality that can provide that venture capital to a lot of these smaller enterprises that are developing world standard technology? They get funding or support in this country, so they leave. We see them setting up in countries such as the United States of America where the government gives them all the tax breaks under the sun and provides them with interest free loans to develop factories and to develop the tooling to manufacture their technology. Then what happens? It is exported to Australia. We import products that were originally developed in this country. That is a very sad situation. The government-it does not matter whether it is the Labor government that is in power now or a future coalition government-has to address this situation because we are spending an absolute fortune in taxpayers' money in this country today educating our young people to a much higher level. We will be developing much higher technology and manufacturing new products in the future. We have to be prepared to fund the manufacture and the marketing of those products. Special consideration needs to be given to developing the tooling and the manufacturing skills and providing the venture capital to go on and market those products. Another matter that deserves comment in this debate is the fact that we need to have far more focus on and direct special consideration to the development of R&D and technology in industries that are located in regional areas of Australia. The Country Manufacturers Association of New South Wales last year conducted-I am sure that you, Mr Deputy Speaker Newell, have some members of the Country Manufacturers Association of New South Wales in your electorate-a very extensive study on a broad range of issues concerning manufacturers located outside of the metrQPQlitan areas Qf Newcastle, Sydney and WQllQngQng. It came up with SQme astounding statistics. The study fQund that they were very cQmpetitive, did nQt receive the SQrt Qf cQnsideratiQn that they shQuld be receiving from gQvernment-bQth the CQmmQnwealth and New SQuth Wales gQvernments; I will nQt ju-t lay the blame here-and that they are relieving the pr-sure, as it were, pn nQt Qnly the infrastructure but also.. the envirQnment in the Sydney basin. The Minister fQr SchQQls, VQcatiQnal EducatiQn and Training (Mr Free), who. is at the table, CQmes frQm that area Qf the Sydney basin that needs relief. AnQther study was dQne by the CQuntry MayQrs AssQciatiQn Qf New SQuth Wales, funded under the OLMA program-anQther labQur market prQgram in place at the mQment. That study highlighted the need fQr mqre cQnsideratiQn to. be given and fQr greater fQCUS to. be put Qn thQse manufacturing industries that are really mQving ahead in leaps and bQunds in a lQt Qf their R&D and technQIQgy Qutside Qf the metrQpolitan areas Qf New SQuth Wales so. that it becQmes easier fQr. them to. Qperate and so. that they can becQme mQre cQmpetitive. That will enable them to. Qperate Qn an equitable basis in their IQcality with thQse industries Qperating within metroPQlitan areas. . A big challenge there fQr the gQvernment is to. seriQusly cQnsider its apprQach to. the develQpment Qf manufacturing industries in areas such as my electorate- the electQrate Qf my cQlleague the hQnourable member CQwper (Mr Nehl) and yQur electQrate, Mr Deputy Speaker. ThQse industries are .taking the pressure Qff thQse Qverburdened areas in New SQuth Wales and the gQvernment shQuld give them greater encQuragement by way Qf better cQnsideratiQn Qf the infrastructure that is being develQped in thQse areas. Mr Braithwaite-And a better quality Qf life.",101
114,Mr VAILE,REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT,"We are prQviding a better quality Qf life.

Mr Reid (Bendigo.) (5.19 p.m.)-I support the CQmments made by my cQlleague the hQnQurablemember fQr Lyne (Mr Vaile) arid take great heart from what he had to. say. He has shQwn great enthusiasm and great SUPPQrt fQr the part that industry and technQIQgy will play in the develQpment Qf Australia. With this legislatiQn, the Industry, TechnQIQgy and RegiQnal DevelQpment LegislatiQn Amendment Bill' 1993, it is.quite QbviQUS that the gQvernment at IQng last is making SQme attempt to. recQgnise the strQng part that industry and technQIQgyplay in the develQPment pf industry and the develQpment of technQIQgy in Australia. I was delighted to. see to the change the PQrtfQliQ and the descriptiQn Of regiQnal develo.pment being included in the po.rtfo.lio. when the changes were made. It was reco.gnitio.n at lo.ng last o.f the part that regio.nal areas play in Australia -. I want to. CQmment o.n thedo.cument that was put Qut·· by the task force o.n regiQnal be develQpment entitled Developing Australia: a regional perspective. The way in which this task force develQped under the chairmanship Qf Mr Bill Kelty was quite interesting, as was the way in which it carried Qut its task. It visited a number of centres throughout Australia; no less than 60 regions were visited. After the deliberations of the task force, found myself in the' unusual receiving a copy of a media release which was forwarded to my office under the letterroad head of the task force on regional developairport, ment and entitled Task force report to boost Ballarat and Central. Highlands. I proudly indicate to the House that I represent the of Bendigo, and at the moment the honourmember able member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) at the. table. I rt!ad this release with great interest because I wanted to see what the task force was proposing for Ballarat under regionregions al development, what it would be doing for industries in that area and what it would doing' for technological development in ated regions o:utside the capital cities. I read this document which, in fact, went to spell out what the regional task force was all about. But. it made one very bad error. Quite obviously, in the word processing this particular press release the areas got mixed up. I suppose that after visiting centres the members of the task force did not quite know whether they were in Bendigo or Ballarat but they made the' following reference: There would also be the opportunity to establish a new regional development framework, improved access to Tullamarine airport and the port of MdbourneMy colleague the honourable' member for Ballarat would pe the first to agree that Ballarat probably has. the best access to Tullamarine .airport of any area in the whole of Australia. It is pal't of the national highway grid-a beautiful four-lane highway which goes all the way from Ballarat almost to the airport door. So I am quite sure a very bad error was made in this press release. I·contacted.the secretariat of the task force asking if it would mind forWarding down a Mr Kelty, was: copy of the release on Bendigo. Surprise, ... surprise! Bendigo, which has one of the worse markets highways in the state, which Tullamarine airport, does not rate a mention; it simply does not rate a mention. However, there is mention of improving the road infra.structure. I am sure the task force got it wrong, and I' have reminded it of that. I have been in contact with the task force, told it that I it got that wrong .and that it should do somesituation of .thing to correct it. There is a very real need to 'improve the links between centres like Tullamarine the capital city of Melbourne and regional centres like Bendigo.· This is one of the aspects that needs particular attention. I - rea am concerned-and I think the honourable for Lyne would share my concernis that the government's thrust in regional development includes capital cities in some of the regions. There. is concern amongst other throughout. Australia that capital cities, which already are congested and have be enormous environmental problems and associcosts, will end up getting the lion's share of any money that is put into regional develon opment because, they will be considered with other regions outside of capital cities in the allocation of funds for industry and technoof logical development. That. is a concern of mine, and lam sure it woulc:lbe a concern of 60 the honourable member for Lyne. The task force went further. It recognised the fact that one of the major impediments to the development of Australian industry is the infrastructure requirements not only in the capital cities but also in regional areas. The task force recognised that there must be new roads, fast train links to regional centres and improved port and airport facilities.·ln fact,. it went quite a long way down the track of . recommending that airport facilities should be privatised in many instances to improv:e their efficiency, so that industry and manufacturers in Australia can have access to good 9verseas flight services and transport facilit,ies so that they can get their products into' overseas markets. . An interesting recommendation from the task force, chaired by the ACTU secretary, the creation of new financial instruments and to increase the abil.ity of regions to attract connects with private investmentIt is interesting that the task force falls back upon private investment to start stimulating . the economy and get those regional pooled development. funds up and operating. I think the government would be wise to take note that, but whether it will be able to encourage private sector investment and development areas outside the metropolitan area will be task that it needs to address very seriously. The other area that attracted my attention in transport. this release was the admission by the chairman of the regional task force that the government's policy on industry matters simply not working. The second page of release states: Bendigo could also benefit from the recommendagovernment tion for a regionally sensitive industry I think the same words were included in the release for the city of Ballatat. To me, that a cle'ar admission that the government's industry policies in regional centres are simply not working. I think there is a recognithe tion there. Obviously, this task force had to these 60 centres throughput Australia, had looked at the opportunities for industry development in regional centres and had found that the government's industry policies were simply not working. Quite obviously, that recognition by Mr Kelty, the chairman, has been relayed to the government. It will interesting to see what response the governany ment gives to that report. Transport infrastructure, which I mentioned earlier, was an issue which repeatedly cropped up in any discussions of regional developarea. ment. Quite obviously, Australia is a very major manufacturing area, but it also has difficult problem of being a, large country. The additional transport costs incurred where industries are established in various locations throughout the country can be a significant impediment to the development of industry. One of the recommendations which this task force came up with was that transport infrain structure should be financed through a combihas nation of private and public investment, together with the part or total sale of major airports-which I mentioned earlier-and, for roads, the exclusive use of additional revenue from any increased petrol taxes.' Let me say to the government that any suggeStion of increased petrol taxes in country Australia would be absolutely abhorrentto its residents and would add markedly to the costs of their manufacturing enterprises as well of their domestic travel and any other business travel. Country people already pay an excesin sively high amount of fuel tax and excise a because they are reliant upon their private vehicles and their business vehicles for their ,Public transport throughout, many centres of Australia is sadly deficient. In fayt, , country manufacturers and country residents was are already paying a much higher impost on the fuel prices in regard to tax and excise. I think Mr K-Ity's recommendation to the should be discounted if there is policyto be any proper regional development throughout Australia: Weinust remember that is most of the ,food produced in Australia comes from and is processed in many regional areas. Adding another impost by way of increasing cost of fuel would impact not only on our been domestic market but also on our overseas markets because of the cost of that food. I ask the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free),.who is at the table, to relay those matters to the government because this issue is of great importance in developing the regions of Australia to' an be efficient level. These people could not bear further increases, in petrol prices.' I commend the minister at the table. I know he has had a lifetime interest in science and technology. I compliment him on his interest in this For too long in this country we have negthe lected the development of the brains in the science field. There is still a brain drain out of Australia. Young people with ability and knowledge are still' going overseas because of of a lack opportunities in this country. I know that from ,Personal experience, with two of my chilc:lren at various times living and working other countries. Fortunately, one of them come back, but one is still away, waiting for the Australian economy to improve and for an opportunity of employment back here in Australia; That is just one isolated example; there are many thousands of examples throughout Australia. I think it is great that young people take the ,opportunity to go overseas and develop their skill and expertise, but I would like to think that, ultimately, after they have gathered' that information and as knowledge, they will be able to come back to this country and put that knowledge and expertise to good use for the development of this .country, particularly in the fields of industry and technology. I think it is import!:lnt.. I think the two volumes of the report· from the task force· on regional development have been handed back to the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Griffiths), who was the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development at that time. I am a little uncertain at the moment about where the industry portfolio is really moving. We will be waiting with great interest to see what the government does in response to that report and what the new minister who has the responsibility for industry and technology does with the response to it, because it is absolutely crqcial to Australian industry and technology and the development of this nation. I know that the most revered wish. of manufacturers and industry in this country is for government to get out of the way, to reduce some of the restrictions and impedimentS and red tape that surround their activities, and to allow business to get on and become internationally competitive and efficient and to develop Australia's industry to a very high .level.",102
115,Mr WAKELIN,REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT,"As stated in the preamble of the Industry, Technology and Regional Development·Legislation Amendment Bill, this bill makes uncontentious amendments to current legislation. As such, I do not have any objections to it. I however, have objections to the government's treatment of regional development. I have yet to see a government bill which leads me to believe that the Australian Labor Party is looking after regional Australia. My electorate of Grey can be described as regional. I can say without exaggeration that the government has made the task of development for Grey a very hard one. In fact, I can recall no substantial development or injection of jobs in Grey since the establishment of Olympic Dam, apart from the recent $100,000 grant to one of the regional cities during the state election campaign. However, this money pales into insignificance when we consider the rises in excise, which the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) mentioned. Of course, we have the wholesale sales tax as well. The excise and the wholesale sales tax were collected in a matter of weeks. By that standard, the government funding injection is insignificant. Olympic Dam was very strongly opposed by Labor. Olympic Dam, which is a real jewel in South Australia-and certainly in the electorate of Grey-is based on the latest technology in mining. If we look at Labor's record on this matter, we see that it was opposed not on a technological basis but on environmental grounds and an opposition to uranium mining, but it does typify this government's· role in and attitude to regional development. If it were not for the courage of one Labor. man, Roxby Downs, or Olympic Dam, would be just a few test holes in the desert. Woomera is another community in the electorate which would benefit greatly from improvements in industry policy and in the application of technology through the Australian Space Agency, particularly, and through the technology of satellites and any other option that the new technologies might offer. The Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) has made his views quite clear about the future of Nurrungar. Whilst it is not proven at this stage, I think we all must be aware of it. The community of Woomera would very much appreciate every opportunity made by this parliament to apply new technologies and do, use the facilities that are currently lying relatively idle at Woomera. I mentioned Olympic Dam and the encouragement that the Liberal government gave to that project. I also mentioned the opposition . that came froth the Labor Party at that time. In my electorate, the Liberal goverriment was also behind the power station at Port Augusta, the Moomba gas fields, Stony Point, and Whyalla's great period of expansion during the Playford - ra. I have to go back that far to look at when Grey, and electorates like Grey, had significant development. It stands in contrast to what we have seen from the Labor Party. At Whyalla we saw the shipyards close down and the steel industry simply contract. On Monday the honourable member f()r Herbert (Mr Lindsay), who I acknowledge has had an interest in regional development, said: I have found that in the many and diverse parts of Australia there are many people who have a strong desire to make their community fully participate in Australia's development. A key role of this ment will be to tap into that desire and harness it I .say to the honourable member· that this desire to fully. participate has been with regional Australia for a v-ry long time-:-Iong before he discovered it. Further, regional Australia has. been participating and doing more than its fair share. It has been producing most of this country's exports for over 200 .years. I also believe that the honourable member for Herbert's use of the word 'harness' was unfortunate. It describes rather aptly the government's tying down, its restriction, of regional development. Rather we should be considering, as the highest priority,. the harnessing of our technology, our people and equally as' important our private .enterprise ethic, particularly that of small business, which sadly this government .with .its 'corporate approach loses track of. The government has made a habit. of putting hurdles in the way of regional. development. We have already mentioned fuel excise, but I will mention 'it again for the record. The Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall) yesterday described fuel excise and other increases in taxation in the last' 12 months as minor matters. I will keep reminding him of these minor matters for I know that the regions do not regard the price of fuel as minor. This minor. matter, the fuel excise, collects $8.4 billion for the government coffers. This minor matter will collect an extra $788 million in 1993-94 as a result of the government's hiking up the price of fuel. This minor matter touches everything we do in my electorate. Yesterday I· questioned the Minister for Resources on the impact of the budget tax increases on our exporters, particularly our agricultural exp()rters. This is the irony of regional development; we get· so carried away with the mood of the moment that we forget that our agricultural exporters still offer great potential for· development. The productivity rates are still double the national average. In reply to my question about the tax increases on exporters; the minister said that the diesel fuel rebate of $440 million was far bigger than any increases in taxes imposed on govern- exporters. The budget increase in general sales tax alone is estimated to raise. an extra $435 million for the government in 1993-94; added to that, tens of millions of dollars have come from the wine tax and $788: million from the fuel excise, which we have already mentioned. While it is true that s()me exporters derive relief through the diesel fuel rebate scheme, the manufacturing and tourism industries must pay for the full impact of the fuel excise increase. All export industries are affected by ·the increased costs of road,rail and coastal shipping transport since all of these modes will pay the full increase in fuel excise. On top of the government's hike in the price of fuel, the regions face a differential pricing policy-the honourable member for Bendigo touched on this-where suppliers of fuel in the regions cannot·buy fuel for the same price ·as their city counterparts can retail it. We hear much criticism from this government about the view that ·we should let the market rule. It is a politically selective process which ignores what the market· is doing presently. I repeat, because I think the. Labor government does not understand it, that the price of fuel. touches everything we do in regional electorates. An article by Julian Cribb in the Weekend Australian drew attention to the population drift from regional Australia. Mr Cribb had to dig deep to find this information because it is not abundant. I dare say that it is not information which this centralist government is terribly concerned about. The article stated that of the 240 communities that shrank in 1990-91,210 were in regional areas. That is, 88 per cent of communities that shrank in size ·in this nation came from regional Australia. After reading this article, I studied a report on population growth arid predictions for Australia and my own electorate. Not surprisingly, the report found that the top 20 areas for growth were municipalities of the six main capital cities. The report ranked 65 cities on their expected population growth. Town number one could expect the most growth, town number 65 could expect the least. The largest town in Grey is Whyalla, which ranked 58 in the list of 65. In fact, Whyalla had a negative ranking. Its population is expected tofall from about 26,000 in 1991 to 22,000 by the year 2000. Whyalla, as many honourable members would know, is the site of the BHP steelworks and' a former shipyard. It is an industrial town that is desperate for new enterprises. The state government has come to the party by declaring WhyaUa an enterprise zone with tax incentives to attract investment. The new Liberal state government has also met with potential investors to discuss newventures for Whyalla. I cannot recall any federal government initiatives. According to the population report, all other regional centres. my electorate face a declining populationthere is no expected growth: Cities, of course, have the communications, the transport services, the schools, the. post offices, the banks and the TV channels which people want. These services are gradually being withdrawn from regional centres, helped in no small part by the centralist attitude of this government. People living in regional Australia do not give up easily; however, some are becoming pessimistic about the future of their regions. An excellent report on the rural crisis, commissioned by the district council of Cleve and released in December last year, carried a survey of 50 local business operators. It asked the businesspeople whether they felt Cleve was losing or gaining from the rural recession in contrast with other towns. Almost 50 per cent of the. business people said they were losing while only 14 per cent felt that they were gainirig. We are entering critical territory when local business people feel so pessimistic. - egions have a wealth of ideas for new indllstry and development, however they are faced with what has become an increasingly distant and arrogant federal government which '.' thinks it knows best. We need to listen to the region, show a lead for development and give maximum encouragement and confidence to investors. That is what the regions need, but will they get it? So far all they have got is Bill Kelty and his task force on regional development. Kelty's task force has been criticised by almost everyone who· has commented on it. One damning statement came from the previous Labor minister Peter Walsh, who said in the Australian Financial Review last month: Having set the Taskforce up, the Government will feel obliged to throw some' money. at its silly recommendations. I fear he may be right. However, the new Minister for Industry Technology - md Regional Development (Senator Cook), on taking on the role, said that the era of the handout mentality was over. One of the hallmarks of this government has been its handQut philosophy. While some sections of society, and it in just depends on which section we find ourselves in, need. support:-such as our aged widows, who do not get it-others need encouragement and not handouts. Encouragement from this government is sadly lacking. Where is the incentive for people to take the risk to set up the-r own business? Where is the incentive for people to take responsibility for their destiny and contribute to Australia's wealth? It is a great irony of research and development in this country that, although .we have ideas out there by the bucketful, I think only one in six come to frllition. It comes down to individuals being prepared to have a go and risk their effort, dollars and time to get these new concepts and new technologies going. That is what this country lacks. The federal government makes many demands on business, which it does not bother itself with because a good old whiteboard will suffice. When a person contemplates setting up a smalI business he or she must also contemplate our convoluted superannuation system, which is particularly difficult for casual employees to benefit from; the training guarantee levy; workers compensation; and·a myriad. of legal requirements. Employers are also looking down the barrel of the government's Industrial Relations Reform Bill. I have the word 'reform' in quotation marks on this page which I am reading from. I note that the Business Council Bulletin also placed that word in quotations hi an artic1elast week. I guess that is what we would expect; it is.an adversarial situation. But I think at the end of the day the Business Council and the trade union movement ultimately have to take joint responsibility and a joint approach which serves the national interest. In other words, the government's bill can only make things harder for the unemployed, not easier. The Business Council also described the government's I;:onsultation with business employer groups as perfunctory during negotiations on the bill. The bill was damned as a missed opportunity. S6 there we have two of the government's latest ideas to pull Australia out of the mire-the Industrial Relations Reform B'ill and the jobs levy-which were dumped on by the Business Council. Thankfully, the jobs levy seems to be attraCting less and less support from those opposite. The honourable member for Herbert stated on Monday that. the government wished to preserve and enhance the institutions that have served the Australian people well. I think the Labor government has forgotten one of our greatest institutions-the institution called regional Australia. I look forward to the release of the industry statement later this year and I hope that it contains some incentive for regional Australians to hang in there because regional Australians are receiving precious little incentive from this government. These are the points on regional Austmlia which I wanted to highlight today in the context of the Industry, Technology and Regional Development Legislation Amendment Bill. I do not oppose the bill. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.

As was foreshadowed in the second reading speech by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Lindsay), the government is moving 17 amendments to. the schedule to the Industry, Technology and Regional Development Legislation Amendment Bill consequent on the amendments to the bill agreed to in the Senate. None of the amendments are monumental. They do, however, tidy up the legislation and remove any unintended effects or ambiguities. The majority of the amendments,namely, those numbered 1 to 3, 7 to 9 and 12 to 15, do no more than remove the reference to regulations made under this act or any other act consequent on and consistent with Senate amendment Nos 1,3 and 5. Amendment Nos 4 and 15 as proposed in this House by the government omit the now redundant changes . to section 8A of the Designs Act and section 11 of the TradeMarks Act as originally proposed in the bill. The remaining amendments, Nos 5, 6, 10, 11, 16 and 17, are consistent with the intent of the Senate amendments but remove unintended and undesirable effects that would flow. from the amendments as they currently stand. For instance, amendments Nos 5, 6, 16 and 17 will avoid any question arising as to whether 'employee' in the Designs Act and the. Trade Marks Act would have a different meaning from that in the Public Service Act. There is no. doubt at present that the meanings are the same. However, the new reference to a 'prescribed employee' within the meaning of the Public Service Act, which .is to be included in the new section 8A of the Designs regula- Act and the new section 11 of the Trade Marks Act, might import a meaning different from just 'employee' within the meaning of the the Public Service Act. It is not certain what the difference might be, but amendments Nos 5, 6, 16 and 17 avoid the question ever being raised. Other unintended effects of the Seriate amendments as they currently stand flow from the amendment of the definition of 'employee' in the Patents Act. In order to provide for parliamentary scrutiny of the delegation of powers by the Commissioner of Patents, the bill proposes that .it will be necessary to prescribe the person to whom these powers could be delegated. This was intended to be achieved by revising the definition of 'employee'. However, that has the undesirable effect, for example, of exempting employees - other than those prescribed as being able to exercise delegated powers-from the statutory prohibitions of trafficking in inventions and disclosing without authorisation information about the matters before the commissioner. Proposed amendment Nos 10 and 11 will amend the Patents Act with the same effect as the amendments to the delegation provisions of the Design Act and the Trade Marks Act but without the' unintended and undesirable effects. The supplementary explanatory: memorandum explains these proposed changes. Amendments agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to.

The amendments from the Senate do not take into account a lot of - the advantages of the hOme child-care allowance. I want to - say few words about some of the advantages of the hoine child-care allowance, HCCA, and about some of the mattei's that were brought up in the Senate by ,the opposition with support of the Independents, excluding - the Australian Democrats. The government's proment posals for the home child-care allowance-were designed to provide significant advantage over the dependent spouse rebate, DSR. ' There are a number of advantages. Firstly, therels a inore'direct recognition of the support given to children by parents, generally mothers; who stay at home to raise their children. For the first time this support will paid direct to the parent caring for the children rather than to the other partner as a tax concession. Some 840,000 families are expected to receive the HCCA at anyone time. I' ordiIt will be paid at a higher maximum rate of some $60 a fortnight, almost $6 a fortnight higher than the with-child' rate of dependent spouse rebate. About 55,000 families whose tax liability was too low to get the full value of the \Vith-child DSR will receive up to, $60 a fortnight extra. There is greater responsiveness to families' needs than there is under the DSR because of an income test on current income rather than on income over the financial year. This will allow a parent leaving the work force at any t-me during the year to care. for children to get' the HCCA. This will help an estimated 120,000 families whose circumstances change within any year. In addition, there is a far more generous income test for dependent children for the DSR. A child is not considered dependent and rate cannot attract a DSR where the income exceeds $1,785 a year. In contrast, for the HCCA purposes, a child is still considered to be a dependent child if it has income up to $5,860 a year. Overall, the HCCA will cost $1.13 billion each year, an additional $230 million ort the cost of the with-child dependent - spouse rebate and will advantage some 840,000 families. The coalition and the Independents in the Senate are holding all these families to ransom with their proposed amendments which the government· cannot and will not accept. a 'I tum to some points relating to the amendments and to some of the explanations that I believe are absolutely correct in refuting what has been said in the other place. Amendment the No. 1 seeks· to·' change the definition of 'income"" used to calCulate a person's entitleto HCCA.·· The' definition proposed by the government is' one based on existing social security concepts of: income used for other purposes under the Social Security Act. The amendment would incorporate instead a concept of income used in taxation legislation for the separate net income or SNI' test that is used to determine the amount of a tax rebate. be The coalition claims that this would assist many families; for example, under HCCA income from shares is assessed at a rate. of return based on capital growth and dividends paid over the previous 12 months. The DSR only assesses income from dividends. However, for this to affect eligibility for the lICCA, the shares wQuld generally have to be the only income held by the dependent spouse. Any other investments would already be counted in the DSR testand only if the shares were purchased after August 1992- Unrealised capital growth on shares purchased before this time is not assessed. The numbers affected by this would be tiny. Having different definitions of income would bring confusion to both clients and administrators and the following disadvantages. Firstly, the SNI definition of income is. embedded in the concept of the financial year. would remove access to the HCCA on a current income test basis. This would deny the HCCA to at least an extra 120,000 families at anyone time that would otherwIse not receive the with-child DSR. One of the significant changes of the HCCA is outlined above. The SNI definition would include a number of items of income: for example, the remote area allowance, rental assistance and the pharmaceutical allowance. This impact JaIls largely on those who are or have been on very low incomes. Lastly, the HCCA is paid during a year in advance of entitlement being determined. It may prove not to have been correctly paid. This could give rise to the recovery of substantial overpayments from clients. The second amendment would change the conditions of qualification for the HCCA for certain families. In all of these cases, the government's proposed legislation would allow families access to the dependent spouse rebate at the without-child rate of $1,188 per year. The net effect for a small number of families is that there would be a disadvantage of a maximum of $4.56 a week compared with what they currently get through the DSR. The government's best estimate is that only a very small number of families would be in this group. I must also stress that families would be affected by these tighter provisions only if all children or an only child were ineligible. For example, in about half the families with student children, a younger child would continue a family's entitlement to the HCCA. 1 want to raise a few other matters that seem to concern our colleagues in the Senate. One of them is overseas payments. In transferring the HCCA into the social security system, the government has tried to align it as closely as possible to. the family payments structure. The basic family payment is payable if the family is tempo-arily absent for up to three years. The additional family payment is only payable overseas for up to 13 weeks if only one partner . is away and both the children and other partner remain in Australia. The HCCA will be paid overseas for up to 13 It weeks if the children or one or both partners travel. Extending the period to match that of the DSR would make it far more generous than all the other family payments. Another concern expressed involves children receiving Austudy and other pres-ribed educational allowances. For the most part, Austudy students do not attract the with-child rate of DSR. This is because Austudy is paid at a minimum of $1,040 for those under 18 years or $1,219 for those aged 18 and over. The DSR cuts out when the student's own inCome is $1,785, and the income taken into account is Austudy plus any other income. The number of cases where a student's total income is between $1,040 and $1,785 is small. .. Another concern involves the payment of the HCCA until the dependent chHd is 25 years old. The age of 25 that is contained in the current with-child rate of the dependent spouse rebate is long standing. There are doubts that it currently represents social reality. It is extremely difficult to justify a parent needing to. be at home caring for a child aged 24. Mr Brereton....;... Twenty-four? Mr SCIACCATwenty-four. Allowing students up to the age of 25 to be counted as dependents would be contrary to other social security programs, which cater only for those at secondary school and those no older than 18. The age limit at which parental income testing ceases in the Austudy program is now 23 years and will reduce further in the future. None of the changes in the amendments are costly in program terms. Indeed, we expect that amendment No. 1 will save possibly in the order of $60 million in a full year. However, further work would need to be done on costing the administrative effects of all the changes. In conclusion, overall, the government firmly believes that the amendments proposed by the Senate would create confusion, significantly withdraw one of the major advantages of the HCCA and create anomalies in the government's policies for supporting families. Therefore, the government rejects them quite emphatically.",105
116,Mr RUDDOCK,REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT,"Berowra) (6.05 p.m.)Firstly, I. very much regret the intrusion of blackmail into this matter. I notice that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca) said that, in pursuing these amendments, whiCh do justice to families who have been seriously misled, we might be holding to ransom 840,000 families who would benefit. I regard that proposition as absolutely outrageous. I am sorry that there are not too many people here to hear it.· . Mr Sciacca:""""There's nO""7one here to hear it, so what's the point of saying it? You know it's not true.",112
117,Mr RUDDOCK,REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT,It is absolutely true. Mr Sciacca-What about the ones that you are holding to ransom? ,112
118,Mr RUDDOCK,REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT,"I heard the use of the words 'holding to ransom'. He has repeated them. The parliamentary secretary is attempting to blackmail those families who will suffer as a result of the government's billthe. Social Security (Home Child Care and Partner Allowances) Legislation Amendment Bill-and the way in which these proposals are being implemented by saying, 'If we seek to do justice to those families, we, the governforeshadowed ment, will withhold the passage of this bill'. If that is the government's objective, I say quite clearly that we will take on this matter and continue to press· these amendments. Let me make it very clear to the parliamentary secretary-he may not have been aware of this and he may not have read my press statements, which foreshadowed clearly what we were about on this matter-that this bill is one in which the government, in its consideration of the matter, had before it a promiSe by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). The promise of the Prime Minister was that the Keating government will· increase. the dependent spouse rebate and pay it directly to the spouse who is at home caring for children. He also said that the new home child-care allowance will be $30 a week and will provide some source of independent inc;ome for women at home who are caring for children. He never said that it would exclude some of those people who are now eligible for the dependent spouse rebate. We know in consideration of this matter that it was not. until the opposition did t-e work-it was never made clear in the second reading speech of the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) or the speech by the parliamentary secretary-that we made it clear that numbers of families were going to be worse off. If those who are now benefiting from the d-pendent - pouse rebate were transferring inadequately into the social security system, they would no longer receive these benefits. I, my staff and the parliamentary library undertook extensive research and an examination of both the taxation and social security systems. The fact is that the government could have addressed this matter at that time. We were concerned that the government had seriously misled people. I raised it in the debate in this House when this bill was last before us. I foreshadowed that in the Senate we would be seeking to have this bill postponed; that is, the Senate would defer the committee stage of the bill until after the government had drafted amendments, which would prevent these families from being excluded from the HCCA. The fact is that we very clearly to the government that there were these groups. The parliamentary secretary has not denied it. He has tried to say that they are small numbers and that it is not significant. He then came up with this argument in relation to those aged between 18 and 25 in full-time education who now benefit. He said that that benefit should not have been made available in today's society. If the Prime Minister had intended to make that change, he could have foreshadowed that quite clearly in his promise to people so that, when they voted on it, they would know that they were going to .lose the benefit. We said to the government, 'Honour your promise. Amend your legislation. We '11 give you time to make these amendments in the Senate and we'll even let you do the drafting'. But the government said that it was not prepared to buy that. The parliamentary secretary would know that Senator Harradine said, 'I'll have a go at the drafting. Give me a day or so', and the Senate agreed to that. Senator Harradine brought forward some amendments to achieve this objective, which we support. The government says that those amendments will have unforeseen consequences. All I am saying to the parliamentary secretary is that, if he is of good faith, he should withdraw the bill and talk to us about amendments that will achieve the government's objectives and our objectives. They are perfectly compatible. The amendments can be drawn up. I am not seeking that this bill with its amendments should have unforeseen c()nsequences. I am conscious of the difficulty associated with drafting provisions of this sort, but we are not letting the parliamentary secretary, his government or his Prime Minister off the hook on this matter. The government has severely misled the families of Australia since the last election not only this matter but on a whole host of other matters which have been before this parliament and which we have commented on. On 1 January, when the government implemented certain other social security changes, it· reduced the income ceiling for the basic family payment for· families with one child from $64,938 to $60,000 and it reduced the additional amount allowed for each child from $3,249 to $3,000. In the same legislation- the government reduced the existing assets test value limit for the basic family payment from $607,250 to $550,000. The· government applied the family payment income and assets test to new student parents. The government was also involved with amendments to legislation which took employer provided fringe benefits into account in the income test for the family payment. The government also took family foreign income into account in the income test for family payment. None of those matters was the subject of any announcement in the election, yet they clearly would have been drafted, ready and able to be pursued by the government when it came back into office, as turned out to be the case. If the government were of good faith, those matters would have been· dealt with at that time. After the government had mouthed all these slogans that families with children often have greater financial needs and that it is up to us as a society to ensure that the. next generation is clothed, fed, sheltered and educated-that was a quote from the Prime Minister-it sought to remove benefits from some families. . What we are doing with this legislation is another sleight of hand. People who had a clear entitlement to the dependent spouse rebate are now being told,. 'When we transfer it into the social security system, I'm terribly sorry old chum, you're an anomaly. We can't provide these benefits for you'. When Australian aid workers, working for one of the important non-government organisations that the Australian government supports, are sent overseas to undertake work for their agency and they take their family offshore with them for a year or so, because they are still Australian taxpayers and Australian residents on offshore, they are entitled to the dependent spouse rebate. But, if they go away. for more than 13 weeks, the government saysthitt they ate not entitled to the home child-care allowance payment. Clearly, Australian aid organisations will be disadvantaging many of their workers offshore as a result of these· changes. That is not the only group. It can affect public servants. But when I raised the issue of public servants, the government said, 'We can make it up to them because they're our employees\ But it is too bad for aid workers; it is too bad for Australian· academics going overseas on extended leave as part of their furlough or sabbatical. Their families can suffer. If people working for an Australian.·company are transferred overseas, their employer may be able to make up for this disadvantage that they will suffer, but the government will make a saving. , This is an unforeseen consequence. But the parliamentary secretary tells us that there is not a great deal of money involved in this; it is just difficult. We knew it was difficult, we have shown the government that amendments can be drafted to achieve this objective. Quite clearly, we will be rejecting the government's proposal to refuse this request, but I do hold out an offer to the parliamentary secretary, as I did in a letter. I wrote to the minister today concerning this matter. We are not seeking to be difficult. We believe that the government ought to be accountable for its trickery. We believe that those people who were entitled to believe that they would receive this benefit should still be eligible to receive it. We are quite happy to allow the matter to be deferred either here or in the Senate for the necessary number of days-an.d I expect it would be only daysfor the government to get the expert advice of Office· of the Parliamentary Counsel and to undertake the drafting. Let it be clearly understood that this offer was made originally and the government rejected it. Senator Harradinesaid that he could get the amendments drafted within a day, and he did. The Senate has supported them. If the government believes that they will have unforeseen consequences, then it should articulate them clearly and make the amendments in the time that is available to it. But it should not try this line that it intends to blackmail the opposition over this matter and that it intends to say, 'We will deny to 840,000 Australian families their entitlement under this bill because the opposition has proposed amendments to ensure that all of those who receive the promise benefit'. The government should not try to blackmail us. That sort of trickery and blackmail, will bring the parliamentary secretary and his coll-agues very much unstuck. I am quite prepared to stomp up and down the country, making sure that people know that the government is quite prepared to use those families as a weapon of blackmail and as a weapon with which to ransom this issue. I do not believe that any Australian would give the gov,ernment credit for that. I think they would see it for the shabby, tricky statement that it was. It did the parliamentary secretary no service at all to have made that threat. I encourage him to retrieve the situabut tion for his colleagues and to take the opportunity to step back and have a go at drafting amendments that will achieve the government's objectives and ours. I assure the parliamentary secretary of my willingness to sit down in good faith to ensure that objective is reached. Question put: That the requested amendments be not. made; The House divided.

FOREIGN EVIDENCE BILL 1993 Cognate bill: NA (TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS AND CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1993 Consideration resumed from 10 February. Second Reading MrDUNCAN (Makin-Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General) (6.29 p.m.)I move: AYES That the bill be now read a second time. Simmons, D. W. This bill has three purposes. First, it provides new procedures for enabling authenticated foreign testimony to be admissible, subject to appropriate safeguards, in certain criminal and civil proceedings. Secondly, it includes provisions to implement the Hague Convention Abolishing the Requirement of Legalisation for Foreign Public Documents. And finally it re-enacts, with minor changes, parts IIIB and IIIC of the Evidence Act 1905. The new procedures for enabling foreign testimony to be used are in parts 3 and 4 of the bill. Part 3 makes foreign testimony and exhibits authenticated in a prescribed manner provided to Australia pursuant to requests made by or on behalf of the Attorney-General admissible in evidence, subject to specific exclusions in the interests of justi<;:e. The part will apply in any court conducting criminal proceedings in relation to Commonwealth offences and related civil proceedings. Related civil proceedings cover civil proceedings arising from the same .subject matter from which the relevant criminal proceeding arose. They include proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987, the Customs Act 1901 or proceedings for the recovery of tax, or of any duty, levy or charge payable to the Commonwealth. To provide national uniformity, the states and territories may request the Commonwealth to. apply the part, by regulations, to PAIRS criminal proceedings or related civil proceedings in their courts for offences against the law of thatjurisdiction. To ensure that traditional· evidentiary safeguards are. not undermined, the legitimate rights of the accused will be protected by way of the court having a wide discretion to refuse to admit foreign material. The court will be required to take certain specified matters into account when exercising its discretion, but will. not be limited to those matters. There are also other safeguards, such as the requirements of authentication by the foreign country and certification by the Attorney-General and the non-admissibility of certain material. Under the present law, documentary foreign material available pursuant to mutual assistance treaties or arrangements frequently cannot be admitted into evidence unless witnesses are made available to give oral testimony in conformity with the traditional rules of evidence. Currently, only a small proportion of the material received from foreign countries is admissible as evidence without a foreign witness giving oral testimony in Australia. It is costly and cumber,. some to make a foreign witness available in Australia. Implementation of the part is expected to reduce the need for foreign witnesses to be made available, thereby lowering the overall cost of obtaining foreign evidence and improving the capacity of the courts to have regard to all relevant material received from foreign countries pursuant to requests by or on 'behalf of the Attorney General. Implementation of the part will improve the effectiveness of mutual assistance in criminal matters arrangements and thereby assist' in complex prosecutions involving foreign evidence. A resolution passed by the National Complex White Collar Crime Conference in Melbourne in June 1992 called for action' to overcome such deficiencies. Part 3 meets the concerns expressed in the resolution, whilst continuing to protect the legitimate rights of the accused. Part 4 of the bill sets out a similar scheme, adapted to meet the specific needs of the Australian Securities Commission in civil proceedings arising from. the Corporations Law and the ASC law where the ASC is a litigant. The part will facilitate the admissibility of foreign evidence in such proceedings. The globalisation of capital markets in the past few. years has required business regulatory agencies such as the ASC to liaise and offer assistance to each other in carrying out their regulatory functions. This will often result in requests by the ASC to foreign agencies for information, testimony and documents where the ASC is involved in civil proceedings. Part 4 provides the ASC with the statutory framework to ensure that so far as practicable foreign material is successfully admitted in civil proceedings in which the ASC is a party. The bill contains provisions,in part 5, implementing the Hague Convention Abolishing the Requirement of Legalisation for Foreign Public Documents,so that Australia can accede to the convention. The convention abolishes the requirement, imposed by many countries, for legalisation of foreign public documents. Legalisation is a system for authenticating an official document by certificates. Often a chain of certificates is required, and where the docliment is used in another country, frequently the final certificate is given, upon payment of a fee, by an official of a foreign embassy or consulate of the country where the document is to be used. The convention provides for the issue by a convention country of a single certificate which is sufficient evidence to authenticate the signature or seal on the original document. While the convention is concerned specifically only to abolish legalisationby a diplomatic or' consular official of the country in which the public document is to be produced, the effect of the convention is also to render unnecessary previous certificates in a legalisation chain. After accession Australian residents sending foreign public documents to countries which normally require legalisation, but which are parties to the convention,' will be able to obtain a certificate from an Australian authority, rather than having to get the documents legalised by foreign diplomatic or consular officials. Finally, the bill substantially re-enacts, with minor modifications, parts I1IB and I1IC of the Evidence Act 1905. This is because the rest of that act is being replaced by other legislation. Part 2 of this bill, which replaces part I1IB of the Evidence Act 1905, provides for obtaining testimony from .a person in another country by means of an order for examination of the, person, issue of a commission for examination of the person, or issue of a letter of request to the judicial authority of a foreign country to take the person's evidence. Part 6 of this bill, which replaces part I1Ie of. the Evidence Act 1905, sets out a procedure by which the Attorney-General can prevent, pn national security grounds, testimony being given or documents or things being produced in Australia for proceedings before a foreign court. The bill will. provide less expensive means of obtaining some foreign evidence but is not expected to have a significant impact on Commonwealth expenditure or revenue. It-ble the explanatory memorandum for the bl11. FOREIGN EVIDENCE (TRANSITIONAL NA AMENDMENTS) BILL 1993. This bill is consequential upon the Foreign Evidence Bill 1993 and sets out transitional arrangements for that bill and makes consequential amendments to the Evidence Act 1905. Likewise, that bill is expected to have little impact on Commonwealth expenditure or revenue. I table the explanatory memorandum to that bill and commend both bills to the House.",112
119,Mr WILLIAMS,PROVISIONS AND CONSEQUENTIAL,"Tangney) (6.37 p.m.)The Foreign Evidence Bill 1993 attempts to simplify the means by which foreign evidence can be ,introduced in some criminal and civil proceedings in Australian courts. This is a reference to part 3 and 4. It also re-enacts with some variations provisions of the Evidence Act 1905, dealing with the examination of witnesses abroad and the taking of evidence for proceedings in foreign courts. This is a reference to parts 2 and 6 respectively. also implements the requirements of an international convention dealing with the authentication of foreign public documents in part 5. While the bill is .designed to stand on its own, it is, being introduced by the government as part of a package of whol!!sale reform of federal al)d potentially state evidence law. Evidence Bill 1993 was introduced into the House of Representatives in December last year. That bill basically seeks to rewrite the law of evidence at the· federal level. The government hopes that states will follow suit and introduce complementary legislation, with the ultimate aim of achieving broadly similar ev.idence laws in all Australian jurisdictions. It is yet to be seen whether that proposal will obtain the support of all state and territory governments. The merits or otherwise of the Foreign Evidence Bill can be considered in isolation from the Evidence Bill,· but the relationship between the two bills does give rise to some technical issues concerning the application of other laws. These issues will need to be worked out if the Evidence Bill is passed. The Foreign Evidence Bill is not opposed by the coalition. Broadly, the objectives sought to be achieved by the bill are worthwhile. There are some questions concerning the particular methods by which those objectives are to be achieved. Part 2 re-enacts with some variations part IIIB of the Evidence Act 1905. It sets ()ut the procedures for examination of witnesses outside Australia pursuant to court order after the commencement of proceedings in Australia. It applies to criminal and civil proceedings in courts exercising federal jurisdiction. Given that the part essentially re-enacts existing law, it is in itself uncontroversial. However, in a recent case, the constitutionality of some provisions of part 2 has been challenged. I will refer to that briefly later. Part 3 of the bill is new. As the law stands, there are very few situations where foreign material is admissible in Australian courts without the foreign witness .giving oral testimony in Australia. A resolution of the National Complex White Collar Crime Conference It in June 1992 called for action to reduce the need for foreign witnesses to be made available. Part 3 is designed to improve the effectiveness of arrangements for mutual assistance in criminal matters and thereby to assist in complex prosecutions involving foreign evidence. The part applies to criminal proceedings in The Australian courts dealing with an offence against the law of the Commonwealth; It applies to civil proceedings only to the extent that the civil proceedings are related to criminal proceedings, that is, a civil proceeding arising from the same subject matter from which the criminal proceeding arose. Examples are proceedings for recovery of tax or a duty payable to the Commonwealth or proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987. A mechanism is provided for the provisions to apply to state courts dealing with state laws if agreed to by the state. A request for foreign testimony and any accompanying exhibits must be made by the Attorney-General. Presumably, the relevant law enforcement agency will request that the Attorney-General make the request. ,It, is necessary that the testimony obtained be certified by the foreign country. Once the material is before a court, the court must not allow the material to be adduced if the person who gave the testimony is in Australia and is able to attend the ing, or if the evidence would otherwise have been inadmissible. The court is otherwise given a discretion to exclude the material. Specific matters are listed which the court must take into account in exercising that discretion. However, the court may also take into account any other relevant matters it wishes to take into account. The question arises why under part 3 the procedures are limited to proceedings which involv- or have a relationship with criminal proceedings. A related question is why the provisions are designed for the benefit of law enforcement agencies only, rather than the accused in' criminal proceedings or the defendant in civil' proceedings. ,These questions are answered when it is recognised that part 3 builds on the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987. That act provides a legislative basis for Australia to enter into arrangements with other countries whereby it can, request and grant assistance in criminal matters. It seems that the practical opportunity for law enforcement agencies to be provided with foreign testimony d-rives from the relationship that has developed with II number. of other countries since the passage of that act and the making of associated bilateral treaties. In the Senate the government accepted an amendment to part 3, and specifically clause 25, which was moved by Senator Ellison. After further discussion with the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) and officers of the Attorney-General's Department, I will move an amendment which modifies the language of the Senate amendment and applies it to section 33 as well. I will deal with that after mentioning part 4. Part 4 contains a scheme similar to part 3 that allows the Australian Securities Commission, to obtain testimony from its foreign counterparts for the purpose of civil proceedings.The ASC must be - party to, the proceedings. The request can be made directly from the ASC to the foreign securities agency. Once the testimony is provided the court has a discretion to exclude the material,as it has under ;part 3. Under the Corporations Law, the ASC has power to intervene in a hear- variety of proceedings commenced between private parties. It is presumed that intervention of that nature would make the ASC a party to the proceedings, for the purpose of part 4. To some extent, it seems incongruous that in those cases the ability to adduce testimony from foreign agencies should depend upon whether the ASC has intervened. During the Senate debate, Senator Vanstone commented that the Attorney-General's Department had indicated that the use of part 4 was intended to be limited to foreign agencies that have formal memoranda of understanding'-MOUs-f0r the exchange of information with the ASC. The minister has advised that the use of part 4 of the bill to ' adduce evidence is not limited to evidence obtained in those countries whose business regulatory authorities have an MOU with the ASC., The provisions of part 4 will be available for use by the ASC in relation to evidence obtained from any country. The minister has advised that the ASC has indicated that, in practice, it will limit .the use of the part 4 provisions to evidence obtained from those countries which have legislative provisions controlling the disclosure of information to foreign regulators such as the ASC or, in other words, countries which have 'equivalent legislation to the Australian. Mutual Assistance in Business Regulation Act 1992. The ASC policy, the minister has said, in this regard refletts the fact that the large majority of overseas jurisdictioAs are not able to assist the ASC in the absence of legislative support for the disclosure of information to foreign regulators such' as itself. Only countries with developed business regulatory regimes have enacted such legislation; the United States, the United Kingdom and New Zealand being examples, Even in those countries, the ASC's counterparts usually require an assurance of reciprocity before complying with requests under their legislation. To create a framework for such reciprocal relationships, the ASC has signed MOUs with three of its foreign counterparts and will seek to enter into more in the future. Of the three MOUs signed by the ASC, those with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and the United Kingdom's Securities and Investments Board and Her Majesty's Treasury provide for requests to obtain testimony and related documents pursuant to the relevant reciprocal legislation in those jurisdictions. The third MOU signed by the ASC, namely, that signed with the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission, does not in fact provide for such requests as Hong Kong has not enacted equivalent legislation to the Mutual Assistance in Business Regulation . Act 1992. On the other hand, it would be open to the ASC to seek to obtain testimony under the New Zealand legislative equivalent of the Mutual Assistance in Business Regulation Act, notwithstanding that an MOU has not yet been negotiated by the ASC with the New Zealand regulator. In the course of the debate in the committee stage in the Senate, Senator Ellison proposed an amendment to part 3 of the bill, which was passed by the Senate. Part 3 of the bill deals with the use of foreign material in criminal and related proceedings. By proposed subsection 25(1) the court is given a discretion to exclude the evidence. In exercising that discretion, the bill sets out a ntimber of matters the court must take into account. Senator Ellison was particularly concerned to ensure that the court should be required expressly to consider whether exclusion of the foreign material would cause prejudice to either party, and particularly to the defence. While Senator Ellison's original proposition was couched in terms that exclusion not cause prejudice to either party, the final amendment dealt with his· main concern. It was. resolved that an item (e) would be added to subclause 25(2) to read 'whether exclusion of the foreign material would cause prejudice to the defence'. The bill in its form before this House includes that provision. The government has considered the Senate amendment further and has advised that, in its view, more appropriate that the court consider whether exclusion of the foreign material would prejudice the prosecution as well as the defence. I have no difficulty with that proposition. It is what was proposed by Senator Ellison in the first instance. In the course of the Senate debate on the amendment, the government proposed that the prejudice in question must be substantial. That was objected to by the opposition and the government agreed that the prejudice need not be qualified. The government has reconsidered that question and the minister has advised that· the appropriate terminology is 'unfair prejudice'. Unless the term is qualified, the minister has suggested, the court's consideration of foreign material obtained on behalf of the prosecution will prejudice the defence in all cases within the ordinary meaning·of the term. The coalition equally has no difficulty with the requirement of unfair prejudice. It is appropriate that the amendments made to part 3 are to apply to the corresponding provisions of part 4, which deals with civil proceedings to which the ASC is a party. Accordingly, I foreshadow the following amendments: (1) Clause 25, page to, lines 30 and 31, omit ""cause prejudice to the defence"", substitute ""unfairly prejudiCe any party to the proceeding"". (2) Clause 33, page 12, at the end of subclause (2) add the followirig word and paragraph: If; and (e) whether exclusion of the foreign material would unfairly prejudice any party to the proceeding"". The addition of the proposed paragraphs raises another question which I have. this morning discussed with officers of the Attorney-General's Department. It is a well established principle that in a criminal trial the trial judge has a discretion to refuse to admit evidence if, in his or her opinion, its prejudicial effect outweighs its probative value. It appears not to be settled whether a similar discretion may be exercised by the trial judge in a civil trial. The reference in the proposed new paragraphs to unfair prejudice must becarefully distinguished from the trial judge's discretion relating to unfair prejudice. It is enlightening to examine the manner in it is which the provisions of parts 3 and 4 will operate in this respect. I take part 3 as an example. Assume that a person is examined outside Australia for the purposes of criminal proceedings before an' Australian court to which part 3 relates. The record of the testimony, appropriately certified, will be tendered to the Australian court. The foreign material is not to be adduced as evidence if, under subsection 24(2), the evidence would not have been admissible had it been adduced from the foreign witness at the hearing in Australia. It is at that stage and under that provision that the trial, judge should exercise the discretion to exclude the evidence on the basis that its probative value is outweighed by its prejudicialeffect. - Only after the judge has determined not to exclude the material as being inadmissible will the question of the special power under subsection 25(1) to exclude foreign material in order better to serve justice arise. In sidering that question, the trial judge may take into account any matter relevant to whether or not justice would better be served by the exclusion of the foreign material. However, the judge is directed by subsection 25(2) to take'specified considerations into account. On the basis of the amendments I have foreshadowed, one of those considerations will be whether exclusion of the evidence would cause unfair prejudice to a party. In light of that analysis, th- issue of the admissibility prejudicial evidence is a matter quite distinct in the statutory scheme from the exclusion of evidence where the exclusion could unfairly prejudice a party. Part 5 of the bill deals with the recognition by Australian courts and public officials of certain foreign public documents. The Hague Convention Abolishing the Requirement of Legalisation for Foreign Public Documents of 1961 seeks to simplify procedures for certification of public documents generated in one country and required for official use in another. At present,certain public documents are required to be certified by the foreign embassy or consulate of the country where the document is required. The convention abolishes that practice and provides for the issue of a certificate by the country which generated the document, which is sufficient to authenticatethe original document. The government has indicated that it wishes to accede to the convention. The biIIimplements the convention by requiring that Australian courts and officials recognise the certificate as evidence of the authenticity of the document. It should be noted that court recognition is not limited to Australian courts exercising federal jurisdiction but is applicable to courts exercising state jurisdiction. It would appear that power to make the extension to state jurisdiction derives from the external affairs power of the constitution. The Attorney-General's Department has advised that in practice foreign documents do not generally require formal legalisation in Australia. The convention is being acceded to and these provisions implemented so that the benefit of the cOflvention can be claimed by those, seeking to adduce ,Australian documents con- in other countries which are parties to the convention. The provisions are not controversial or of difficulty to the coalition. They may result in some savings to persons engaged in litigation through the elimination of unnecessary formality and, as an additional consequence, the need to pay fees in respect of the formality. Finally, part 6 re-enacts, with some variations, 'part mc of the Evidence Act 1905. The part deals with a situation where Australof Ian courts are taking evide.nce for use in foreign, proceedings. The part provides that the Attorney-General may prohibit the taking of evidence in the interests of Australia's security. Unlike under the Evidence Act 1905, the Attorney-General's power is not limited to civil andcomniercial proceedings. I am not aware whether the Attorney-General has used the power under the 1905 act frequently, infrequently or at all. It is also not clear why the power under the Evidence.Act 1905 was confined to civil or commercial proceedings. There appears to: be no justification for the distinction on policy grounds. I mentioned earlier that there is a case in which the constitutionalityof provisions to be re-enacted in part 2 of the bill is under challenge. The case is of interest because of the challenge to those provisions. The argument is that the provisions in the Evidence Act 1905 allowing for the taking of evidence overseas are unconstitutional. Those provisions, asTindicated, have now been incorporated as part 2 of this bill. The Commonwealth Attorney-General intervened in the case in respect of the constitutional objections. The arguments of the accused in the case were rejected by the court. I understand, however, that the decision has been taken on appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. The case in· question is the Director of Public Prosecutions Alexander. The judgment on the issue was delivered on 29 September 1993. The trial judge was Mr Justice David Hunt, Chief Judge at common law. The case concerned an application by the DPP pursuant to sections 7V and 7W of the Evidence Act 1905 for the issue of a letter of request to the judicial authorities of the United States to take the evidence of two United States residents. The substance of the two sections is now contained in proposed sections 7,8, 9 and 10 in part 2 of the Foreign Evidence Bill. The defendant to the proceedings had been charged with two offences pursuant to Commonwealth law. The DPP wished to obtain the evidence of the two United States residents. Pursuant to theDPP's request, the evidence of the two individuals would be able to be taken in the United States with legal' representatives of both parties permitted to attend and participate in the process and the evidence would be recorded by audio--isual equipment. It' .was argued by the accused that the provisions in the Evidence Act 1905 are constitutionally invalid, in so far as they to a trial for a federal offence on indictment, on two grounds. First, the provisions permit the conduct of that trial to take place in the absence of the jury in breach of section 80 of the constitution and, secondly, the provisions confer federal jurisdiction on a person or persons not part of the court in which the trial is to take place. r say·no mote of the second ground except that it was rejected by the trial judge. The relevance of the first argument extends beyond the provisions which re-enact provisions as to the taking of evidence pursuant to a letter of request. Part 2 contains another two mechanisms for taking evidence overseas. The court may make at) order for examination on oath or affirmation at a place outside Australia before a judge or officer of the court or before any other person. Alternatively, the court can issue what is described as a commission for the examination of. witnesses overseas. The accused's argument would apply in relation to this bill to. the extent that it permits admission of testimony from witnesses overseas without that witness being before the jury at the time v. the testiInony was taken. The argument would, it seems, also apply to part 3 to the extent it provides for admis-ion of foreign testimony in Australian proceedings. The argument is based on section 80 of the constitution, which provides that the trial on indictment of any offence against the law of the Commonwealth shall be by jury.· What Alexander argues is that the constitutional right to trial by jury imports an obligation that the jury confront all witnesses. Section 80 of the constitution was modelled on an identical provision in the United States constitution. The provision in the United States constitution is amplified by the sixth amendment which provides in relevant part that: In aJl criminal prosecution, the accused shal1 enjoy the right to a . . . public trial, by an· impartial jury ... [and] to be confronted with witnesses against him ... The accused argued to the Supreme Court of New South Wales that' the confrontation clause should be read into section 80 of the Australian constitution. The trial judge rejected the argument that section 80 of the constitution was infringed. He did that on three relate principal grounds, which I summarise. The first was that in the United States the sixth amendment is not applied as a strict rule. As an example, admission of evidence pursuant toa letter of request has been _expressly permitted in at least' one United States decision. The second was that Australian authority makes it questionable whether the sixth amendment is to be incorporated into section 80 of the constitution. The third was that section 80 is to be construed as an adoption of the institution of trial by jury, as that institution was known in Australia at the time of that adoption. This is a principle that was ventilated in the judgment of the High Court in the recent case of Cheatle v. The Queen. If the appeal proceeds to a hearing, the arguments will, I' presume, receive' further present day. consideration. I think it appropriate at this stage that I make no further comment upon them. I indicated previously that the coalition has no objection to the bill. I commend to the House the amendments to be moved in my name at the consideration in detail stage.",117
120,Ms HENZELL,PROVISIONS AND CONSEQUENTIAL,"Capricomia) (7:04 p.m.)I am pleased to support the passage of Foreign Evidence Bill 1993 and the Foreign Evidence (Transitional Provisions and Conseclear quential Amendments) Bill'that we are dressing this evening. I pay tribute to the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Wilproach liams) for'his careful and considered of the legislation. It is, I that there has been a high degree of cooperation arid consideration on this bill both in the Senate and in the current debate in this remove House. I think it indicates that on many matters there is a high degree of cooperation on both sides of the House to provide for real progress in many areas of legislation. An up-to-date and relevant legal system is crucial to providing citizens in social democcourts racies with real social justice. As the for Justice, (Mr Kerr) said in his second reading speech to a related bill, the Evidence Bill 1993,on 15 December 1993: Comprehensive evidence law reform is not easy. Many challenges have accumulated over too many years for that to be the case. But this government is taking evidence law reform out of the too hard basket and making it an important feature of law reform agenda. The minister quote4 the Law Reform Commission, which said: The present law is the product of unsystematic statutory and judicial development. complex body of law which is arcane even to most legal practitioners. It contains' traps and pitfalls which are likely to leave the unrepresented litigant baffled, frustrated and defeated. The reform process, of which the Foreign EvIdence Bill is one part, was initiated 1977 by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which that recommended: ... a review of the whole evidence law should be undertaken by the Law Reform Commission with a view to producing a wholly comprehensive code of evidence based on concepts appropriate to the A reference was given to the Australian Law Reform Commission in July 1979 by the then Attorney-General; the Hon. Peter Durack. Following substantial review, its final report and draft legislation was presented in 1987. In 1991, both the New South Wales and Commonwealth governments introduced the legislation based on the Law Reform Commission's draft bill. As the minister made in his second reading speech on the adEvidence' Bill I have just referred to: The Commonwealth wants this bipartisan apto achieving uniformity to be taken up by analysis other states and territories. think, helpful' to see He went on: nowCommonwealth, state and territory governments have an opportunity to improve the law, to inconsistencies and, as a result, make them more just, reasonable and comprehensive. He also said: Evidence law reform is micro-economic reform. A reformed evidence law will simplify and shorten proceedings . . . Reform is necessary to assist the to achieve just and proper decisions with a Minister minimum of expense to all concerned. As a non-lawyer in this debate, I think it is very important to make it clear that, from the community'S perspective, the law as it is presently understood and practised in this country is seen to be in the province of the very rich and the very powerful, in the hands of and available to large corporations and, to the a very limited extent, the poor and dispossessed through legal aid assistance. But there is certainly a feeling in the community that the general community is not able to access justice through our legal system because of its It is a highly complexity and expense. I am very heartened to see that this government, represented by the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) and the Minister for Justice, has ' a very strong commitment to the reform of our legal system, to make itavaiIable, underin standable and accessible to people in the wider community so that they may perceive they can obtain real justice and, through that justice, social justice. The Foreign Evidence Bill 1993, as I said, is part of the government's comprehensive evidence law reforms. The amendments in differential this legislation will repeal dence Act of 1905. The Foreign Evidence Bill will be an important component in adding a more contemporary approach to Australia's evidence laws. This bill contains provisions omitted from the Evidence Act pertaining to international considerations. As has been pointed out by the Parliamenwhere tary Secretary to the Attorney-General (Mr Duncan) and the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Tangney, the bill has three broad purposes. With minor chantransactions. ges, it· re-enacts parts of the Evi!ience 1905 enabling evidence from other countries to be used in Australian proceedings and required. preventing, for reasons of national security, certain evidence from being obtained in Australia for use in foreign proceedings. Secondly, it provides a range of new initiagive tives to enable authenticated foreign testimony and exhibits to such testimony to be admisobviously sible, subject to appropriate safeguards. era of rapid technological advancement, our legislative arrangements should be aware of the need to be flexible in. - cquiring informaconcerned tion to be used as evidence. In this respect Foreign Evidence Bill provides the necessary legislative framework to bring our evidence laws to this standard. Finally, the bill enables Australia to accede to the. Hague convention abolishing requirement for legalisation of foreign public documents. The benefit of accession to the convention will relieve Australian residents the need to get public documents legalised use in countries which are parties to the convention. I will refer to a couple of aspects of the in somewhat more detail. The bill provides for the obtaining of testimony from a person in· another country by means of an order examination of the person, the issue of a commission for the examination of a person or· the .issue of a letter of request to the judicial authority of a foreign country. to that person's evidence. It also provides for procedure by which.the Attorney-General can prevent, on national security grounds, mony being given or documents being presented to a foreign court. It includes the that it is not limited to civil or much of the Evicommercial matters. The background to these amendments relates to the current circumstances in which Australia is increasingly part of the world marketplace. It is now commonplace for Australian individuals and companies to have links with foreign countries and institutions. charges are laid alleging misconduct in relation to corporations,it is necessary for both defence and prosecution in Australian proceedings to obtain evidence of foreign Existing· evidence .laws do not Act meet the needs .of complex criminal cases whereevide.nce of fore.ign transactions is Part 3 of the bill overcomes existing deficiencies whereby foreign evidence cannot be admissible unless witnesses are available to oral testimony to conform to traditional rules of evidence-and these were matters r-ferred to in the speech of the In this honourable· merqber ·for Tangney. These requirements of availability of witnesses are costly and time consuming. The legislation is to maintain a careful balance the between the ability of the criminal justice system to deal with complex criminal matters and· protect the legitimate rightS of the accused. Other safegmuds will require authentication by the foreign country and certification the by the Attorney-General. Certain evidence will be declared inadmissible when those witnesses are available in of Australia. As both the parliamentary secretary for and the shadow Attorney-General have said, part 4 relates to the use of foreign materials and records of foreign business authorities in bill civil proceedings which will bear on pr_oceedings instituted by the Australian Securities Commission. This is seen as crucial to profor ceedings under the Corporations Law. I. think the matters under consideration in the Foreign Evidence Bill will go a fair way to updating what is now a very old bill and take demonstrate the commitment of this governa ment to real reform across the board, including the reform of our legal system. On this testibasis; I commend the bill to the House.",122
121,Mr DUNCAN,PROVISIONS AND CONSEQUENTIAL,"in reply-To sum up, I simply want to say that this bill is a piece of what some people disparagingly describe as 'lawyers law'. I particularlyMr Williams--'It is a compliment.",124
122,Mr DUNCAN,PROVISIONS AND CONSEQUENTIAL,"Indeed. As I said, some people disparagingly say that. I certainly do not see it as such. I particularly on record my thanks to the shadow Attorney General, the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams). I think his contribution was learned and thoughtful. I think this is the sort of legislation which, to· some extent, regardless of the government, would be in the national interest and would be going through the parliament. I indicate that the government will be supporting the shadow Attorney-General's amendments when he moves them in a moment or two. I think it can also be said that it is a pity more of the public were not here to see the parliament going through the legislative process in a constructive fashion, which so often happens of course, but at the same time the public perception is that the laws of the natiop rp.ore oftyn come through their birth process through a gladiatorial process. This is certainly an· example of the cooperation that so often exists. I think the country will be well served by. this legislation. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Clauses 1 to 24-by leave-taken together, and agreed to. Clause 25.",124
123,Mr WILLIAMS,PROVISIONS AND CONSEQUENTIAL,"I cannot let the reference by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General (Mf Duncan) to a gladiatorial process go without comment. I was once a participant in a lengthy voting proceeding in a university senate. The procedural complexities that were introduced in the course of the attempt at the election resulted in the sort of thing that goes on with the election of a pope. I was minded at that stage to suggest to those assembled for the election that, if there was no white smoke puffing from the university chimney within a fairly short time, I would formally move that the parties repair to the court before the main university hall and each of the candidates be provided with a horse, a shield and a lance. I wonder sometimes whether question time might be improved if the questioner and the answerer were in fact given a horse, a shield and a lance and sent outside to deal with the want to place issue. I move: (1) Clause 25, page 10, lines 30 and 31, omit ""cause prejudice to the defence"", substitute ""unfairly prejudice any party to the proceeding"". I have already commented on this amendment in the second reading stage and I do not propose to add to that. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to.

124,Mr MCARTHUR,ADJOURNMENT,"The black plague that swept Europe in the 14th century has a clear resemblance to the insidious creeping noxious· weed called the serrated tussock, in that they are both devastating and affect the sustainability of life of man and beast. Each serrated tussock plant produces 100,000 seeds, which can be scattered by the four winds throughout southern Victoria. Given the right soil conditions,· this noxious weed could become a major environmental problem to farmers and city dwellers alike. The serrated tussock is an unpalatable fibrous plant with little nutrient value. Sheep and cattle lose body weight if they are forced to eat the plant. Stock selec:tively graze other plants, which in turn encourages the growth of the serrated tussock. Serrated tussocks are prolific seed producers and, as is often the case with undesirable weeds, they are able to reproduce at a frightening rate. Serrated tussocks are able to establish themselves in rocky outcrops and bare patches and· on fallowed land. lIifestation of serrated tussock has now occurred in the Geelong region and around the lIiverleigh, Sunbury and Bacchus Marsh areas, with other smaller patches appearing in neighbouring districts such as the You Yangs Regional Park and the Brisbane Ranges. Given that serrated· tussock is able to take total control of a paddock or a rocky outcrop area, it is almost impossible to eradicate. This indicates the magnitude of the problem facing Victorian land holders. It is possible to remove serrated tussock from arable land with cultivation; however,· much of the affected area is rough country, which is most difficult to control. Mr Duncan Campbell, the secretary of the serrated tussock task force, has spent $40,000 on his 6,OOO-acre farm attempting to eradicate this weed. He, along with John Thornton, from Inverleigh, chairman of the task force, and other committee members, are totally committed to controlling the serrated tussock to a minimal area. Further, they are concerned to alert the policy makers that a stitch in time saves nine-so much so that an early eradication program could save millions of dollars for the farming community and Australia. The cost of chemical spray is very high. A 20-litre drum of frenock, the most effective herbicide available, costs $700. Research indicates that only this· brand is effective against serrated tussock. . The Victorian Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, whilst it has the legal responsibility for the control of serrated tussock on both public and private land, is not up to the task because of a lack of funds. Landholders who are familiar with the problem are now prepared to take action at the community level. Whilst the Landcare schemes have been generally successful, I am recommending that the federal government allow Landcare programs to be part of the control of this noxious weed. Duncan MCNab, an experienced farmer from Anakie, has personally indicated to me that the serrated tussock is 'on the march' and that urgent action is required. Given the depressed rural conditions and the necessity for farmers to pay their way, noxious weed eradication falls lower down on the list Of priorities. Federal and state governments should assist farmers by matching their efforts on a dollar-for-dollar basis so that the broader community problem can be solved in its infancy. There is clear evidence that because of the prolific propagating capacity of the seed from serrated tussock, Victoria's national parks could be overtaken. The catchment and storage areas of Geelong's water could become damaged by the infestation of serrated tussock, and there is the possibility that suburban gardeners could suddenly find serrated tussock seeds in their own backyard. Also, the Tullamarine airport is overrun with the tussock. The serrated tussock task force, which has a budget of $40,000, is to be commended for its public awareness program. This volunteer group hopes to coordinate national Landcare programs, and is seeking support from the Victorian Department of Conservation and Natural Resources and the Agriculture Department.It is a self-help program,. and has my total support. Whilst there is evidence of considerable economic damage to parts of New South Wales and New Zealand by the serrated tussock, it is fair to say that the problem is reasonably well contained in this local area in Victoria, but has the potential of a major explosion within five years. The delicate balance of native flora would be upset if the serrated tussock took control. Australia has had a long history of not attacking the base problem of introduced species before they multiply to plague proportions. For instance, the Austin family introduced rabbits for recreational purposes, which then became the major animal pest to Australian wool growers. Likewise, the prickly pear was introduced for landscaping reasons, and if it had been exterminated at an early stage would not have become such a major national problem. The serrated tussock has all the wonderful characteristics of a capacity to spread itself quickly, to grow in difficult terrain, and to be useless as a stock feed. Finally, like the rabbit, it could get totally of control unless immediate action . Stevedoring Industry",125
125,Mr KNOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"Gilmore) (7.28 p.m.),-Today I rise to put on the record the magnificent victory by the Maritime Union of Australia in the stevedoring dispute, which has captured the attention of this nation, as has the stevedoring industry for well over a century. In looking at the history of the stevedoring industry in this country, we recall some of the historical documents such as Rupert Lockwopd's book on the Melbourne wharves, which traced a history of the two stevedoring unions there· which eventually amalgamated into the Waterside. Workers Federation. They have now been amalgamated into the Maritime Union. of Australia. In the early part of our history one can see that it was not the wharf labourer at fault; the fault lay with the stevedoring companies and their lack of care about the conditions of the work force, and the bull system. Many inquiries in this house over the last 100 years have found that the conditions offered in the Bull system were highly susceptible to corruption, . distortion, manipulation and exploitation of the work force involved. This victory represents a condition that many of us who have worked in a wage situation require: some certainty, some future. The concept which has been put forward as being the norm· for this community is that people should. live in fear of their job. l do not fear for my job, I know that I am doing a good job. The, . honourable member for Rume (Mr Sharp) should know that because I have inherited a significant part· of an electorate which was his. Mr Bilney-Which he fled from in fear of you.",126
126,Mr KNOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"That may be so, but I am not the one to say it.",126
127,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,The honourable member for Gilmore might not be distracted. from comments from either side.,126
128,Mr KNOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"Thank you, Mr Speaker, I will not be distracted. The point that I am making is that these people have avoided out casualisation of their industry. They· have . . is· taken. stood up for what our fathers and grandfathers have fought for over a hundred years: recognition of the rights of labour to have conditions in work and security in employment so that the kids they have to clothe and feed can live in a country where they have equal ability to achieve to their 'potential. The waterside workers do not want casualisation; they do not want to go back to the bad old days-and why should they? Everyone else has tenure of employment, even us. Our tenure is between elections. Tenure is an important concept in the security of families. I am proud to stand and say that I support those people in their fight, because it is a basic tenet of humanity that we should have in our lives some security for those that we love. Those people have won that, and I applaud them. In steering to the need for micro-economic reform on the waterfront, I suggest to the House that we go back through history and look at where some of the problems are. The problems, as I noted earlier, came initially from the avoidance of responsibilities by the stevedoring companies, and 1 believe that any acceptance of responsibilities has just been thwarted again. But there is a second tier: the charges which are laid by s.tate governments and· the dividends which are taken by state governments from the boards which control the facilities. Industry is complaining that it is not getting the benefits of the micro-economic reform. Over 3,000 wharfies have gone, so· they are not seeing the benefits. They are not seeing the benefits because the states' imposition of tariffs and their returns on their investment are such that they are bleeding the stevedoring industry dry. I suggest that we look at the real culprits and have a look at where the money that must have come through has gone. We have a duopoly in place and 3,000 wharfies have gone. The benefits of that micro-economic reform have been snapped up by others who are not necessarily entitled to them. I suggest that we look at the real culprits in the industry and not blame· the work force, the wharfies, for wanting a decent living for their families. SBS Television and Radio",126
129,Mr TRUSS,ADJOURNMENT,"Since I have been a member of this place I have been campaigning for the extension of SBS television to my electorate. I was pleased when early last year the western part of the electorate received SBS television signals for the first time; largely because of the extension of services directed to the Toowoomba area in southern Queensland. But the coastal cities of my electorate-Maryborough, Hervey Bay and Gympie-still do not receive SBS television. SBS has a small but enthusiastic audiencean audience that is growing year by year, particularly as people lose confidence in the ABC. These days the SBS news service, particularly its international news service, is considered to be the best. It is the only telecaster these days of domestic soccer and most of the important soccer fixtures around the world. There is a growing demand from the community to see SBS television, even from those people who do not have a particular ethnic background. SBS was established originally to provide this link for people who have come to Australia, and who perhaps do not have English as their mother language, to help them become a part of the Australian community and to help them enjoy the lifestyle that we have in Australia without the loss that is associated with language difficulties. SBS has provided a useful role as far as that is concerned. Its subtitles have helped many people to learn the English language when it has not been their mother tongue. It is important that extending SBS television around Australia - be given priority, but over recent times it seems that SBS is putting its emphasis on radio transmissions. I noticed an announcement from the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) on 1 February this year which boasted about the extension of SBS radio to Brisbane,·Adelaide, Perth and Darwin. I welcome the fact that SBS radio is available not only in Sydney and Melbourne, but it seems to me to be a strange priority for the government to be moving to extend SBS radio-which does not offer anything like the benefits to the community that SBS television offers-to other cities, while the majority of Australia still does not receive SBS television. I note also that SBS is moving towards second radio transmissions in Sydney and Melbourne before most of Australia gets SBS television. Those priorities are all wrong. As early as 1985, the SBS annual report indicated that SBS television was to be extended to the Wide Bay region, but that has not happened. I have written repeatedly to ministers. As recently as 21 December 1993, the last minister to whom I wrote, the then Minister for Communications, now the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall), merely said to me that the government was extending SBS television signals as funds became available, but there was no promise to include the Wide Bay area in that list. All I could get was an assurance that he had noted my views about the need for the residents of Wide Bay to be included in the list of areas to receive SBS television. lam hopeful that the present communications minister. will consider areas on their merits. I ask him to bear in mind that the Hervey Bay area is one of the fastest growing areas in Australia. Its population is being boosted by large numbers of people moving to the region from Sydney and Melbournepeople who have been used to receiving SBS television for years. Now that they have moved to sunny Queensland they are not getting the benefits of SBS television. The demand to receive the soccer telecast is growing. The ABC has refused, even when SBS offered them the rights, to extend soccer telecasts into areas where SBS has no signal. It is becoming more and more important that SBS be available to all Australians. . I presented a petition in the House last month which was signed by 657 people in the Hervey Bay region, urging that SBS be extended into their area,and more petitions will be presented in the weeks ahead. One of the local newspapers has put out little coupons that say, 'Yes. I want SBS'. Hundreds of those have now been returned. I hope that the minister for communications will take on board the fact that the people of Hervey Bay are petitioning and are prepared to write letters on this matter. They are keen to receive the SBS signal and hope that the government will act quickly to extend SBS to the Wide Bay area. Badgerys Creek·Airport: Transport",127
130,Mr LATHAM,ADJOURNMENT,"Werriwa) (7.38 p.m.)....;.I wish to address the issue of the failure of New South Wales government to plan properly for the provision of transport links to and from the Badgerys Creek airport site. Many honourable members on this side and, I hope, many of those opposite, would be pleased by the action that the federal government has taken in recent· times regarding the development of Sydney's second international airport. I noted with interest that the opposition raised this matter in question time today. The Minister for Industrial Relations and Transport (Mr Brereton) has said that· the government is keen to· accept and examine detailed propositions from the private sector about its interest to own, build and manage the international airport at Badgerys Creek. Of course, the government has committed itself to the development of the facility. The only question is one of timing-whether the international airport comes on line for the year 2005 or private investment can expedite that process. Most significantly, we will see the commencement of construction for the general aviation facility this month. The real problem with this process, now that private sector investment has been welcomed and invited, is the failure of the state government to allocate a land use corridor from Glenfield through to the airport site on which we could run the essential rail and road links. Investors are looking at the absence of proper planning and are starting to shy away from the project. They legitimately ask why they should _be spending hundreds' of millions-even billions-of dollars, on this project if we have not got cooperation between federal and state authorities to do the transport planning. It all comes down .to the consideration by the New South Wales government that Badgerys Creek is a marginal seat held by one of its ministers, Anne Cohen. She has made representations to the New South Wales minister for planning to see that a handful of landowners in her electorate are not upset by the prospect of a land use corridor and a rail link. Even though in October 1991 the state Links government examined and exhibited a regional environment plan for the South Creek Valley sector the minister, Robert Webster, the visited Badgerys Creek in the middle of 1992 and announced: The route of the public transport corridor as identified in the draft plan is to be abandoned; the whole issue of public transport in Sydney's south-west is to be re-examined. It is almost two years since that announcement. There has been no re-examination of public transport needs, and certainly no identifica:tion of the essential land use corridor from Glenfield to Badgerys Creek for a rail line. In no other advanced or trading nation would we find so little cooperation and goodwill from a state authority. Work will commence this month on the site for an international airport without the state government .undertaking any of the planning or allocation of land that is needed to provide the rail link. This issue is made more relevant by the announcement by the state opposition yesterday that it will build the rail line. It is to be fully funded. We have a promise from Bob Carr to build the rail line. Here we have the federal government inviting private investment, the state opposition saying that it will fund the project if elected at the next state poll, but the New South Wales governmentfor base electoral reasons-doing absolutely nothing to allocate the land on which the rail line would be constructed. This is a tragedy for western and south-western Sydney. This failure of planning is holding back the prospeCt of the development of 35,000 new·jobs on and around the airport site over the next 20 years. It is debasing the spirit of federal and state cooperation. As you would appreciate, Mr Speaker, it is holding back the whole networking of rail links that could arise out of this project. If we had the link from St Marys to Badgerys Creek to Glenfield it would make much more feasible the development of the Maldon-Dombarton line through the Illawarra to Port Kembla. That would open up a whole range of economic benefits across New South Wales and, most importantly, in my region of south-west Sydney, access. through to that very efficient port. It really is a shame when Australia is trying to become more internationally competitive and south-west Sydney and regions like the Illawarra are trying to join that drive that, for very narrow electoral reasons, in a state marginal seat we cannot even get a land use corridor on which an essential rail link would be constructed to and from an international airport. The Fahey government needs to do a lot better and all members of this House should be urging it in that direction. Trading Hours: Queensland Shops",128
131,Mr KATTER,ADJOURNMENT,"The recent Hilmer report which has been accepted by all of the states and the federal· government plumps very strongly for liberalisation of all competition throughout Australia and the elimination of any restrictions whatsoever. Consequently, the Premier of Queensland is currently advocating the extension of trading hours for shopkeeping in flagrant breach of a promise' made by him to the people of Queensland before the last election. I praise very greatly and put on record the excellent work done by the Queensland Retail Traders and Shopkeepers Association which has fought tirelessly and effectively for its members throughout Queensland under Ian Baldock and, before him, under Rod Black. The last time the National Party government attempted to do this in Queensland, not only did I speak up about it but also the minister at the time, Vince Lester, very strongly objected to the trials. The trials were abandoned after a short four weeks. I suspect and hope that the same thing will happen if the Queensland government attempts to proceed down this path. No country in the world suffers from the monopolistic situations that exist throughout almost all of the economy in Australia. Three major cOn1panies in Australia account for 70 per cent of the food sales throughout Australia. I would be very surprised if any intelligent person would assert the principle that that is not a monopolistic position which militates very strongly against the food producers of this country and very strongly against the consumers of this country. In the United States the 10 major companies hold 12 per cent of retail food sales; in Australia the 10 major companies hold 40 per cent of retail food sales; and in the United Kingdom the three major companies control only 28 per cent of food sales. Under the proposals that are being forced on the Australian public not only by the federal government but also via the Hilmer report, people in Queensland and other parts of Australia will suffer decreased services. The after-hours comer stores will close and the smaller family run businesses will close. Not only will that restructure Australian society whereby family businesses will cease to exist, as will the concept of the owner operator, but also there will be a shrinkage in the number of outlets. There are a lot of poor people in this country that simply do not have access· to motor vehicles any more and they have to walk to their nearest shop. In Queensland outside of Brisbane there is virtually no commuter transport system. So i- Queensland alotof people will find it very difficult to the amount of food necessary to live a healthy and acceptable lifestyle. That will apply to only old people but poor people, and people on ordinary incomes. They will be placed in very grave difficulty because they simply do not have access to transportation systems. Also, there is a finite amount of money that can be spent on food and clothing. If that finite money is extended over Sunday trading as well as the other days of the week, the same amount of money will be spent but the cost of servicing and providing retail outlets in Queensland will increase dramatically because the big and small shopkeepers will have to pay staff for an extra day's trading. But, of course, the number of consumer dollars will not increase. Not only will there be an increased cost of transportation in the city to get people to these places but there will also bea cost to the individual shopkeepers, many of whom will go broke. Yet we are told that we need to do these things, that we need to catchup with the rest of the world. We have only 2.4 million tourists to Australia paying us $53 million, and they are - not paying us for Sunday trading. Berlin, Paris, Athens and the United Kingdom have no Sunday trading. New York, in fact, has fewer trading hours than Brisbane! Once again, the big chains and corporations are so untrammelled in their greed that they wish to increase their market share over the broken backs of the owner operators throughout Australia. That push is being sponsored by people in this House through such reports as the Hilmer report. I strongly urge the people of Queensland to rise up, as they did before when my own government attempted to move down in this direction, and fight tenaciously against the continual moves towards monopoly ownership throughout Australia and a crushing of the great Australian tradition of getting up and having a go. Domestic Violence MrHORNE (paterson) (7.47 p.m.)-In this International Year of the Family we will be going through the process of redefining the Australian family. Some myths will be exget ploded and it will be recognised that the home is not always the haven in a heartless not world. I am referring to the research that has shown quite unequivocally that every year thousands of our citizens-women and children in particular-suffer physically, psychologically and financially within their homes as a result of acts of violence against them. Millions of dollars are spent annually on policing, court services, hospital and other medical services, welfare services, women's refuges and social security benefits as a direct consequence of violence. Domestic violence is no longer a private issue. It is a matter of public concern. For the first time a study has costed domestic violencein dollar terms. Data obtained from 20 victims. revealed costs of well over $1 million for these 20 alone. We now know that 43 per cent of homicides are within the family and almost half of all female victims are killed by their spouse. We know also that only 56 per cent of victims contact the police in spite of having sustained serious injury. As a nation, it is imperative that we reduce this deeply troubling and pervasive form of violence afflicting our society. In 1991, the federal government took up this challenge and allocated approximately $3.5 million to be spent over three years in ways which would alert the community to the problem of violence against women. This initiative came from the Office of the Status of Women, a policy making unit of the federal government and a part of the national agenda for women. A pilot scheme to identify needs in local areas resulted. Applications for the first round came from a wide variety of community organisations. Included amongst them were churches, women's health centres and Aboriginal and rural organisations. Due to the efforts of Bronwyn Rademaker of the Maitland youth development unit in my electorate, a grant of $23,000 was. obtained for the employment of a domestic violence court support worker for. 21, hours a week. She would carry out a year's work of identifying local needs and providing education in awareness. A very capable young lady,Vicki King, was appointed for the year to provide a counselling service at Maitland court for women who are the victims of domestic violence and to carry out training programs for various agencies and government departments that work with women victims of domestic violence. Vicki King has worked tirelessly. Last year, over 100 women received - ourt support counselling and 89 were assisted to obtain apprehended domestic violence orders. Previously, many women had beeR forced to return to a domestic violence tion, but last year, thanks to Vicki's efforts, 52 women were able to find alternatives to these' threatening home situations. Children are often the forgotten victims of domestic violence. Last year, 158 Maitland children were victims. There is - o doubt that the work done by the Maitland domestic violence court support worker has exposed a great need in the community, which is exactly what this program was designed to do. So where' do we go from here? As Vicki King said, what has been revealed is. only the tip of the iceberg. Only a few of the women living with domestic violence have had the courage to come forward. Presently, there is a three-month wait for victims of domestic violence to see a counsellor at the local community health centre. Furthermore, resources available to local police, who are often the front-line support workers, are limited and over-stretched. This is totally unreasonable and unacceptable. State governments are responsible for. the administration of the court system. The need for domestic violence court support workers is indisputable. Only yesterday John Fahey outlined his program for the remainder of this year and declared that family issues would be to the fore·with his government. I challenge the Premier of New South Wales to respond to the needs of women in his state that have been. identified so. strongly by the Maitland project. The offence of domestic violence is so abhorrent that it demands immediate and thoughtful action. It is not something that can be placed on hold. What better way could Mr Fahey keep faith with thousands of families in New South Wales than by providing urgently needed counselling services for all the victims of this horrific crime? What better way has he to show whether this is merely empty rhetoric or a sincere commitment? I call on him not to abandon the women and children at risk, in the Maitland area in particular. A practical response is the proper response. Recycling of Products",129
132,Mr HAWKER,ADJOURNMENT,"I situa- listened to the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) a few minutes ago. I thought it a. great pity that he did not come here 10 years earlier. If he had, he would have been able to significantly speed up the implementation of a decision taken by the Fraser government to build a third runway at Sydney airport. Tonight I want t<>-draw attention to what is emerging as a major crisis in country Victoria and probably other country areas' in Australia. We have, seen some very great work done throughout my region by' people in volunteer groups, individuals and service c1ubsin developing a recycling· system for plastic, paper, cardboard and glass. All of this is now at risk. Despite the great work of all these people, we are now seeing the whole thing coming to a halt. In fact, as one operator has put it to me, it has become a shambles. All this has happened at a time when the former Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, who should have been looking at this and acting on it, was too busy playing around with whiteboards. Service clubs and others that used to collect paper have ceased to do so. Local councils are horrified at what is happening, When I drew this to the governmenCs attention, the response I got. was very disappointing. The then minister said that the task of developing markets for waste paper and products from recycled paper requires urgent consideration and that the Commonwealth was endeavourto ingto address the recycling issues. She also said that the government intended to have the Commonwealth Environment Protection disgust. Agency evaluate. progress towards the various national targets for recycling and waste minimisation. Furthermore, she said that the government would get the agency to sponsor the Bureau of Industry Economies to examine plastics recycling in Australia. In other words, we are going to have yet another inquiry. I think it is pathetic when we have this situation, which is an emerging crisis. What has really happened?· To give a couple of examples, plastic drink containers were raising about $700 a tonne. That has fallen to half-$350 a tonne. If we stopped think about it; we would realise that it takes a hell of a lot of plastic drink containers make up a tonne. Let us look at the situation push. with paper. If it has to be sent to Albury, which is where some of the paper from westerri Victoria has to go, one is lucky to $75 a tonne. The freight costs $68. In words, there is virtuaIIy no margin there for the person who is assembling it or the service clubs that have been collecting it, In the last few months we have seen the .extraordinary· situation of the government making the freight even more expensive by putting up the fuel tax. The same situation applies with cardboard and paper. In Mela bourne people are getting about $40 a tonne, hut the· freight to Melbourne is more than $30. Not only that, there has to be a special mix of 70 to 30 cardboard to. paper, and for many small towns it is impossible to meet that mix. When we look at glass, we find that this year ACI intends to cut the recycled price by nearly $20 a 'tonne. This at timea when one operator in my 'electorate has just invested more than $70,000 in teceiving points to try to facilitate recycling. Now all that is at risk. On top of this we have ·the situation· many tips are already overloaded, and so crisis is compounded. We do indeed have a major crisis. Efforts have been made many volunteers, service clubs and communi':' ty-minded people who have set about to try do something in the recycling business in country areas, but have now found themselves utterly frustrated and have had to give up in I call on the government'to act, and to act quickly. As one constituent said to me, 'The whole recycling situation in western Victoria. is in a shambles'. I do not think that we need another study. What we need is some action, and we need some action quickly. Aussie of the Mpnth Awards",131
133,Mr ALDRED,ADJOURNMENT,"Since the push by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for an Australian republic, I find that there has been an increased community interest in Australia's history, our form of government, to olir national symbols, and particularly the Australian flag. These things are probably the to only positive aspects of the Prime Minister's . Recently I had the pleasure of presenting an get Australian flag to the students and staff at other Dorset Primary School at Croydon in my electorate of Deakin in Victoria. I am certain that most members in this place have performed the same kind of ceremopy in their own electorates at .different times. I was invited to attend the school assembly by the principal, Miss Joy Phillips, and, as is usual on these occasions, I gave the students brief outline of the significance of the symbols on. our national flag. What was different and of great interest to me on this occasion was that I was asked to present awards to two Of the students. I gave an inschool 'Artist of the month' award to Amy Garrett, of grade 1, for creative ability and imagination, which. was a splendid achieveglass ment for one so young. I also Presented an 'Aussie of the month' award to John Brady, of grade 5. He received it in front of proud grandparents who were of visiting the school especially for the occasion. The AUsSie of the month award is it nationally where promoted award sponsored by the Australia the Day Committee in Victoria, and Australia Day Councils in various other states, as well by so by the MCDonald's fast food chain. Each winning student receives a certificate and badge, which is no doubt worn proudly around the school. I am certain that hundreds of Aussie of the month awards have been given, and will be given throughout the length and breadth of this country. Possibly there are members here and in the other place who have attended similar ceremonies in their own electorates, but I feel the concept is worth a particular mention here tonight. I would also like to conclude by saying that the Victoria based Australia Day Committee and the Australia Day Councils in various other states, as well as MCDonald's, should be congratulated on their enterprise in respect of this particular worthy event.
