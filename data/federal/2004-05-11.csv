1,The SPEAKER,Unknown,Mr Neil Andrew) took the chair at 2.00 p.m. and read prayers. NA,19
2,Mr HOWARD,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I inform the House that the Treasurer will be absent from question time today due to budget commitments. I will answer questions on his behalf. I also inform the House that the Minister for Trade will be absent from question time today and for the remainder of the week. He is overseas for trade related discussions in a number of countries. The Minister for Foreign Affairs will answer questions on his behalf. I also inform the House that the Minister for Small Business and Tourism will be absent from question time today and for the remainder of the week on compassionate leave. The Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources will answer questions on his behalf. NA Howard Government: Leadership",19
3,Mr LATHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister agree with my view that the Australian people have got a right to know who they are voting for at the next election? Will the Prime Minister now bring the Australian people into his confidence and give them a frank and honest assessment of whether he will serve a full term as Prime Minister if re-elected later this year?,19
4,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I think the Australian people are well aware that the choice will be between the coalition led by me and Labor led by you, Mr Speaker.",19
5,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,19
6,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Led by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Speaker. It will also be an assessment of whether they want the member for Higgins, the Treasurer, to continue to preside over the economic fortunes of this nation-or do they want the member for Hotham? Australian Defence Force: Deployment",19
7,Mr LINDSAY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Minister, how does the presence of the Australian Defence Force in Iraq help Australia's national interest? Is this role merely symbolic? Is the minister aware of any alternative policies?",19
8,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Herbert. I know that he represents many Australian Defence Force personnel very ably up in Townsville. The Australian Defence Force personnel in Iraq are performing vital tasks. They are providing security for Australian officials at our representative office in Baghdad, they are helping to train the Iraqi army and navy so that the Iraqis can provide proper security for themselves, they are providing air traffic control support, and they are patrolling the Persian Gulf in HMAS Stuart and two P3C Orion aircraft. Last month, the Leader of the Opposition said that he thought that all of this was symbolic-that the ADF were not, in other words, doing anything useful but there for symbolic reasons, as though providing protection for our diplomats and other officials was not a useful function but just a symbolic function. As we pointed out at the time, it is an offensive thing to say about Defence Force personnel who risk their lives. HMAS Stuart, for example, played a critical role in rescuing American personnel wounded in action against a terrorist attack on the Basra oil terminal. The ADF is making a difference in terms of the training of Iraqi military personnel. The member for Griffith has been out there in the last couple of days launching into Australian personnel by suggesting that somehow we are culpable for the abuses that some British and American personnel have been conducting in Iraqi prisons. The government roundly condemns the abuse that has taken place in those prisons-it is an appalling thing-but there is no record of Australian Defence Force involvement in those abuses and no record of Australian involvement in those abuses. If I may say so in answering the honourable member's question, it is a bit rich coming from the opposition to hear this moralising about what the Americans and some British personnel are alleged to have done in these prisons, which is appalling and we condemn it.",19
9,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,20
10,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If you had your way, Saddam Hussein would still be in power-a regime whose human rights abuses, including in the Abu Ghraib prison, ranked amongst the most horrific reported. Apparently the fact that 260 mass graves have been found with 300,000 corpses in them is not a matter of any interest to the opposition-that does not matter; it is not important. Actually, that is important. That is enormously important. This was a regime whose brutality had been tolerated by many in the international community, and now it is gone. Now that regime is no longer there. This is a regime which denied the International Committee of the Red Cross access to its prisons. The Coalition Provisional Authority has given that access to the International Committee of the Red Cross. Abuses have been exposed, maltreatment has been exposed, and quite rightly the Americans and the British are taking action against those responsible for those abuses. Those abuses are completely unacceptable, but it ill becomes people who think that the better policy was to leave Saddam Hussein in power to moralise about human rights. Howard Government: Leadership",20
11,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister confirm that an important role played by the Treasurer is overseeing the production of the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook statement, which is released before Christmas? Will the Prime Minister also confirm that budget preparations post-Christmas are informed by the work undertaken by the Treasurer pre-Christmas on MYEFO? Will the Prime Minister therefore confirm that it would disrupt budget preparations if a Treasurer resigned at Christmas and, given this, would the Prime Minister appoint, or permit to continue to serve, a Treasurer who set a Christmas deadline and would not commit to serve as Treasurer beyond that date?",20
12,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Gellibrand-Lalor, I apologise; both safe Labor seats-asks me about the Treasurer. I am reminded of that remarkable comment I think made by Christopher Wren: if you want to see my work, look around me. Look around at the Australian economy over the last eight years and you see the remarkable work of the Treasurer. The House will hear tonight, and you, Mr Speaker, will also hear because you will be presiding, a story of absolutely heroic economic achievement. The Australian people will hear again that you cannot spend money on health that you do not have from a strong economy. You cannot spend money on education that you do not have from a strong economy. You cannot spend money on the environment that you do not have from a strong economy. You cannot spend money on aged care that you do not have from a strong economy. You cannot spend money on science that you do not have from a strong economy. You cannot spend money on roads that you do not have a strong economy. You cannot spend money on good employment policies that you do not have from a strong economy. You cannot spend money on defence that you do not have from a strong economy. What I believe the Australian people will hear again tonight is the story of the strongest economy in the Western world. Ms Gillard- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. As I would believe the Prime Minister would be aware, my question did not relate to tonight's budget; it related to the preparation of the next",20
13,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Lalor will resume her seat. The chair would be facilitated if the member for Lalor had indicated what the matter was that she was raising her point of order on. It is a matter of relevance. The question canvassed such things as economic statements and a range of other issues. The Prime Minister is in order.,21
14,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Lalor was good enough and helpful enough to ask me about the responsibilities of the Treasurer. I am pointing out to her and pointing out to the House, as he will point out to the Australian people tonight, that over eight years under his economic stewardship this economy has performed in a stronger and more consistent manner than at any time since the end of World War II. This government, because of its superior economic management, and this Treasurer, because of his economic skills, have delivered the foundation for any government to deliver services and value to the Australian people-and that is a strong economy. If you do not have a strong economy, you cannot deliver benefits. And if you hand over a strong economy to people who have a proven track record of economic mismanagement, of high debt, of high interest rates and of big deficits, you pretty quickly squander your capacity to deliver benefits to the Australian people. That is the contribution the Treasurer has made, and it is a magnificent contribution. Trade: Free Trade Agreement",21
15,Mr HAWKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs representing the Minister for Trade. I ask the minister: would he update the House on the latest developments in the government's free trade policies?,21
16,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Wannon for his question, for the interest he has taken in the free trade agreement with America and for the support he has provided. The Minister for Trade and his American counterpart, Bob Zoellick, are going to sign the Australia-US free trade agreement in Washington on 18 May-just a week away. The agreement still remains on track for entry into force on 1 January 2005. As a new Centre for International Economic Studies report said recently, it could lead to a $6 billion increase in Australia's economic bottom line and create over 30,000 new jobs. Opposition member interjecting",21
17,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, I know you are not in favour of it, but most Australians I think the last can see the sense in it. Mr Wilkie interjecting",21
18,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Swan.,21
19,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is not just the Australian people that can see the sense in this agreement; it is also the state Labor governments that can see that this is an agreement that is in the national interest. What is interesting is, in stark contrast to the federal Labor Party, the state Labor governments are lending their support to it. I note that Queensland's Premier, Mr Beattie, made a speech on 6 May, which was reported in the Financial Review with the headline ‘Beattie backs trade deal', in which he said ‘the agreement will prove positive for Queensland and Australia as a whole'. So there we have the successful Premier of Queensland supporting this agreement. The South Australian Attorney-General, Mr Atkinson, acting on behalf of the industry minister, has written to the Minister for Trade expressing South Australia's support for the agreement. He took the opportunityand I quote-‘to congratulate you and your officials on your effort; I have no doubt the task was immense'. This is the Labor government in South Australia supporting the free trade agreement with the United States. The Victorian government, who recently had their budget presentation, are allocating money in their budget to help Victorian companies take advantage of the free trade agreement. This stands in stark contrast to the Leader of the Opposition's negative antiAmericanism. He has had nothing to say about the free trade agreement with Thailand. Mr Wilkie interjecting",21
20,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Swan! Mr Wilkie interjecting,22
21,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Swan!,22
22,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He has had nothing to say about the free trade agreement with Singapore, but he has decided to come out and attack the free trade agreement with the United States. When the Leader of the Opposition began in that job, he went on A Current Affair and said: I'm not here in opposition for opposition's sake. And if Mr Howard does something that's good I'll be the first one to say, ‘Well let's hind that'. I call on the Leader of the Opposition to show the leadership that the premiers of Queensland, South Australia and Victoria have shown, get behind the free trade agreement and make sure that Australian businesses and workers are able to maximise the opportunities that this common sense agreement offers to them. NA",22
23,The SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon the Egyptian Minister for Supply and Internal Trade, His Excellency Dr Hassan Khedr, who is visiting Australia under the auspices of the Australian Wheat Board. Accompanying Dr Khedr is His Excellency the Egyptian Ambassador to Australia. On behalf of the House I extend a very warm welcome to both of our guests. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Australian Broadcasting Authority: Professor David Flint",22
24,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. What representations did the Prime Minister receive from Alan Jones concerning the reappointment of Professor David Flint as chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Authority in the lead-up to Professor Flint's reappointment in 2000?,22
25,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thought I already dealt with this, but I will say it again. I completely reject the claims made about some meeting and some discussion. In fact, I have no recollection of it. I have trawled through all of my correspondence, and I have been advised that that issue has not even been raised in correspondence I have had with Mr Jones. He does write to people. There is nothing wrong with that. He has a perfect right to do that. all get beBeyond that, I have nothing to say. Transport: Security",22
26,Mr BARRESI,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Would the Deputy Prime Minister update the House on actions undertaken in Australia to address land transport security?,22
27,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question and note his real interest in good public transport infrastructure, particularly in relation to the Scoresby, where I can assure him and the House that we will be seeking to hold the Bracks government to its original commitment to build the Scoresby as a freeway. Following the Madrid atrocities, it was agreed that the Australian Transport Council meeting which was scheduled for 30 April in Perth should focus on the issue of land transport security. That happened, and a communique has been issued out of it. Ministers at that meeting were briefed by Dennis Richardson, the head of ASIO, and by the head of my department, who had at that time just returned from leading a mission around the world to closely examine what countries around the world were doing to maximise the security of land transport-in particular, train services and public transport. That mission found that, like Australia, most countries have placed a great deal of emphasis on aviation security and have been and are placing a lot of work and effort into maritime security, but there is now a great focus on mass transit security. It should be noted that, I think, the head of ASIO was right to warn us that the past actions of terrorists are not necessarily any useful guide to their possible future activities. It should also be noted that the Australian government completely recognises that mass transit security is overwhelmingly a state responsibility. Nonetheless, the Australian government accepts that it has a leadership role to play in the collection of intelligence, which is your front-line defence against terrorism, and in the dissemination of that information to the relevant players at both government and private sector levels. It also has a role to play in areas such as coordination and cross-border security coordination arrangements. Mr Sidebottom interjecting",23
28,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am interested that the member opposite is very concerned to hear of the concerns of his state Labor colleagues about the issue of securing the safety of the travelling public. He is very interested! All Australian governments have agreed on, firstly, the need for an upgraded and nationally consistent approach to land transport security; secondly, the need to strengthen arrangements which cross state and territory borders; and, thirdly, the need for an upgraded approach to the national dangerous goods security program. All states and territories have gone away to progress the various recommendations that are before them. They have asked for a reference to the National Counter-Terrorism Committee. They have also agreed-very interestingly, together-to a public awareness campaign, because they believe that the previous campaign was valuable and we need to build on it. The question that arises out of that for those opposite is whether they will lift themselves above politics in this regard. I suppose that is hopeful, but we will ask them to see whether they can do as their state colleagues have done and lift themselves above politics and support the very real need for a further public education campaign so that we can alert the public to the critical role that they play in securing safety on our trains, in particular, and in our train stations, which are obviously difficult to secure without the full cooperation of the travelling public. Australian Broadcasting Authority: Professor David Flint",23
29,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is again to the Prime Minister. I refer to the Prime Minister's admission on the Neil Mitchell program on 30 April that he spoke to Alan Jones after the John Laws revelations on the morning of 28 April. Why did the initial statement released by the Prime Minister on 28 April contain no direct denial of the Laws allegations? Did the Prime Minister speak to Alan Jones on that day before making his second statement on the allegations much later in the day? Did he delay making a direct denial of the allegations until he had got his lines right with Alan Jones?,23
30,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The factual basis on which the question was asked is wrong. The initial statement that I made through a spokesman made it perfectly plain that I did not take instructions from anybody in relation to the appointment of people. In those circumstances, the fact base of the question is quite wrong. Agriculture: Sugar Industry",24
31,Mr CAUSLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. Would the minister inform the House what action the government has taken to address the difficulties facing the sugar industry? Is the minister aware of alternative policies?",24
32,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,A great package.,24
33,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Prime Minister comments ‘A great package'. This government has been very aware of the serious difficulties confronting the sugar industry that are really beyond the control of the industrycorrupt world markets, low prices and, of course, increasing competition from large suppliers such as Brazil-which have had a really devastating impact on this vital Australian industry. We recognise that this industry is important not only to the farmers, the mill workers and the others who are associated with it di- improvements. rectly but also to scores of regional towns, particularly in Queensland and New South Wales but also in Western Australia. This industry has contributed mightily to the tralian economy over the years. We believe it has the capacity to do so in the future, but it needs a bit of help now. So the Prime Minister announced at the end of last month a $440 million package to help the sugar industry through the current crisis. The centrepiece of this particular initiative is a $146 million sustainability grant which will provide assistance to everyone in the industry. It will provide additional support for farmers but it will also help the milling sector to ensure that they can survive these difficult times. The second key element is a $75 million regional strategy to help position the industry for a more diversified and secure future. We believe the industry will have to be different in the future. There will have to be significant changes made. The industry will need to focus much more on a wide variety of uses for cane than simply export sugar. We export about 85 per cent of our crop, which means we are very dependent upon the international market. I welcome Dr Khedr's presence in the gallery today. Whilst he is here specifically to talk about wheat-Egypt will probably be our biggest wheat customer this year, so his visit is very important to Australia-he has also expressed to me an interest in acquiring Australian sugar, and so these export markets are also of interest to Australia. But in the future we will need an industry that is doing other things with sugar, and this particular grants program will help achieve some of that diversification. In the interim there will be income support for farmers for 12 months; business planning assistance for growers and harvesters, as well as for the smaller and cooperative mills; and restructuring grants for growers to undertake on-farm In spite of all that, we accept that there will be some people who will want to make a future outside of the industry. For them there Aus- will be crisis counselling available, re-establishment and retraining grants to assist them in whatever new career they might choose, and a special assistance program to enable intergenerational transfer of cane farms through a three-year holiday window from the normal gifting provisions which apply to the age pension. This is the biggest assistance package to an Australian agricultural industry since the gon-with states deregulated the dairy industry. We lieve it will go a very significant way towards helping the sugar industry through these difficult times. Can I compliment the honourable member for Page for his role in helping to put this package together, along with the members for Richmond, Fairfax, Fadden, Hinkler, Dawson, Herbert, Leichhardt and Kalgoorlie, all of whom have had a keen interest in this.",24
34,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"All coalition, too.",25
35,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, all-curiouslygovernment members, who care about this industry and who want to see it go forward. The only real criticism has come from the opposite side, as one would expect, where there has been no commitment to this industry. But we are determined to have a strong and viable industry to share in our nation's future prosperity, and this package will help guarantee that. Military Detention: Australian Citizens",25
36,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, are you aware of recent media reports that US military interrogation techniques approved for use at the Guantanamo Bay prison involve not only sensory deprivation but also sexual taunting and humiliation, including interviewing prisoners whilst they are naked; and, furthermore, that claims of innocence by prisoners are not recorded? How are these claims consistent with statements made by the government that it is satisfied with the treatment of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay; and can the Prime Minister give an assurance that none of these practices have been applied to Australians?",25
37,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Denison for that question. Can I take this opportunity to say that I have specifically, in the past few days, had the Australian Ambassador in Washington raise with the PentaDeputy Secretary Paul beWolfowitz-the question of the interrogation and treatment of the two Australian detainees, Hicks and Habib. I am awareMr Bevis interjecting",25
38,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Brisbane!,25
39,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is a serious question and I am endeavouring to treat it in a serious fashion but, if the opposition want to interrupt, that is fine; it is an indication that they do not treat their colleagues' questions seriously. I am aware of those reports, and they disturb me, and we are satisfied on a number of bases about the treatment of Hicks and Habib. Australian officials, I am advised, have visited Guantanamo Bay on several occasions. They have been able to speak with Hicks and Habib, and with the United States personnel. On those visits, they have seen no evidence indicating that either man has been mistreated. Representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross have also seen both men in the course of regular visits to Guantanamo Bay. Mr Hicks's lawyer, Stephen Kenny, has stated that Mr Hicks gives ‘credit to those individuals who guard him and have treated him in a decent and human way within the limits set for them'. Nevertheless, given the serious nature of various reports, yesterday morning I rang the Australian Ambassador in Washington, Mr Thawley, to again seek specific assurances from the United States authority that no improper interrogation techniques had been used or would be used. That assurance, I am advised, was delivered by the Deputy Secretary of Defense, Paul Wolfowitz, to the effect that both Hicks and Habib had been treated humanely and would continue to be so treated. The government have consistently told the United States that we wish to see these cases resolved expeditiously. Mr Hicks has not yet been charged. Legal counsel have been appointed and are in discussion with the United States authorities. US authorities have advised that Mr Habib is likely to be included in the next list of detainees to be to trial. We will continue to follow this issue very closely. I believe we have taken particular steps to satisfy ourselves in relation to the treatment of the two men, without in any way prejudicing the outcome of any trial in which they will be involved. They are Australian citizens and they are entitled to the interest and the protection of the Australian government, consistent with a proper airing of the charges that may be brought against them. I believe that the Australian government has fulfilled those obligations to date, and it will continue to do so in the future. Health and Ageing: Payroll Tax",25
40,Mrs DRAPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Is the minister aware of any plans to increase the payroll tax on hospitals and aged care facilities? What is the government's response to these proposals to increase this tax?,26
41,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Makin for her question, and I regret to say that I am aware of proposals to increase taxes on health facilities. I can point out to the House that three years ago the Howard government introduced a brand-new scheme to fully protect workers' statutory entitlements, but now we have a proposal from the Australian Labor Party to reintroduce a federal payroll tax to cover something which the Howard government has already protected. It was a coalition government that abolished the federal payroll tax way back in 1971, but now the Leader of the Opposition wants to reintroduce a tax that has been dead for more than 30 years. About 500,000 Australians work in health care, and a payroll tax as envisaged by the Australian Labor Party is effectively a $25 million cut in health care funding. But what can you expect from members opposite? sent When it comes to the Labor Party, think Labor, think tax. In their federal history, they have come up with some 20 brand-new taxes-in fact, the Australian Labor Party have had a lifelong love affair with new taxes and higher taxes. In 1992 Labor introduced a training tax. In 1989 Labor introduced the Higher Education Contribution Scheme. In 1985 Labor introduced the capital gains tax and the fringe benefits tax. In 1984 Labor introduced the resource rent tax. In 1975 Labor introduced the coal export levy. In 1974 Labor introduced the Medibank levy. In 1945 Labor introduced a social security tax. In 1944 Labor introduced provisional tax. In 1942 Labor introduced a war tax and gift duty. In 1931 Labor introduced primage duty and a super tax on property incomes. In 1930 Labor introduced the wholesale sales tax. In 1916 Labor introduced an entertainment tax. In 1915 Labor introduced the first Commonwealth income tax and companies tax. In 1914 Labor introduced estate and succession duty. In 1910 Labor introduced a land tax. Mrs Irwin interjecting Mr Albanese interjecting",26
42,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I remind the members for Fowler and Grayndler that if they wish to be denied the opportunity to be present for the budget tonight I will be happy to facilitate that.,26
43,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There are at least 20 new taxes that Labor thought of first. Mr Albanese- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The point of order is on relevance.",27
44,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Grayndler will resume his seat, and I will rule. The Minister for Health and Ageing was asked a question about payroll tax as it applied to hospitals, and he is entirely in order. Mr Albanese interjecting",27
45,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Grayndler is warned!,27
46,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I point out that nearly all of the 20 brand-new taxes that Labor thought of first have fallen on the health industry and workers in the health care sector. The Leader of the Opposition increased rates when he was mayor and, as sure as night follows day, he would increase taxes and invent new ones if he ever got to be Prime Minister. Health: Australian Hearing",27
47,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Is the minister aware that Australian Hearing publicly denied rumours of a downgrade of services at its Burnie centre when these rumours were made public in the Advocate newspaper on 5 May 2004? Is the minister aware that senior representatives of Australian Hearing referred to rumoured changes at its permanent Burnie site as no more than ‘a well-earned makeover'? Is the minister further aware that a letter to over 2,000 clients officially announcing that the Burnie centre was being changed from a permanent site to a visiting site of six days per fortnight from 17 May was already in the post at the time management were denying these rumours? Will the minister immediately intervene in this matter and restore these important services before it is too late, and before I meet with Australian Hearing management this Thursday at midday?",27
48,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am not aware of the facts that the member puts to me. I certainly will consider the matters that the honourable member has raised, and if there is anything that I think I can usefully add to what he has put to me I certainly will. Let me assure the member for Braddon that this government is deeply committed to the provision of hearing services to the Australian public. I would advise the member for Braddon to listen very carefully to the budget statement and to carefully read the budget papers that he will have available to him tonight. Mr Sidebottom-I seek leave to table three articles from the local newspaper and the letter from Australian Hearing in Burnie in relation to the downgrading of these services. Leave granted. Economy: Resources Sector",27
49,Mr NEVILLE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources. Would the minister inform the House how the Australian resources sector is contributing to the economy? Is the minister aware of any threats to investment and jobs in the resources sector?",27
50,Mr IAN MACFARLANE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Hinkler for his question. He is a great supporter of the resources sector, which of course provides thousands of jobs in his electorate; Australia wide it provides some 90,000 jobs and is our biggest single export earner. As the member for Hinkler and those on this side know, the resources sector is the lifeblood of many regional communities, and it is supported by companies that generate the national wealth which will underpin the family-friendly budget measures which this government will be handing down tonight. The member for Hinkler asked me if I am aware of any threats to the resources sector were a Labor government to be elected. There is almost a constant cascade of anti resources sector policies coming from those who sit opposite. We have already seen the potential policy of a Labor government to wind back the diesel fuel rebate on the resources sector, which will cost that sector some $500 million. I was recently in the member for Kalgoorlie's seat, where the resources sector were outraged at the Labor proposal to abolish AWAs, which are an intrinsic part of the flexibility of the resources sector and the employment of workers in such regional areas. We have just heard of Labor's intention to impose a payroll tax on all Australian wage payers who employ Australians, and that payroll tax of course is of further concern to the resources sector. The resources sector is extremely worried about these antibusiness policies. But it gets worse-it actually gets much worse. Under a Labor government the Labor Party will introduce a ‘use it or lose it' policy towards retention leases for the resources sector. That policy attacks the very basic tenet of sovereign risk in Australia. Sovereign risk gives Australian companies and global companies that invest in Australia the security they need to make the billions of dollars of investments that create the jobs in Australia. Once the unequalled premier sovereign risk policy that currently exists is threatened by the Labor policy, which is not only ‘use it or lose it' ‘use it the way the Labor Party tells you to or lose it', then the investments that global companies make in Australia will be made elsewhere. That will cost Australia investment, that will cost Australia jobs and that will cost Australia its economic growth. If we want to see what a Labor government does in terms of its policies on sovereign risk, we need look no further than Queensland. Today in the parliament in Queensland a Labor government is introducing legislation to strip away the leases of a global company based in Queensland. That action by a Labor government puts under threat our A1 rating as a country which protects the rights of companies that invest here. Our sovereign risk status is without equal in the world. The Labor Party will threaten that policy and that status. That will cost Australian jobs, that will cost Australian investment and that will cost Australia's economic growth. NA",27
51,The SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon members of the eighth delegation from the International Youth Cooperation Development Centre of Vietnam, who are visiting Australia under the auspices of the Political Exchange Council. On behalf of the House, I extend a very warm welcome to our guests. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Immigration: Detention Centres",28
52,Mr ORGAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. In light of reports on the deleterious conditions faced by detainees in Australian detention centres, most notably by children, will the Prime Minister ratify the United Nations optional protocol to the convention against torture and inhumane treatment to ensure that Australian detention but centres and other facilities are open and accountable and that actions which are clearly inhumane according to international standards do not occur in this country?",28
53,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Cunningham for his question. I will seek advice as to our present position in relation to that particular protocol. I cannot off the top of my head recall what it is, but I will find out and I will come back to the honourable member. I do not accept that the treatment of people is in breach of our international obligations. I am keen, as are all members of the government, to ensure that there is compliance with our obligations under international agreements to which we are party. We are very proud of our human rights record. I believe that it compares very favourably with the best human rights records of other countries around the world. Research and Development: Backing Australia's Ability Initiative",28
54,Mr BARTLETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Education, Science and Training. Would the minister advise the House how Backing Australia's Ability will raise the quality of Australian research and increase opportunities for the commercialisation of Australian ideas?",29
55,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Macquarie for his question and for his very strong interest in Australian science, and medical science in Western Sydney in particular. This government is constantly thinking about Australia's future and the decisions that have to be taken today in order to create the future that we want and leave the next generation of Australians an economic and social legacy in which we can have confidence. For that reason, last week the Prime Minister, on behalf of the government, announced the most historic investment in Australian research and innovation that has ever been made, of $5.3 billion over the next seven years. That will take to $52 billion the investment in Australian research and innovation by the federal government in the decade from 2001. The initiatives are focused on three priority areas. The first area is quality. As a tively small country, we need to ensure that very sound investment in research supports the highest quality research wherever it occurs in Australia. The second area is collaboration. As much as we can, we must support collaboration not just between Australian researchers and overseas researchers but also amongst our institutions in Australia, such as the CSIRO and universities. The third priority area is the commercialisation of research. This $5.3 billion package includes, for example, an extra $305 million to the CSIRO over the next seven years to focus on key national priorities for research and commercialisation, including increasing by some tenfold the economic, social and cultural benefits we derive from the use of water; increasing by $3 billion the return that we get from food manufacturing; cutting in half our greenhouse gas emissions; and significantly increasing the efficiency of new energies. The package includes $1.1 billion of additional investment in university research infrastructure-in high-speed transmission in supercomputing, in laboratories and in libraries, and in all of the infrastructure so essential to supporting research in Australian universities. The package will mean a doubling by 2011 of the total investment in regional research through the Australian Research Council and $1.4 billion of additional investment in Australian research. Importantly, every year 20 per cent of that research budget will be committed specifically to collaboration. It also includes 250 scholarships a year so that postgraduate students can undertake a six-month course specifically in research commercialisation. There is $1½ billion to support large and small industries in commercialising Australian research and to support emerging technologies. The government will also be committing $2.8 million to establish and design a quality assessment relaframework so that, two years from now, Australia's Minister for Science will be able, with much more confidence, to make decisions about allocating this $5.3 billion into areas of research that we confidently know are of the highest quality. As a country of only 20 million people, making up 0.3 per cent of world population, in this century in particular we cannot afford to squander research resources, even with this significant investment, on research which is not of the highest quality. The government will be absolutely committed to see that the CSIRO, our Defence scientists, our university researchers and research organisations across this country work together and produce high-quality research and that, importantly, wherever we can as a country we turn money into knowledge and also knowledge back into money through innovation. Australian Defence Industries: Sale  to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, why did you promise the construction of a 100hectare park and sporting complex at the ADI site at St Marys without committing any money to the project and knowing that the project is outside the government's contract with the ADI developer, Delfin Lend Lease? Will the government now release the full details of the ComLand sale agreement with Delfin Lend Lease?",29
56,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am indebted to the member for Chifley for reminding me of a very important announcement that I made in the western suburbs of Sydney. I think it was in the electorate of Lindsay, in the company of the magnificent member for Lindsay. I am not a walking encyclopaedia-I do not carry all these details around and I will have to and check-but I say to the member for Chifley that it is my understanding that it was part of the contract arrangement that there be land set aside for the sporting complex. The member for Chifley is shaking his head-he may be right, but I will check all of the details, because I would never have made a statement like that unless it was based on the knowledge that it was part of the understanding that something be provided. I will be very happy to check those details. I will write to the member and I will make a copy available to the member for Lindsay, because she displays a great aggressive and energetic interest in these matters. Research and Development: Backing Australia's Ability Initiative",30
57,Mr NAIRN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Science. Would the minister detail funding available to the CSIRO under the government's Backing Australia's Ability announcement? Is the minister aware of any alternative policies?,30
58,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Eden-Monaro for his question and for his role as one of the major drivers within the government in regard to science and innovation policy formulation. He took as much pride as any other member of the government, if not more, in the announcement last week of Backing Australia's Ability mark II, which again saw record sums directed at science and innovation, specifically $305 million for CSIRO's flagship programs. As a number of members would be aware-certainly all those on this sideCSIRO has some six flagships. They address the largest and most pressing-urgent, even-issues facing Australia, and cover preventative health care, water, food, energy, wealth from oceans, and light metals. It is a collaborative program within CSIRO, bringgo ing in other research agencies, institutions and industry. We have supported them to the tune of $305 million. More narrowly, over the next four years $800 million will be invested in the flagship programs, which will have such a tangible, targeted impact on Australia's biggest social, economic and environmental problems. Of that $800 million, $400 million will come from CSIRO's existing budget and there will be $155 million in additional funding from the government and an estimated $245 million external funding. Over the next seven years this investment will be close to $1½ billion. CSIRO has been placed at the centre of the government's science and innovation strategy. I am asked, ‘Are there any alternative policies?' There are no policies from the Labor Party, but there is a proposal and it was revealed by the shadow minister for science and research in an address he gave to an audience at the Australian National University on 7 August 2003. This was the topic of his lecture: ‘Is smashing CSIRO the answer to the research funding crisis?' On behalf of the government I wish to assure the 6½ thousand members of CSIRO, and the wider community, that the answer is a resounding no. But I cannot presume to speak for the Labor Party. I do know from the Labor Party's actions and especially those of the shadow minister for science and research that there is an unrelenting anti-CSIRO campaign-one of denigration on a personal level and of abuse of scientific record. The Labor Party have a campaign against CSIRO. There are no policies to speak of, but I remind the House that I made the point last year that on 14 October we were promised by the shadow minister for science a policy in these terms: A national research and innovation strategy be announced over the coming period ... That was more than six months ago. The government has a policy; the Labor Party simply do not and never will. Family Services: Good Beginnings",30
59,Mr ZAHRA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services. Minister, will you give an assurance that the Good Beginnings early intervention parenting program in Moe will continue to be funded by the federal government beyond the end of this year? Given that this local program provides assistance and advice to around 150 families per month in the Latrobe Valley, a region of identified social and economic disadvantage, will you ensure that this program is allowed to continue its important work in providing help and support to families with young children?",31
60,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I remind the member for MCMillan and, in fact, the member for Chifley that the term ‘you' is inappropriate. It should have been, ‘Will the minister give the assurance?'",31
61,Mr ANTHONY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would like to thank the member for asking the question. Indeed, I remember a number of years ago going down into the area of MCMillan and launching that particular Good Beginnings project. Good Beginnings is a terrific success story. I might say that the coalition government, from the Prime Minister down, have been great supporters of what Good Beginnings is doing. It is encouraging volunteers to go into the homes of families with newborns and give the parents basic life skills to deal with raising children in those early weeks and months. The government is a great supporter of that. Indeed, it was only a couple of weeks ago that the Prime Minister made an announcement that we would fund Good Beginnings will nationally with a considerable amount of money-$3 million-over the next four years to ensure they have a solid foundation on a national basis. Ultimately it is up to them where they allocate projects, but, as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, I will certainly speak to them to ensure that those projects in your area are catered for, as I will do to support Good Beginnings projects right round Australia.",31
62,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am indebted to the minister for the assurance that projects in my area will be catered for, but I remind him that it would have been appropriate to address that remark through me to the member. Family Services: Stronger Families and Communities Strategy",31
63,Mr DUTTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is also addressed to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. Would the minister inform the House of any recent government initiatives to help young children and parents?,32
64,Mr ANTHONY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would like to thank the member for Dickson. I know he has been a great supporter of Australian children. He has operated child-care centres, and he looked after young children in his previous career, in the police force in Queensland-as he does, of course, in his role with the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs at the moment. I am delighted to tell the parliament about a very important announcement made by the Prime Minister just before Easter. We committed $365 million to our Stronger Families and Communities Strategy. It is all about providing better opportunities for Australian children through very innovative grassroots projects. This is a considerable investment in the early childhood years. We believe that we should empower local communities to come up with local solutions to find the best answer for children. I would like to talk a little bit about $365 million package, of which $110 million is geared towards 35 sites across Australia. There will be funding of between $3 million and $4 million, organised and led by a leading NGO-it could be Mission Australia; it could be many others-to target, in those communities, between 2,000 and 3,000 children. We can directly help those children through nutritional programs, parenting programs or discipline programs-a whole range of programs. But it is up to the program organisers to come back to government rather than government telling them how to improve the health and well-being of children in those particular communities. There has been a show of bipartisan support. One program was in the Leader of the Opposition's electorate. The member for Gippsland has been a great advocate of Kilmany UnitingCare, which is trying to enhance the lives of children in that community. We have more to announce in the weeks and months ahead. The Invest to Grow initiative is $70 million to support national programs like Good Beginnings, as I mentioned in my answer to the previous question, and things like what Fiona Stanley does with ARACY. It is about local answers, where local communities come up with local solutions to local problems. I would like to congratulate the member for Kalgoorlie, who has been a great advocate of a program we put into his electorate recently to strengthen mining families in the Eastern Goldfields area. Mining families come under enormous pressure when it comes to managing work and family. The $125 million flexible child-care initiative is trying to assist those in in-home care-there are many families who are shift workers, there are many involved in emergency services and there are many in which a child has a significant disability; and even in farming communities child care can go into homesthe and there are also incentives for long day care. But what is interesting is the Labor Party's comments on the Stronger Families and Communities Strategy. They have stated that the Stronger Families and Communities Strategy is a hotchpotch of ideas. Indeed, the Leader of the Opposition wants to raid the Stronger Families and Communities Strategy-it is all about early childhood, which is surprising-to support their mentoring programs. Mr Tanner interjecting",32
65,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Melbourne!,33
66,Mr ANTHONY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In fact, all we hear about from the Leader of the Opposition, particularly in the early childhood area, is a lot of motherhood statements, a lot of rhetoric-but it is very short on detail. I have to say that we are not talking about it; we are actually delivering. The refocused Stronger Families and Communities Strategy is a prebudget announcement, but it is not the only thing we will be doing for Australian families. Indeed, the Treasurer will have a number of exciting announcements for Australian families tonight that he has been working on with the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister has often described work and family as the real barbecue stopper. I hope tonight that Australian families fire up the barbecue at 7.30 p.m. The PM has said that, up until now, we have just had a couple of beers. Australian families should get out the salads. They should marinate the steaks and maybe pop the cork on the Jacob's Creek, because the Treasurer will be hosting one ripper of a barby tonight and the steaks will be sizzling.",33

71,Mr ABBOTT,ADDITIONAL ANSWERS," Mr Speaker, I seek the indulgence of the chair to add to an answer.",33
72,The SPEAKER,ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,The minister may proceed.,33
73,Mr ABBOTT,ADDITIONAL ANSWERS,"In further response to the member for Braddon and, through him, to his constituents, let me inform the House that the Australian Hearing office in Burnie is not closing. I am advised that Australian Hearing will change the operation of its Burnie hearing centre with effect from 17 May. This change is necessary because of the shortage of resident audiologists in Burnie. I am advised that clinical services will be provided for an equivalent of two weeks in every month by two qualified audiologists who are based in Melbourne and Launceston. Technical services for the repair of hearing aids will be provided one day per week by a visiting technician. I understand that Australian Hearing has advised its 2,000 clients of the details of the new service. It has also advised members of parliament, local hospitals and doctors. Australian Hearing is confident that this new service will continue to meet the government's obligation to children under 21 years of age and to people with complex hearing needs. NA Comcar Drivers: Security Passes",33
74,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"On 1 April 2004, the member for Cowan asked me about security passes for Comcar drivers. There has been no general withdrawal of photographic passes for Comcar drivers. One Comcar driver had his photographic pass cancelled in October 2003, following a request from Comcar management. Several of the 11 photographic passes issued to permanent Comcar drivers have expired in recent months and have been reviewed by the parliamentary Pass Office in accordance with their routine audit process. It has now been agreed between the Parliament House Pass Office and Comcar management representatives that photographic passes will be issued to all 11 permanent Comcar drivers, subject to their maintaining regular and frequent access to the restricted areas of Parliament House. Comcar management has agreed with the Pass Office that, if a driver does not maintain regular and freconcludes: quent access, that driver's Parliament House photographic pass should be withdrawn. Parliament: Photographs of Proceedings",34
75,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"At the end of the last period of sittings, the member for Hunter asked if I could give the House an update on investigations into the presence in the House of Representatives gallery of an unauthorised television camera during the address to both houses last year by President George W. Bush. I am now concluding this matter by making a final report to the House. I have received a copy of the report by Mr Daniel Bolger, the media liaison officer employed under contract by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to coordinate media arrangements for the visit. I understand that Mr Bolger's report has been provided to a Senate estimates committee. I present a copy of the report for the information of members. I also received the results of the investigation undertaken by the Serjeant-at-Arms into the same matter. The serjeant's report goes to matters that impact on security more widely, and I am not able to make it available. However, I will cover the serjeant's relevant conclusions in this statement. Mr Bolger's report makes only brief references to the presence of an unauthorised camera in the gallery. It notes that a request from the White House advance team to have a United States camera placed in the gallery was refused and this was confirmed in writing after reference to me. Despite this advice, it notes that a US pool television camera was taken into the gallery. The only insight the report gives as to how this occurred is that the US travel pool arrived at the entrance to the galleries after the speech had begun and subsequently was able to enter the gallery. The report from the Serjeant-at-Arms - Clear and unambiguous advice was given to the US team that a television camera was not permitted in the open galleries. Contrary to the Speaker's clear direction, a camera was taken into the northern gallery and took footage that was subsequently aired on international and Australian television networks; - The security screening procedures failed to prevent the entry of the camera into the gallery. The late arrival to the gallery area of the US travel pool, with television camera/s, when attention and resources were focussed within the galleries themselves appears to have created the gap. It should be noted that, while the rules for the television coverage of the House's proceedings were breached by the security lapse, there was no broader security concern as the travel pool had been screened on entering the building and their movements constantly monitored; and - Security staff in the galleries who saw camera assumed the camera had been ised and took no action to remove it. Unfortunately, we were not aware of the presence of the US camera crew in the gallery until footage was aired on international television. By this time the crew had left the building and, shortly afterwards, left the country. In these circumstances, it was not possible to identify conclusively or take action against the crew involved, nor is it now possible to take any action. I think it is a matter of great regret that this incident occurred and that those who were guests in this parliament chose to ignore the clear direction that had been given by me. Had we been aware earlier of the presence of the camera in the gallery, the strongest action would have been taken. I consider the matter now closed.

More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",36
84,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"One could be forgiven for wondering just who is going to run the country next year if the Liberal government is re-elected. We have a Prime Minister who refuses to commit to serving for the life of the next parliament and a Treasurer who wonders out loud whether he has any more budgets left in him. I was astonished to hear the member for Adelaide on radio this morning saying how demanding it had been for the Treasurer to put together nine budgets and how hard it had been on the Treasurer's family and that, yes, it might be appropriate for him to soon move on to be Prime Minister, as if the Treasurer is going to become Prime Minister so that he can have a rest! The bad news for the Treasurer is that Australia in the 21st century is not like Australia in the fifties, when Bob Menzies could go to Lords to watch the cricket while the country took care of itself. Being PM is a bit more onerous than that. Mr MCGauran-Are you reading this? He's reading his speech!",36
85,The SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The Minister for Science does not have the call. tres,36
86,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"However, it turns out that the country is being run by John Howard-that is, John Howard of Howard Partners Pty Ltd, a firm of consultants who did an evaluation last year of Australia's Cooperative Research Centre Program. Howard Partners recommended that cooperative research centres, known around the the traps as CRCs, be industry driven and that pure public-good related research not be part of the program in future. That the Howard government accepted this recommendation is utterly regrettable. It has sounded the death knell for environmental CRCs such as Rainforest CRC and CRC Reef. It has also sounded the death knell for the CRC for the coastline and guaranteed that there will be no funding for the proposed CRC on solar energy. I am very disappointed that successive Howard government environment ministers, both Senator Hill and Minister Kemp, have been disengaged from the CRC process and have allowed this debacle to happen. Why weren't they advocating in the Cabinet the importance of research into protecting our environment? They will say, and the government will say, that whether CRCs get funded or not is the subject of an independent assessment and not their decision, but they were party to a government decision to put an end to pure public-good research and to say that the CRCs must all be industry driven. We have a situation now where the success or failure of your CRC project is all about the size of the industry contributions. So we will have CRCs into coal and cotton but no research into what is needed to protect the Great Barrier Reef or into what is needed to protect our World Heritage listed wet tropics rainforests. What is it that the Bible says? ‘To those who have much, more will be given; but to those who do not have, what little they have will be taken away.' That is typical of Liberal Party performance. The longer they stay in office the more their true colours shine through. By abandoning research from the CRCs into the reef, the rainforests and the coast, the government ensures that we will hear less about the environmental problems which these magnificent areas are facing. I suspect that is exactly how this government wants it. This is a government for whom no environmental news is good environmental news. As long as we do not hear too much about the problem, all will be well. We will hear plenty of talk tonightbudget night-about deficits, but this government has been running a massive environmental deficit. Whether it is land clearing, the extraction of water from our rivers, greenhouse gas emissions or salinity, we are creating an environmental debt for our children and leaving behind an unsustainable legacy of which they will have to bear the consequences. One of the CRCs being defunded, Rainforest CRC, did a report in January this year which examined the impact of climate change on the wet tropics rainforests. Many rainforest species can only survive in a very limited, mountainous and high-rainfall habitat. Climate change will reduce the area in which many of these species can live, typically pushing them up the mountain. Rainforest CRC found that for endangered species, such as the golden bowerbird, an increase in temperature of just one degree Celsius will shrink the area of habitat in which they can survive by 50 per cent. It might not suit the government to hear this news because it underscores just how short-sighted their policy is to refuse to ratify the Kyoto protocol on climate change, but it is the kind of information we need in order to develop good public policy to protect the wet tropics. I visited North Queensland last week and spoke with Professor Nigel Stork, the head of Rainforest CRC in the wet tropics, about his CRC's work. I was very impressed with innovations up there such as the canopy crane, which enables researchers to look at the treetops and examine them without the need to endlessly climb up and down the trees. I was also impressed by the way in which Rainforest CRC brings together a range of research bodies, such as James Cook University. I met some of the researchers from Rainforest CRC and it was clear that their morale had taken a battering, not unlike the effect of one of those North Queensland cyclones. I think it is inevitable that this decision brain drain south from North Queensland of researchers who wanted to pursue a career in relation to the reef or the wet tropics but who no longer will be able to do that. Make no mistake, this decision is a disaster for James Cook University and for North Queensland. I also met with groups who were distressed about the defunding of CRC Reef. Not only environment groups but also the Association of Marine Park Tourism Operators and organisations like the Australian Institute of Marine Science in Townsville were talking about the kind of work and the significance of the work which CRC Reef does. As the tourism operators know better than most, there is a $4.3 billion tourism industry in the Great Barrier Reef catchment and it employs more than 47,000 people. That industry depends absolutely on the continued health of the Great Barrier Reef. You have to protect the asset and everyone up there knows it. Our reef must continue to be better than other reefs around the world. We must face up to threats to the reef from coral bleaching caused by climate change, from land based run-off and from overfishing. To get sound public policy decisions we need sound research. Without research or evidence, no action will be taken and the reef and the rainforests will just slowly deteriorate. Just what part of $4.3 billion is it that the science minister does not understand? The Liberal member for Herbert, just like former Liberal Party President Tony Staley, knows this decision is wrong. The member for Herbert said, ‘This has been a disaster and it just can't be allowed to happen.' Unfortunately, he has no influence in this place, and it is happening. The Liberal member for Leichhardt has more influence in this place, but he supports the government line. It is time the member for Leichhardt became North Queensland's advocate in Canberra, rather than the Liberal Party's advocate in will lead to a North Queensland. I want to turn now to the decision to defund the Coastal CRC. Labor understands that the decision to defund the Coastal CRCMr MCGauran-Whose decision?",36
87,The SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The member for Wills will resume his seat and we will stop the clock. I am not here to disadvantage him. The Minister for Science would be among the first to express indignation if he were being interrupted by someone on the other side. He will lead by example.,38
88,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. The rapid population shift to the sea change coastal zone can cause the loss or degradation of, or irreversible change to, coastal habitats. River and tidal flows are being altered, beaches eroded, and vegetation is being cleared along waterways. Water quality is deteriorating from excess nutrients, urban stormwater run-off and domestic sewage. Pollution and sediment are impacting on our creeks, rivers and bays. Competition for coastal resources such as potable water supplies or new land for urban growth is putting many local councils under severe pressure to come up with suitable options that maintain services and preserve the amenity of our landscape. There is a need to increase protection for our beaches, coastal zone and waterways. That is something that Labor understand, with a coastal protection policy that we released just a couple of short weeks ago. The Coastal Cooperative Research Centre has been addressing these challenges since 2000 with a range of social, economic and environmental research and development projects. It was advised that it was unsuccessful in its rebid for future federal government funding for seven years, based on a two-page summary that all rebidding CRCs were obliged to complete. If that CRC does not continue, you will have not only the loss of the full-time jobs there but the loss of our only independent national coastal research and development organisation, the loss of coastal research and development coordination and data sharing between the states and one of the territories, and the loss of Australia's professional research and management networks, such as the National Estuaries Network. You will have the loss of the potential to export coastal management expertise to developing countries in the Asia-Pacific region, the of a key organisation to facilitate the implevelopment, mentation plan for the government's framework for a national cooperative approach to integrated coastal zone management and the loss of coastal science capacity for regional NAP and NHT groups. I also mention that some of the Coastal CRC's best achievements have benefited Brisbane and Rockhampton residents. The ecosystem health of Moreton Bay has been assessed. This CRC developed and implemented an ecosystem health monitoring program to monitor water quality in Moreton Bay and its estuaries. That program provides data for an annual report card rating system. It is being used by local councils. to better management practices such as sediment controls and sewage treatment plant upgrades. The annual report card receives considerable publicity. The Coastal CRC has also developed remote-sensing technology which is being used around Australia's tropical estuaries and coasts. Key water quality parameters, such as chlorophyll and suspended sediments, can now be assessed cost effectively using new imaging technology. That is being used by Queensland's EPA to monitor changes in marine biodiversity in Moreton Bay and along the Capricorn Coast. I also want to make some reference to the decision not to fund a Solar CRC. The Solar CRC application comprised the Australian National University, Murdoch University, the University of Sydney, Central Queensland University, the University of South Australia and Origin Energy and involved the Australian Greenhouse Office, CSIRO and the governments of the ACT, South Australia and Western Australia. It was to focus on solar photovoltaics and solar thermal energy. The failure of that application means that there continues to be zero strategic federal loss support for renewable energy research, dedemonstration and commercialisation. It follows the closure in recent years of the Energy Research and Development Corporation, the Australian CRC for Renewable Energy and the Australian Greenhouse Office Renewable Energy Commercialisation Program. Professor Andrew Blakers, Director of the Centre for Sustainable Energy Systems at the ANU in Canberra, said last week: I wish I knew why there is more than $100 million available for fossil fuel strategic research and development, and why the corresponding sum of money available for renewable energy strategic research and development is zero dollars It has led and zero cents. He also said: The Government has behaved quite irresponsibly over the last five or six years in closing down, one by one, every single one of the renewable energy strategic funding agencies while transferring large, large sums of money into the fossil fuel industry. And if rumour is correct, there'll be another $100 million or so going into the fossil fuel industry in the next Budgetthat is, the budget tonightand that will make the score $200 million to nil. The problem is that there is a huge gap to take basic research and development and turn it into a commercial product. That is the sort of gap that a cooperative research centre would fund, but the government have been closing down those various bodies which could have closed that gap. Now there is nothing at all for solar energy. The government say: ‘We don't make those decisions; they are made by an independent committee.' The chair of the CRC committee which chooses the centres which are funded just happens to be the government Chief Scientist, Robin Batterham, who is also employed by the mining corporation Rio Tinto. Mr MCGauran-He is not.",38
89,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The Minister for Science has acknowledged that Dr Batterham participated in the recent CRC funding decisions, but he denies that there is any conflict of interest. We are concerned that, while Dr Batterham has been Chief Scientist, research money for fossil fuel technologies has flourished and research money for renewable energy has evaporated. It has dried up. This government's response to the conflict of interest issue is completely unsatisfactory. When the conflict of interest issue is raised, the government says: ‘Dr Batterham makes these funding decisions as the Chief Scientist. He's making decisions in the public interest and his position at Rio Tinto doesn't come into it.' But when Labor seeks to question Dr Batterham before a Senate committee, the government says: ‘You can't do that. Dr Batterham is not a public servant; he's a private sector man.' This nonsense must stop. Either Dr Batterham is acting on behalf of taxpayers or he is acting on behalf of Rio Tinto. He should appear before a Senate committee so that his status, the conflict of interest allegations and the reasons why renewable energy research gets so little funding under this government can be sorted out once and for all. This government has lost sight of what cooperative research centres should be all about. When a previous Labor government established the CRC program back in 1990, we did so in response to clear market failure in certain research areas. The private sector simply was not carrying out research in areas where research was in the public interest. A Labor government would overturn this government's decision to defund these CRCs, and we would also overturn the Howard government's change to CRC guidelines, which has caused their demise. The Howard government does not believe in public good research because it does not believe in the public good. If there is not an immediate dollar in it, it just does not get it. But Labor believe that both North Queensland and our environment deserve better than that, and we will act to look after them the way they should be looked after. Not only will we support the kind of research which has been carried out in these areas but, under the coastal policy which we have developed, we will act to ensure that our precious coastline is protected and that we do not, as we are in danger of doing, end up loving those areas of coastline to death. We have been prepared in outlining our coastline policy to indicate the importance we place on it. This government, in defunding the CRC for coastline areas, indicates that it places no importance on that area of research and is no longer interested in that issue. (Time expired)",40
90,Mr MCGAURAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The Labor Party has a credibility problem in coming into the chamber to debate this matter of public importance on environment cooperative research centres-and so does the shadow minister-in that there was not a single question asked today, in either the House of Representatives or the Senate, on this subject. The Labor Party had some 18 questions available to it today in which it could have asked about this matter of great public importance, and it failed to do so. That is unheard of. Every member of this House knows that the MPI, a daily debate, signifies the most pressing, urgent issue which faces the opposition and consumes public attention. Yet there was not a single question on this issue. This is a charade. This is completely concocted anger and a completely constructed argument against a normal, sensible and entirely creditable government decision. The Manager of Opposition Business, Ms Gillard, remains in the House. Perhaps she can enlighten us as to why the tactics committee of the opposition did not allow one of the nine questions the opposition asked today to tackle this issue. I was ready. I think there are matters of great public policy at stake here, but I would have liked the opposition to have treated it seriously and pursued it instead of putting this great issue of the most pressing kind in the graveyard shift. This is the matter of public importance before the budget. The eyes of the nation are hardly on this matter of public importance. Put it up tomorrow, put it up Wednesday, put it up Thursday, put it up next weekMs Gillard-We're not sitting next week.",40
91,Mr MCGAURAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Next sitting week. Put it up again. Ask me some questions. But instead you slink in here and think: ‘Well, we need a time filler. This might as well be it.' The most important aspect of this is that we finally have a concrete policy announcement by the opposition. I happen to disagree with it, as I will now establish, but I respect that we finally have an announcement as to science policy. It is a bit curious that the shadow minister for the environment is announcing it. I trust you have the consent and agreement of your counterpart, the shadow minister for science, and even the shadow cabinet. You have said two things: first, you will change the criteria under which the cooperative research centres program is based. Fair enough. I do not agree with you; you have done no consultation on this except in the last few days, but that is your entitlement should you come to office.",41
92,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The minister will address his remarks through the chair.,41
93,Mr MCGAURAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The second major announcement today by the shadow minister for the environment is that the decisions of the cooperative research centres selection committee will be overturned. That is fundamental to this debate, because there are 52 applications before the CRC selection committee. Nineteen of those 52 have not made it through to stage 2. The first 19 have not progressed. Of the 52 there would be, I guess, between 10 to 15 funded. How can the opposition selectively, almost at random, choose some of those-disappointed, understandably-38 or 40 applicants and support others? It is an absurdity. We have probity lawyers all the way through this process to ensure that no-one gets an unfair advantage, that all are treated equally, and that the politics are kept out of it. I am completely at arm's length. I am glad that the shadow minister for the environment did not, in his descent into filthy politics with his attack on the Chief Scientist-a very distinguished Australian-go that far and say that I had somehow interfered. He conceded that there is no question about the probity and fairness of this entire process. So you are going to turn it on its head. An independent scientific panel has selected 33 applicants out of 52 to go to the next stage, and even then a large number of them will not be funded. Yet you are going to ride to the rescue, and it just happens that the politics surround the largest complainants of those who are unsuccessful. What about the other 19? Of the 19 that were unsuccessful, you have announced today that three will be funded. What about the other 16? Aren't they in marginal seats? Aren't they friends of the Labor Party? Haven't they made enough noise? You are going to choose three out of 19",41
94,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The minister will address his remarks through the chair!,42
95,Mr MCGAURAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The shadow minister for the environment will choose three out of 19 and possibly three out of 40 unsuccessful applicants. That is improper. That is politics at its worse. No wonder the scientific community cannot take the Labor Party seriously. You are going to ride in on a white horse and, for base political reasons, assist three fortunate, privileged CRCs. That is a nonsense, and the Labor Party will have the Auditor-General down around its head. It is as simple as that. Under the guidelines estabin lished for the CRC program, we have an independent CRC committee, and I have got every confidence in its judgment and the decisions that it has made. My role as Minister for Science is to make decisions at the very end of the process-the final recommendations of the CRC selection committee. Bear in mind that we fund this program very generously-$200 million a year-but you cannot fund every applicant for research funding. You would need $2 billion a year if you were to fund, through the CRC program, all of the applicants. Of course it is on a competitive basis. Every aspect of research funding, with a few notable exceptions, is competitively based. Would the Labor Party have us believe that every applicant to the Australian Research Council or the National Health and Medical Research Council should be funded? Of course not. Are you going to intervene in those bodies too-for those unsuccessful applicants that catch your eye or that you want to assist for your political strategies? It is a nonsense. You have got no credibility, you are distorting good governance and good government, and it is a very risky path that you are proceeding down. In any event, let us look at those three CRCs that you now wish to re-fund, despite an expert panel saying they cannot have continued funding when their funding expires in two years. Bear in mind that they have still got two years funding. They have got a lot of other options. The CRC for reef have been in existence since 1993 and have had some $31 million of Commonwealth funding over that period. They have had $31 million, and they have still got two years to run to make alternative arrangements if possible. The tropical rainforests CRC have also been going since 1993, and they have received approximately the same amount. They have received $29½ million. The CRC for coastal zone has been existence since 1999 and it has received $17.8 million from the Commonwealth. This is a mature research program. It has been going since 1990. Of course the government were entitled, after 14 years, to review the guidelines, and we decided to redraft the guidelines-as was known to all of the applicants when they made their submissions in December of last year-to more reflect Australia's industrial and economic needs. I hasten to addMr Kelvin Thomson-We don't agree with you.",42
96,Mr MCGAURAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You do not agree with us? Fair enough, but I want to see that in writing. I want to see the shadow minister for science put in writing now what the shadow minister for the environment has announced. There is nothing in writing from the opposition on this. They take advantage of the limited but politically advantageous use of radio grabs and perhaps quick TV grabs and local media in North Queensland, but they will do nothing here. There is nothing in the parliament apart from this paltry debate and there is nothing in writing. I chalthat lenge the shadow minister for the environment and his Labor colleagues: have the courage of your convictions and put in writing that you are changing the criteria. And you had better explain also why these three environmental CRCs will be re-funded and whom you are going to take the money off. Given that every program is limited and has a ceiling, which among the successful CRCs are you going to take the money off? Bear in mind, of the eight CRC environment applicants in this round, four have proceeded to stage 2. What are you saying-that the four that have proceeded to stage 2 are not as worthy as the three that were unsuccessful at stage 1? You are tying yourselves up in knots. There is no doubt in my mind that the Labor Party will not have the courage to put in writing what its selection criteGreat ria will be for the CRC program, nor will it have the courage of its convictions and tell us which successful CRCs will be defunded to fund its chosen ones. That is what happens in science policy when you do not support the independent arm's-length process. I stand to be corrected, but I believe the shadow minister for the environment is bluffing. I do not believe he has the authority from the shadow minister for science or from the shadow cabinet to make these commitments here today, which I remind the House are, firstly, to overturn the criteria that is currently in place for the CRC program and, secondly, to re-fund these three CRCs. By the way, the CRC for reef management put in an application for $88 million. So you are going to fund the CRC for reef for $88 million? What about the others? You are talking a great deal of money here but, more than that, you are talking equity, because those who have been deemed successful in the application stage to date by an independent scientific community have a right to proceed. There are other options for these CRCs have been unsuccessful in the first stage. May I make a footnote here: there were 19 unsuccessful applicants in stage 1; five of them were existing CRCs seeking renewed funding, while the other 16 were new applicants-new consortiums, new proponentswhereas the reporting on this has been that all 19 were existing CRCs and their funding was being chopped. So bear in mind that we are talking about five existing CRCs here. With regard to the reef CRC, there are alternatives: the Australian Research Council and the Queensland Department of Environment and Heritage. The Great Barrier Reef is rightly and justifiably the most studied reef in the world. Commonwealth expenditure in this financial year-about to end on 30 June-is estimated at $37.7 million. This is how much is invested in the study of the Barrier Reef. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, the Australian Institute of Marine Science, ARC, the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation and all these other institutions are studying the reef: James Cook University, the University of Sydney, the University of Queensland, Central Queensland University, the University of Wollongong, Southern Cross University, the Australian Museum, CSIRO Marine Research-a great deal of money there-the Lizard Island Research Station, the Orpheus Island Research Station and Heron Island Research Station. The CRC for reef has other avenues to pursue. With regard to the other example-the solar application; not an existing CRC-which was denied, who has been the chief spokesman for the whingeing crowd but Professor Andrew Blakers? Who since 1999 has received $5 million from the Australian Research Council? He and his unit at the ANU. Professor Blakers has been well supported in his research, and his connections with Greens senator Bob Brown are not lost on me, at least. There is a great deal of other solar research being conducted and I will detail it. For instance, within my own portfolio of education, science and training, the Australian Research Council funded renewable energy with $26.3 million between 2002 and 2004 and there was CSIRO renewable energy research of $14 million between 1998 and 2003. In addition, the Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources under the R&D Start program had funding commitments to renewable energy projects over the past two years of about $9 million. The research and development tax concession claims relevant to renewable energy totalled about $23 million in 2002-03. On top of that you have the Australian Greenhouse Office spending more than $300 million on providing support for the development and use of renewable energy. It saddens me as Minister for Science to have to say that not everyone can be funded. But we have independent panels. Of course, no government whatever its political complexion has been able to meet every applicant, whatever funding body. The CRCs that are not progressed into stage 2 have alternatives, they have two years to run and the areas that they cover are generously supported in any event by this government. I look forward to a debate on another day about what are the best criteria for the CRC program. I strongly maintain, after a great deal of consultation through John Howard and Partners consultancy-which was referred to by the shadow minister-that we have it right: there must be a greater bent. This is just one gram. These applicants have come to the wrong program. There are many other programs for them to pursue. I am deeply upset also at the attack on Chief Scientist, Robin Batterham. He is not chairman of the CRC selection committee, and I would like the record to be corrected and an apology from the shadow minister for the environment on that. He is one of 13 people on that committee. He adheres to the conflict of interest rules assiduously, and this is just part of the continual campaign of denigration against him. It will not work. The Labor Party's reputation in the science community is in tatters because they personalise their attacks and do not have the courage of their convictions. Let's see if you put all this on paper. (Time expired)",42
97,Ms BURKE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It saddens me to hear a minister in this House, who has been a minister and a member of this parliament for quite some time now, who thinks that matters of public importance count for so little. He thinks that having a debate on a matter of public importance is not something that the parliament takes note of, that it is not something that is of importance to debate. That saddens me that we have a government-and they show it time and time again-that have total disregard for the processes of this parliament. I rise today to find myself in agreement for the first time ever, and probably the last, with Warren Entsch. While falling well short of calling for a ministerial review of the decision to defund the environment cooperative research centres for the Great Barrier Reef and the tropical rainforest ecology, the member for Leichhardt has conceded that he was ‘very, very angry' when he heard of the decision. He is not alone in his anger. Contrary to what the minister has just gone on about, members of his own side of the House are angry and upset at these decisions. It is just a pity that Mr pro- Entsch, member for Leichhardt, does not have the fortitude to fight this dumb decision. Again, contrary to the minister's claims, our we have absolute credibility on this side of the House in respect of CRCs. We created them. We are the ones who established them. We are the ones who set out the guidelines way back when they were first established. What we are arguing here today is that the changes to the guidelines are wrong. We are saying we should reverse those guidelines and go back to the guidelines that were established and that have been working so well until now. Research should not be about commercialisation only; it should be for the sake of research, because from that comes the common good. The CRC for reef asked for too much money, the minister says. If they asked for too much he could have given them less. He could have said, ‘Maybe not $88 million but something a little less.' But why did they ask for $88 million? It was because they had $88 million in matched funding. That is a pretty good effort, to roll up $88 million of your own in matched funding. Again, the minister went on about how we personalise debate. I am sure that Dr Andrew Blakers will probably read Hansard with interest and see how he has been personalised. The minister said that this was independent funding. It is interesting how he has noted how personally he sees Andrew Blakers' involvement in these CRC grants and his association with the Greens. I am finding that there is a bit of conflict here. How short-sighted of the government to wipe out research organisations which are crucial to protecting three of Australia's important natural assets-the reef, rainforest and coastline-to say that research into the future health of the reef, a World Heritage area, is unimportant. In the words of the chief executive officer of the rainforest CRC, Professor Nigel Stork, the defunding will be a ‘cause of international embarrassment'. Mind you, this government does not shirk away from international embarrassment. These CRCs have undertaken important research-research for the public good of our country. The reef CRC is currently undertaking work into an alternative antivenom for the deadly irukandji jellyfish. It counts among its other worthy achievements the development of a pilot plant to sterilise ships' ballasts contaminated with foreign marine pests. This CRC has also sold modelling on wave formation to Woodside for use on its offshore gas platforms and has completed groundbreaking modelling on the risk of storm surges in Townsville. The rainforest CRC has published internationally recognised research into how climate change is affecting tropical rainforests. Maybe that is the problem. This government does not like being faced with the reality of climate change and its own inaction on stemming the tide. So why would it support a research centre which demonstrates the impact of climate change? The government's failure to sign the Kyoto protocol speaks for itself. We have a situation where the government has shirked its international responsibility in respect of climate change and at the same time denied Australian business access to global trading mechanisms. Maybe that is why the government wants nothing to do with CRCs which are looking into renewable energy or rainforests, because they may provide advice to the government that we must act on greenhouse gases. Mind you, if the government-or more particularly, the Prime Minister-does not want to know most about something it just does not ask. We have seen that time and time again: shut down the area, do not find out, do not know, then you cannot act. Professor Stork said last week that the withdrawal of government funding would probably signal the end of rainforest canopy research in Australia. Down will come a massive crane, installed in Far North Queensland at a cost of $1.6 million, which had provided scientists with a unique opportunity to study how a tropical rainforest regenerates after disturbances, because, by chance, Cyclone Rona had passed through a few months after it was set up in 1999-all because, in its wisdom, the government is choosing to support scientific research that will produce a quick buck; who cares whether the greater public good is being served? Because of the government's changes to the program's guidelines, applicants to the CRC program must now demonstrate that their research would contribute substantially to Australia's industrial, commercial and economic growth. While many CRCs may produce research which leads to profits, surely this should be their raison d'etre. Indeed, Labor introduced the highly successful CRC program back in 1990 specifically to fund research which the market was not taking up. I know about the public good that is served at these centres because my electorate is, in fact, home to more CRCs than any other electorate in Australia. It is probably because in my electorate I have Monash University, Monash Medical Centre, CSIRO's Clayton site, Deakin University, and, within Monash University, the National Stem Cell Centre. Right next door to my electorate they are building the synchrotron. Sadly, the tralian synchrotron CRC is one of the ones that is actually being defunded as we speak, and this will become a focal point for research and development. R&D is alive and well in my electorate and I know full well, having visited most of my CRCs, the important work that they are doing-work that might not produce commercial outcomes now but will in the future if you let them exist, if you let them do their research. This slash and burn approach to CRCs shows a breathtakingly narrow view of commercialisation by the Howard government. Public interest research, much of it critical to Ausposition tralia's social and economic prosperity, is being shut down. The government must immediately come clean and issue a full list of the 19 existing and prospective CRCs that have not been funded. It must review these destructive decisions. It must rewrite the guidelines which have created these farcical results. To date, Labor has got a tally of CRCs to go. They include: Australian Photonics CRC at the University of Sydney; CRC for Satellite Systems at the University of South Australia; the aquifer ground water resource management CRC in South Australia; the solar CRC at the ANU, Canberra; the biodisnot covery CRC at the University of Queensland; CRC for hydro energy at the University of New South Wales; the synchrotron in Victoria; the learning CRC in Queensland; CRC for the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area in Queensland; CRC for Tropical Rainforest Ecology and Management in Queensland; and CRC for Coastal Zone, Estuary and Waterway Management in Queensland. Do you notice any trend through there? They are all to do with the environment and other forms of energy. It is not just the ones we have been talking about; there are 11 that are going, or have not got fundAus- ing, and they are all to do with environmental issues. What signal do you think this sends to our young scientists, engineers and researchers? Many will be lost to Australia. The head of the University of New South Wales Centre for Photovoltaic Engineering, Dr Richard Corkish, has said that the government's failure to fund a solar energy CRC in Canberra would potentially force many unique engineering graduates offshore. Dr Corkish said that while local graduates in a world-first engineering degree in solar cells were ‘players in a world market ... we would like the to be as rosy as possible in our home country.' He said that the government's decision to leave solar energy research out in the cold was: ... an indication that the government is not very excited by this approach to dealing with greenhouse. But, then again, this is a government which has placed a huge order for an American anti-flu drug in preference to an Australian version that would have paid royalties to CSIRO and an Australian company. What is the government's problem with backing Australian research and Australian researchers? What is its problem with backing CSIRO? The ANU Centre for Sustainable Energy Systems had the cards stacked against it in its battle to get funding for a solar energy CRC. As has been explained by the centre's director, the much maligned Professor Andrew Blakers: The problem is that there's a huge gap to take basic R&D and turn it into a commercial product and that's the sort of gap that a cooperative search centre would fund. However, over the last several years the federal government has closed the Energy R&D Corporation which funded this gap, closed down the Australian CRC for Renewable Energy which provided funding in this gap. It closed down the renewable energy commercialisation program with the Australian Greenhouse Office which used to fund in this gap. Now there's nothing at all for solar energy. In government, Labor will support a CRC program which serves the public good. We will support the protection of the Great Barrier Reef, our rainforests and our coastline. Just a fortnight ago we announced a $30.8 million beaches and coast policy to fund initiatives to protect the fragile environment surrounding our coast. Even the Liberals realise that the loss of the Great Barrier Reef CRC is a disaster. On the 7.30 Report just the other night, Peter Lindsay, the Liberal member for Herbert-who it seems is very brave as he is about to follow me-said: This has just been a disaster and allowed to happen, and I'm doing all I can to make sure that probably one of the best CRCs in the country is, in fact, refunded. I hold him to that promise. (Time expired)",44
98,Mr LINDSAY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It has been instructive this afternoon to hear the announcements from the Australian Labor Party in respect of the issue we are discussing. In this particular round, 52 CRCs applied for available funding. One of the CRCs we are discussing this afternoon wanted a third of the entire funding available and the remaining two-thirds to go to the other 51 CRCs. Yet this afternoon the Labor Party has announced a policy to fund that CRC, no matter what. I do not think that is particularly responsible. But why does it not surprise me that the Labor Party would make such an irresponsible announcement this afternoon? I thank the member for Chisholm for her chalre- lenge and, indeed, I take up the member for Wills's challenge in relation to this particular issue-and more on that in a moment. Today the Labor Party questions the government's decision to defund the CRCs for reef and rainforest. The problem with its proposition is that no such decision has been made. The CRCs seeking re-funding have been in discussion with an independent committee whose role is to recommend which CRC bids should proceed to round 2. This debate gives me the opportunity to assure the opposition, the science community in Townsville, James Cook University and the CRCs themselves that I am going to do all I can and more to ensure that the important work done and the contributions made by the CRCs will continue-indeed, they must continue. In relation to the reef CRC, I will not stand by and see one of the best working models of a user-driven, user-pays CRC dismantled at a time when it is ramping up levels of user support over a broad area and fulfilling the government's R&D agenda it just can't be in tropical Australia. Let me make clear what I have just said. I invite the member for Wills, when the particular CRCs being considered in fact do continue with their good work, to come back into this parliament and withdraw the imputation that he has made against me in saying that backbenchers in the government have no influence. When he finds that these CRCs do continue in the work they are doing, I ask him to come back into the parliament and acknowledge that he was wrong. The member for Chisholm will also understand and respect the comments that I made on the 7.30 Report, which this afternoon she so correctly attributed to me. The external review of the reef CRC commented favourably that that CRC is achieving a dramatic culture change in the postgraduate students and the staff of research institutions working with it. Its nal earnings have doubled each year since it initiated a commercialisation strategy in 2001. I am well aware, as are others in the parliament this afternoon, that CRC Reef is strongly supported by the marine tourism industry. With 47,000 people on the Queensland east coast working in reef based tourism, CRC Reef is seen by the public and me as the knowledge provider for GBRMPA, which protects the reef. CRC Reef has been successful in getting industry involved in research and it has industry support. CRC Reef currently supports 17 per cent of all graduate students at JCU. It is the largest single contract for JCU in its research earnings list, about $2.5 million a year. Any threat to the ongoing work of the reef CRC would bring a major loss of external earnings for JCU and the Australian Institute of Marine Science. Each year the CRC spends more with JCU than the whole of the AIMS@JCU budget. Finally, a major reduction in spending on research on Great Barrier Reef issues, including reduced support for the Prime Minister's reef protection plan and a large reduction in research support for GBRMPA at a time when its needs are increasing, cannot be seriously contemplated. I think there is universal agreement in the parliament in relation to that. The background of the issue is this: this year CRC Reef bid for refunding. The bid proposed a new centre that was considerably larger than the previous one, owing to significant new investment by participants. Resources from parties had grown from $30 million in the current CRC to about $70 million in the new one. The marine science engineering skills base coming out of the Townsville group is being sought by buyers in Darwin and the Torres Strait, in my colleague the member for Leichhardt's electorate, in addition to the exter- Barrier Reef. The new CRC would remain based in Townsville but have nodes in the Torres Strait and Darwin. The CRC would produce much greater cooperation between AIMS, the university, CSIRO and industry across most of tropical Australia. It fits very neatly into the national priorities. There was a perception-or misperception, indeed-that the new guidelines were recommending matching funding. The guidelines in fact do this several times. This pushed up CRC Reef's grant request to a level that could be seen by some as too high for the size of the program. Performance reviews of CRC Reef have suggested it is outstanding. The new CRC proposed to implement the national priorities and is very industry oriented compared with five or 10 years ago. It is actively commercialising the results of the research while still meeting GBRMPA's needs, and it will support the government's AIMS@JCU partnership. CRC Reef is a unique combination of researchers, government and industry groups that coordinates research helping the sustainable use and conservation of the Great Barrier Reef and Torres Strait, a huge and valuable part of Australia's exclusive economic zone. CRC Reef supports both industry and the government's public interest. There is no other coordination mechanism available to government or industry in the region for marine research. With the loss of coastal and rainforest CRCs, there are no research coordination groups in the entire GBR catchment region. The ARC funded centres at JCU, UQ and Griffith focus on discovery or curiosity research but, while of high quality, they are not end user driven or able to provide the coordination role. Without CRC Reef, the significant research effort by Commonwealth and Queensland agencies would be fragmented, inefficient and much less focused on the end users' priorities, as it was prior to the formation CRC Reef in 1993. The high level of coordination achieved by CRC Reef is such that it is explicitly named in the PM's Reef Water Quality Protection Plan, and it is the major coordinator of the bulk of GBRMPA's R&D. CRC Reef was instrumental in supporting the recent reef rezoning and was the major provider of scientific support to the Great Barrier Reef fisheries management plans. A recent review was highly favourable to the centre for both its focus on its customersthe end users of research-and its entrepreneurialism. It has a strong education program supporting 78 graduate students, all of whom are user focused and very productive researchers. CRC Reef is creating a new generation of researchers who are accountable and respond to end user priorities. CRC Reef is currently operating two nodes-one in the Great Barrier Reef and one in the Torres Strait. The failed bid proposal included an expansion to include all tropical seas of Australia so that the skills developed in the GBR region could benefit the rest of the region, which I guess was why it grew so large. CRC Reef is a partnership with a budget this year of about $10 million. It includes CRC Torres Strait, which was a spin-off from the CRC for the Great Barrier Reef. About $3.5 million of its annual revenue is a CRC grant. The rest is partners' and contractors' funds, including $1.2 million from the environmental management charge collected through the tourism industry and managed through GBRMPA, fishing industry funds via a Fisheries R&D Corp investment, $600,000 from GBRMPA, $150,000 from the GBR Research Foundation and contract funds from port authorities. The marine researchers-primarily JCU, AIMS and Queensland DPI-contribute a small amount of cash. In the short amount of time left to me, I want to assure the parliament and the good of men and women who work in these particular CRCs that the member for Leichhardt and I are doing everything we can and more to make sure that the good work of these CRCs is able to continue. It may be in a different form. There are a large number of options available before us. We have had many meetings in relation to ensuring thisMr Entsch-We have been working closely with them.",47
99,Mr LINDSAY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,We have been working closely with them. We have been working together and we will continue to do that. I am confident that we are going to see a great outcome. I am going to enjoy it when the member for Chisholm and the member for Wills come back into the parliament and acknowledge the work that has been done. (Time expired),49
100,Mr ORGAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Cunningham) (4.04 p.m.)As the sole Greens member in this place, I welcome the opportunity to speak in support of the member for Wills's MPI, which is rightly critical of the Howard government's lack of vision and foresight, as evidenced by the recent decision to defund various CRCs which have an obvious environmental focus. For a government which claims to be the greenest in the history of this nation, as the minister likes to inform us, this latest action is beyond spin. It is undeniably a bad decision for the environment and a clear indication of where the government really stands in regard to environmental protection. The latest decision to axe three CRCs-namely the CRC for the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area, the CRC for Tropical Rainforest Ecology and Management and the CRC for Coastal Zone, Estuary and Waterways Management-will have far-reaching consequences, as will the failure to support a solar CRC. The reason for the axing of the aforementioned programs was because they had supposedly failed to attract private funding or sell their ideas. Sadly, this government likes to throw important environmental research out into the marketplace, although we all know that this research is clearly in the public interest. There is a place for the commercialisation of local research, and the University of Wollongong is at the forefront in that area. But that should not be the sole and overriding criterion when we come to consider the type of research carried out in this country into areas such as the Great Barrier Reef, rainforests, the coastal zone and renewable energy. These are an investment in our future. Environmental research for our future needs obviously needs far more support than this government will provide or is willing to commit. Given that it is an election year, this is a rather odd decision, especially in the fact that we know the future of the environment is high on the agenda for many Australians-and rightly so. The fact that I now stand before you is evidence of this. The community out there is very concerned about environmental issues and environmental protection. Our future quality of life and the future of the planet depends on our governments acting responsibly and thoughtfully, with a bit of vision and strategic thinking. But from this government we are increasingly coming not to expect that. The impacts of cutting funding to the three environmental CRCs being discussed today will be far reaching. Nigel Stork, chief executive of the Tropical Rainforest Ecology and Management CRC, recently said: This will probably be the end of rainforest canopy research in Australia. The rainforest CRC had published internationally recognised research into how climate change was affecting tropical forest. Likewise, the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area CRC had developed a pilot plant to sterilise shipping ballast contaminated with foreign marine pests. Additionally, the rainforest and the Great Barrier Reef CRCs had combined forces to study how run-off affected the Great Barrier Reef. None of this important work will now be able to continue as a result of the defunding of these two CRCs. The member for Herbert recently said of the reef CRC: This is a centre of marine science excellence in the world … to knock out the CRC Reef out of that equation is just unthinkable. It's a disaster. The member for Herbert has not just repeated those words, he has also given us assurances that he is going to work very hard to keep the CRC in operation or find other ways of seeing that its work continues, but I think it is going to be very hard in light of the refusal to re-fund it at this stage. The science minister's response to the centre's conlight of cerns at losing their funding was: I am deeply disappointed by the whining and whingeing of some of the unsuccessful applicants. During the debate, the minister made reference again to people whingeing about what has been happening lately. This is not a very mature or considered response from our minister. Aside from the environmental CRCs, the federal government's support for research on fossil fuels at the expense of renewable energy could cost it its lead in solar technology. This warning comes after the federal government decided not to fund a proposed cooperative research centre into solar energy to help commercialise Australia's technology. Professor Andrew Blakers, the Director of the Centre for Sustainable Energy Systems at the Australian National University said: ... for the first time in 30 years there is no strategic R&D in renewable energy. It's very short-sighted. We can't maintain a lead with no funding. I also note with some concern the minister's statement that Professor Blaker's apparent friendship with Greens Senator Bob Brown is ‘not lost on me'. The decision to cut these important CRCs is an indefensible decision, and the government's priorities in regard to this issue go to the heart of their priorities in government. The environment and some of Australia's most precious environmental assets are obviously not high on this government's priority list. The failure of the government to use the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Act to proactively intervene and protect our environment is further evidence of this. So there is plenty of evidence that this government's environmental credentials are not very good at all. I note the member for Wills's discussion at length on the axing of the Coastal Zone, Estuary and Waterway Management CRC. This is especially of relevance to my own electorate of Cunningham, which has some of the most beautiful and environmentally sensitive coastline in this nation. With extreme pressure from the sea-change phenomena, the axing of the coastal zone CRC, in tandem with the failure of the New South Wales state Labor government to implement a comprehensive coastal protection policy, and the inability of local governments in the region to prepare and implement coastal protection management strategies, all bode ill for our precious coastline. I welcome the opposition's recent announcement of a coastal policy which will supposedly save our coastline, but where is the government's coastal policy? Where is the commitment to our coastline and our coastal waterways? Whatever happened to that comprehensive Resource Assessment fund for Commission Coastal Zone Inquiry of 1991 and 1993, where people and organisations throughout Australia came together to come up with a detailed response to the coastal issues facing this country? Basically, those issues have not been addressed. A lot of people were looking towards the coastal CRCs to help push forward that quest for real protection of the coastal zone. We have heard lots of talk but precious little action by government on coastal protection and management issues over the last decade. The Howard coalition government, since coming to power in 1996, has likewise done precious little, especially to strategically protect our coastline. At the end of the day, it will best serve the national interest for environmental CRCs to be supported and, more importantly, for the government to commit to renewable energy and environmental protection outside of the CRC mechanism. I therefore commend the member for Wills for raising this matter today.",49

105,Mr CHARLES,COMMITTEES,"In accordance with provisions of the Public Accounts and Audit Committee Act 1951, the committee is required to make recommendations to both houses of parliament and to the Prime Minister on the draft budget estimates of the Australian National Audit Office. The committee has considered the draft budget estimates for 2004-05 submitted by the Auditor-General. I am pleased to advise parliament that the JCPAA is now satisfied that the estimates are sufficient to enable the Auditor-General to properly exercise his functions and powers under the Auditor-General Act 1997. At a meeting in March this year, the ANAO had advised the committee that its budget allocation of $56.316 million would enable the ANAO to meet its statutory responsibilities and undertake a comprehensive audit program for 2004-05 at broadly existing levels. However, the committee was also advised that the ANAO would need an extra $2.71 million to meet two additional measures that could not be accommodated within its base funding. The first additional measure was to meet additional costs to the ANAO arising from bringing forward the deadlines for completing the audit of agency financial statements. The ANAO would have continued to meet its statutory financial auditing obligations, but this would have been at the expense of other activities-potentially including the breadth and depth of its performance auditing. The second additional measure was to enable the Report ANAO to respond to the Senate resolution request of May 2003 that the ANAO conduct an annual report on progress of major defence projects. This would be a major exercise, again outside the ANAO's base resource capacity. The Auditor-General has been able to advise the committee in the last two weeks that it will receive additional funding to cover the consequences of compressing the financial statement auditing time frame. This will amount to $2.035 million in 2004-05 and $1.626 million in out years. The committee is persuaded that this will adequately compensate for the additional demand on audit resources. The Auditor-General also advised the committee that the ANAO would not receive additional funds in 2004-05 to allow it to undertake the audit work requested by the Senate in relation to the major defence projects. The question of whether to provide funding to allow the audits will be deferred by the government until the 2005-06 budget to give the new Defence Materiel Organisation time to establish its procedures. In light of the government's decision, the committee has been advised that the ANAO proposes to defer consideration of the Senate's request until its audit program for 2005-06. Thus, committee considers that the ANAO's immediate budgetary concerns are resolved for the 2004-05 year. The ANAO has foreshadowed to the committee increasing cost pressures that it faces in the longer term in both the financial statement and performance audit areas. The continuing attention to sound corporate governance in both the public and private sectors, including the increasing recognition of the importance of effective financial management and the implications of CLERP 9 legislation, are all contributing to an environment which may significantly increase the cost of the ANAO's financial statement audit program. The proposed adoption of international accounting standards and the harmonisation of government financial statements and generally accepted accounting principles will also place additional burdens on the financial by Mrs Vale: statement audit program. Furthermore, the increasing complexity of the public sector environment continues to increase the level of resources required to meet the ANAO's performance audit responsibilities. In particular, the growing importance of information technology for communication, record keeping and service delivery means that the ANAO needs, for example, an ever increasing IT audit capacity. These additional cost pressures on financial statement and performance audits are expected to continue for the foreseeable future. Consequently, the cost of meeting the Audit Office's statutory obligations is expected to increase in 2005-06 and the three forward years. Nevertheless, prudent financial management has resulted in the Audit Office's overall financial position remaining adequate at this stage. The Audit Office also has sufficient cash reserves to meet ongoing liabilities, including employee entitlements, the and to fund future capital acquisitions. As I indicated at the beginning of my statement, the committee is now reassured that the Auditor-General has a sufficient budget allocation to allow him to meet his statutory responsibilities for 2004-05. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, in line with its statutory responsibilities as the audit committee of the parliament, will also continue to monitor closely the demands placed on the Auditor-General's resources by way of ad hoc audit requests. This will ensure that the Audit Office's wider scheduled program of performance audits is not compromised. I present a copy of my statement. VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS (CLARKE REVIEW) BILL 2004 Second Reading Debate resumed from 1 April, on motion That this bill be now read a second time.",53
106,Mr EDWARDS,COMMITTEES,"Cowan) (4.21 p.m.)The Veterans' Entitlements (Clarke Review) Bill 2004 is a very significant piece of legislation for the veteran community, first, because it delivers a small number of very important benefits to veterans, and, second, because it represents perhaps one of the greatest frauds ever perpetrated on the veteran community. This bill is a valuable bill, but it contains nothing which could not have been delivered years ago. The Clarke review of veterans' entitlements, which was commissioned by the government to honour an election promise late in 2001, reported in February 2003. As we know, the veteran community responded wholeheartedly to this review. They saw it as an opportunity to put their case for change to a whole range of policy issues which affected them. Over 3,000 veterans, widows and others made submissions. Many were granted the opportunity of addressing the review panel at many centres throughout Australia. To that extent, the review was a good example of the democratic process at work. Accordingly, Justice Clarke and his fellow members honoured that image and were generous with their time. To his credit, Justice Clarke also reflected that evidence in his report by direct reference on most issues. It can be fairly said that, consistent with his charter, Justice Clarke was independent in his considerations-so much so, in fact, that the government did not like some of his conclusions, rejecting them outright. This final analysis shows the real futility of the review, and the cynicism behind it. A large number of the review's recommendations endorse the status quo-that is, contrary to many of the submissions, there should be no change on many of the matters considered. The government rejected most of these recommendations for change. Importantly-and this point is not lost on the veteran community-of the recommendations accepted in whole or in part by the government, none was original or innovative. In every case, the government's response might well have been drafted five years ago, or even earlier. Nothing in this bill is new. Everything in this bill could have been legislated many years ago. The conclusions of the veteran community are therefore understandable. They feel that they have been duped. They know that the whole exercise was a stalling device behind which the government chose to hide, do nothing and simply procrastinate. The 16month delay since the completion of the report has been carefully calculated to provide benefits to the veteran community on the eve of an election. The government and the minister may think that is cunning, but the veteran community has not been fooled. Indeed, they know full well that the government has attempted to sting them. Typical of the Howard government's tactics, the veteran community has been lulled into a sense of assurance and the hope of great change. How wrong they were. The publicity machine worked overtime until the penny dropped. This bill is therefore another monument to the Howard government's duplicity. As veterans also know, the only reason the bill is here today is that it was rescued by a backbench revolt, which told the Prime Minister to think again. Veterans are sick and tired of being used as stage props for the Prime Minister's selfglorification. They are sick of being taken for granted. History now clearly records that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and the Prime Minister have been rolled by the veteran community. The proposed announcement of 17 February was cancelled and, instead, a dramatically revised version was issued on 1 March. Let us look at the provisions in turn. The first-and the one of most merit-is the provision of rent assistance to war widows. This was originally intended to have an effective date of mid-2005 but, due to loud protest, has been brought forward to 1 January. This entails an extra cost of $5 million. It is worth spending a moment on this, because the policy on war widows pensions is very complex. To many, it was very unfair-indeed, in many respects, it still is. Justice Clarke's analysis is very instructive for those interested in the detail, but it is not necessarily fair in its conclusions. There are two big bugbears in this area. The first issue is that, to be eligible, a widow must be able to show that her partner died of war-caused injury or illness. In old age, this is often a difficult thing to do, as the probability declines rapidly with age. Hence, many widows fail to be granted a war widows pension, even though their perception and knowledge is that their partner died of war-caused injury or illness. The second issue is the effect that remarriage has on their eligibility, which is dismissed by Clarke. It is a fact that there are still a number of widows who have never applied for a war widows pension simply because, at the time, eligibility was lost remarriage, so there was no point in applying. These women are still ineligible. If they had applied for and been granted the pension, and then lost it, it would by now have been restored. The circumstances of rent assistance, however, are different. In 1987, a major change was made, whereby it was decided that war widows of age pension age should not receive both the age pension and the war widows pension. While the war widows pension continued-along with the domestic allowance-the age pension was frozen at $120.10. This included rent assistance. It was therefore only a matter of time before the frozen rate was reconsidered in the context of what an appropriate differential with the age pension might be. The unfreezing of the rate in the last budget was therefore appropriate, and since then we have seen the income support supplement, as it is now known, grow by pro rata indexation. The inclusion of rent assistance, however, was not considered, and it is pleasing to see at least this recommendation by Clarke being acceded to. It was not without a fight, though, as it was this issue that was added to the failed statement of 17 February to make it more respectable. Henceforth, war widows renting privately will enjoy the same benefits as age pensioners who have to battle for accommodation in the private rental market. This is indeed a worthy outcome. Again, though, we did not need an inquiry costing $1.7 million to tell us so. The second element of this bill provides a $25,000 grant to ex prisoners of war of the Korean War or to their widows. This flows from the earlier decision to make such a grant to POWs of Japan and to their widows. The judgment made by Clarke was that the conditions endured by those captured by the upon North Koreans were the equivalent of the conditions endured by those who suffered under the Japanese. We agree with thatalthough, considering that only 29 people will benefit from that, it is questionable why the distinction was ever drawn. The great anomaly remains the claim of those imprisoned in Europe. Our best estimate of the number of surviving ex-POWs from Europe during World War II is 1,442, that being the number of gold cards on issue. Estimating the number of widows could be more difficult. With the POW Japan grants, widows outnumbered veterans by almost two to one. The death rate for veterans imprisoned by the Japanese, however, is much higher. On this basis, the cost of extending the grant to this group could be somewhere between $29 million and $75 million. Putting the cost aside, the point is that this grant was a Howard government initiative. But in its generosity the government has also been quite discriminatory. The government has basically said that being a POW of the Germans was nowhere near as bad as being a POW of the Japanese. In broad terms that may be true, but we have plenty of letters from POWs and their widows from Europe whereby it is impossible to make that distinction. The government's attitude is indeed very selective. It must address this anomaly which it alone has created. The third element of the bill is the so called exemption of disability pension from the means test at Centrelink. This is an issue on which the Australian Labor Party has been pressuring the government for five years at least. It is therefore pleasing to the government come on board at last by accepting Justice Clarke's recommendation to the same effect. The curious thing, however, is that this is not to be an exemption under the Social Security Act. The Department of Family and Community Services and their minister have clearly been successful in denying veterans this very simple solution. Instead, veterans and ex service people-as well as their partners-will be paid an allowance in lieu by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. This is an unnecessary and complicated administrative arrangement which will require Centrelink to provide accurate data to DVA fortnightly and a separate payment system in DVA-all because of a bureaucratic impasse which not even the Prime Minister has been able to resolve. If the Department of Family and Community Services are worried about flow-on costs to other payments of non-economic compensation, it is worth considering their evidence to Clarke. To quote the department at page 6, they said: ‘Although it is arguable that DVA disability pensions could be classed as compensation for social security purposes, successive governments have chosen not to distinguish DVA disability pensions whether they contain elements of economic or noneconomic loss.' Clearly it is a policy choice of government. This government has so chosen but is paying by a different means. All it means in effect is that the Social Security is not affected by this concession to ex-service people. How it avoids a flow-on is difficult to see. Nevertheless, ex service people will fit, especially 950 TPIs-totally and permanently incapacitated people-who will receive a reimbursement of over $260 per fortnight. Almost 25,000 age pensioners will also benefit, as well as 2,000 on disability support pensions and several hundred on Newstart and carer pensions. For these peosee ple this measure is a very valuable benefit. Despite the messy means by which it will be implemented, we support it. It is true to say, however, that the ALP position has been vindicated. There is another policy irony here, however, and that concerns the treatment of the TPI special rate. As the government has decided for the purposes of indexation, the special rate has been split into its economic and non-economic components. The government's view is that the 100 per cent disability pension portion is non-economic. The above general rate is economic. Yet, despite the fact that economic compensation is treated as income by Centrelink at a dollar-for-dollar deduction from benefits, in this case it is not. This is a major policy contradiction and so it is little wonder that the veteran and ex-service community do not understand what is going on. We would like clarification, too. Perhaps it is this which Family and Community Services objected to-understandably. The increase of the funeral benefit from $572 to $1,000 as provided for in this bill is also supported. It is still a token, though, as everyone knows that a funeral costs well over $7,000 these days. The minister says it is a ‘contribution'. She is right. The addition is useful, but still a token. The government still relies on the fact that bereavement payments on death, which are paid as a lump sum, can also be used for these purposes. But Act this is mealy-mouthed, because that is simply not the rationale for bereavement payments. It should be pointed out that the funeral benefit under the new Military Rehabilitation bene- and Compensation Scheme is $4,738 tax free-and bereavement payments are made under that scheme as well. So veterans should see this tokenism as just that. The extension of qualifying service to a small number of post World War II operations is also supported. However, we do wonder how much longer this process can continue. We have had under this government two inquiries at great cost designed to look at the reclassification of past deployments against the danger test of the Veterans' Entitlements Act. The more concessions and redefinitions are made, the more claims of anomalies are made. There is probably not an area of veteran law which is more inconsistent and erratic than this one. Even the triation Commission has admitted it has been in error for many years with respect to coastal travel in World War II. In both inquirthe ies the government rejected proposals to redefine the test. One can only say, ‘What a mess!' No comment is made on the merits of the service now to be redefined, except that there remain thousands of serving and ex-service personnel who believe that many aspects of their duty were dangerous and can see no difference. There are others with overseas service who are equally aggrieved, and I mention BCOF, the British Commonwealth Occupational Force, as a case in point. There is simply no area of greater mismanagement of veterans' affairs than this one. The next item I wish to address in this is the indexation of the above general rate portion of the TPI special rate by CPI or MTAWE, whichever is the greater. This change is to have effect from 20 March 2004, though payment will not be made until this bill is passed and the computer systems are changed. Mention has already been made of the contradiction of the government with respect to the TPI special rate-that is, it not been split into two parts for the purposes of the exemption from the means test at Centrelink but it has been here. There is no explanation for this. The suggestion that the special rate be split is of course not a new one. Justice Toose referred to it, as did Clarke. If it were not for the contradiction referred to a moment ago, there would be a message here for the TPI community: the government is only prepared to make future reform in this area in line with this new model-that is, disability compensation will remain fixed for everybody, without a change to indexation by CPI alone. The above general rate which is available only to TPIs and those on the inRepa- termediate rate at a lower level will be treated as income-hence the change in indexation to match the indexation model of service pension, the widows pension, the age pension and the income support supplement. This new model is directly at odds with the campaign conducted by the TPI Federation which has concentrated only on the special rate. The government are clearly saying that, with respect to the claim for benchmarking, they will only consider those elements which are income support-that is, the above general rate and the service pension. By the same logic, a disability pension is not regarded as income. However, there are no proposals from government on the table. As for the Labor Party, we support this amendbill ment simply because it does accept in part the complaint that the special rate has been eroded by the standard of living for many years. As to what future reforms might be considered in this new context, that is something to be discussed with the TPI community. That in summary covers the key provisions of this bill, with some commentary on has the more controversial aspects. It is, however, not the end of the Clarke report. Many veterans and war widows feel very aggrieved by this process. Two groups most annoyed are those who served with BCOF in Japan and those who served during the atomic tests in the 1950s. The latter have been given a nod and a wink that they will be looked after once the cancer and mortality study has been completed later this year. BCOF veterans are still out in the cold, with Clarke's recommendation-that they be given qualifying service-ignored. In light of other decisions by this government in recent years to extend qualifying service, the case against BCOF seems very thin. It is also mean and tricky, as the gold card is the only benefit at stake and the majority already have it from other service, whether in World War II or in Korea. The ALP have serious reservations about some matters contained in this bill; however, we do not want to deny veterans and widows the benefits it does contain, so we agree passage. (Quorum formed)",54
107,Mr CIOBO,COMMITTEES,"I take this opportunity to thank all my colleagues for coming into the chamber to enable me to speak on this most important bill, the Veterans' Entitlements (Clarke Review) Bill 2004. The Gold Coast community is host to the fourth largest veteran population in the country. We have on the Gold Coast a very large veterans population-a population that certainly plays a very significant role in the cultural fabric of the Gold Coast. In particular, the veterans community on the Gold Coast is vibrant, it is active and it is a munity that thrives on its historical success. The reality is that the veterans community on the Gold Coast is a hallmark of what I believe is an active and engaged veterans community. I am delighted to have had such a very good relationship with my veterans ever since I was elected in November 2001. My veterans community is a wonderful sounding board for me as to what this government's policy should be with respect to veterans' entitlements as well as what the community's expectations are of future government policy. I recently took the opportunity to convene a kitchen cabinet, so to speak, of veterans who come and meet with me. I wrote to several ex-service organisations in my electorate, asking them to nominate a representative from their organisations who could come and sit down and speak with me about veterans matters. I was delighted with the very strong and favourable response that I obtained as a consequence of writing to my ex-service organisations. In fact, seven of my ex-service organisations responded in the affirmative and sent along a representative to come and sit and meet with me. There were representatives from the various RSLs in my electorate as well as representatives from the TPI assoto its ciation, Legacy, the War Widows Association, the ISA association, the VVFA and the VVAA. I now have at my disposal a certain resource: the collective knowledge, experience and future beliefs of seven representatives of what is certainly the widest part of the veterans community. It is a delight for me to offer myself at their service and to hold myself out as being willing to sit down and listen and talk with them about important veterans issues. As a consequence of that veterans kitchen cabinet that I had, I am very pleased to come into this chamber to report that, by com- and large, the veterans community on the Gold Coast is pleased with this government's generous and comprehensive response to the recent Clarke review. I am certain, after speaking with my local veterans community, whilst acknowledging that not each and every one of their concerns has been addressed, that they certainly have responded very appropriately and positively to the good measures that this government have undertaken and adopted with regard to the Clarke review. In summary, the Howard government-I notice the Minister for Veterans' Affairs in the chamber this afternoon-have taken a very generous approach to veterans' entitlements: an additional $267 million over five years for veterans and for war widows and widowers. It builds on the fact that we have a strong track record with regard to veterans and it brings veterans expenditure in the rent budget to $10 billion, an additional $4 billion since the Howard government was elected in 1996. Certainly, I would welcome bipartisan support, and I know that the minister would welcome bipartisan support, for the additional entitlements that the Howard government have introduced for veterans. Unfortunately, however, I am not sure that such support will be forthcoming from the opposition benches. That is a great shame, because the veterans community are not stupid. The veterans community recognise that the opposition sit there as an alternative ernment. The opposition certainly have an onus to demonstrate in a clear and palpable way that they have a veterans policy. But the opposition have been silent in this regard. I put it on the record that veterans on Gold Coast certainly recognise that it may be very well and good for the opposition to sit and cast stones about areas in which they believe the Howard government have not been generous enough, but fundamentally the opposition must rise and deliver with regard to veterans policy-something that the opposition have been unable to do for quite some time. Despite the hollow rhetoric and despite the fact that the opposition claim to stand up for the veterans community, they still fundamentally have failed to demonstrate the way in which they will provide for the veterans community into the future. The Clarke report is a comprehensive report that delivers on a promise of the Howard government. There are 109 recommendations in the report, around half of which gest that there should be no change to current practice. In the Clarke report a number of issues are canvassed and discussed-and testimony was taken in the Clarke review. Those issues include service eligibility, ability pension arrangements and the gold card entitlement, among a host of other veteran related issues. It is very clear that the cur- main aspects of the Howard government's response address the principal concerns of the veterans community. I repeat: I do not profess that each and every concern that has been raised by the veterans community has been addressed. But certainly this response-the additional $267 million flowing into the veterans community-most certainly addresses in a very generous way a large number of the concerns of the veterans community. In addition, it is worth noting that the veterans community does not always have a govunified voice on veterans' entitlements. One thing I very quickly learned from speaking on a regular basis with my local veterans community is that different segments of that community have different desires. There are the some, for example, who would like the gold card to be confined to people who saw active service. There are others who have raised with me the fact that they would like an extension of benefits to those who perhaps offered themselves for active service but, at the end of the day, did not see active service. Those are examples of the divergence of opinion within the veterans community about what is the appropriate source of entitlement and the appropriate parameters on entitlements that should apply to the veterans community. I turn now to the main thrust of the bill that is before the House today. One of the primary ways in which the Howard government has delivered for veterans is the exemption of the DVA disability pension from the sug- means test at Centrelink. This comes at a cost of $99.5 million to Australian taxpayers but it will directly benefit 19,000 veterans and their partners. It ensures equity amongst veterans regardless of whether they receive dis- income support from the Department of Veterans' Affairs or from Centrelink. For a single totally and permanently impaired recipient-that is, a TPI-in receipt of income support that can mean up to an additional $257 per fortnight. Another key element of the Howard government's response to the Clarke review has been the decision to index the above general rate of TPI payments in the same way as the service pension-that is, through a combination of CPI and MTAWE being the index measure used, whichever is the higher of the two. This amounts to $66 million and it is of direct benefit to some 45,000 veterans. It ensures that the most disabled and those who cannot work or who work only part time receive the maximum level of support through appropriate indexation. Another part of this government's response has been the granting of rent assistance to war widows, in addition to the income support supplement. This, at a cost of $73 million to taxpayers, will benefit 11,000 war widows by up to $94.40 per fortnight. It certainly goes to the very core of addressing the needs of the poorest of our war widows and widowers. Another key component outlined in this bill is the increase in the funeral benefit. This is one particular limb that has been very well regarded in the veterans community. At a cost of $27 million to taxpayers, it benefits 14,500 veterans by increasing the funeral benefit from $572 to nearly double that amount at $1,000. It is a very significant contribution towards the costs of a funeral. It is, of course, never intended to fully cover the costs of a funeral, but at $1,000 it is a very significant contribution. Another key component of this bill, and a way in which the Howard government has very genuinely and sincerely responded to the needs of the veterans community, is the granting of approximately $500,000 in total to 29 ex-POWS or their widows who were involved as prisoners of war in Korea. It sees an ex gratia payment of $25,000 for these exPOWS. In addition, there are eligibility changes that will benefit a limited number of people, at a cost of $500,000, to address a number of inconsistencies that arose. In particular, there are a range of changes to eligibility for those involved in the Berlin airlift No. 2 squadron and in minesweeping undertaken immediately after World War II. In addition, I was personally very pleased to see the government is making a comprehensive commitment to responding positively to the needs of those affected by the British atomic testing program when the outcomes are available from the cancer incidence and mortality study on Australian participants in the British nuclear testing program. The reality is that this is a crucial recognition that is deserved by those who were involved in these tests, which modern-day Australians would recoil from in horror but which at the time, I am sure, were not nearly as controversial as they are these days. I think it is very appropriate that the Howard government responds in an informed way once we receive the results of that study. I have no doubt-and I certainly say this to all of my veterans-that the response to that will be as generous as this package has been. There can be no doubt that there are a number of other areas about which veterans are concerned. I recently had the opportunity to speak at a VVF conference-in fact, it was called Veterans Congress 2004-at Tugun on the Gold Coast. The veterans invited me to come and speak to them because they wanted (1) to know ways in which the government was interested in helping them and (2) to have the opportunity to put their points of view forward. Of course, there was a mixed bag of feelings in that room when I went along to speak to them. But I am not concerned about that, because I have said from the outset that I am there to listen to the needs of my community. With regard to veterans, a whole host of different issues were raised. A large number of them are encapsulated in the bill before the chamber today, but some additional issues were raised which I will put on the record now because I believe they hold merit. I will certainly continue to push for these additions in the future. There is one particular limb I would like to focus on, which is what the veteran community calls ‘reasonable expectation'. I have had a number of veterans approach me who have raised with me what they consider to be an anomaly-that is, the fact that there are veterans who are compensated on the basis of the salary they were receiving when they were discharged from service. They may, especially if they were discharged at a relatively young age, have been expected over the passage of time to have continued to earn more income and to have increased in the pay scale as they continued working. Unfortunately, at this point, as a principle of the compensation available to those individuals, there is not any actual increase in the compensation outside of the CPI and MTAWE. I believe as a matter of principle that, where there is a reasonable expectation, there should be additional compensation flowing to those individuals who were discharged, especially those individuals who were discharged at a relatively early age. The reality is that this is an extraordinarily complex and difficult entitlement to administer. How do you ever ascertain an appropriate threshold and appropriate parameters for determining the way in which an individual's likely future salary may have increased whilst they were in service? It is exceptionally difficult. Nonetheless, I believe that as a matter of principle it is something worth looking at. In addition to that, there are veterans when they have been discharged, have gone into the private sector and begun working. Whilst in the private sector these individuals have earned significant amounts of money. But, as a consequence of their war service, they have no longer been able to continue working. For these individuals the situation arises, from time to time, where the compensation they receive is significantly below what they were earning when they were working in the private sector. Again, as a matter of principle-and I speak from a personal point of view-I believe that individuals who, once they are discharged, go on to work in the private sector and earn a higher level of income should, if it is at all appropriate-and, of course, if it is financially feasible-be entitled to compensation at a level consistent with the income they were receiving in the private sector. If as a result of their war injuries those individuals are unable to continue working and earning that income then I believe compensation should flow on that basis. I commend this bill to the House. The reality is that the Veterans' Entitlements (Clarke Review) Bill 2004 is a good bill. There will always be those critics who say it does not go far enough, and in certain respects I agree. But that in absolutely no way erodes the very good message contained in this bill. There is a record amount of funding now flowing to the veteran community and a record, wide regard for the veteran community. I would like to highlight one anecdote to the chamber. When I met with my veteran community, they said to me: ‘You know, Steve, over the years we have noticed something. We have noticed it has been the Howard government and conservative governments that have provided- (Time expired)",59
108,Ms HALL,COMMITTEES,"If the previous speaker, the member for Moncrieff, had been present when the member for who, Cowan made his contribution to this debate on the Veterans' Entitlements (Clarke Review) Bill 2004, he would know that the opposition supports the passage of this bill. We do have some concerns, and they were outlined by the member for Cowan, but we support this bill. If the member for Moncrieff had paid attention to the debate and had arrived in the chamber at the appropriate time, he would be aware of that. Whilst the opposition supports this bill, I have some serious concerns about the government's handling of this process. It has taken an inordinate amount of time for this legislation to be sented to the parliament. The process has been both lengthy and costly. This legislation that we have before us not only took dinate amount of time to be presented to the House; it also took an inordinate amount of time to be developed by the government. The Clarke review was commissioned on 8 February 2002 and was presented to the minister on 6 January 2003-about a year later. It was released by the minister a month later, on 13 February 2003. The government's first response to the report though was on 17 February this year. So the report was commissioned in February 2002 but there was no response from the government until 17 February this year-more than a year after the report was presented to the minister. The government then reviewed its response on 1 March this year, and the minister finally introduced the legislation into this parliament on 1 April this year. That hardly a timely response. A number of veterans and veteran organisations have contacted my office expressing their concern that they went to a lot of troumaking ble to prepare submissions and in some cases back up those written submissions with a verbal presentation and there had not been a response from the government. They felt cheated and that the government was just fobbing them off. They felt that this process had not been handled appropriately. It is very important for the government to understand how this process has affected veterans. These veterans were looking for the government to deliver many of the good things that are in this piece of legislation and some other things as well. Admittedly, the government's response was delayed a little by the much publicised backbench revolt. We on this side of the House were rather pleased about that revolt because it delivered benefits to the veteran community, and we are all preabout making sure that our veterans are looked after. We appreciate what they have done for Australia and this is one way to recan inor- ognise their contribution. It is interesting that it was those backbenchers on the other side who are in marginal seats who were really aware of the implication of the first response by the government. They knew that the government's mean spirited response was not good enough. They recognised that veterans deserve more and that the government had just put this process in place to delay improving the entitlements and benefits of veterans. We do not think that is good enough. We do not think that is the way you treat your veterans. The process was protracted. As I said before, the veterans and veterans groups who made submissions to the inquiry felt betrayed. At the end of it all, they said, ‘What was the review all about?' There were 3,000 was submissions to the Clarke review but the truth is that the review was just a delaying tactic by the government: the minister's response to looking after our veterans and sure their entitlements are taken care of was to call a review instead of acting. We on this side of the House believe that veterans want action and recognition. You cannot just hand out some medals and certificates and do nothing-and that is just what the veterans in the community I represent perceive the minister and the Howard government have been doing for them: handing out medals and certificates, saying nice words, being there when a memorial is opened but never delivering things in a timely way. Veterans also recognise that there is an election around the corner, but I will deal with that later. Whenever I talk about veterans, I cannot help but mention an issue that is very important in my area and, if the minister were interested in looking at veterans' entitlements and making sure they were looked after, she would have ensured that the Howard government had dealt with this issue. The issue I am referring to is that specialists and some GPs in areas throughout Australia are not honouring the gold card. In the Central Coast, the Hunter, Newcastle and Lake Macquarie, specialists are refusing to bulk-bill our veterans who have gold cards. I find that most disturbing and I find the government's inaction on this matter most disturbing. I do not know what to say to a constituent who rings me and says, ‘I served my country and I was promised that my health needs would be taken care of. When I go to the urologist that I've been going to for five years, I'm told that my gold card is no good and that they're not going to bulk-bill me. As a consequence, I can't afford to attend that gist any longer.' I think the minister needs address that issue and deliver that entitlement not only to the veterans of Lake Macquarie and the Central Coast but to all veterans in Australia, because this is happening throughout the whole country. Minister, I am afraid I am not impressed with your performance in the portfolio; neither are the veterans within the community and the electorate that I represent. Further afield on the Central Coast, they have said to me that they are very disappointed with the delaying tactics, very disappointed with the inaction and very disappointed with the nice words used to placate them. They would rather see action. On behalf of the communities that I represent in this House, I put on the record that they want action, not words and reviews. The legislation before the House today, as I mentioned earlier, results from the Clarke review of veterans' entitlements. There were 109 recommendations made by Justice Clarke. As I said earlier, I have been critical truly of the whole review process-the fact that there was a review and the way in which it took place. Of the 109 recommendations, 40 dealt with the gold card; 30 looked at a total restructure of the TPI, which the government rejected; and, of those remaining, 10 to 12 were picked up in this legislation and 15, about qualifying service, were not taken into account. That is an issue that veterans constantly raise with me and it is one that I do not think will go away. I think a lot of the government's response has just been political speak. I will touch on the prisoners of war issue a little later. The legislation, as I have mentioned, does not take up all the recommendations in the Clarke review; but it does have a provision for rent assistance for war widows renting privately, which is effective from January 2005. I believe it was originally going to be urolo- effective from March 2005, but it was to brought forward because there was great consternation about how long it was going to take to bring it in. In my electorate office, I have been approached on a number of occasions by war widows who will benefit enormously from this provision. The government is to be congratulated on including it, but I honestly do not think we needed to have a review to know that it should have happened. It was obvious that this was one area that needed action. If the government had been timely in its response to this issue and had actually governed and put in place what was needed, this could have been up and operating by now. Once again, I have to condemn the government for its tardiness in introducing this legislation. The extension of the prisoner of war grants needs 100 per cent support. There are only a few prisoners of war who will benefit from this-those who were in the Korean War. But what about World War II veterans and the prisoners of war who were held in Europe? About 1,150 of those veterans are still alive. I cannot see how their conditions were appreciably better than those of the prisoners of war who have already been granted the $25,000 payment. In some cases, I am sure they were worse. Those veterans came back damaged men, as those other prisoners of war did. I have had prisoners of war in my office telling me about the consequences of their internment. But we are ignoring them. The government really needs to turn its mind to that issue. There is also the matter of the exemption of the disability pension from the means test with Centrelink. The government has done this in a rather messy way. The exemption of the disability pension from the means test does not operate quite the way you would think. The government could not get the Department of Family and Community Services to agree to implement this change. They objected to the policy. So the Social Security Act will not be amended. Instead, the Department of Veterans' Affairs will be paying an allowance equivalent to the deductions resulting from the operation of the means test. You would have to say that this expensive and messy compromise, brought about by a stand-off between two portfolios. Surely the minister can facilitate the departments sitting down together to work out this problem. It is not good enough, Minister. The increase in funeral benefits from $572 to $1,000 is most welcome. The extension of qualifying service for the small number of post World War II operations also is welcome. As I said earlier, a number of the recommendations that were not taken up related to other conflicts and they possibly need to be revisited. The indexation of the above general rate portion of the TPI special rate the CPI or MTAWE-whatever is greaterwill be effective from 20 March, and that is already in place. I turn to the issue of the atomic test programs of the fifties. The government agreed that something would be done for those affected by those tests once the current cancer and mortality study had been completed. I have raised in this parliament on a number of occasions the plight of a constituent in my electorate, Mr Albert Martin, who, as records can verify, was at Maralinga at the time of those atomic tests. He has acute myeloid leukaemia. A number of the people that he served with have already died from a similar type of leukaemia; yet, because his testing records that showed the level of contamination at the time have disappeared-as did all of theirs-he has not received any compensation. He has been pushed into a nasty situation whereby he is about to accept compensation at a very much lower level than he deserves. His life has been changed forever and his life expectancy has decreased substantially, yet it has taken this long for this matter to be addressed. I am not too pleased about that. I am sure he will not be too pleased that there is going to be a further wait for further studies to be completed, which will simply ensure that he will not get is a very any benefit from the process. The veterans of Australia welcome the changes that have been incorporated in this legislation, but they do not appreciate the delays and frustrations associated with the process that has brought this legislation into the House. They do not appreciate the government throwing scraps from the table five minutes before an election. It is interesting that there has been a two-year process and now, when we have an election just around the corner, the legislation comes before the House. It has been a process of delaying changes that were needed and obvious. And by why? To save money. It is all about saving money-not about caring for the veterans, not about ensuring that they have the entitlements that they need and deserve. The Howard government is a mean-spirited government that takes with one hand and gives with the other. It is a government that cannot be trusted. Here we are on the eve of an election, and it is giving. History shows that the election it will be take, take, take. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs stated in her second reading speech on 1 April this year that she was proud that the government's response would deliver even more for veterans and war widows across Australia. I would argue that she should be ashamed at the tardiness of the government's response; ashamed that the government even undertook the review, as the changes encapsulated in this legislation were obvious and overdue; and ashamed that she made veterans jump through hoops in the belief that her government would introduce radical changes. The minister has treated our brave veterans, who have been true to Australia, with contempt. This legislation provides well deserved benefits and relief to our veterans and war widows-benefits that were obvious when the Clarke review was commissioned; benefits that could have and should have been introduced in February 2002, not on the eve of an election. This government stands condemned for its delaying tactics, but I support this legislation and the benefits it delivers veterans in Australia.",62
109,Mr DUTTON,COMMITTEES,"It is with a great deal of pleasure that I rise to support the Veterans' Entitlements (Clarke Review) Bill 2004. I arrived early in the chamber this afternoon, which sometimes can be a blessing, but on this occasion was a nightmare, because the member for Shortland in her ramblings highlighted the great problems of Labor. The member for Shortland represents the dim, dark past of the Labor Party. She does not represent any of the new, bright Labor ramblings that we would see the member for Werriwa try to bring before this parliament. Her ramblings were an example of somebody who is way out of their depth, who is not representative of their community and who is not in touch with the after veterans within their own community. They were the ramblings of somebody who was unable to demonstrate any understanding of this very important debate. If the member for Shortland had been serious about putting forward the views of veterans of Australia and supporting them, she would have come into the House and explained why the Labor Party has let down veterans for generations. In its response to the Clarke review it has demonstrated yet again that it does not represent the veterans of this community in any positive way. Nothing was said in the previous contribution-or in some of the contributions that I heard today from those on the other sideabout the alternatives they would put up, how they would fund the remainder of the Clarke recommendations or what they would put forward by way of a positive contribution to this debate. It is a demonstration, as I said before, of why the Labor Party are unable to gain any traction with the Australian people not only on this issue but on broader issues that are under public debate today. It demonto strates well why the Australian people will reject the Labor Party at the ballot box in the upcoming election. The Australian Labor Party on the issue of veterans, on the issues of the economy and on the issues of national security provide no alternative government to the Australian people. They deserve to be exposed for the shortcomings that have been demonstrated in this chamber today. I am here to speak about the positive contribution that we have made and that we continue to make towards the veteran community of this country. It is quite apt that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs is in the chamber today. I want to congratulate her for the positive contribution that she has made as part of this debate and as part of the government's response to the Clarke review. The Veterans' Affairs portfolio has never been an easy one. By their own admission, some of the veteran groups will never be satisfied. Some of the veterans that I deal with in my community are very satisfied and complimentary of the position that the government has adopted in response to the Clarke review. There are others within the veteran community who are not satisfied. I understand their concerns and the problems that they have due to some of the expectations that they had of what might have been delivered in the government's response to the Clarke review. But, as I say, responsible government is about providing funded and responsible responses to issues like veterans' affairs and, this case, the Clarke review. The government has made an additional $267 million available over the next five years for veterans and, importantly, for war widows and war widowers. It certainly builds on our strong track record in relation to veterans. It brings the veterans budget to an incredible $10 billion this year, or an additional $4 billion overall since 1996. There has been a great deal of speculation in the media recently about the track record of the Howard government in some of the areas that we have provided considerable support to. The Australian Labor Party hold themselves out to be the supporters of the worker and the battler and of demographics and groups within our community such as the veterans, but I really think they have been exposed over the last eight years of our government. The Labor Party had 13 years in government, right up until 1996, to demonstrate that they supported those groups within our community that they and some Australians believe the Labor Party have traditionally stood for. What we have shown over last eight years is that they did quite the opposite. But this government has been about supporting families and workers in this country. Indeed, today, as we can demonstrate, it has been and continues to be about supporting the veterans in our community. We do welcome the bipartisan support that has been begrudgingly offered in a negative sense by the Labor Party, who have been silent on veterans' issues. This has been noticed by the veteran community and certainly by many veterans I have spoken to. The Clarke report provided 109 recommendations, around half of which suggested no change to current practice. Essentially, that is an endorsement of the way in which the government operates its affairs in the veterans' affairs portfolio. A very strong in message, and one that needs to be highlighted today, is that, in half of those recommendations, Professor Clarke recommended that there be no change. As I said, that may in fact upset some of the veterans and it may please some of the others, but what it does say is that this government is committed to supporting our veterans. The Clarke report obviously raised a number of issues in relation to service eligibility, disability pension arrangements and gold card eligibility, amongst other things. I want to touch briefly on some of the main aspects of the government's response and then talk more comprehensively about some of those things later in my speech. The first significant aspect of our response was the exemption of the DVA disability pension from the means test at Centrelink. That is at a cost to Australian taxpayers of just under $100 million. It will benefit 19,000 veterans and partners. It ensures equity amongst veterans, regardless of whether they receive their income support from the DVA or Centrelink. For a single TPI in receipt of income support, this can mean up to an extra $257 per fortnight. One of the other main aspects was in relation to the indexation of the above general rate in the same way as the service pension-that is, through the CPI-MTAWE combination. This was agreed to by the government at a cost to taxpayers of $66 million. It will benefit 45,000 veterans. It ensures that the most disabled-those who cannot work or can only work part time-receive the maximum level of support through appropriate indexation. Thirdly, the government's response provides for rental assistance to be granted to war widowers and war widows in addition to the income support supplement, at an additional cost of $73 million to the Australian taxpayers and benefiting 11,000 war widows by up to $94.40 per fortnight. It addresses the needs of the poorest of our war widowers. Fourthly, we have increased the funeral benefit. I think this is most important. It is at a cost of $27 million to Australian taxpayers and it benefits 14,500 people per year. It almost doubles the funeral benefit, from $572 to $1,000. Of course, that sum has always been designed as a contribution toward the cost. Never was it intended to meet the full cost and never could the Australian taxpayer, regrettably, afford to meet the full cost. But it is a significant contribution when we are talking about an increase from $572 to $1,000. Importantly, in relation to the government's response, we have talked about and responded to those who were prisoners of war in Korea. At a cost of half a million dollars to the Australian taxpayer, around 29 ex-POWs or their widows will benefit from an ex gratia payment of $25,000. In relation to eligibility changes, the government has announced that $500,000 of Australian taxpayers' money will be contributed to a range of changes to eligibility for those involved in the Berlin airlift, No. 2 Squadron and minesweeping immediately after World War II. It will benefit around 10 people. In relation to the atomic test participants, the government is making a sound commitment to respond positively to the needs of those affected by the British atomic test program when the outcomes are available from the Australian participants in the British nuclear test program cancer incidence and mortality study. As part of this debate it is important to recognise that these measures are in addition to those already signalled and flagged for the veterans within our community. It is interesting to look at a few facts in relation to DVA disability pensions as part of this debate. The DVA disability pension is tax-free, means test exempt and paid for life. It is in addition to income support that a person may be eligible for otherwise. The government spends $1.3 billion per year of taxpayers' money on DVA disability pensions to 156,000 disability pensioners. On top of that $1.3 billion, the above general rate disability pensioners are also eligible for other allowances and, of course, the gold card. Over half of the government response to the Clarke report-$166 million out of the $267 million-is to address areas of need for our DVA disability pensioners. As I moved around my electorate during celebrations and commemoration surrounding ANZAC Day, I spoke to many veterans. I attended the dawn service at the Kallangur RSL, organised by the Pine Rivers subbranch. I attended a service later that morning at the Gaythorne RSL and I attended a subsequent function back at the Kallangur RSL later on ANZAC morning. At all of those occasions there were not only record numbers of veterans, many of whom I spoke to, but also record numbers of schoolchildren and other members of our community who proudly came out to support the veteran community and acknowledge the memory of many of those Australians who gave their lives in the service of this country. That is part of the reason I was so vigorelectorate. ous in my support of the government's response to the Clarke review, and why I put forward the views of many veteran constituents within my own electorate and why I believe that, as a government, we need to continue in our strong support of the veteran community in this country. When I spoke to many of the veterans at those ceremonies right around the electorate on ANZAC Day and at the celebrations leading up to the day I received feedback that many of those veterans were in fact impressed with the response of the government. As I acknowledged in my opening remarks, many of those people wanted to see the government response go further than it did, but the majority of people recognised that the extra $267 million that we had committed in our response to the Clarke review was adequate and fair and signalled the continued strength in the policy that we have adopted over many years towards the veteran community. I want to talk about the indexation of the above general rate of the DVA disability pension. This was important to many of the constituents of my electorate and indeed to many veterans right around this country. The government decided to reject Clarke's proposal in relation to the restructure of the DVA ability pension which we believe would have introduced a much more complex and difficult arrangement. Instead, the government responded to and are addressing key areas of concern for disability pensioners-namely, effectively exempting the DVA disability pension from Centrelink's means test. In addition to that, we have indexed the above general rate of the DVA disability pension in the same way as the service pension-that is, it is to be indexed by CPI and benchmarked against MTAWE. In my view, that is a very important element of the response, and that was reflected in the views given to me by many of the veterans as I moved around my It is also important to talk about the Defence Force income support allowance and how it works, because it is an important element in the government's response to Clarke. The DFISA will be paid to those veterans who receive a reduced income support payment from Centrelink because their DVA disability pension is included as income in the assessment of their Centrelink payment. It will be a taxable income support allowance, paid under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986-the VEA-from 20 September this year. It is important, because up to 19,000 veterans and their partners may receive an increase in their total Australian those government income support payments as a result of this initiative. No veteran or their partner will receive less as a result of this initiative. The DFISA will be automatically paid to eligible veterans and their partners who are currently receiving a social security payment. One of the most important commitments that we have as a government is to support war widows and war widowers. Under this proposal, this government has provided for 11,000 eligible war widows and war widowers to receive rental assistance in addition to disthe maximum rate of the income support supplement. It is estimated that around 4,600 recipients will receive an increase equal to the maximum rate of rent assistance, which is currently just under $95 per fortnight for a single person. If you say that quickly, Mr Deputy Speaker-$94.40 per fortnight for a single person-you might gloss over it and think that it is an insignificant amount. But I say to you and the House today that that is most welcomed by those in most need. It is a significant amount of assistance to those war widows and war widowers who had their partners make the ultimate contribution and sacrifice for this country. I am very proud of that measure that the Howard government has committed to. A further estimated 6,900 people will receive an increase in the order of half of the maximum rate, being the rent assistance entitlement as determined by the amount of rent they pay. This measure is the fourth significant enhancement to war widows' benefits in the past eight years. I spoke about funeral benefits before and about how they would increase to $1,000. Eligible veterans include those receiving a disability pension for severe or extreme disablement, those who were prisoners of war, those whose death was accepted as being due to service, those who were in severe financial need or those who died in a hospital or home after being discharged with a terminal illness where treatment was under a repatriation entitlement, and dependants of veterans who died in severe financial need. That is a significant contribution to those people who are most in need. I want to close my speech today on the support that this government is providing as part of our response to the Clarke review by saying that we obviously face a budget tonight which will continue this government's support to not just the veteran community but to Australian families far and wide. This government has been about been providing support for the cross-section of the Australian community. This bill is a demonstration of the way in which we continue to support the veteran community. It is by no means an example or a message to the veteran community that there is not more that needs to be done. We acknowledge as part of the debate today that more does need to be done. We will continue to do more. But it is important for our critics to realise-particularly those on the other side who have come into this chamber misinformed about this debate-that we make a commitment in the order of $10 billion per annum to the veteran community. It is a significant contribution and it is one that will be reinforced, I believe, in the budget tonight. But, as I said, the budget tonight will go much further to supporting indirectly those in the veteran community and those in the broader community. Over the last eight years, the Howard government has been about providing for a stable economic environment in which we can return dividends to the Australian people. It does need to be said as part of this debate today that, if this government had not been as economically responsible as we have been over the last eight years in delivering surat pluses to the Australian people through the budget process, then we would not be able to afford the measures that are contained in this bill today, and we would not be able to afford the announcements that will be made by the Treasurer tonight. All Australians can be proud of the way in which the Howard government has conducted its economic affairs over the last eight years because it speaks not only to what we are able to provide-through the significant measures as announced and discussed today-but also to those measures which will be announced for many years to come in this country. The question the Australian people need to ask themselves is: could the Labor Party deliver what we have delivered to the veteran community and to the broader Australian community for years to come? The resounding answer is: definitely not.",66
110,Mr ORGAN,COMMITTEES,"Cunningham) (5.38 p.m.)I welcome the opportunity to rise this evening to speak to the Veterans' Entitlements (Clarke Review) Bill 2004. In response to the member for Dickson's assertion that people on this side of the House come to this debate not informed, I would like to point out that we come not misinformed but concerned. According to the minister, this bill is the culmination of the government's commitment to review anomalies in veterans' entitlements and concerns about the level of benefits and support provided to disabled veterans. The minister's explanatory memorandum goes further. It says that the measures include creation of a new allowance, new indexation arrangements for certain disability pensions and a once-only payment to former prisoners of war of the North Koreans or their surviving spouses. The measures in the bill do go some way to addressing long standing inequities, particularly the new indexation measures for totally and permanently incapacitated veterans-TPIs-and I welcome these measures. But the veteran community says that they do not go far enough. That is right: the experts, those who know most about these issues-the veterans themselves-say that these measures do not go far enough. I have received a lot of correspondence on this matter over the past few years, and I am sure other members of this chamber have as well. The recent passing of ANZAC Day and the various parades and services I attended in my electorate of Cunningham brought home to me many of the outstanding issues facing the veteran community. Various veterans have spoken to me about these outstanding issues. I would like to quote what one veteran has written to me, and I want to raise some of the issues that are relevant to this debate. The correspondent says: Totally and Permanently Incapacitated (T&PI) war veterans receive $762:80 per fortnight for loss of ability to work. Some will argue that we also receive the Service Pension, true, but that is welfare and we are not welfare cases. Until 1984 TPIs were not entitled to the Service Pension as the compensation payment was sufficient to give the appearance of a normal lifestyle similar to that of the average Australian. The stealthy removal of that compensation payment has had a serious impact on the pride and dignity of veterans. Presenting a Pensioner Concession Card and begging for a concession not only goes against the original intent of the original Repatriation Act, but reduces once proud men and women to mere beggars. A suitable income allows us the dignity we were promised and fought and died for. It's about what Prime Minister Billy Hughes told this Parliament on 21 March 1929. The correspondent included a quote from Prime Minister Hughes because he obviously felt that it encapsulated the feeling out there amongst the veteran community and that it was of relevance today. Prime Minister Hughes, in reference to World War I veterans, said: Some, indeed, came out of this inferno of war apparently unscathed; the bounding vitality of youth for the time triumphed over the fearful shocks and strain of war. As the honourable member for Reid and others have said, when the war was over, they made haste to throw off their soldier's tunic and put on the jacket of a civilian, thanking God they had been spared, and resolved to put all thoughts of the horrors they had endured behind them. For three, five, or perhaps ten years they pursued their various civilian vocations, apparently hale and strong, and then with startling abruptness comes the end. Their strength oozes from them, their youth passes, they are broken men. The expectation of life at the age of 24 years, the which we may assume was the average age of men of the Australian Imperial Force, is 43½. The average death rate at 35-that is 11 years after the Armistice-is 45 per thousand; but the men of the AIF are dying at the rate of 75 per thousand. The war is doing its deadly work, but then again how many of them are below par? They are still far from old but they are getting toward middle-age. Disease takes a thousand shapes; some of the men develop Locomotor Ataxia; some tubercular trouble but these maladies are due to one thing-a lowering of vitality. The nervous force has been reduced until the men no longer have the power to resist disease. Their war service has prematurely aged them. If a civilian, subjected to a similar strain course of his employment, sued his employer, no doctor in Australia would say other than that the ills from which the man was suffering were due to that cause. The onus of proof is placed on the unfortunate ex-soldier, although it takes the best of us, in the days of vigorous health, to prove anything before a Court of Law or other Tribunal. These poor men, suffering the effects of the great strain of war service, goes before a Tribunal and, because he cannot prove what no doctor on earth can prove, or disprove, redress is denied him. Prime Minister Hughes summed it all up when he said: The onus of proof is placed on the unfortunate ex-soldier, although it takes the best of us, in the days of vigorous health, to prove anything before a Court of Law or other Tribunal. They put their case well, don't they, Mr. Deputy Speaker? But there is more. My correspondent goes on to say: Well, we are still in that position and many are dying long before we are able to prove their case. Prime Minister Hughes talks about the health of veterans of the great war of 1914 to 1918 but a similar pattern exists with other wars, the mortality study and validation study on Vietnam veterans reads similarly to the words of Billy Hughes. Anyone who thinks disabled veterans are not worthy of some dignity can only be described as heartless and lacking compassion. Many were called up for national service in the sixties and seventies and were led to believe they would serve for two years, and many are still serving, but on a reducing income granted at the whim of men and women that have never seen the ravages of war. ‘Is this a fair go? Would you accept it?' my correspondent asks. He goes on: The TPI community is probably the only group in Australia that does not have a benchmark on which to base their compensation payments, and this had been a concern for many years. The TPI Federation in its submission has not asked for full restitution of their compensation, in the the claim is for it to be indexed at 75% of MTAWEthe male total average weekly earningswhich still leaves them at a loss compared to those that preceded them. When we departed for war in the sixties and seventies we were well briefed on our entitlements and were confident that they would be looked after if they suffered injury or illness. We were made a promise and we won't go away until it is honoured. A suitable wage for TPIs also contributes to the national economy and allows disabled soldiers to continue to assist each other thus further reducing the burden to society. What will be the real cost to government when we are finally so financially embarrassed that we stay at home and allow their depression to scream to new levels? We are not asking for anything other than a fair go; is that so much to ask? Is it too much to ask? I do not think so. Australia's veteran community are obviously angry, and they feel betrayed by the government. Consider this from another veteran, a namesake of the Prime Minister, as it happens. He is especially critical of the government and the minister: When the Minister of Veteran Affairs [or the Minister of Movements, Monuments and Morning Teas] can inform the general population of Australia that we [TPI's] receive 109% of the MTAWEthe male total average weekly earningsit makes you wonder about HONESTY. When the very same Minister uses a figure of $10 billion as proof that we are well looked after, it certainly makes you wonder about TRUSTING any one especially those in power on that hill in Canberra. The Minister does not inform the public that the $10 Billion would cover things like, infrastructure, wages, superannuation, rental of buildings, taxes of those employed, utilities, insurances, solicitors, monuments, travel to open said monuments, appeals against the claims of service personnel who fight their way through courts [i.e. the HMAS Voyage case] etc, etc, etc. Most of the money allocated in the above would be spent on the bureaucracy within the public service, so much for Duty of Care of the Veteran Population! Now we have introduced by the SPIN DOCTORS, economic and non economic loss. Is this another move to slow the process of correcting the TPI rates of compensation as sought by the President [ Mr J. “Blue” Ryan] and the 27,000 [approx] members of the National TPI Association of Australia? You can see that some of our veterans have now reached the point where they do not believe the government. And that is not surprising. On 1 May 2004, the Sydney Morning Herald carried an article by Nick O'Malley, which dealt with veterans' access to medical treatment via the gold card. I will quickly quote from that: Some medical specialists are closing their doors to war veterans because government payments to the doctors have not kept pace with the increasing costs of treatment. It is not known how many specialists are refusing to accept veterans' Gold Cards-which are meant to pay for full and free health care-but last November the Department of Veterans Affairs told Parliament that 323, or about 4 per cent, had done so. Anecdotal evidence gathered by the RSL and the Combined Superannuants Association suggests the problem is worsening, especially and regional areas. A Bathurst urologist, Mark Morrissey, wrote to his veteran patients last month informing them that “with deep regret” he would not be accepting Gold Cards as payment from May 1 because the schedule fee paid by the Department of Veterans Affairs no longer covered costs. “It appears that the department does not value veterans in the same way as the Medicare patients in our area,” he wrote. Dr Morrissey's practice manager said the department was willing to ferry patients to Sydney in taxis but would not increase his fee. In January orthopedic services were suspended for Gold Card holders at Nowra Hospital and orthopedic surgery will be withdrawn from June. There patients were issued a memo saying they would charged, “like other seniors”, $80 for an initial consultation and $40 for a follow-up. “If you are unhappy with this situation, please write to your federal MP, your RSL and the Prime Minister and make your dissatisfaction known,” it said. The RSL president, Bill Crews, wrote to the Minister for Veterans Affairs, Danna Vale, last month highlighting the problem and pointing out that other government bodies responsible for paying doctors, including Victoria's Transport Accident Commission and WorkCover, had managed to increase schedule fees to doctors. Major-General Crews said most specialists were keen to help veterans, but some could not afford it. “Those who have a heavy caseload of veterans have a very hard time of it,” he said. Major-General Crews said the problem was pronounced in regional areas where there were fewer specialists. He said he was told by a member of the Department of Veterans Affairs that problems with veterans' health could not be tackled until endemic problems with Medicare were addressed. “That is not a satisfactory answer when you consider the contribution these people have made to the national security of this country, especially when other agencies already [treat those in their in rural care] better,” he said. “There is a sense of being let down. Some might call it a sense of betrayal. I would be tious to use that word, but some might.” Last week a spokeswoman for Ms Vale said the Government could not guarantee veterans access to their choice of doctor, but could tee that they would be treated, even if that meant transporting them from country towns into regional centres or cities. Margaret Mauro, of the Bathurst branch of the Combined Pensioners and Superannuants Association, rejected this, saying: “John Howard is willing to send men off to war but not to look after them when they get back.” You can see that Australia's veterans and the veteran community expect just one thing from their government. They expect it to stay brave and true. It is a matter for regret that the Veterans' Entitlements (Clarke Review) Bill does not do that. I will support the legislation solely because it does provide some enhanced benefits, but I say again that what it delivers is a long way short of what the veteran community wants, what the veteran community needs and what the veteran community deserves.",70
111,Mr SOMLYAY,COMMITTEES,"Fairfax) (5.52 p.m.)Let me say at the outset of this debate that it is indisputable that Australia has the most comprehensive, generous and wide-ranging repatriation system in the world. No country looks after its veterans better than we do, and that applies whether the coalition is in government or the Labor Party is in government. The Australian veterans' entitlements system is acknowledged worldwide. From time to time the government finds the need to review our repatriation system. This is because, as veterans age or new conflicts arise or peacekeeping needs are met, problems encountered by our veterans change and the existing system does not cater for them as well as originally intended. We must remember that veterans' entitlements are not welfare. Veterans' entitlements are compensation paid to those Australians cau- who serve their country and put their lives on the line for their fellow Australians. The Clarke review was commissioned to examine and modernise veterans' entitlements. The guaranpurpose of the Veterans' Entitlements (Clarke Review) Bill 2004 is to give effect to the government's response to that review. It contains measures that include the creation of a new allowance, new indexation arrangements for certain disability pensions and a once-only payment to former prisoners of war of the North Koreans. Our communities, of course, are composed of many different but interrelated groups. Our veterans are integral not just to the strength and values of those communities but also to our sense of national pride and identity. Our veterans have learnt strength and wisdom not from reading in an armchair but through practical and challenging experiences. They not only stand for many of our core values but have actually put their lives on the line for those values. The fact that our community is appreciative of veterans is demonstrated by the increasing number of people attending ANZAC Day ceremonies every year. Every year I see it at each of the five or six ANZAC Day ceremonies I attend. At this year's dawn service at Coolum Beach a young primary school girl-her name was Chloe, I found out later-quietly went around to all the veterans, anybody wearing a ribbon or who marched or was wearing medals, and gave them a very small card. I have one of the cards in my pocket. I kept one that one of the veterans gave to me. She sat at home the previous day and made those cards to give to the veterans. She gave her Saturday to that purpose. I have a card here. It had a flower attached to the back of it. She had hand drawn an Australian flag on the card. Inside it said, ‘Thanks for making our country what it is today.' That came from a child of six or seven years of age, and it shows you what the community thinks of the contribution of our veterans to our community. I know that the ANZAC spirit is well and truly alive see young children who are motivated to do that. When we came to office in 1996, spending on veterans' health was $1.7 billion. The member for Cunningham spoke about the need for more spending on veterans' health. This year that spending is $4.1 billion. In 1996 total spending on veterans' affairs was $6.4 billion. In last year's budget it was $10 billion. Let me repeat that: in the 2003-04 budget the government allocated $10 billion to the care of our veterans. Of course there always a need for more. There is always more that can be done or should be done. There are always things that can be done differently. The government are aware of this and are constantly reviewing such matters. That is why we had the Clarke review. Much of the increased spending on veterans' affairs is due to the government's recognition of the growing and changing needs of Australian veterans, war widows and widowers as they become older. In its review of veterans' entitlements the Clarke committee consulted widely with the veteran community, held public and private meetings and accepted over 3,000 written responses. The committee attempted to address as many as possible of the issues submitted, and in doing so it made 109 recommendations-more than half of which called for no change to current arrangements. The government has accepted some of the recommendations and rejected others. To implement those it has accepted, the government will be providing an additional $267 million over five years. This bill gives effect omy strong: to the government's acceptance of those recommendations. There are basically six areas of benefit for veterans in this bill. It provides for an ex gratia payment of $25,000 to surviving prisonwhen I ers of war held captive by North Korean forces, or to their widows who were alive on 1 July 2003. It means that above general rate disability pensions will be indexed in response to both the CPI and male total average weekly earnings. It introduces a Defence Force income support allowance. It ensures that rent assistance is provided in addition to the ceiling rate of service pension or income support supplement which may be payable to a war widow or widower pensioner. It increases the maximum amount of funeral is benefit from $572 to $1,000. It extends operational service under the act to include persons who have been awarded or who are eligible to be awarded certain minesweeping or bomb clearance awards. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Leave granted; debate adjourned.",74

Bill presented by Mr Costello, and read a first time. Second Reading",75
113,Mr COSTELLO,COMMITTEES,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. NA This Budget is designed to keep our econ- so that people can find work and keep jobs; - so that interest rates for homebuyers are kept low; - so that older Australians can look forward to dignity in retirement; - so that families have more choices. We can't do these things without a strong economy. If parents run the risk of being thrown out of work, they can't have confidence. If homebuyers have to pay double digit interest rates they can't feel secure. want to deliver security for families so they can plan for the future. And a weak economy won't do it. A weak economy won't pay for the hospitals, the schools and the roads that we all want. And it won't assist our defence and national security effort. Over the last eight years so many countries-countries much bigger than ourshave gone into recession. We have been challenged by financial collapse in our region, by plagues like SARS, by terrorism and war, by an aching drought that still lingers. We have had many difficult challenges and we have come through. But it would be foolish to think the challenges are over. Economic management requires careful planning, hard work, and sound choices in difficult situations. Economic management is not an accident and it is not a fluke. The Budget. I am announcing tonight involves huge expenditures of nearly $200 billion. But for the seventh time since 1997 it will be in surplus. We will keep to the principles that we laid down in previous Budgets: - the Government will not spend money it does not have; - after we fund our current spending we will continue to make repayments of Labor's debt. In net terms we have now reduced Labor's $96 billion debt by $70 billion. The Australian economy is much stronger. But now we have new challenges. We must start preparing for the ageing of the population. Over the next forty years the number of Australians of working age will grow only slightly, but the number of Australians over 65 will more than double. Tonight I will anWe nounce measures that will work to address this fundamental shift in our society. And to cope with that change we need to take measures which will help our economy grow to its maximum potential-to help more people into the workforce and make it easier for mothers who are juggling paid work and part-time work with the nurture and raising of children. Tonight I will be announcing the largest package of measures ever to assist families who are juggling work and child-rearing. And since we need to improve rewards for people who are working extra, looking for promotion, or wanting to upgrade their skills, tonight I am announcing new tax scales which will lower marginal tax rates for middle income earners. NA Our plan: More help for families has five interwoven components: - a $600 increase in the level of payment per child under the Family Tax Benefit Part A; - relaxing the income test for this benefit which will give more families access at higher rates; - a change in the income test for the single income family benefit-FTB (B)which will allow more mothers to access this payment while working part time; - a new maternity payment-without qualification-for every mother on the birth of a child; - a very substantial increase in childcare places. The Family Tax Benefit Part A is paid to around two million Australian families. Tonight I am announcing an increase of $600 in all levels of this payment. The base payment, per child, will increase from $1,095 to $1,695. This new level is, in real terms, more than 100 per cent higher than the amount paid under this benefit when the Government was elected in 1996. This increase of $600 will be available as a lump sum to families upon reconciliation of their 2003-04 entitlement, that is, when they file their tax return after 30 June this year and in every subsequent year. And further to this, tonight I am announcing an immediate payment to all families eligible for the Family Tax Benefit Part A in the sum of $600 to be paid before 30 June this year. As soon as Parliament enacts the legislation, eligible families can receive $600. They will then be entitled to a further $600 lump sum upon reconciling their current year entitlement after 30 June. This means nearly all of these families will be eligible for an additional $1,200 per child in the next 12 months. Second, the income test for this benefit will be eased. The phase out for the maximum payment (a sum increased to over $4,000 tonight) will be softened so that a family with three children will still receive some part of the maximum benefit with a family income up to $70,920. Third, tonight I am also announcing enhanced benefits for single income families and families with a part-time second earner. Around 90 per cent of these families receive the additional $600 per child I have just announced. From 1 July they will also receive a more generous income test and taper on the income of the second earner. At present these families lose the benefit when the second earner returns to work and earns $11,500. This can discourage mothers re-entering the workforce for part-time work. The more generous test will allow part of the benefit to continue until the second earner's income reaches $18,600. And further, from 1 July 2005 where the mother returns to work, the income from employment will not be counted against her eligibility for the benefit already received. A mother can keep the benefit she has already received when she reenters the workforce. Fourth, the Government will roll together the existing Maternity Allowance and Baby Bonus into a new payment, a Maternity Payment, to be paid to all mothers on the birth of a child. The payment will be a $3,000 lump sum from 1 July and it will rise to $5,000 by 1 July 2008. Those who receive the current Baby Bonus will keep that entitlement where it is higher than this. The Maternity Payment recognises the cost of a new child and will assist all mothers many of whom leave the workforce on the birth of their child. Fifth, the Government will dramatically increase the availability of childcare places to help mothers balancing work and family commitments. In addition to announcements made last December, the Government will add another 30,000 outside-school-hours places and 1,500 family day care places to bring the total new places to 40,000 outsideschool-hours places and 4,000 family day care places from 1 July 2004. Allowing for these places means an overall increase in childcare since the Government was elected of 85 per cent or around 250,000 places. Taken together, our package, More help for families, will increase family assistance by around $50 per week for a family on average wages with a wife in part-time work and two children. The family package will deliver more help to families. It will deliver more choice to families. It will cost $19.2 billion over NA Mr Speaker, our income tax rates should be kept as low as is consistent with our spending requirements. People on middle incomes should not face the top rate of income tax. In 2000, income tax was cut by the largest amount ever and last year thresholds were changed to reduce income tax again. Tonight I am announcing new thresholds for marginal tax rates which will cut income tax by $14.7 billion over the next four years. The thresholds will be lifted in two stages. From 1 July 2004 the 42 per cent threshold will be increased to $58,000 and the 47 per cent threshold will be increased to $70,000. From 1 July 2005 the 42 per cent threshold will be further increased to $63,000 and the top 47 per cent threshold to $80,000. Australians will not go on the top marginal tax rate until their income exceeds $80,000. These tax cuts will mean that more than 80 per cent of taxpayers will have a top rate of tax of 30 per cent or less over the forward estimates. The overwhelming majority of taxpayers who earn between $21,600 and $63,000 will not face any increase in their tax rate as their income increases. These changes will improve rewards for those wanting to do overtime or to upgrade their skills. These changes improve the structure of Australia's income tax system. They make it more internationally competitive. They improve incentive. They will help those with skills receive better reward for effort. The tax cut for someone earning at the top threshold or above will be $42.21 per week. NA Mr Speaker, the Government also believes there should be incentives for additional savings by those who want more retirement income than the superannuation guarantee and five years. the age pension provides. Against the wishes of the Opposition the Government has finally introduced a $1 for $1 co-contribution scheme for low earners who make voluntary contributions to superannuation. But it is time to take this further. From 1 July the Government co-contribution will increase to 150 per cent of an employee's contribution up to a maximum of $1,500. This means that if an eligible person pays $1,000 into superannuation, the Government will match it with $1,500 for that person in their fund. The lower income threshold, up to which the maximum co-contribution applies, will be raised to $28,000. Above this, the maximum co-contribution will reduce by five cents for each dollar to phase out completely at $58,000. This will significantly boost superannuation incentives for low and middle income employees and boost their retirement incomes. Further, the Government will also reduce the superannuation surcharge for those on higher incomes at a cost of $610 million over the next four years. The rate will reduce from its current level of 14.5 per cent to 7.5 per cent by 2006-07. The combined cost of these superannuation measures will be $2.7 billion over four years. They will help people build retirement savings. INVESTING IN AUSTRALIA'S NA Mr Speaker, a strongly performing economy is best sustained within a safe and secure community and nation. The heightened threat posed by terrorism means the Government has had to move quickly to upgrade national security. In total, the Government has committed $3.1 billion over seven years since 11 September 2001 to make Australia more safe and more secure. This Budget includes a further $755 million over five years to continue to improve our national security arrangements. Intelligence is one of our key weapons to combat terrorism. Our intelligence agencies are at the front line when it comes to gathering information to uncover would be terrorists. These agencies will receive additional funding to ensure they are well equipped to meet the challenges of the current security environment. The Government will provide $270 million in additional resources for intelligence, mostly for the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and the Australian Secret Intelligence Service. This means more intelligence officers, more checks, and more sharing of information with other intelligence agencies to help the effort to close the net on would be terrorists. We are committing increased funding to upgrade protective security. More plain clothes sky marshals will travel on more international flights to more locations. Protecting our nation's borders is a big part of providing a safe nation. The Government will allocate $150 million, including to develop biometric technology and upgrade visa processing systems to lessen the risks that terrorists get into our country. NA NA Mr Speaker, this Government has provided substantial new funding for a big step up in defence capability and preparedness. Measures in this Budget bring to nearly $40 billion the total amount of additional defence spending since 1996. The Government will provide $132 million for the Australian Defence Force contribution to Iraqi stabilisation and reconstruction. Australia will not cut and run from Iraq. This will continue the deployment through financial year 2004-05. The Government will also provide $20 million for an expected extension of our contribution to the United Nations mission in East Timor. More funding will be provided to ensure that our defence assets including F/A-18 fighter aircraft and Collins Class submarines operate at optimal levels. In this Budget, we will provide for a range of personnel initiatives, including $357 million to improve the quality and access of housing for members of the Australian Defence Force without dependants. AFFORDABLE, HIGH QUALITY NA Mr Speaker, Australians need high quality health services with access for all. Such services need very substantial funding. Since coming to office, this Government has doubled spending on health, from $17 billion in 1996-97 to $35 billion in 2004-05. Recent improvements to Medicare have been announced to provide additional incentives for GPs to bulk bill consultations with children under 16 and concession card holders. Together with the new government rebate on non-hospital costs, these changes represent the single largest improvement to Medicare since its inception. And this Government remains committed to the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate. Tonight I am announcing new measures to help people who find it difficult to control diabetes with injections. The use of new generation insulin pumps allows these people a steady flow of insulin through the day, without the need for injections. Currently the consumables associated with using these pumps cost around $2,400 per year. The Government will provide funding so that the cost for most users will drop to less than $200 per year. This will particularly help children and pregnant women. This Budget also aims to help children who are profoundly deaf who can be assisted by Cochlear implant speech processors. These processors need to be upgraded every few years. Currently there are around 130 children waiting for an upgrade. The Government will provide funding of $8 million over four years to virtually eliminate the current waiting list. It will provide for around 230 upgrades each year thereafter. These measures will help deaf children get quicker access to technology which can change their lives. The Government has a proud tradition of respect for the health and welfare erans. The Budget includes a significant increase in funding of $158 million, so that veterans on gold and white cards are able to see specialists when they need to. SCHOOLS-INVESTING IN THE NEXT NA Mr Speaker, in this Budget we are making another substantial investment in our schools. This builds on the reforms and additional funding announced last year for higher education. Over the next four years, the Government will increase funding for schools by over $8 billion to $32 billion. This will provide additional funding for both government and non-government schools. Our substantial increase is conditional on States agreeing to national standards designed to help students and to assist parents. Parents have every right to know how their child is doing at school. All schools will be required to make information about their performance public. This may include average academic outcomes, improvements on previous years, school leaver destinations, teacher qualifications, staff retention rates and absentee rates. The Government will work with State and Territory Governments and local communities to develop a National Values Framework in schools. To assist with this I am announcing tonight that $35 million will be provided for values, civics and citizenship initiatives in our schools. Every school in Australia will receive an average of $1,600 to conduct forums with students, parents, and teachers on values and to educate children about things like the dangers of drugs. We hope every Australian child will learn of the damage that drugs will do to them. INVESTING IN AUSTRALIA'S of our vetINFRASTRUCTURE-AUSLINK Mr Speaker, the provision of quality physical infrastructure is crucial to increasing efficiency and productivity in the economy. In this Budget, the Government introduces a new land transport infrastructure programme called AusLink. Over the next five years, $3.1 billion will be provided to upgrade Australia's road and rail system. This is on top of the $5.6 billion in base funding which covers the National Highway System and Roads of National Importance like the Scoresby Freeway. The additional funding includes $810 million over three years redirected from the Fuel Sales Grants Scheme as announced in January. With a vibrant and growing economy, the the fast movement of freight is paramount. To assist in this task, the Government will pay $450 million in June this year to the Australian Rail Track Corporation so it can upgrade its network of rail track. This will allow work like straightening the track lines from Northern New South Wales to Brisbane to allow faster movement of freight, with wide ranging benefits for producers. In January this year, the Government announced the extension, for four years, of the Roads to Recovery programme costing $1.2 billion. This funds local roads and it is appreciated by local residents. Taken together, this significant new investment will position Australia to cope with an expected doubling of the land freight task over the next 20 years. NA NA Mr Speaker, the carers who look after those with disabilities are unsung heroes. Carer Payment is paid to those on low incomes who provide constant care for a disabled person or child. Carer Allowance is paid to those who live with and provide daily care and attention to a person with a disability. We deeply value the work that these people do. Tonight I announce that around 80,000 people on Carer Payment will receive an additional one-off payment of $1,000. Around 300,000 recipients of Carer Allowance will receive a payment of $600 before 30 June. These people are devoted to those who need help to look after themselves. We can afford to pay it, they deserve it and it will cost million. At the moment, carers who do not live with the person they are caring for are not eligible for the Carer Allowance. The Government will change this. $107 million will be allocated from 1 April 2005, to enable carers who provide substantial levels of personal care per week, but who do not live with the recipient, to receive the payment. This will benefit an additional 13,000 carers. Carers are on duty all the time. They give of themselves in a selfless way in demanding circumstances. Recognising this, the Budget includes $99 million to expand the access of carers to respite. Ageing parents who care for adult children will be entitled to up to four weeks respite a year. We will ask the States to match funding for this initiative. INVESTING IN AUSTRALIA'S AGED NA Mr Speaker, as the population ages, the viability and the level of services in the aged care sector needs to be expanded. Acknowledging this, the Government tonight announces a massive new investment of $2.2 billion to the aged care sector to ensure it is able to continue to provide affordable and quality aged care for the increasing number of older Australians. A new payment will be introduced conditional on providers meeting certain conditions. That will mean that the average care subsidy provided by the Government will increase from $30,500 per year for each resident to $35,000 by 2007-08. $101 million will be provided for more trained nurses, for 15,750 vocational education and training places, and for 400 new undergraduate nurse places in 2005. Additional funding from 2006 will increase the number of aged care places to 108 for $255 every 1,000 Australians aged 70 years or over. So that providers can expand and improve facilities, maximum accommodation charges for new high-care residents will be raised to $16.25 per day. The Government will provide a corresponding increase in supplements on behalf of the financially disadvantaged residents so they will have to pay no additional cost. But the change will deliver an additional $439 million in capital funding to the sector. And further, tonight I am announcing a oneoff payment to all providers of $3,500 per resident to be made before 30 June this year. Costing more than half a billion dollars, this measure will inject immediate capital to enable safety and building standards for aged care homes to be improved. NA NA Mr Speaker, we are aware of the profound economic and social impact the drought has had over the last two years. In some areas recovery is underway, while in others the drought continues. The Government will continue to provide support to drought affected farmers with assistance which includes income support and interest rate subsidies. The Government expects to provide around $1.1 billion in direct drought assistance to farmers and their communities over the four years from 200203. And in a measure to support Australia's wine industry, tonight I announce a tax rebate of $290,000 in Wine Equalisation Tax for every wine producer on an annual basis. This initiative will particularly support small wine producers with domestic sales. It will replace cellar door rebates and reduce tax on the industry by $338 million. This measure will effectively exempt 90 per cent of Australia's wine producers from the Wine Equalisation Tax. NA Mr Speaker, a big part of our resilient economy is our resilient small business. To reduce the compliance burden on small business, tonight I am announcing measures which will allow small businesses below the registration threshold and voluntarily registered for GST to report and pay GST annually, instead of quarterly. These measures will benefit 740,000 small businesses and 30,000 non-profit organisations that are voluntarily registered rently pay on a monthly or quarterly basis. Since all GST is received by the approval of these changes will be required. The Government will offer to compensate the States for the revenue deferred in this measure at a cost of $330 million in 2004-05. NA Mr Speaker, the outlook for the Australian economy is for continued growth, increasing employment and low inflation. A stronger world economy this year should rebalance our growth from domestic to external sources. In year-average terms, GDP growth is forecast to moderate slightly from 3¾ per cent to 3½ per cent. The recovery in farm production will continue, if there is a return to average seasonal conditions. Unemployment in 2004-05 is forecast to remain near 23-year lows. The combination of strong growth, low inflation and low unemployment puts Australia at the forefront of the economies of the developed world. But we cannot rest. We cannot take this for granted. We must build on the work of the past to face the challenges of the future. This is a Budget of reform. This Budget contains initiatives carefully coordinated to meet the challenges for families, for our ageing population, for retirement incomes, and to improve incentives with a better tax structure. I commend this Budget to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Latham) adjourned. BUDGET PAPERS 2004-05",75

NA AMENDMENT (MORE HELP FOR FAMILIES-ONE-OFF PAYMENTS) BILL 2004 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Anthony, and read a first time. Second Reading",84
121,Mr ANTHONY,FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The measures contained in this bill and another bill to be introduced tonight represent the largest package of assistance for families ever. The measures will provide very substantial increases in the level of financial support to families with dependent children as well as giving better rewards from paid work. They will help families balance their work and family responsibilities. The bills underpin the government's More Help for Families package announced by the Treasurer tonight. The package provides additional assistance for families with dependent children of more than $19.2 billion over five years. The 2004-05 budget measures build on the government's family tax initiative in 1996 and the increased assistance which formed part of A New Tax System in 2000. Compared to the situation in 1996, total assistance to families from this government has increased by over $6 billion a year. However, the measures contained in these bills go further. They provide major increases in assistance to help families raise their children. They provide better rewards from paid work and will help families balance their work and family responsibilities. This bill will provide three one-off payments that will generally be paid in June 2004. The first one-off payment, of $600 per child, is to families. Eligibility for the new payment will be linked to: - receipt of family tax benefit part A on budget night for Centrelink instalment customers; - a confirmed entitlement to family tax benefit part A on budget night in respect of the 2002-03 income year for lump sum claimants through the Australian Taxation Office and Centrelink; and - receipt by parents and nominees of dependent youth allowance for 16to 17year-old children on budget night. The second one-off payment, of $1,000, is to recipients of carer payment on budget night. The third one-off payment is to recipients of carer allowance on budget night, payable as an amount of up to $600 for each eligible carer receiver. These payments will be credited directly to customers' bank accounts without the need for a formal claim process. In addition, an administrative scheme will be established to pay families who did not meet the criteria already noted for the oneoff child payment on budget night but who subsequently have a confirmed entitlement to family tax benefit part A for the 2003-04 income year on reconciliation. No-one eligible for family tax benefit part A in the 2003-04 income year will miss out on the lump sum one-off payment. - Guidelines will be established by the Minister for Family and Community Services to enable payments from this scheme. - The fund will have a sunset clause of three years. The bill contains provisions to ensure that the one-off payments will be exempt from tax and will not be included as income for the purposes of the social security law. As a broad principle, there will be no debts arising from these one-off payments. A debt would only arise in relation to one of the proposed one-off payments where some or all of the payment was incorrectly paid because an individual knowingly made a false or misleading statement or knowingly provided false or misleading information. The measures included in the first bill demonstrate the government's firm commitment to assisting families with raising their children and will cost $2.2 billion in 200304. Together with other measures announced in the budget tonight, the government has recognised the substantial contribution made by carers in providing care for people with disability or severe medical condition. The one-off payment to carers will cost lion in 2003-04. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill. Debate (on motion by Ms Gillard) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT (MORE HELP FOR FAMILIES-INCREASED PAYMENTS) BILL 2004 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Anthony, and read a first time. Second Reading",85
122,Mr ANTHONY,FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The measures contained in this bill and another bill introduced tonight represent the largest package of assistance for families ever. The measures will provide very substantial increases in the level of financial support to families with dependent children as well as giving better rewards from paid work. They will help families balance their work and family responsibilities. The bills underpin the government's More Help for Families package announced by the Treasurer tonight. The 2004-05 budget measures build on the government's family tax initiative in 1996 and the increased assistance which formed part of a new tax system in 2000. However, the measures contained in these bills go further. They provide major increases in assistance to help families raise their children. They give better rewards from paid work and will help families balance their work and family responsibilities. Compared to the situation in 1996, total a assistance to families from this government will increase by over $6 billion a year with $255 milpassage of this legislation. This bill contains a number of important measures to improve the rewards from paid work and to help families balance their work and family responsibilities. The changes to family tax benefit part A and family tax benefit part B provide extra cash for families and improve rewards from work, especially for families on low or middle incomes and for mothers returning to work after having children. When the government came to office, families on average earnings faced effective marginal tax rates in excess of 80 per cent. The introduction of a new tax system saw these effective marginal tax rates reduced significantly. The measures in this bill will reduce them further. The specific measures contained in the bill are: - An ongoing increase in the maximum and base rates of family tax benefit part A of $600 per child, payable as a lump sum when families lodge their tax returns for the 2003-04 income year and later years. - As well as providing extra assistance to families, this lump sum will be available, if required, to offset any family assistance overpayment that may have occurred during a previous income year. - A reduction in the rate at which family tax benefit part A is withdrawn from the maximum rate to the base rate, from 30c in the dollar to 20c in the dollar. - The lower taper rate will apply from 1 July 2004. - An increase in the amount of income a secondary earner in a partnered relationship can earn before entitlement to family tax benefit Part B is affected, from $1,825 to $4,000. This measure will apply from 1 July 2004. - A reduction in the rate at which family tax benefit Part B is withdrawn, from 30c in the dollar to 20c in the dollar, from 1 July 2004. - The two proposed changes to family tax benefit part B mean that secondary earners in families with a child under five will be able to earn $18,600 before losing entitlement to family tax benefit part B. Families with a child over five will be able earn $14,184 before losing entitlement to family tax benefit part B. - The financial cost of the family tax benefit changes is around $14 billion. - The bill also provides further help for those balancing work and family responsibilities by the introduction of a new maternity payment. The new payment of $3,000 will be payable as a lump sum to all mothers, regardless of income, from 1 July 2004. The maternity payment will increase to $4,000 in July 2006 and $5,000 in July 2008. - The new maternity payment will replace the current (means tested) maternity allowance and the baby bonus. The baby bonus scheme will be closed to new claims after 30 June 2004 but existing claimants' entitlements will be maintained for up to five years. - As the new maternity payment will be non-means tested, provisions are included in the bill to ensure that maternity immunisation allowance is not means tested and is payable for all children who meet current immunisation requirements. - The financial cost of introducing the new maternity payment is $2.5 billion over four years. The measures contained in this bill will provide significant additional assistance to families. The government has taken significant steps to improve rewards for working families since coming to office. The measures contained in this bill add to this in a major way. Since 1996, the amount of assistance through family tax benefit part A and its predecessors will have increased by over 100 per cent in real terms with the inclusion of the additional $600 per child per year provided for in this bill. The measures are also a concrete expression of this government's commitment to assisting families with their to work and family responsibilities. They provide greater choice for families in balancing their work and family responsibilities, through the new universal maternity payment, which will provide extra support for families with a new baby. In addition, the substantial increase in the level of tax-free assistance for families with dependent children in receipt of family tax benefit part A and the changes to the income threshold and withdrawal rates for family tax benefit part B will mean that couple families can increase their level of paid work without losing entitlement to benefits.
