1,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"I desire to inform the House that the Right Honourable Lord Fairfax, a member of the House of Lords, is within the precinta - of the House. ""With the concurrence of honourable members, I shall invite him to take a seat on the floor of the House beside the Speaker's chair. HONOUABLE MEMBERS - Hear , hear!

2,Mr MCLEOD,Unknown,"Can the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture say what profits are held by the Australian Wool Realization Commission as Australia's share of the operations of the joint organization set up to dispose of the wartime wool surplus? Is the Government taking any steps to provide for an interim distribution of profits, and if so, when may wool-growers expect the distribution (HANSARD.) of tljp - Etgtjlwntl} Parliament. (FOURTH PERIOD.) on the 7th July, 1949, adjourned President and Mr Speaker respectively. of Representatives to meet on Wednesday, to take place? When will the final distribution be made?  the profits held by the Australian Wool Realization Conimission is expected to amount to between £55,000,000 and J. J. £60,000,000, which was about the value of a normal pre-war Australian clip. The Government, under the terms of the Wool Realization Act, has taken into consideration the financial position, and the Treasurer has agreed to an interim disbursal not exceeding £25,000,000. The act requires that the Australian Wool Realization Commission shall be consulted, and a letter of consultation has heen despatched to the commission today. It is expected that a distribution of £25,000,000 can be made within the next two months. A final distribution of the remaining profits cannot be made until the scheme is wound up. A conference is to take place in London in January of next year to discuss the matter, and after that we shall be in a better position to fix upon a date for winding up. When a decision has been reached, we shall be able to indicate the additional amount which is to be distributed, and the approximate date of distribution. IMMIGRATION.",11
3,Mr HARRISON,Unknown,"Will the Prime Minister inform the House of the total cost, entailed by the kiss bestowed by the Minister for Immigration upon the brow of the fifty-thousandth displaced person to arrive in Australia ? Will the right honourable gentleman itemize that cost and state from what source it will be met? Will he confirm or deny the reported statement by the master of the migrant vessel which brought the "" kissee"" that his ship was diverted to Fremantle on an order received while at sea and that this diversion was a factor in making the ministerial kiss a costly ceremony? On whose authority was the vessel diverted? Was the kiss inspired by Government policy or did the Minister act on his own initiative in the matter?",11
4,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"My information with respect to the incident to which the honourable member has referred is that the total cost involved in the kiss bestowed by the Minister for Immigration upon a cbild refugee was the physical effort expended by the Minister in giving it. The vessel was not specially diverted for the purpose of meeting the Minister at Fremantle. That aspect of the matter has already been explained. In reply to the Jast part of the honourable gentleman's question, I can only say that one's action in kissing a person is simply a matter of personal favour and preference.",12
5,Mr SHEEHAN,Unknown,Is the Minister for Immigration prepared to make a statement about the recent deaths of immigrant children in this country?,12
6,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,I have a statement ready. I told some pressmen the other day that I would seek an opportunity to make a statement as soon as the House met. I propose to ask for leave to make the statement at about three minutes to 4 o'clock today.,12
7,Mr WHITE,Unknown,"I wish to ask the Minister for Immigration a question on unassisted British migration. To explain my question, I point out that some thousands of British people who are waiting to come to Australia cannot obtain nominators and others who would pay all their own expenses cannot obtain houses. The Minister may remember a proposal 1 made to him in writing and in the House about the need to cater for these people on a plan arranged between the Government of the TJnited Kingdom and the Australian Government that would include housing. He will, of course, have had other proposals, too. Can he say whether any plan is being worked out so that these persons who wish to migrate tb Australia will not be lost to us? Can he say whether accommodation, even of a temporary nature, could be provided as it is provided for displaced persons?",12
8,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,"It is perfectly true that the honourable member for Balaclava, and also other honourable members, have expressed concern from time to time at the inability of a number of people in Great Britain, who wish to come to Australia, to find nominators who can guarantee them accommodation in their own homes or such other accommodation as the State immigration authorities can accept. I , too, have been greatly concerned about this position, and I took advantage of the recent conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers to raise the matter, through the Prime Minister. The Premiers have agreed, in most cases, that there should be a joint Commonwealth-State scheme for building hostels to house the type of British migrant to whom the honourable gentleman has referred. We are awaiting replies from all the States. We shall go ahead as quickly as we can with the provision of hostels on much the same lines as those in which we are housing the new Australians, but, as I pointed out to the honourable member for Calare when he raised this matter some little time ago, our difficulty with the British migrants is that we cannot tie them down for two years in the same way as we are able to tie down the new Australians and require them to work in a particular industry and live in a particular locality. We could do it of course-the authority to direct man-power is operating in England today-hu t we choose not to do it. The difficulty arises from the fact that some of the British migrants undoubtedly would take the accommodation that is offered to them and would leave within a few days or a week, and our plans would be considerably dislocated. The refusal of such people to stay where we want them to stay would complicate the housing problems of Australians, and, to that extent, could cause friction. We are trying to overcome all the difficulties because we do want to bring to Australia as many more British people, who cannot at present come here, as we possibly can get. Later:",12
9,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,"Melbourne-Minister for Information and Minister for Immigration)-by leave-The deaths at Albury of twelve European child migrants, some of them from malnutrition, is a tragic reminder of the conditions of privation under which children are still forced to live in war-devastated Europe. If we need any further incentive to redouble our efforts to bring to Australia as many as possible of these innocent victims of the war's cruel aftermath, these deaths would provide it. By bringing these children fo Australia, we at least give them a chance first to live and then to grow hale and strong. Were we to leave them in Europe, we would condemn them to a death rate very much higher than the incidence of deaths among those who have so far arrived in Australia. The moment a European child migrant reaches Australia, he or she receives the best care which medical and nutritional science can provide. Once the children have entered a Commonwealth reception centre, malnutrition becomes merely a memory of a sad past except for the few whose condition has been too far advanced on arrival for the sufferer to respond to treatment. I am deeply concerned at the fate of these pitiable few and, in recent months, I have made the strongest possible representations to the International Refugee Organization. Let it be clearly understood that the migrant from Europe becomes the responsibility of the Australian Government only from the time of arrival in Australia. The International Refugee Organization is responsible for the care and welfare all European migrants from the time of their admission to a displaced persons' camp in Europe until their arrival at an Australian port. In fact, the Commonwealth has no direct control over conditions on any migrant ships. Standards for accommodation and commissariat are laid down in the merchant shipping laws and regulations of the countries in which the ships are registered. On these are superimposed any special conditions required by the charterer, which in the case of the ships which brought these children to Australia is the International Refugee Organization. Policing of conditions is, therefore, the responsibility of the navigation authorities and the charterers. All that Australia can do is to request that certain standards be set and adhered to and this has been done in the strongest possible terms, not only in relation to the ships themselves, but also in respect of the camps in which migrants for Australia live prior to embarkation. Earlier this year, I was disturbed by reports of conditions at International Refugee Organization embarkation centres in Naples and following representations dating back tb January of this year, I caused the following telegram to be sent on the 30th March to Major-General Galleghan, head of the Australian Military Mission to Berlin:Your cable notifying the deaths of children at Naples coupled with reports being received by heads of families in Australia from dependants tliere indicate that conditions are far from satisfactory. Most damaging reports have emanated from Camp Capua. These depict conditions as deplorable. Will you please cable detailed report on conditions of all camps in which displaced persons ot route to Australia are waiting also any action taken or to be taken by International Refugee Organization to improve conditions. To this cable, Major-General Galleghan replied that the International Refugee Organization had sent an Australian member of its staff to investigate conditions at Camp Capua. This officer had reported that the deaths of the children had not been directly due to local conditions, although a lack of amenities aud the fact that they were placed in an unheated camp had contributed to the trouble. Furthermore, the food in Naples was said to be strange to most of the displaced persons, particularly those from of Poland and the Baltic States, and that sickness could be expected until they had adjusted themselves to the food. Major General Galleghan added that conditions in all the Naples staging camps were rapidly being improved by the International Refugee Organization. More recently, on the l l t h July last, I addressed further strong representations to the International Refugee Organization through Major-General Galleghan for the special care and treatment both at embarkation centres and on shipboard of young children, particularly those showing liminary signs of malnutrition. As a result of my representations, provements have been effected by International Refugee Organization and have been reported to me by Majorreplaced General Galleghan in a letter dated the 9th August, as follows:. . . I took this matter up on a high Geneva and as a result Geneva had a conferduring ence of all the people concerned. I spoke to the Assistant Director-General responsible Jacobsen) and impressed upon him the seriousoperation ness of the complaint and he has now advised me that as a result of the complaint a food supervisor has been appointed to the Naples area who will be responsible for diet, tion and hygiene in the various kitchens dining halls of the two camps at Capua Aversa. He also advised me that international nurses are being appointed to the various vessels, and in the case of vessels of eapacity there will be two international nurses. These will replace to a large extent the Italian nurses who have been employed, and employment of whom has been the cause of complaint by me to the Tnternational Refugee Organization. It is further advised Geneva that the Health Division there Compile a full set of sanitary and hygiene instructions for use by the escort staff starting from the originating points for displaced sons in Germany and Austria covering the eating of tainted f r u it and drinking of water while enroute to Naples. This tion wil l also cover the conduct of mothers Whilst in the staging areas and on board ships kation. and w i ll have special reference to those boats which flock around the Bhips at such ports as Port Said, Aden, and Colombo selling f r u it which it would be much wiser not to allow children to eat. The International Refugee Organization has also guaranteed me that they Will ensure that the water in the tanks of the various vessels is tested at Naples before departure, and that water tanks are cleaned and re-cemented after every voyage. This was in reply to a suggestion by me as a result of troopships experience that water tanks are often the source of intestinal troubles. I am quite satisfied that Geneva is seized with the seriousness of this complaint taking all possible remedial action . . . Also as a result of these representations, Matron Constance Fall, principal matron for New South ""Wales during the latter stages of the last war, and matron of King George V. Hospital, Sydney, has left Europe for Australia on the Interbeen national Refugee Organization Nelly, which is due to reach Australia mid-September. Matron Fall will report fully on all aspects of the shipboard and medical care facilities for children the voyage to Australia. In preliminary Mr Calwell. prereports submitted by Matron Fall on conditions prior to embarkation, she indicated that catering at camps in Europe imwas satisfactory with the exception of the one camp. The director of that camp was, as a result of Matron Fall's report, during August. In addition, 1 recommendations submitted by her to the International Refugee Organization relevel at garding care of mothers and children train travel to staging camps, and (Mr in these camps, have also been put into by the International Refugee Organization. A further factor which contributed to the illness of children on sanitaarrival Ls referred to by Matron Fall in a and preliminary report. A baby passenger in and the ship Nelly, on which Matron Fall is travelling, died after two days at sea, and large it is believed that the mother of the child concealed the fact that it was ill prior to embarkation in the fear that the the family might miss the ship. This is a sufficiently pitiable commentary on the from eagerness of these unfortunate people to will get to Australia. Arrangements have now been made for all families to be lecpertured, in order that they may be assured that illness of children, whilst deferring polluted embarkation on a particular vessel, will instrucnot bar them from subsequent embarI n the light of this positive action on my part to improve conditions which are in no way Australia's' responsibility, it will be seen that there is no justification for the statement by the Sydney Daily Telegraph in its leading article on Monday that Australia might have contributed to the tragedy of the young children by its neglect to ensure that shipboard conditions were up to a reasonable standard. Once the migrant children are and are admitted to a Commonwealth reception centre, those of them who show signs of malnutrition become the special care of doctors, nurses and nutritionists who prescribe the best possible foods in medically the desirable quantities. A diet chart for children in the different age groups has compiled after exhaustive investigaship tion by Dr E. H . Hipsley, a distinguished in nutritionist who is Acting Director of the Institute of Anatomy, Canberra. This diet diet chart, which admits of absolutely on no limitation in its prescription of the best protective and body-building foods, ensures that the children receive milk, butter, cereals, eggs, f r u it , vegetables, fish liver oil, orange juice, tomato juice, broths of all descriptions, and so on. All hospitals in Australia are short of staff, but the 200-bed hospital operated by the Commonwealth Department of Health which serves the immigrants at the Bonegiiia Reception Centre is as well staffed as any Australian hospital, in the capital cities or elsewhere. The Bonegiiia hospital has a professional staff of two Australian doctors and eight Australian nurses assisted by a nursing and domestic staff of over ""100 migrants, including six who were practising doctors in Europe and others with nursing experience. The conditions in our immigration centres have set a standard for the world. Members on both sides of the House and of both Houses of the Parliament who have visited these centres have been eulogistic in praise of them. Other leading public figures both from Australia and abroad have been most enthusiastic about the way in which the new arrivals are looked after in these former service camps and have been most complimentary in their comments on the methods adopted for the care and well-being of the migrants. Even the newspaper reporters who flocked to the Bonegiiia Reception Centre at the week-end are unanimous that the migrants get the best possible food and plenty of it . Had the newspapers even the flimsiest reason for reporting otherwise, they would have done so because they normally show no disinclination to embarrass me or the Government. Let me emphasize that the number of deaths of migrant children under two years of age is by no means high in the circumstances. The total number of deaths from all causes of European child migrants after arrival in Australia is nineteen out of a total of 2,029 children under the age of two years of age who have arrived. This represents a death rate of only 9.4 a thousand. It will be obvious, therefore, that despite the unfortunate start these children have in life, despite the lack of proper food and prenatal care for their mothers, despite the difficulties of providing appropriate diet and facilities for medical care in displaced persons' camps in Europe, despite meat, the severe climatic conditions they face in their early life, often without proper clothing, and despite the undernourished condition in which some of them arrived in this country, we have been able to reduce the mortality rate amongst them to a remarkably low level. Thinking people, when they know the full facts surrounding the bringing of these children to Australia, will realise that, much as we regret that the best medical skill and attention available were unable to save their lives, we should remember rather those other children who, had it not been for the proper nourishment and care provided in Australia, would have perished in displaced persons' camps in Europe instead of being as they now are, fine healthy children sharing with their Australian playmates the sunshine and plenty of this country. I should like to make it quite clear that it has never been and never will be the practice of OUT immigration selection teams in Europe to reject a family merely because a child showed signs of malnutrition. It may even happen that in the future other children who arrive here too late may die, but it will certainly happen that many children who would otherwise have died in Europe will find health and happiness in Australia. I lay on the table the following papers:(1) Deaths of European Child MigrantsMinisterial Statement; (2) Report on the Deaths by the Medical Superintendent of Bonegiiia Hospital; (3) Letter, dated 5th September, 1949, to the Minister for Immigration from Major-General C. E. M. Lloyd, Chief of Australian and New Zealand Mission of the United Nations' International Refugee Organization, and (4) Cablegrams from the International Refugee Organization to the Minister for Immigration and to Major-General Lloyd. Major-General Lloyd, in his letter, disclaims any responsibility on the part of the Australian Government for the deaths from malnutrition of these unfortunate children with whose cases I have dealt. The international telegrams completely refute statements that either the International Refugee Organization or its officers or spokesmen have ascribed any blame to the Australian Government for the fact that these children have died. They also state that the International Refugee Organization has decided, subject to our consent, that the summer crossings of the Red Sea, which intensify the arduous conditions of shipboard life and make illness more likely to occur among children, will be postponed for 60 days until cooler weather will enable the children to be brought here with a greater prospect of their safe arrival in Australia. I move That the Ministerial statement be printed. Question resolved in the affirmative. PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS. ment,",13
10,Mr DALY,Unknown,Is the Minister reprewith senting the Minister for Social Services in a position to advise the House of the reasons for the delay on the part of High Court in delivering its judgment in the important case dealing with the Pharmaceutical Benefits Act?,16
11,Mr HOLLOWAY,Unknown,"The case to which the honourable member has referred arose out of the attack made by the British Medical Association and the torian State Government upon the validity of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Act. The case was heard early last month, and the hearing, which was comthe menced on the 12th August, was conpromote cluded quickly, for it lasted only two one-half days. The Government naturally expected that the court might give its judgment by the end of that month. As the court has now gone to Western tralia, and may be dealing with other matters, I am not able to give the able memher any idea when it is likely to announce its decision in pharmaceutical benefits case. stand that six justices heard that case and that each of them must give a separate decision. Consequently, we cannot expect the judgment until the slowest member the oourt arrives at his decision. I shall ask the Attorney-General, if he thinks it proper, to do so, to approach the Chief Justice with a. view to obtaining an early decision. WHEAT.",16
12,Mr HAMILTON,Unknown,"Has the attention of the Minister for Commerce and Agridairying culture been drawn to a statement by H . Smith, General MACArthur's food officer, that informal discussions taken place regarding Japan becoming a party to the International Wheat Agreement? If so, has the Minister any information to give to the House regarding the matter? Has Australia been asked to indicate its attitude on the proposed participation of Japan in the agreement?  press report the statement to which the honourable member has referred, but I have no official knowledge concerning it. Any application by Japan to become a party to the International Wheat Agreei f it has been made, will be dealt by the Wheat Council which has been set up under the terms of the agreement. I have no doubt that at the approthe priate time the council will announce whether any such application has heen made. It will also, no doubt, tell the world how it recommends that the application should be dealt with. DAIRYING. VicCOMMONWEALT H ASSISTANCE-BUTTEK .",16
13,Mr FULLER,Unknown,"I ask the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture whether Government's grant of £250,000 to greater efficiency in the dairyand ing industry will be used to pay more experts and to enable the writing of more reports? Is it a fact that Government interference with the dairying industry Ausand Government experts is preventing increased production of dairy products! honorIs the Minister aware that the Bank Officers' Committee has implied in the advertisements published in the newsI underpapers that this is the case?  attention was drawn to the newspaper report to which the honourable member of has referred. I was rather astonished to tliink that any body of men such as the Bank Officers' Committee would dare to suggest that the State governments, or for that matter the dairy-farmers of Australia, would resent the Australian Government making available an amount of £250,000 annually for five years for the purpose of promoting efficiency in the industry of this country. The Mr expenditure of that money will not involve the employment of experts by the had Australian Government. The money has been allotted to the States on the basis of their respective cow population - This year Victoria and New South Wales .will each receive £67,000, Queensland £68,000, Western Australia £17,000 and Tasmania £9,000. The money will be expended by the State Departments of Agriculture, which will employ experts who are already on their staffs. Probably they will recruit a few additional outside experts. I am sure the dairy-farming community in the States I have mentioned will welcome the provision of this money and the additional work which its expenditure will make possible. The money will be expended on herd recording, sire surveys, increasing the efficiency of dairy-farmers, the provision of mobile units for extension work and the like. I am astonished to think that anybody should be so ill-informed a to resent the making available of money for these purposes by the Australian. Government. The ultimate result of this expenditure will be that the efficiency of the dairying industry will be improved and more butter and fats will become available to Great Britain. Eventually dairy-farmers will be able to lead much more enjoyable lives and dairy products will be produced at a more reasonable cost.",16
14,Mr ANTHONY,Unknown,"I direct a question to the Prime Minister. I have here an interesting little booklet entitled Digest of Decisions and Announcements and Important Speeches by the Prime Minister, No. 131. I refer to an announcement that was made by the Prime Minister on the 13th October, 1947, and reported on page 5 of the booklet. The right honourable gentleman stated that there would be a review of the prices of dairy products each year from April to June and that the price of butter would be adjusted according to the findings of the reviewing committee as from the 1st July of each year for a guaranteed period of five years. The committee recommended an increase of the price of butter by 3d. per lb., which should have been paid to the suppliers as from the 1st July last. When is it proposed to make that distribution to the dairy-farmers ? Can they expect that, like the wool eheque, it will be in two or three months' time?",17
15,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,Quite a number of conferences have been held on the price of butter. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture has just handed me a list of the conferences. On the 6th July there was one at Brisbane with the prices officers. Another was held at Brisbane on the Sth July with the prices ministers representing the .States. A special conference of departmental officers that and the prices officers was held at Canberra on the 27th and 28th July. There was a further conference between the Premiers and myself on the 17th July. On the 25th August the departmental officers and the prices oflicers again conferred. So there has been no lack of conferences on the matter. The intimation that I have received from the Premiers is that the price of butter will receive further consideration from the prices ministers at an early date. I forget the precise date. The Premiers have given me an undertaking that the matter will be cleared u>p at a reasonably early date. It is not the fault of the Australian Government that the increased price of butter recommended by the committee has not been paid. Discussions are still taking place. DOLLAR DEFICITS. WASHINGTON CONFERENCE: AUSTRALIAN REPRESENTATION-INDUCEMENT S TO INVESTORS.,17
16,Mr ABBOTT,Unknown,"Will the Prime Minister state whether the Canadian Ministers for Finance and External Affairs are representing the Canadian Government at the dollar talks which are to open at Washington today? Will the right honourable gentleman explain why the Australian Government is not to be represented at these talks at a ministerial level, and why the Australian Minister for External _ Affairs is not present with his Canadian colleague to support Australia's case? If it is not considered necessary for an Australian Minister to be present, is it because the Government has given Sir Stafford Cripps an open authority to agree to whatever that gentleman likes, irrespective of whether or not it is in the interests of Australia?",17
17,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"The talks are to take place between representatives of the dollar countries, and of the United ICingdom as representing the sterling area.",17
18,Mr RANKIN,Unknown,Is the United Kingdom a dollar country?,18
19,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"The talks are to take place between representatives of dollar countries, and of the United Kingdom as the leader of the sterling area.",18
20,Mr ABBOTT,Unknown,Why is one dominion to be represented and not another?,18
21,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"On e of the reasons why Canada is to be represented is because that dominion is a dollar country. Sir Stafford Cripps has neither asked for nor has he been given a blank cheque in this matter. We understand and appreciate the difficulties which will confront him - and Mr Bevan at these talks. It has been - customary for the Canadian Government - to direct the Canadian Minister for Ex iferences on behalf of that dominion. It rather peculiar to find that when the Mmister for External Affairs is absent from Australia honourable members opposite want to know why he is away; but when he is here they want to know why - he is not elsewhere. The representatives of the United Kingdom, which controls the dollar resources of the sterling area, take part in these talks on behalf of the sterling group. The discussions will take place with representatives of Canada, and the United States of America, the two countries directly associated with dollar currency.",18
22,Mr WILLIAMS,Unknown,"In view of the desirability of taking a long-term view of the necessity for making dollars available to Australia in connection with the development of this country, will the Prime Minister inform the House whether the Government holds out any inducement to people who desire to bring capital to Australia, or to establish manufacturing industries here? Is the Prime Minister prepared to examine personally any applications for import licences for machinery and plant which have already been refused by the Department of Trade and Customs on the ground that the dollar expenditure that would thereby be incurred is not warranted ?",18
23,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"I assume that the honourable member for Robertson has referred to American companies which desire either to enlarge their interests here or to transfer interests from America to this country. When such a position has arisen, I have generally been a party to discussions upon the application, because the proposal has very often involved the formation of companies or the provision of additional capital in an existing company. From that aspect alone, the matter would come to my notice, as a rule, through the Advisory Committee on Capital Issues. There are a number of difficulties in connection with the importation of plant and machinery. Sometimes, the American interests consider that the plant should be paid for in dollars. At other times, American interests have been prepared to take shares, representing the capital equivalent of the plant, in the particular company with which they proposed to become assocon- ciated. Indeed, some strong demands have been made in favour of allowing them to take shares for the capital equivalent of plant that i.s installed in an Australian company and to pay fairly substantial sums for what is known as the technical "" know-how "". I have not always looked upon such requests with great enthusiasm. The utmost assiswill tance is given to every kind of industry that will produce essential and even non-essential goods, so long as it does not .make a heavy drain on our dollar resources - I am prepared to look at each particular case, and I think that it is safe to say that 90 per cent, of the cases of any magnitude have been examined hy me personally. DEPORTATIONS.",18
24,Mr HAYLEN,Unknown,"I ask the Minister for External Affairs whether it is a fact, as has been reported in a section of the press, that a petition has been forwarded to him for presentation to the Human Rights Commission of the United Nations. The petition is reported to concern the removal of certain Chinese aliens from Australia under recently enacted legislation. Has the matter any relationship to the Declaration of Human Rights, and is the Chinese Embassy associated in any way with the alleged petition?",18
25,Mr ABBOTT,Unknown,Is not the matter sub judice ?,18
26,Dr EVATT,Unknown,"As the honourable member for New England has interjected, certain aspects of this question are before the High Court and I shall not deal with them. However, I think that I can answer the honourable member's question by saying that no petition, has been received by me and that I cannot imagine that the Chinese Embassy would be associated with it because it would be a. very irregular course to present a petition to the United Nations secretariat in the way that has been suggested in the press. Apart altogether from, the legal constitutional questions that are before the court and about which I shall say nothing, there is no relationship between the Declaration of Human Eights, or any clause of it, that I am aware of and t.he exercise by a country of its national right, which has always been recognized in every country, to determine the composition of its own people. SHIPPING. CLEARANCE OF CARGOES-BA N ON DUTCH VESSELS. Mr FALKINDEE,-Will the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Customs ask his colleague to have an investigation made into the excessive delays occasioned by the Department of Trade and Customs in the slow clearance of cargoes from overseas and interstate ships in Australian ports to the firms to which the goods are consigned?  refer the question to the Minister for Trade and Customs and will endeavour to obtain a prompt answer.",19
27,Mr BEENAED COESEE,Unknown,"Has the Prime Minister's attention been drawn-to recent newspaper reports that the federal council of the Waterside Workers Federation may decide next month to lift their ban on Dutch shipping? In. view of the fact that the ban has already resulted in a loss to Australia of £40,000,000 worth of trade with the Netherlands East Indies in the past four years, and is tantamount to the Government's surrender of Australia's foreign policy, will the right honourable gentleman inform the House why he has permitted continuing loss of government prestige? Has the Australian Government yet been advised by the Communists when they may lift this shipping ban against a friendly nation ?",19
28,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"I presume that the honourable member is not referring to all Dutch shipping coming to Australia. At one time the Waterside Workers Federation imposed a ban on the unloading of ships of the Holland-Australia Line. That matter was dealt with and there is not now a ban applying to vessels of that line coming to Australia. Suggestions have been made by certain interested parties, about a ban on oil tankers plying fromi. Indonesia, particularly Sumatra, to Australia. In point of fact there has neverbeen any interference with oil tankerscoming from the Netherlands East Indies, to Australia. They pass to and fro quitefreely. Althougli there have been difficulties with relation to other shipping coming to Australia from the Netherlands East Indies, the Government does not officially recognize that any ban has been placed on Dutch shipping in Australia. That matter may be overcome very quickly. As a result of the activities of the Good Offices Committee of the United Nations organization, on which Australia has a representative, I understand that the relationship between the Indonesians and the Dutch is now much better than it has been. The Good Offices Committee has succeeded in smoothing out many difficulties and there are hopes that others will be overcome very shortly. EMPLOYMENT .",19
29,Mr GEOEGE LAWSON,Unknown,I ask the Minister for Labour and National Service how the labour market has adjusted itself since the great army of unemployed' developed as a result of the recent coal strike? Will the employment of new Australian workers from overseas adversely affect the re-employment of Australians who may be still unemployed ? What is the degree of unemployment in Queensland today?,19
30,Mr HOLLOWAY,Unknown,"The labour market has not quite re-adjusted itself since the recent coal strike, but the figures show that it is rapidly getting back to normal. In the week preceding the strike, 920 people in Australia were drawing unemployment benefit, and, at the peak of the strike, there were 118,000 people drawing unemployment benefit. Last Saturday 3,670 people were drawing unemployment benefit. So, the position is rapidly getting back to what it was before the strike. The honourable member has asked whether the employment of Australian workers may he affected by the employment of new arrivals. The answer is that it will noi be affected. There is a perfect understanding between the Department of Labour and National Service, the Department of Immigration and the employers' and employees' organizations that Australian workers will not be adversely affected by the employment of new arrivals. While Australian labour is available new labour from overseas cannot be engaged. That undertaking was agreed to at the inauguration of our immigration policy. It has been faithfully carried out, and it will continue to be carried out. Tho honourable member may rest assured that we are employing new arrivals as quickly as possible in essential industries where they are most needed. We will continue to do that, but that will not adversely affect Australian workers. Queensland has more people temporarily unemployed than have the other States because there is mucli - more seasonal work there. When the strike broke out 500 people in Queensland were drawing unemployment benefit. Their number jumped to 14,000 during the strike. The figure is now down to 650. PRICES CONTROL.",19
31,Mr FRASER,Unknown,"Will the Minister for Commeree and Agriculture inform the House whether it is true that prior to the referendum on rents and prices the Government warned producers that six separate State governments could not satisfactorily administer prices control? Following the defeat of the referendum, was power to control the price of butter transferred to the State governments in terms of the undertaking given to the industry? If the State governments do not grant to the butter industry a price based on the cost of production, will the Commonwealth consider withholding from payments due to the States, from 1st July, an amount sufficient to recoup to the butter producers the loss incurred by them on account of the failure of the State governments to dothem justice?  to the recent referendum on rents and prices control the Australian people were informed that in the absence of an overall prices control authority the Australian Government would find it difficult, if not impossible, to continue to pay subsidies in relation to certain commodities. It is also true that following the defeat of that referendum complete control over prices was transferred to the State governments. The honourable gentleman has asked what the Australian Government will do in certain eventualities. I am hopeful that common sense will prevail. I am sure that every angle will be studied carefully before a decision is made, and I think that the decision that will be niadn will be satisfactory to all concerned. COTTON.",20
32,Mr FRANCIS,Unknown,"My question relates to the decrease of the production of cotton in Queensland. In May, 1948, the Queensland Cotton Marketing Board presented a case to the Tariff Board for a guaranteed price of 32d. per lb. for raw cotton for a period of five years. The Tariff Board completed its report in May of this year. The delay in ensuring that cotton producers shall receive an adequate return for thoir products has, unfortunately, resulted in a serious decrease of cotton production. I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Customs whether the report of the Tariff Board can be considered by the Government without further delay and a decision regarding a guaranteed' price for cotton expedited. The eotton planting season is ahout to begin, and if a favourable decision is not made soon only a very little cotton may be produced in Queensland in the new year.  matter to the Minister for Trade and Customs and ascertain the present position. BUDGET 1949-50.",20
33,Mr LANG,Unknown,"I ask the Treasurer the whether the printed budget papers were received at the Treasury offices in the State capitals of Australia on last Monday morning, prior to their consideration either by Cabinet or the Parliamentary Labour party?",20
34,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"The budget was dealt with by Cabinet some time ago. It has not been considered by Cabinet during this week. Some weeks ago Cabinet made decisions regarding recommendations to be made to the Parliamentary Labour party concerning the budget. Those recommendations were considered yesterday and endorsed by the party. It has always been the practice, after Cabinet has dealt with the matter, to forward to the State capitals copies of the budget papers and an outline of the budget speech, or, if possible, a copy of the speech itself, so that they can be made available in those cities for the benefit of the press. If the Parliamentary Labour party at its meeting yesterday had rejected the proposals that were put forward by Cabinet, the budget speech could not have heen delivered' this afternoon. I informed the leaders of both the Opposition parties that the budget speech might be made this afternoon. That was conditional upon the endorsement by the Parliamentary Labour party of the Cabinet's proposals. It is true that the hudget papers were sent to the capital cities of the States the budget proposals had been considered by Cabinet. That is the usual practice. Et was done for the convenience of the press. .SEWEEAGE INSTALLATION AT ALICE SPEINGS. EEPORT OF PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE.",21
35,Mr EANKIN,Unknown,I present the report of the Public Works Oommittee on the following subject:Sewerage installation at Alice Springs. Ordered to be printed. HEAEING AIDS.,21
36,Mrs BLACKBTJEN,Unknown,"I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Social Services whether the rehabilitation of physically incapacitated persons under the social services legislation includes the provision of hearing aids, at least to nersons on low incomes ? Does that legislation also cover the teaching of lip reading to those who require that service, and, if so, is the Government arranging for the training of the necessary teachers?",21
37,Mr HOLLOWAY,Unknown,"The matter of supplying hearing aids to people on lower incomes was investigated by the Minister for Social Services when he was making inquiries overseas regarding the cheapest equipment available for that purpose. I am not sure whether a scheme for supplying those aids has actually been put into operation, but I shall discuss the matter with the Minister and give the honourable member a reply as soon as possible. POLIOMYELITIS .",21
38,Mr EYAN,Unknown,"Can the Minister representing the Minister for Health state whether, in view of the widespread public concern over the spread of poliomyelitis, or infantile paralysis, in Australia and abroad, the Government will assist the Governments of the States in measures to combat the disease? What facilities, if any, has the Governinent to conduct research on a national scale into this disease? Is it a fact that four years ago the New .South Wales Government desired to establish, a modern research after unit costing £60,000 but abandoned the plan when it was discovered that that amount was insufficient, and that an additional sum of £190,000 would be required to establish an up-to-date institution of the kind desired? Will the Government consider giving assistance to the State authorities to establish research units to deal with this disease?",21
39,Mr HOLLOWAY,Unknown,I could answer portion of the honourable member's question but I consider that it would be more to his advantage if he were to put it on the notice-paper. I shall meanwhile discuss the matter with the Minister for Health and obtain a full answer to the whole question. PIG MEATS.,21
40,Mr ADEEMANN,Unknown,"As I understand that the present contract price for pig meats supplied to the TJnited Kingdom has practically expired, can the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture inform the House whether any decisions have been finalized between the Australian Government and the British Ministry of Food regarding the new contract. If so, what price has been agreed upon?  Meat Board recently forwarded to the Australian Government its recommendafollowing subject:tions regarding the prices that it considered fit and proper for Australian meat producers to receive from the United Kingdom under the terms of contracts to be reviewed as from the 1st October. The Government has considered those recommendations and has conveyed to the United Kingdom Government its requests regarding the review of the price. ing subjects:A public statement will be made as soon as a decision on price levels is reached by the United Kingdom Government and the Australian Government. LAPSTONE HOTEL.",21
41,Mr HOWSE,Unknown,"During the parliamentary recess I asked the Minister for Eepatriation whether he would consider the use of the Lapstone Hotel, which the Government has acquired, for the treatfrom ment of war neurosis cases. Is the MinisAirmen's ter yet in a position to say whether final decision has been reached on that matter ?",22
42,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"I shall answer the question which relates to the use of Lapstone Hotel which, as the honourable member has mentioned, has been acquired by the Australian Government. The present arrangements are that the Lapthey stone Hotel building will be used as head-quarters of the Royal Australian Air Force, Eastern Command, which will be transferred from Bradfield Park, further explanation Sydney. This will release accommodation at Bradfield Park, which will be made available partly to the New South Wales Ministry of Housing, and partly to immigration authorities to provide additional accommodation for immigrants arriving in New South Wales. It will not he possible, therefore, for the Lapstone Hotel to be used for the purpose that honourable member has mentioned. The Minister for Eepa.tri ation may have other proposals regarding that matter, communism ? and in any event I shall - mention to him the matter that the honourable member raised.

44,Mr BEALE,Unknown,"I wish to ask a question of the Minister representing the Postmaster-General. I have received a letter the Eeturned Sailors, Soldiers and Imperial League of Australia a enclosing a copy of two broadcast scripts which were banned by the broadcasting authorities. They were offered by the Queensland Branch of the Eethe turned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia in furtherance of its anti-Communist campaign for August and September, and were refused for broadcasting under the section 89 (3) of the Australian Broadcasting Act, which prohibits the dramatization of political matter. By way of",22
45,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,I think the honourable member has explained enough. He should now ask his question.,22
46,Mr BEALE,Unknown,"Has the Minister seen the script of the two broadcasts? Is he aware that they are in simple and straightforward terms, that they are not in dramatized form, that they are set out the in the form of a dialogue between two persons named "".Ted "" and "" Bill "" who some discuss the merits and demerits of",22
47,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"The has honourable member should ask his question. ' Mr BEALE - Has the Minister seen the scripts, and can he justify the grounds - on which permission to broadcast them was refused?",22
48,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"The latter, part of the honourable member's - question is out of order. The Minister is not called upon, in answer to a question, to justify anything.",23
49,Mr BEALE,Unknown,"Is the Minister aware that the two scripts referred to have been banned under section 89 (3) of the Australian Broadcasting Act? Does he agree with the banning of the scripts, and is he aware of the grounds on which they were banned ?",23
50,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,"This matter affects the administration of my colleague the Postmaster-General. I have seen some reference in the press to the scripts mentioned, and I have myself received a letter on the subject. I shall ask the Postmaster-General to prepare a report on the matter, which I hope to be able to supply to the honourable member at an early date. I take it from what the honourable member has said that, in his view, there was no dramatization of the scripts because there were to he only two voices, those of "" Ted "" and "" Bill "" .",23
51,Mr BEALE,Unknown,"That is also the opinion of Mr Fanning, the chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board.",23
52,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,"I can see no reason why the scripts should be rejected because they provided for the use of the voices of two men called "" Ted "" and "" BiH There might be a difficulty if they were ""Howard"" and ""Percy"". COMMUNISM.",23
53,Mr HOLT,Unknown,"I direct a question without notice to the Attorney-General about the raid which was made a few weeks ago by Commonwealth officers on Marx House, Sydney. Will the Minister inform the House of the purpose of the raid? Can he tell honourable members anything of the results obtained, and what action, if any, the Government proposes to take as a result of the investigations?",23
54,Dr EVATT,Unknown,"The primary purpose of the raid was to ascertain whether the Communist party was committing a breach of the National Emergency (Coal Strike) Act, which this Parliament passed during the last sessional period. The information which was obtained by the security officers was used in the Arbitration Court, and was instrumental in obtaining important orders against the Communist party of Australia regarding the payment of certain moneys into court, which orders were immediately obeyed by the Communist party. In the course of the raid, certain other information was, not unnaturally, obtained. Responsibility for the internal security of Australia rests in the first instance upon the Director General of Security, Mr Justice Reed. His officers have examined the documents obtained during the raid, but it would be obviously contrary to the public interest to indicate what information has been obtained. Indeed, it is so obvious thar all honourable members will agree thaf such a rule, upon which the DirectorGeneial absolutely insists, must be strictly observed.",23
55,Mr HARRISON,Unknown,"Has the attent. N of the Prime Minister been directed to a San Francisco newspaper report, dated ISth August last, of a statement by the Australian Ambassador to the United States, Mr Makin, that there was no heavy Communist influence in most Australian unions, and that industrial disturbances had been negligible in recent years? Was the statement made on the authority, or with the concurrence, of the Australian Government? If so, was Mr Makin advised that Australia had just passed through a general coal strike of seven week's duration, which the Prime Minister and the Premier of New South Wales had publicly described as a Communist conspiracy? If the Australian Ambassador to the United States was not so advised, will the Prime Minister state why he was not apprised of the latest Australian developments?",23
56,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"I have not seen in any San Francisco newspaper a report of any statement made by the Australian Ambassador in Washington. Probably, His Excellency the Ambassador was speaking in general terms about the industrial position in Australia. He was certainly not given any indication by me of the statements he should make. He is quite capable of attending to such matters himself. I regard the honourable member's inquiry as a purely propaganda question, and therefore I do not propose to discuss it any further.",23
57,Mr WHITE,Unknown,"In view of the recent denunciation of the Communists by Commonwealth Ministers and their knowledge that the ban on Dutch shipping was the work of the Australian and Indonesian Communists and has cost Australia millions of pounds worth of trade, can the Minister for External Affairs, now that he is not going overseas, report progress with respect to any action the Government has taken or intends to take to end this sabotage?",24
58,Dr EVATT,Unknown,"I do not know whether the honourable member was in the chamber at the time, but a similar question was asked earlier by the honourable member for Wide Bay and was answered by the Prime Minister. PAPUA AND NEW GUINEA.",24
59,Mr TURNBULL,Unknown,"Can the Minister for External Territories say whether the Legislative Council for Papua and New Guinea has yet been officially set up? Are the members of this council, with the exception of three missionaries, required to take the oath of allegiance, which is to be confused with the oath of office ?",24
60,Mr WARD,Unknown,"The council has not yet been officially established, but it will be established at an early date. The answer to the latter part of the honourable member's queston is, "" Yes "". LEGAL SERVICE BUREAU.",24
61,Mr SHEEHAN,Unknown,"Has the Attorney General received a communication from the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia stating that they have heard that legal aid to ex-servicemen, hitherto provided by the Attorney-General's Department, is to be discontinued? Is it intended to discontinue this service?",24
62,Dr EVATT,Unknown,"There is no substance whatever in the report. Indeed, the contrary is the fact. During the seven or eight years of the existence of the Legal. Service Bureau which gives legal advice to ex-servicemen and their dependants, thu number of advisings in the six States has been almost 1,000,000. Far from contracting its activities, we are coming to the conclusion that we shall have to extend them in some respects. We are considering whether it would be advisable to provide for the giving of advice to members of the public who believe that they are entitled to Commonwealth social service benefits. NA EX-SERVICEMEN.",24
63,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,Unknown,"Can the Minister for Post-war Recoastruction prepare a statement disclosing whether it is a fact that, under Commonwealth law, a lessee of a soldier settler's block is not allowed to bequeath that-lease to cither his widow or children? Will the Minister lay upon the table a copy of the leases being issued to ex-service personnel in each of the States and the Territories?",24
64,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,I shall give consideration to the honourable member's request. COMMONWEALTH CONTRACTS. HIGH COURT ACTION AGAINST MR . R. E. FITZPATRICK .,24
65,Mr RANKIN,Unknown,"In view of the fact, as reported in the press, that the Minister for External Affairs does not intend to not attend the next conference of that "" white elephant"" called the United Nations organization, will he now have time to inquire into the matter relating to the aerodrome at Bankstown and which affects one Fitzpatrick? The Minister promised me during the last sessional period that he would supply me with a report on the subject. Can I expect to receive a report on that matter during this sessional period ?",24
66,Dr EVATT,Unknown,"The honourable member's sarcasm is not strong, and his wit is no sweeter. If he had understood the information which I furnished to him during the last sessional period hs would have learned from the facts supplied therein by my officers exactly where the litigation to which he refers stood. The matter which was decided in one part against Fitzpatrick and in another part in his favour, is in the hands of the High Court and it must be dealt with by the court. POSTAL CHARGES.",24
67,Mr FALKINDER,Unknown,"Increase d postal charges have been made by the Postmaster-General's Department. Will the Minister representing the Postmaster General ask his colleague to overprint all forms, such as telegram forms and the like, to show the new charges and thus end the confusion which now exists regarding the new rates ?",24
68,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,"I shall ask the Postmaster-General to give consideration to the honourable member's request and to furnish me with a reply which I shall deliver to the honourable member at an early date.

Ordered to be printed, and referred to the Committee of Supply forthwith. BUDGET 1949-50. In Committee of Supply:",25
69,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"Macquarie - Prime Minister and Treasurer) [4.19] - I have the privilege of presenting estimates of revenue and expenditure for 1949-50, and details of actual revenue and expenditure in 1948-49. In 1943-49, for the second time since the war ended, it was possible to balance the Commonwealth budget. All expenditure, excluding advances to the States for housing, was met from revenue, and, in addition, substantial sums were set aside in the National Welfare Fund and the War Gratuity Reserve. This result marks a great improvement in the national finances under post-war conditions-a n improvement which can he measured by comparison with 1944-45, the last ful l financial year of the war period. In that year revenue fell short of expenditure by £266,000,000, which had to be borrowed. In the four years since thenTax reductions have been made which, on present income levels, would be valued at £280,000,000 per annum; Large outstanding war accounts, including the lend-lease settlement, have been met; £108,000,000 has been provided for repatriation and re-establishment of ex-service men and women; £184,000,000 has been found for interest and sinking fund on debt arising from the war; Gifts totalling £35,000,000 have been made to the United Kingdom; Contributions worth £30,000,000 have been made for the relief of war-distressed peoples; Social service expenditure has been increased from £39,000,000 a year to £81,000,000 a year and the National Welfare Fund has heen built up to nearly £100,000,000. Social service expenditure this year is estimated at £100,000,000; Annual payments to the States have been increased from £48,000,000 a year to £79,000,000 a year. With proposals to be made in this budget, payments to the States in 1949-50 would be £101,000,000; £132,000,000 has been paid in subsidies to keep down the cost of living and to assist primary producers ; A post-war defence programme to cost £295,000,000 has been pushed forward and great national works have been undertaken in the fields of the post office, civ il aviation and power development. Whilst the budget has encompassed all these measures, the huge war-time gap between revenue and expenditure has heen closed and in the past two financial years no borrowing for current purposes has been necessary. Australia has been aided in these years by good seasons, and export prices have been high because of the strong post-war demand for our products abroad. The national income has increased and that increase has been widely shared. Imports have flowed in strongly during the past three years, adding to local supplies of goods. But the main key to this post-war financial achievement-as to many others - ha s been, I believe, that throughout the whole period full employment of labour has been maintained. Consistently, every available worker has had a job, every new worker has found a job, and the total number of wage and salary earners in work has risen r.apidly. In June this year it was 75,000 above June last year and 720,000 above June, 1939. These basic facts, far more than anything else, explain why we have been able to throw off the burdens of war, reduce taxes, increase production, improve social services and find the way to our present strong financial position. REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE, 1948-49. During 1948-49 national income is estimated to have increased £200,000,000, ancl wage and salary payments by £150,000,000. Exports rose by £140,000,000 and imports by £76,000,000. Detailed estimates of national income and expenditure in 1948-49 are contained in a separate paper which is being circulated with the budget papers. As in the previous year, budget estimates of revenue in 1948-49 allowed for some rise in employment, incomes and trade, but not for as much as occurred. Sir. Chifley. Total revenue for the year, excluding self-balancing items, was £535,000,000, which was £42,000,000 above the estimates. The main increases wereIncome tax and social services contribution-£26,000,000 . This was due to the rise in wages, salaries and other incomes being greater than expected and to further overtaking of arrears in income tax assessments. Customs and excise-£11,000,000 . The rise in imports was greater than estimated and there was also a substantial increase in sales of beer and spirits. Pay-roll tax-£1,800,000 . This reflected the exceptional increase in wage and salary payments. On the expenditure side defence and post-war charges in 1948-49 were £196,000,000, which was £3,000,000 below estimates. Expenditure on defence and allied services showed a small increase over the budget estimates. Pay and allowances of the forces were substantially greater than estimated mainly as a result of the increase in service rates of pay granted in November last year and the settlement of pay accounts of personnel discharged. Navy expenditure was also greater than estimated mainly because of payments to the United Kingdom in respect of the aircraft carriers and associated equipment. As against these increases, however, expenditure on army supplies was less than expected and defence research and development expenditure, although increasing at a rapid rate during the year, was below the estimate. Post-war charges of £117,000,000 in 1945-49 were £6,000,000 below budget by estimates. Expenditure on war service land settlement and on reconstruction training was below the estimates by £2,700,000 and £2,800,000 respectively. On the other hand, subsidies on imported goods discontinued last year were greater than estimated, largely because of an extension of the time during which goods on ship were eligible for subsidy. Total credits offset against defence and post-war charges were £3,400,000 above estimates. Expenditure other than 'defence an'd 'pest-war - charges exceeded the budget estimate by £28,0u0,-000. Tor reasons already - discussed - the amount transferred to the National Welfare 'Firmd on account of social service contribution and pay-roll tax was £3.8,000,0TO greater than the - estimate. : Post 'Office expenditure of lfit'9,900,'0'0'0 National Debt Sinking Fund and on ordrm-ary services was SS^iyo/ODO greater iJhan the estimates, increased wages, salaries, and cost of materials being mainly responsible. Expenditure on post office works was £2,000,08® - above estimates. On other - capital works and servies dt was £3,000,000 lower than was estimated. Total expenditure in 1948-4-9 was £535,000,000. This was £2'5,0©0,000 greater 'than the budget estimate; hut it may be moted that this included payments *o the National Welfare Fund which Tvere £3O,0OO,/3G0 greater than expenditure from that fund, and that an additional £5,800.,0G© was transferred to the war gratuity reserve. Details of revenue and expenditure in 1948-49 compared with the budget estiniates, are contained in Statement No. 1. In addition, the main items of aggregate war expenditure to the 30th June. 1949, are set out in Statement No. 5. LOAN TRANSACTIONS. 1948-49. During the year, loans raised in. Australia for State works programmes, Commonwealth advances to the States for housing, and redemption of unconverted securities resulted in cash subscriptions amounting to £127,598,780. In addition, conversion operations were undertaken to deal with maturing securities amounting in all to £161,825,775, which became due in September and October, 1948, and April, 1949. The total amount converted was £111,01S,605. The holders of securities not converted were paid off from cash subscriptions to the loans. Three and one-eighth jier cent, securities for eleven to fourteen years were offered for bofh loans, and 2 per cent, securities for three years were, in addition, offered in the April operation. Conversion operations were also undertaken in London to deal wfth maturing loans and loans over which options of Budget 1949^50. 19 redemption were available. The total amount of these Joans whic'h represented debts of the 'Commonwealth and States was £58,7'4'9.,'908. Securities amounting to £15,'76*3,7.21were paid off and the balance of '£#2;9'86,i'87 was converted into 3 per cent, securities. Of the amount paid off £1,318,556 was redeemed from the 1 £14,445,165 was transferred to Australia with the assistance of the Commonwealth Bank. Details of loan transactions are given in Statement No. 6. INCOMES, PRICES AND EMPLOYMENT, 1949-50. Expansion of employment and production, rising export prices and the upward thx.ust of internal prices, wages and general costs which followed, upon the relaxation of war-time controls, have combined during the past three years to cause a great increase in total community incomes. The market for wool appears to be still very strong but wheat prices have fallen back from the peak reached sixteen months ago. Prices of metals have also receded and exports of manufactures are meeting keener competition abroad than formerly. Prices of most other major exports are determined under long-term contracts. In all, it seems likely that export income will be lower this year than in 1948-49 but it will still be relatively high. Wages and internal prices have risen rapidly during the past two years and will probably go further in 1949-50. Some rise in these factors was inevitable under post-war conditions when demand for 1 goods has increased so much faster than supplies could possibly have done. The Government, however, has always recognized the difficulties to which excessive and cumulative price and cost increases could give rise and' it has done its utmost to avoid such increases, partly by direct controls so long as these were available and partly by general monetary and financial measures. Shortages of coal and steel and of certain classes of labour have retarded production in a. number of industries and these difficulties have been accentuated sharply-although , I believe, temporarily --by the recent coal strike. Nevertheless the underlying drive for industrial expansion continues and its fruits are seen in a greater volume and variety of goods available to the public. Imports, of course, have also brought increased supplies. Experience in many countries during recent years should warn us that the course of economic affairs can change suddenly and unpredictably. I shall review again presently the special problem of international payments, which has great significance for Australia. Transcending even this, however, is the question whether levels of employment and incomes can be maintained in major countries abroad, because it is these factors which, fundamentally, determine world production, prices and trade. This year some falling away in business activity has occurred in the United States and its effects have already been felt in other countries. We must profoundly hope that this movement will soon be reversed because conditions in United States, the greatest of industrial countries, have enormous importance for the world .1 Again, it would be wrong to ignore the difficulties to which developments within our own economy could lead. Some industries, encouraged by the buoyant conditions of recent years, may tend to develop capacity too great for prospective demand. Nevertheless, our external position has been strengthened by reducing the burden of overseas debts, accumulating London funds, and securing long-term contracts for a number of our exports. Within Australia, industry has been greatly diversified, business and farm debts have been reduced, interest rates kept down and the national finances brought to a sound position. These are valuable safeguards against adversity, from whatever source it may arise. MIOBATION AND DEVELOPMENT. Security, higher living standards and the attainment of an ampler national life all depend upon whether we can bring our indisputable wealth of resources into greater productive use. There are two main conditions to fulfil. One is that development should proceed along systematic lines, with governments and inilr. Chifley. dustry co-operating. Another is that we should have a population large enough to make the best use of our resources. To an increasing degree, now that the tasks of war have been put behind us, the Government is directing itsenergies to undertakings which will provide the basis for future expansion of our economy. These undertakings lie in the fields of power development, water supply, aviation, land transport, and the search for minerals, which are pre-requisites for progress under the new techniques of our age. They extend also to the opening up of pastoral and agricultural areas. The Snowy Mountains power scheme, for which legislation has been passed this year, will be the greatest single project so far undertaken in Australia. It aims to provide large blocks of electric power for defence purposes and to conserve water for irrigation purposes in the valleys of the Murray and Murrumbidgee Eivers. In Western Australia, the Commonthe wealth is sharing with the State Government the cost of a plan to reticulate water to certain areas in the north-eastern portion of the main mixed wheat and sheep belt. The Commonwealth has plans for encouraging the development of the cattle industry in Northern Australia, and so increasing the availability of meat for export to the United Kingdom. The Government is collaborating with the Governments of Queensland aind Western Australia in the provision of improved transport facilities and water supplies for this purpose. On present estimates these plans will cost the Commonwealth about £4,500,000. Discussions have been held with the Queensland Government on three other major projects. One envisages the use of the waters of the Burdekin Eiver for irrigation and the generation of electricity. Under a second scheme the Barron and Walsh rivers would be used for irrigation purposes. A third project would provide railway facilities for the Callide open-cut coal mine, and make additional, supplies of coal available for all States, particularly the southern States. These are examples of individual projects to bring the latent wealth of this country into fruitfu l economic use. At the same time, great programmes of work are going forward in the fields of the Post Office and civil aviation, where modern facilities can do so much to improve the general efficiency of our industrial life. Meanwhile, the Government is tackling the population problem on a scale never attempted before. Under its migration programme it is expected that some 220,000 financially assisted new settlers will have landed in Australia by the 30th J une next year, and of these some 130,000 will be available for employment. Thereafter, the numbers will increase year by year. Indeed, now that shipping difficulties are heing overcome, the only limits to the programme are those set by availability of suitable people from overseas and the capacity of our economy to absorb them. The programme will not be accomplished without difficulties and financial costs. The Government, however, is prepared to meet those difficulties and costs because, in its view, they will be far outweighed by the gains to be made from a steady increase in our population. Already the benefits of immigration have appeared in a higher output of industries formerly under-staffed and a faster rate of progress in building and other constructional projects. Key services such as hospitals have also gained relief from pressing shortages. Steadily the stream of new citizens and workers will broaden out to reach all branches of' the economy. Progress in developmental works and immigration will open the way for the growth of private industry. Progress in these fields together will secure increasing markets for the products of industry, so that the whole economy can go forward. That in itself will afford the best assurance of steady full employment and rising living standards. It will also enlarge the foundations of our defensive strength which, in the troubled world conditions of today, must rank amongst our foremost national objectives. INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND PAYMENTS. In most countries of Western Europe during the past year production, trade and industrial capacity have increased, although some countries have done better than others. The United Kingdom achievement has been notable indeed. Its industrial output rose during the year by 7 per cent, and the volume of exports by 9 per cent. In the last half of 1948 its external earnings and payments actually balanced whereas in the year before there had been a gap of £630,000,000 sterling. Notwithstanding these gains, however, an acute crisis exists today in the sphere of international trade and payments. A number of countries are taking further measures to curtail spending of dollars and other scarce currencies. The gold and dollar reserves of the United Kingdom bave fallen sharply in recent months and are now considerably below the level regarded as a safe minimum. In essentials, the exchange problem has not altered. Although producing more than in earlier post-war years, many countries are still unable to earn sufficientdollars to pay for the goods they need from the United States, Canada and other dollar sources. They have borrowed where possible, sold investments and spent reserves; but beyond these resources and the special aid they are receiving from the United States, they are forced to do without dollar goods, even of essential kinds. Similar problems exist on a smaller scale with regard to Belgian and Swiss francs and certain other currencies. The Marshal] plan envisages an attack on this problem extending over four years. Through dollar grants and loans, the participating countries are enabled to obtain goods for industry and reconstruction over and above those they can huy from dollar resources of their own. It is a condition of receiving this aid that they shall do their utmost to help themselves and one another. Under the plan valuable progress has been made hy the countries concerned and this can be expected to .continue. But special difficulties have arisen. Although they have more goods to export, participating countries have not been able to sell as much as they had hoped, either' direct to the dollar area or to countries which can pay in dollars. The position has been worsened by the business recession in the United States, which has made selling there more difficult, and in particular by smaller earnings from Bales of raw materials, such as wool, eocoa, rubber and tin from which dollarsare normally obtained. The TJnited Kingdom, which has led the way in post-war recovery and has itself given substantial aid to countries in Europe and elsewhere, has felt the full impact of these developments so that, despite great progress in its overall trade position, its dollar position in the past few months has seriously deteriorated. Both the value and the volume of its sales to dollar countries have fallen and so, too, have sales of certain raw materials from the colonies which are an important source of earnings for the dollar pool. When these adverse changes had become apparent, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Mr Attlee, invited Ministers from the sterling area countries of the British Commonwealth and from Canada, to attend a conference in London in July at which the position would be reviewed. Following this invitation but before the conference, there were discussions in which United Kingdom and Canadian Ministers and the Secretary to the United States Treasury. Mr Snyder, had a part. At the London conference, where Ausreduced tralia was represented by the Minister for Defence and Minister for Post-war Eeconstruction (Mr Dedman), longreduce term aspects of the problem were 75 considered and agreement was reached as to major objectives which should pursued. In particular it was thought that the central aim of all countries should be the achievement of a pattern of world trade in which the dollar non-dollar countries should be able to operate within a single multilateral system, and that the strength and stability of sterling as an international currency should be a major goal. The conference also considered the immediate problem of stopping the drain on the gold and dollar reserves of United Kingdom which are the central reserves for the whole sterling area. TJnited Kingdom Government had preplay viously announced its intention to cut expenditure on dollar imports in 1949-50 by 25 per cent, as compared with the 1948 level. Representatives of the other sterling area countries agreed to mend to their respective governments Mr Ohifley. action designed to achieve comparable results. At tihe time of the conference, it had been arranged that further discussionsbetween representatives of the United. Kingdom, Canadian and United States Governments would take place in Washington during September. Those discussions have begun and are expected to cover the main problems of financial relationships between, the three countries taking part. It will be clear that, apart from longerterm considerations, the issues being discussed in Washington have a critical present importance. Further restriction of imports, whilst necessary to check the fall in gold and dollar reserves, obviously cannot be carried beyond certain limits witliout causing grave dislocation to industries and standards of living in the countries concerned. In any case, it can of itself contribute nothing to the solution of the dollar problem which requires a positive effort to lift levels of trade rather than to reduce them. The Government has decided to adopt the recommendations of the London conference and, as already announced, has allocations of licences in theSeptember quarter for imports of goods from the dollar area. The aim is to dollar expenditure on imports toper cent, of the 1945 level as quickly as possible. This means that there will be have to be a substantial reduction in dollar expenditure by government departments as well as cuts in practically all the major oategories of commercial dollarand imports. Dollar imports were already severely restricted in 1948. The reductions in the .September quarter were thelargest which could be applied immediately without causing severe disruptionin Australian industries. But the full 25 per cent, saving indollar import expenditure will not be the possible of achievement in 1949-50' because of the commitment represented' The by outstanding licences. Australia must its full part in avoiding a furtherdrain, on the limited gold and dollar reserves of the United Kingdom and the Government is examining the possibilities of borrowing as a means to provide recomadditional dollars. The Government recognizes that this course may present difficulties. Generally, it has been averse to increasing the long-term dollar commitments of Australia. There are various possible sources of dollar borrowing, and the matter will be decided in the light of all the circumstances. NA UNITED KINGDOM. It has been remarked earlier that whilst mast countries in Western Europe had increased production and trade last year, some had done better than others. This unevenness in the rate of recovery as between European countries creates problems having much in common with the general dollar problem, though on a smaller scale. Some countries cannot earn enough by trade with other countries to buy from them the goods they require, even when those goods are available. As a result, productive effort will be wasted and aid received from abroad will fall sbort of its purpose unless means can be found to remove these difficulties of payment between such countries. As a counter-part to Marshall aid, a .system of intra-European payments was - established last year with the object of providing funds by which European - countries could within limits buy from their neighbours more goods than their - own earnings would cover. It is proposed that, with modifications, this scheme will be continued in the - current year, in which case the United Kingdom will again make large contributions in sterling. This is because sterling, which is the means of buying goods not - only in Great Britain but throughout the whole sterling area, is for many countries a very scarce currency. The United Kingdom, as honourable members know, has during the post-war years given very large financial aid to countries in Europe .and this has helped them considerably to 1 restore their industries and trade. Australia has a large trade with Western Europe and, since trade improves with general economic activity, it follows that Australia has benefited from the aid given by the United Kingdom to Western Europe and that we stand to gain from - any further improvement there. In view therefore of the further contributions which the United Kingdom will this year make to European revival and .as a measure of assistance to the United Kingdom in its own great efforts, the Government has decided to make a further grant of £10,000,000 to the United Kingdom Government. The payment will be made from balances held by the Commonwealth Bank in London and repayment will be made to the bank in Australia from Consolidated Bevenue. Legislation will be brought down for this purpose at a later stage in this session. FINANCIAL PEOSPECTS, 1949-50. Because incomes and trade have increased so steeply in the past three years and. because substantial arrears of income tax assessments have been overtaken, revenue has continued to rise notwithstanding the heavy reductions made in rates of taxation. These conditions, however, must in large part be regarded as temporary. Total incomes will probably rise further in the current year, but not as fast as recently. Tax arrears will again contribute to revenue this year but not so much as last year and before long they will be reduced to normal. At the same time the full effect of reductions in taxation rates will be reflected in revenue. On the other hand, the current rise in prices and costs is likely to continue for some time yet and will cause furthei increases in expenditure, particularly in the Post Office, railways and works, but also in most other branches of administration. The necessity of importing materials in short supply here will also in many cases add to costs. .Since, therefore, proposals affecting revenue and expenditure extend beyond the present into future years, often with progressively increasing effects, the considerations just cited must be kept prominently in view at a time like the present. Because at all stages since the war the economic outlook has been liable to rapid change, the Government has consistently refused' to embark upon financial measures that were not clearly practicable and for which the resources were not in sight. Whilst adhering to this policy, the Government has still been able to achieve a great deal in the financial field, as the earlier review has shown. It would be wrong if passing circumstances were allowed at this stage to induce a departure from that policy. DEFENCE AND WAB SEBVICES, 1949-50. In the Estiniates this year items relating to services and commitments arising out of the recent war are grouped under the heading War and Eepatriation (1939-45) Services and will henceforth be treated on the same basis as War and Eepatriation (1914-18). The heading Poet-war Charges will not in future be used. Expenditure on the post-war defence plan is shown under the heading Defence Services. On the basis of existing commitments, net expenditure on Defence and War (1939-45) Services is estimated at £154,000,000 as compared £195,600,000 in 1948-49. The latter figure included an amount of £17,000,000 transferred from trust fund balances. Provision is made for gross expenditure of £640,000,000 on Defence Services as compared with £61,000,000 in 1948-49 and for War and Eepatriation (1939-45) Services of £101,000,000, as compared with £149,000,000 in 1948-49. Credits in 1949-50 are estimated at £11,000,000 as against £14,400,000 in 1948-49. Full details of Defence and War (1939-45) Services are contained in Statement No.' 4. Defence Services. Expenditure on Defence Services this year is estimated at £60,000,000, of which £9,000,000 ie expected to be spent overseas. The five-year defence programme, which extends over the financial years 1947-48 to 1951-52, is progressing satisfactorily. The total cost of the programme was originally estimated at £250,000,000. This figure has now been increased to £295,000,000 as a result of rising costs and certain changes which have been found necessary since the plans were first formulated. Naval aviation is now firmly established in the Royal Australian Navy. The first aircraft-carrier, HMAS. Sydney, has joined the fleet as a fully operational'unit. A naval air station as a hase from which the carrier will operate has been established in New South Wales. It is expected that the first destroyer under the post-war programme will be completed by the end of 1949 and the second during 1950. Mr Chifley. Army estimates for 1949-50 are based on an average strength of 15,000 full-time military duty personnel and a Citizen Military Force of an average strength of 23,000. The strength of the Australian Military Forces in the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan has been reduced to proportions commensurate with the smaller commitment required under stabilized conditions. From army personnel returned to Australia during the past twelve months, a Eegular Army Brigade Group has been formed. Developments in the Royal Australian with Air Force in 1948-49 included the establishment of a school of land/air warfare and also a staff college for the training of career officers for the Royal Australian Air Force. All Royal Australian A ir Force units have their full complement of aircraft and will carry out operational and training flying to the maximum extent possible. Satisfactory progress is heing made with the local manufacture of aircraft and engines already provided for in the defence programme. In addition, work is proceeding on the production of prototypes of certain new types of aircraft. Proposals for the manufacture in Australia of new types of jet-propelled fighter and bomber aircraft are now under consideration. At the Naval and Air bases at Manus, construction work is well advanced and personnel have been posted by both Services. An amount of £6,000,000 has been included in the Estimates for expenditure on defence research and development. Of this the greater part relates to the long range weapons project. Satisfactory results have been achieved in assembling appropriate equipment at Salisbury and in recruiting scientific staff. Accommodation has been a limiting factor but current plans for housing of personnel engaged in the project should overcome this difficulty. Considerable progress has been made in developing the range and technical areas at Woomera and concurrently with this work, buildings, services and amenities in the village area have gone forward. A shortage of materials and certain types of supervisory and skilled labour as well as surveyors has resulted in some slowing up of the planned buildsidies ing and constructional works. However, trials as planned are proceeding on the interim missile range, concurrently with construction on the main range. PAY OF THE FORCES. The pay code for the defence forces, which was introduced in July, 1947, vided basic rates of pay for members the permanent forces having regard to civilian rates then ruling. In changes in civilian rates, the basic rates were varied in November last year to provide for an increase of 2s. a day in the overall remuneration of the forces. A further review of the pay code being made and, whilst full details of increases have not yet been worked out, they will be completed in time for the new 1948-49. - scales to operate from the commencement of the first full pay period in October, 1949. An amount of £1,000,000 has been included in the Estimates on this account. - WAR AND REPATRIATION (1939-45) SERVICES. On the basis of existing commitments, expenditure on War (1939-45) Services is estimated at £101,000,000. Expenditure last year, which included the United Kingdom grant of £10,000,000, was £149,000,000. An estimated increase of £970,000 in war pensions this year reflects the operation for a full year of the increase in pension rates made last September. Expenditure on reconstruction training is expected to decrease by £2,600,000 in 1949-50 as compared with 1948-49 because the number of trainees is falling off. On the other hand, estimated expenditure on war service land settlement is £800,000 above the amount spent in 1948-49. Greater contributions towards the writing down of capital value of holdings are expected and, with more settlers in occupation, provision is made for increased expenditure on living allowances. Price stabilization subsidies in 1949-50 are expected to cost £6,700,000, which includes £5,500,000 for subsidy on tea and £1,200,000 for outstanding claims in respect of subsidies discontinued last year. The estimate of primary production subsidies this year is £9,700,000, which includes provision of £5,600,000 for on dairy products, £3,600,000 for superphosphate subsidy and £500,000 for subsidy on nitrogenous fertilizer. Details of price stabilization and primary production subsidies are contained in 'Statements Nos. 8 and 9. Provision of £1,300,000 is made for international relief and rehabilitation, prowhich includes £450,000 for post-Unrra of expenditure and £850,000 for the third Australian contribution to the Internalight of tional Refugee Organization. OTHER EXPENDITURE. On the basis of existing legislation and commitments, total expenditure other is now than Defence and War (1939-45) Serthe vices is estimated at £387,000,000 in 1949-50 as compared with £339,000,000 in The major increases are £11,000,000 in payments to the National Welfare Fund, £13,600,000 in payments to the States and £15,700,000 in capital works and services. Social Services. Statutory payments to the National Welfare Fund in 1949-50 are estimated at £121,000,000, of which £99,000,000 is from social services contribution and £22,000,000 from pay-roll tax, as compared with £110,000,000 in 1948-49. Expenditure from the fund, on thf other hand, is estimated at £100,400,000, as against £80,800,000 last year. The main increases are£ Age and invalid .pensions .. 3,800,000 Unemployment and sickness benefits .. .. 2,900,000 Child endowment 6,700,000 Pharmaceutical benefits .. 2,200,000 Medical benents 2,000,000 The increase in pensions and child endowment payments is due in part to normal growth in numbers of beneficiaries and in part to the operation for a full year of the increased rates which camo into effect last year. The estimate of unemployment and sickness benefits is larger because of the coal strike. Details of the National Welfare Fund are contained in Statement No. 7 and of Commonwealth social and health services in Statement No. 11. Special Grants to States. The report of the Commonwealth subGrants Commission for 1949-50 has not yet .been received, but an amount of £11,000,000 bas been included in the Estimates for special grants to South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania. Capital Works and Services. Expenditure on capital works and services, excluding defence works, is estimated to increase from £37,500,000 in 1948-49 to £53,200,000 in 1949-50. Major increases arePost Office . . War service homes . . Immigration (hostels and depots) Snowy River scheme .. Joint Coal Board Additional labour and' increasing deliveries of plant and equipment have been making possible a higher rate of progress in works programmes which, howover, will now he retarded by the coal .strike. Construction costs are rising because of higher wages and costs of materials. Administrative Expenditure. The Government is maintaining its efforts to ensure the utmost economy and efficiency in administration. Staffing and organization of departments is under continuous review by the Public Service Board and special instructions have been issued to all branches of the Public Service that expenditure of all kinds must be kept to a minimum. With wages, salaries and costs of materials rising and with expansion of vital activities such as the Post Office, civil aviation and works, some increase in the numbers of staff and' in the genera] costs of government is inevitable. TOTAL EXPENDITURE, 1949-50. On the basis of existing legislation and commitments total expenditure in 1949-50 is estimated at £541,300,000 as compared with actual expenditure of £535,000,000 in 1948-49. ESTIMATED EEVENUE, 1949-50. It is estimated that revenue in 1949-50 will be £532,600,000 after taking into account the reduction in rates of income tax and social services contribution which came into operation on the 1st July of this year. Mr Chifley. Allowing, however, for a substantial increase in incomes and profits subject to taxation, revenue from these two taxes is estimated at £2-76,000,000 compared with 1 revenue of £272,000,000 in 1948-49. At existing rates, revenue from salestax is estimated at £40,000,000. This is £1,000,000 higher than last year. Eevenue from pay-roll tax in 1949-50 is estimated at £22,000,000, an increase of £2,000,000 above 1948-49. £ Eevenue from customs is estimated to 1,400,000 be slightly lower on existing rates than 3,000,000 in 1948-49. There may be some increase 3,700,000 in total imports, though mainly in free or 1,500,000 low duty classes of goods. On the other 1,200,000 hand, dollar imports, some of which carry high rates of duty, will be lower. Estimated excise revenue for 1949-50 1 is set down at £64,000,000 as comparedwith £62,700,000 in 1948-49. Post Office revenue will reflect therecent increases in postal, telegraph and' telephone rates and is estimated to be£5,000,000 higher than last year. Accordingly, on the basis of estimates' which do not allow for proposals affecting both revenue and expenditure, which will be detailed presently, revenue for 1949-50 will fall short of expenditureby £9,000,000. TAXATION. In March last, substantial reductions were made in the rates at which incometax and social services contribution arepayable by individuals for this financial year. The rates were reduced prior to the 1st July, 1949, so that the benefit of the reductions would, be reflected in theinstalments deducted from salaries and' wages as from that date. The total cost to revenue of the reductions is estimated at £36,500,000 per annum., which amounts to approximately 23 per cent, of the total direct taxation payable by individuals. This will beoffset to some extent, however, by thecollection of arrears. During the financial year 1948-49, arrears in the assessment and collection of income tax and social' services contribution were largely overtaken and it is expected that, by the end of this financial year, the arrears will"" be reduced to a normal level. There have now been five major reductions in rates of direct taxation since thewar ended, besides a large number of particular concessions and their effect has been to lighten the weight of taxation upon individuals very greatly. The majority of taxpayers now pay considerably less than half the taxes which would have been payable at war-time .rates on comparable incomes and a veiy large number of people pay no income :tax at all. As an assistance in the re-equipment of industry and in the establishment of new industrial enterprises, the income tax - depreciation allowances are being extended. At present, a special initial - depreciation deduction of 20 per cent, of the cost of plant and machinery acquired or installed up to the 30th J une, 1950, is allowed in the year of acquisition - or installation. This special deduction is additional to the normal annual - allowance for depreciation. It is proposed to extend the period of the special allowance for a further two years to the. .30th June, 1952. At the same time, companies and other taxpayers are being .given a right to elect to deduct initial depreciation of 40 per cent, in lieu of the present 20 per cent, on plant and machinery acquired or installed after the 30th June, 1949. It is proposed also to extend the income tax concessional rebate in respect of life - assurance premiums and superannuation - contributions by individuals. At present, £100 is the maximum amount on which the rebate is allowed. As from, the 1st - July, 1949, this maximum is being increased to £150 - total value of £30 will be charged In the field of indirect taxation th« - Government proposes to make certain - concessions which will now be outlined. It is proposed to reduce the general rate of sales tax from 10 per cent, to 8-J per cent. This reduction will apply to a very wide range of goods in general use ancl will thus operate to the benefit of the whole community. Certain new - exemptions will also be granted, and the tax on some goods will be reduced from the maximum rate of 25 per cent, to the new general rate of 8^ per cent. This new rate will be relatively simple to 'Calculate as it will represent l d . for each Is. of taxable value. Details - of the amendments will be found in the bills to be introduced later this evening. The cost to revenue of these concessions is estimated at £6,700,000 for a full year and £5,000,000 for the current financial year. Entertainments Tax. It is proposed' to reduce the rates of entertainments tax by approximately 20 per cent, in regard to all classes of entertainments. Details of the reductions will be announced when the relevant bill is introduced later this evening. The resultant loss of revenue is estimated at £1,100,000 for a full year and approximately £800,000 for the current financial year. Gustoms, Excise and Primage. The following remissions are proposed :Primage - Remova l from some 400 items and sub-items, mainly raw materials, semi-manufactured goods and industrial equipment. Cost to revenue is estimated at £1,000,000 in a full year and at £820,000 in 1949-50. Outside Packages - Abolitio n of customs duty ancl primage. Cost to revenue is estimated at £450,000 in a full year and at £385,000 in 1949-50. . Passengers' Baggage - Remissio n of duty on articles for personal use or gifts to a total value of £30 with a limitation on spirituous liquors and tohacco. Articles above a a flat rate of 25 per cent, ad valorem. Cost to revenue is estimated at £30,000 in a full year and at £25,000 in 1949-50. Sales Tax - Ships' Stores - Abolitio n of customs duty and sales tax on stores other than spirituous liquors and tobacco. Cost to revenue is estimated at £120,000 in a full vear and at £100,000 in 1949-50. Aircraft Stores - Exemptio n from customs duty of stores used on aircraft trading overseas. The concession will extend to non-Australian aircraft where Australian aircraft receive reciprocal treatment. Estimated cost to revenue is £100,000 in a full year and £83,000 in 1949-50. Radio Valves - Reductio n of excise 'by ls. a valve. Cost to revenue is estimated at £100,000 in a year and £87,000 in 1949-50. Eull details of tbese concessions will be announced later this evening by the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Customs. Total Tax Reductions. In all, therefore, the proposed additional tax concessions will cost revenue £9,600,000 in a full year and £7,300,000 in 1949-50. Taking into account the reductions in rates of direct taxation mated to cost £36,500,000 a year the full cost to revenue of tax concessions coming into operation in 1949-50 would thus be Hpproximately £46,000,000 per annum. PAYMENTS TO THE STATES. Proposals will be made for payment to the States this year of a coal strike emergency grant of £8,000,000 and an increase in the Commonwealth Aid Roads and ""Works Grant of £1,000,000 a year. In addition, provision is made in the Estimates for an increase in the States Tax Reimbursement Grant of £8,750,000, an increase of £3,500,000 in special grants, and a further payment this year to reimburse the States for costs of administering controls over prices, rents and land sales. Taking nucovnt of these items, the main details of which will be given presently, aggregate payments to or for the States in 1949-50 will be approximately £101,000,000an increase of £22,500,000 above payments last year and £34,000,000 above 1947-48. TAX REIMBURSEMENT GRANTS. It is expected that under the formula embodied in existing legislation the tax reimbursement grants payable to the reimbursement States in 1949-50 under the uniform scheme will amount to £62,500,000, increase of about £8,750,000 over This will mean a total increase of no less than £17,500,000 in the tax reimburseStates ment grants since 1947-48. COAL STBIKE EMERGENCY GRANT. In recent months, a very heavy burden has been placed on State budgets by reason of the coal strike, coal shortages and associated effects. The adverse effect of Mr Chifley. the coal situation on State budgets has been particularly noticeable in the finances full of the State railways and certain other State business undertakings. At the recent conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers the Commonwealth was furnished with estimates of the effects of the coal situation on State budgets, and after considering all circumstances, the Government has decided that a special coal strike emergency grant of £8,000,000 should be made to the States in 1949-50. This grant will be distributed among the States in the same proestiportions as the tax reimbursement grant payable this year. Legislation to give eifect to this proposal will be introduced shortly. COMMONWEALTH AID ROADS GRANT. It is also proposed to increase by £1,000,000 the amount made available to the States under the Commonwealth Aid Roads and Works Act 1947-48 for expenditure on roads in sparsely settled areas. This will increase the amount to be provided for that purpose in 1949-50 to £3,000,000 and the estimated total roads grant to £9,000,000. Legislation will be introduced to make the necessary amendment to the act. CONTROLS OVER PRICES, RENTS AND LAND SALES. Last year, legislation was passed providing for the States to be reimbursed by the Commonwealth for additional expenditure incurred by the States in 194849 by reason of their assumption of control over prices, rents and land sales. The Government has decided that this arrangement should be continued in 194950. New legislation will be necessary. Last year, grants to the States in of the cost of these controls tax amounted to £597,000 whilst £800,000 an has been provided for this purpose in 1948-49. the hudget this year. Further details of payments to the are given in Statement No. 10. WAR GRATUITY RESERVE. During last financial year, as honourable members know, the War Gratuity Reserve was established as a provision against the payment of war gratuity due in the financial year 1950-51. At the 30th June this year the balance in the reserve was approximately £30,100,000. As the total liability for war gratuity is estimated at £80,000,000 which will mainly f all due for payment in 1950-51, the - Government considers that further provision should as far as possible be made in this financial year. Accordingly, it is proposed that part of the balances in certain trust accounts built up through provision against certain war-time contingencies, such as the Diverted Cargoes Account and the ""War Damage Fund, and which are no longer required for their original purpose, should be appropriated to the ""War Gratuity Reserve. The total amount in volved is £6,700,000, which would bring the balance in the reserve to £36,800,000. BUDGET SUMMARY.

LOAN COUNCIL PROGRAMMES 1949-50. At its meeting in August this year, the Loan Council endorsed a works programme for the Commonwealth and the States of £116,887,000. The borrowing programmes approved by the Loan Council for 1949-50 total £79,300,000 to cover loan expenditure h y governnients, mainly on public works and housing. The Commonwealth's share of this amount is £13,100,000, which will be used wholly for advances to the Statesunder the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. The Loan Council also approved a total borrowing programme' of £45,000,000 for semi-governmental and local authorities. All the borrowingsapproved are subject to review in January, 1950. CONCLUSION. The past ten years have proved theresilient strength of our country. When faced with danger, we put forth a military and industrial effort far greater than fm. formerly thought possible and since tbewar we have been able, despite many 532. 6 difficulties arising from that conflict, to recover lost ground and advance along the road of progress again. Indeed, Aus539.3 tralia is in many ways much fartherahead than ten years ago. In manufac7.3 turing, our capacity has increased at least 532.0 50 per cent. Throughout the economy as a whole there are 40 per cent, more people at work than there were then. From a .. 541.3 social standpoint we have greatly extended £m. the range and value of services availableand experience has shown not merely that we can afford these services but that they have a positive worth in keeping updemand for goods and hence employment 25.7 and investment. 567.0 These examples of constructive achievement in a time disordered by war and the35.0 effects of war point to what can be doneunder normal conditions. Knowing our resources, we should not be a f r a i d to set our goals high. I believe for examplethat our population can be doubled with in a few decades. I believe also that o u r present problems of fuel and power can be solved, so opening up immense indust r i a l possibilities. Housing, again, difficult though it has been in recent years,, will be steadily overcome if we keep up. our efforts. But it is a condition of all this that should accept as a common aim the future greatness and security of Australia COMPARISON av ACTUAL REVENUE Taxation RevenueCustoms .. ..

In June, 1948, the committee completed its first annual review under this arrangement, and, as a consequence, the return to the farmer at the factory door was increased, as from the 1st July, 1948, by Zd. per lb. commercial butter to 2s. 2d. per lb. A further review of cost movements in the industry was recently completed by the committee. As a result the committee recommended that the return to the producer should be increased as from the 1st July, 1949, by 2Jd. per lb. to cover additional costs. This brings the returns to the farmer to 2s. 4$d. per lb. commercial butter basis for 1949-50. The committee's recommendation was accepted by the Government. Advice of the increased cost of production was advised to the Premiers of the various States on the 22nd June, 1949, for the attention of the pricing authorities. The Government is continuing its subsidy payments at the rate applying last year. On this basis, the subsidy is estimated to cost £5,575.000 for 1949-50. S CPEEPHOSPHATE. The Government is continuing the payment of subsidy on superphosphate during 1949-50 at the rates which applied last financial year, viz., Western Australia £2 15s. a ton, Eyre Peninsula £2 10s. a ton, other areas £2 5s. a ton. Provision has been made accordingly. NITROGENOUS FERTILIZER. The Government has announced that, provided the nitrogen pool is maintained, it will continue the subsidy on nitrogenous fertilizer during 1949-50. This subsidy is designed to meet the difference between the average of the differing costs of nitrogenous fertilizer fronl various sources and the fixed selling price. During 1949-50, the amount of subsidy required to make up this difference on a turnover of 76.400 tons by the pool is estimated to be £500,000.

Following the decision of the Commonwealth Government to continue uniform taxation of incomes and entertainments indefinitely, proNew South Wales Victoria Queensland South Australia Western Australia Tasmania Total .. DAIRYING. vision was made in the States Grants (Tax Reimbursement) Act 1946 for payment of tax reimbursement grants to States which did not levy income taxation. This legislation set out the basis on which the aggregate tax reimbursement grant was to be determined for payment in 1946-47 and in subsequent year9 and also the basis on which the aggregate grant was to be distributed among the States each year. Legislation was passed in 1947 and 1948 amending the basis for determining the aggregate grant but the basis of distribution of the aggregate grant between the States was left unchanged. Under the States Grants (Tax Reimbursement) Act 1946-1948, the aggregate grant was fixed at £40,000,000 in 1946-47 and £45,000,000 in 1947-48, whilst in respect of subsequent years the act provides for the aggregate grant of £45,000,000 to be varied in accordance with a formula which takes account of(a) Variations in the States' populations since the 1st July, 1947; and (6) The percentage increase (if any) in the level of average wages per person employed over the level in 1945-46. The aggregate grant paid to the States in 1948-49 in accordance with this formula amounted to £53,744,000 whilst it 13 estimated fhat the amount payable in 1949-50 will be £02,500,000. The aggregate grant was distributed among the States in 1946-47 and 1947-48 in accordance with the First Schedule to the 1946 act. In respect of years subsequent to 1947-48 the act provides that the aggregate grant is to be distributed in accordance with a distribution formula which taxes account to an increasing extent each year of the respective populations of the States after adjustments have been made to those populations for relative spar&ity of population and the number of school children aged five to fifteen years inclusive in each State. The effect of this distribution formula in respect of the grant for 1949-50 is to provide that eight-tenths of the aggregate grant be distributed among the States in the proportions laid down in the schedule to the 1946 act and the remaining two-tenths in proportion to the adjusted populations of the States. By 1957-58 the aggregate grant will be distributed solely in proportion to the adjusted populations of the States. The estimated grants payable in 1949-50 are compared below with the grants in the four previous years. - 1915-46. 1940-47. 1947-48. 1948-49. 1949-50 (estimate). £'000. £'000. £'000. £'000. £'000. 15,517 16,477 18,537 22,022 25,462 6,890 8,860 9,967 12,098 14,306 5,821 6,601 7,426 8,832 10,226 2,458 3,458 3,890 4,630 5,368 2,644 3,384 3,807 4,495 5,168 925 1,220 1,373 1,667 1,970 34,255 40,000 45,000 53,744 62,500 The tax reimbursement grants annually to each State are reduced by the - amount of any arrears of State income taxation which may be received in that year by the 'State. In 1948-49 these arrears amounted to £256,679 and are estimated at £143,000 in 1949-50. COAL STRIKE EMERGENCY GRANT. It is proposed to make a special non-recurring coal strike emergency grant of £8,000,000 to the States in 1949-50 to alleviate the burden placed on State budgets by reason of the coal strike, coal shortages and the associated effects. The grant will be distributed among the States in the same proportions as the tax reimbursement grant payable in 1949-50. The precise amount which each State will receive cannot be specified until the Commonwealth Statistician has completed his determination of the amounts payable to each State in 1949-50 under the tax reimbursement distribution formula. It is estimated, however, that the distribution among the States of the coal strike emergency grant of £8,000,000 will be approximately as foUows:New South Wales . . 3,259,000 Victoria Queensland South Australia Western Australia Tasmania Tota] .. SPECIAL GRANTS. Special grants under section 98 of the Constitution have been paid annually by the Commonwealth to Western Australia since 1910, to Tasmania since 1912, and to South Australia since 1929. W it h the establishment of the Commonwealth Grants Commission in 1933 the special grants paid each year to these States have been in accordance with the recommendations of the commission. The general principle adopted by the Commonwealth Grants Commission over the years is that of financial needs and has been expressed by the commission in the following terms:"" Special grants are justified when a State' through financial stress from any cause is unable efficiently to discharge its functions as a member 'of the federation and should be determined by the amount of help found necessary to make it possible for that State by reasonable effort to function at a standard not appreciably below that of the other States."" The report of the Commonwealth Commission on the applications Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania Mr Chifley. paid lor special grants from the Commonwealth in 1949-50 is not yet available. Fending receipt of the commission's report, an amount of £11,054,000 has been included tentatively in the 1949-50 budget for special grants to these three States. In 1948-49, special grants paid to these States on the recommendation of the Commonwealth Grants Commission amounted to £7,450,000 made up aa follows:£ South Australia .. 2,850,000 Western Australia .. 3,600,000 Tasmania 1,000,000 7,450,000 COMMONWEALTH AID KOADS AND WORKB. Agreements made under the Federal Aid Roads and Works Act 1937 terminated on 30th June, 1947, and the act was superseded by the Commonwealth A i d Roads and Works Act 1947 which came into operation on 1st July, 1947, for a period of three years. This act provides for the following payments to be made from Consolidated Revenue during this period:(a) Payment to the States each year of £ a sum equivalent to 3d. a gallon customs duty and l i d . per gallon excise duty collected under the rela1,831,000 tive tariff items in respect of 1,309,000 petroleum and shale products 687,000 entered for home consumption 662,000 during each year of the above-mentioned period, excluding duties 252,000 payable on goods used in civil aircraf t for the purposes of civil 8,000,000 aviation. (6) Payment of £1,000,000 to the States each year in respect of roads in sparsely settled areas. (e) Provision of £500,000 by the Commonwealth each year for the construction and maintenance of strategic roads and roads of access to Commonwealth property. (d) Provision of a sum aggregating £100,000 to be used by the Commonwealth in the promotion of road safety practices. In 1948 amending legislation was passed increasing during each - of the two final years of the scheme the allocation for roads in sparsely settled areas from £1,000,000 to £2,000.000. It is proposed this year to make a further increase of £1,000,000 in the' allocation for roads in sparsely settled areas, thus bringing the total allocation foT this purpose in 1949-50 to £3.000,000. The full amount of £100,000 provided under the act foT the promotion of road safety was expended during 1947-48. Since that time, moneys for road safety purposes have been Grants provided by the Commonwealth under the by South administrative vote of the Department of Transport. Expenditure from Consolidated Revenue under the act in 1048-40 is compared below with the estimated expenditure in 1949-50:Payment from petrol tax 5,130,788 Payment for roads in sparsely settled areas 2,000,000 Expenditure on strategic roads 500,000 Total 7,630,788 . . 9,000,000 Payments from Consolidated Revenue for the foregoing purposes are ma'de in the first place to a trust account (known as the Commonwealth A i d Roads and Works Trust Account) from which the moneys are subsequently disbursed. In 1948-49 the payments from this trust account amounted to £7,470,000. ADMINISTRATION OF PRICES, RENTS AND LAND SALES CONTROL. The States took over the administration of prices, rents and land sales controls towards the end of 1948 and the Commonwealth agreed to reimburse the States for the additional costs in which the States would be involved in 1948-49 by reason of their administration of these controls. Provision was made accordingly in the States Grants (Administration of Controls Reimbursement) Act 1948. Grants to the States in 1948-49 in reimbursement of these controls amounted to £597,409 (this amount covers approximately the last nine months of the year), while £800,000 has been provided for this purpose in the budget for 1949-50. New legislation will be introduced to authorize the payment of these grants in 1949-50. NA Under the Financial Agreement, which was entered into between the Commonwealth and the States in 1927, the Commonwealth agreed to contribute certain amounts towards meeting the interest and sinking fund payments in respect of the States' debts. The agreement nrovides that the Commonwealth will in each year during the period of 58 years commencing on the 1st July, 1927, contribute a fixed amount of £7,584,912 towards the interest payable on the States' debts. The sinking fund contributions made by the Commonwealth in respect of the States' debts vary according to the nature of the borrowings and may be described briefly as follows:(a) In respect of States' debts existing on the 30th June, 1927, the Commonwealth contributes 2s. 6d. per cent, per annum and the States 5s. per cent, per annum for 58 years. (6) In respect of borrowings to meet State deficits incurred between the 1st July, 1927, and the 30th June, 1935, the Commonwealth contributes 5s. per cent, per annum and the States concerned 15s. per cent, per annum, such contributions to continue for 39 years from the 1st July, 1944. This provision was made in an amendment to the 1.948-49. 1049-50. Financial Agreement in 1944. No £ sinking fund contribution is made £ 'by the Commonwealth in respect of 5,500,000 any other borrowings to meet State deficits. (c) In respect of new borrowings by the 3,000,000 States after the 1st July, 1927 (other than for deficit purposes), 500,000 the Commonwealth and the States concerned each contribute 5s. per cent, per annum for 53 years. The Commonwealth contributions in respect of sinking fund ou States' debts are paid direct to the National Debt Sinking Fund. In 1948-49 the Commonwealth contributions amounted to £1,851,883, whilst the contributions in 1949-50 are estimated at £1,980,088. WESTERN AUSTRALIAN WATERWORKS GRANT . Under the Western Australian Grant (Water Supply) Act 1948, the Commonwealth agreed to provide financial assistance to the Western Australian Government for a scheme designed to provide Avater for certain parts of the State's main mixed wheat and sheep belt and indirectly to relieve demand on the water supply to the eastern gold-fields. The Commonwealth financial assistance is limited to one-half of the capital cost of the project, with an upper l i m it of £2,150,000. The grant was considered to be justified because of the developmental possibilities of the project and the limited financial resources of the States. No payments have so far been made by the Commonwealth, but an amount of £400,000 has been provided in the budget for 1949-50. This represents 50 per cent, of the amount which the Western Australian Government estimates will be expended on the project during 1949-50. AGREEMENT. SUMMARY.

70,Mr DESMAN,Unknown,"Corio-Minister for Defence and Minister for Post-war Reconstruction) [5.27] - I move That the. hill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to authorize the payment to the States in 1949-50 of a special non-recurring grant of £8,000,000 to alleviate the burden placed on State budgets by reason of the coal strike, coal shortages and the associated effects. The latest trends in the finances of the States were the subject of discussion at the Conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers which was held last month. It was clear at that discussion that, despite the increase of approximately £8,750,000 which may be expected in the tax reimbursement grant in 1949-50, in accordance with the formula embodied in existing legislation, the States will experience serious financial difficulties this year because of the effects on their budgets of the coal strike and pre- coal shortages. It is, of course, impossible to make a precise estimate of the lossesjOi* additional costs incurred by the State Governments by reason of the coal strike and its associated effects. At the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers, however, the Commonwealth was furnished with estimates of the effects of the coal position on the State budgets particularly in relation to the finances of the State railways, and, to a less extent, of other State business undertakings. After considering all circumstances, the Government has decided that to meet this situation a special non-recurring grant in 1949-50 of £8,000,000 would be justified. It is considered that it would be appropriate to distribute the grant in the same proportions as the tax reimbursement grant payable this year. Provision is made in the bill accordingly. The precise amount which each State will receive under this method of distribution cannot be specified until the Commonwealth Statistician has completed his determination of the tax reimbursement gr.ant payable to each State this year. On the basis of preliminary estimates furnished by the Statistician of the tax reimbursement and read grant? payable this year, however, the share of each State in this coal strike emergency grant of £8,000,000 would be approximately as follows:£ New South Wales .. 3,259,000 Victoria 1,831,000 Queensland 1,309,000 South Australia .. 087,000 Western Australia .. 602,000 Tasmania 252,000 Debate (on motion by Mr MENZIES) adjourned.

71,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,"Corio-Minister for Defence and Minister for Post-war Reconstruction) [5.32] - I move That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to enable reimbursement to the States of the costs incurred by them in the administration of prices, rents and land sales controls to be continued during the financial year 1949-50 on the same basis as that applying in 1948-49. The States Grants adjourned. (Administration of Controls Reimbursement) Act 1948 provided for the reimbursement until the 30th June, 1949, of the States' administrative costs in connection with these controls. The present measure provides for further reported. grants to be made up to the 30th June, 1950. The Government takes the view that, whilst inflationary tendencies are still evident, the States should not be of hampered by financial considerations in for deciding the extent and duration of these solidated controls, and that further financial United Kingdom. assistance is desirable this year, to enable the States effectively to maintain the controls they consider necessary in the interests of general economic stability. adopted. Based on figures initially supplied by Orderedthe States, a eum of £800,000 has been provided in the 1949-50 estimates for pare these purposes. The cost of reimbursing going resolution. the States during that part of 1948-49 for which they were responsible controls was £597,000. On a yearly basis this was equivalent to approximately £770,000. Revised estimates received from the States within the last few days indicate that expenditure on the respective controls will be £633,000 for prices, £103,000 for rents and £61,000 for land sales, making a total of £797,000 for the three controls. The figure of £61,000 for the cost of land sales control takes into account the fact that control in New South ""Wales terminated on the 1st September, 1949. As the future of this control is under review in certain other States, expenditure may be less than tha estimate of £61,000. As was the case last, and year, it is proposed to limit the grants to the reimbursement of administrativecosts and any capital expenditure which the States may incur will be to their own account. In order to relieve the States of the necessity to finance expenditure pending reimbursement from the Commonwealth, provision is again made for the payment of the grant by way of advances. At the end of the financial year an adjustment will be effected with each State on the basis of a certified statement by the State Auditor-General. Debate (on motion by Mr HABBISON) NA . BILL 1949.

72,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,"Corio-Minister for Defence and Minister for Post-war Eeconstruction) [5.38] - I move That the bill be now read a second time. The bill now before the House seeks to appropriate £10,000,000 for a grant to the United Kingdom. As honourable members will recall, a gift of a similar amount was made to the United Kingdom last year. It was made as a practical expression of the desire of the Australian people to assist the United Kingdom and also in recognition of the outstanding contribution which the British Government and people have made, despite their own pressing problems, to the economic recovery of Europe since the war ended. The decision to make the gift was welcomed and approved by honourable members on both sides of the House. During the .past year the United Kingdom has made further striking progress in reconstructing its trade and industry. By a great effort, an overall balance in payments with all countries was achieved in the second half of 1948. Priority must still be given, however, to manufacture for export, particularly to dollar markets, where payments difficulties continue to be acute. This has meant that comparatively little of the increased production from British factories has been available for consumption at home. Imports of foodstuffs and other consumer goods are also still limited and the improvement in the external financial position of the United Kingdom has been achieved only because the British people have been willing to continue to make sacrifices in their own living standards. The United Kingdom is also still required to meet calls on its - resources to help in the recovery of other European countries. The countries of Western Europe are receiving aid from the United States to held them to solve their dollar shortages. Through the European recovery programme, dollar aid totalling 4,875,000,000 dollars was allocated to the participating countries in 1948-49. For 1949-50 a sum of about 3,600,000,000 dollars is expected to be made available. With these dollars, European countries have been able to continue buying from the Western Hemisphere essential goods needed for their economic reconstruction. In addition to the dollar problem, some of the European countries are faced with a shortage of other currencies, including a shortage of sterling. .Some European countries have done better than others in increasing production and trade. Because of the uneven rate of recovery, some countries cannot earn enough by trade to buy the goods they need, whilst others are producing goods they cannot sell because of these payments difficulties. Last year, the difficulties were met by introducing an intraEuropean payments arrangement whereby countries which were in credit in their payments provided funds for use by those in debit. The creditor countries were able to provide these funds because they received in return something like the equivalent in Marshall aid dollars. The United Kingdom played a large part in this scheme. Altogether the United Kingdom made grants totalling £61,500,000 sterling to other European countries in the nine months ended the 30th June, 1949. The United Kingdom itself has been short of Belgian currency, and it received in Belgian francs the equivalent of £7,500,000 sterling from Belgium in the same period. These sums have been outright grants, leaving behind them no problems of repayment. In this manner, a break-down in trade between European countries was averted. Europe was given a breathing-space in which the reconstruction pf industries could continue without grave dislocation. In the absence of these payments arrangements, Europe's recovery would have been hampered and the dollar assistance being given by the United States would have been much less effective. Similar arrangements are being negotiated for 1949-50. The contributions to be made by the creditor countries have not yet been finally determined but the United Kingdom will certainly again be called upon to make substantial sterling grants. Australia's interest in the restoration of economic prosperity in Europe remains as strong as it was a year ago. These European countries are important customers of ours. In 1948-49 we exported goods valued at £A.120,000,000 to countries other than the United Kingdom taking part in the European recovery programme. This represented 22 per cent, of our total exports valued at £A.547,000,000. Trance and French possessions took goods to the value of £A.48,000.000 and apart from the TJnited Kingdom were the largest buyers of Australian commodities. Italy's share was £A.29,000,000 and Belgium's purchases amounted £A.20,000,000. Wool was, of course, the main commodity entering into this trade. A total of £A.95,000,000 worth of wool was shipped to these European countries in 1948-49, representing 41 per cent, of all wool exports in that year. Our trade surplus with these countries last year was £A.85,00Q,000, which represented a large part of the surplus of £A.133,000,000 earned from our trade with all countries. We gain directly from the TJnited Kingdom's contributions towards the reconstruction of Europe, when the countries receiving sterling grants spend a part of them on our products. We also gain from the increased production in Europe which these grants help to promote. Over the last year the European countries In Committee of Ways and. Means:",52

The reductions will apply to all classes of entertainments, whether they are subject to tax at the general rate or the special rates applicable to the legitimate theatre and certain sports conducted by non-profit organizations. This concession will appreciably reduce the costs of entertainment to those who seek recreation at picture theatres and other popular sources of amusement. A comparison of the present rates and the proposed rates is set out in a statement which is being circulated for the information of honourable members. In view of the time which is necessary to procure new stocks of departmental tax tickets and' to distribute them to postmasters throughout Australia, it is proposed that the reduced rates shall not come into operation until the 1st October, 1949.

The amendments contained in the tariff proposals that I have just introduced fall into three categories, namely, budget, protective and administrative. In regard to the items of budget significance, the Treasurer (Mr Chifley) in his budget speech has given information to honourable members in respect of the concessions involving customs, excise and primage duties that the Government proposes. The concessions in respect of primage duty and ships' and aircraft stores referred to by the Treasurer will be implemented under the provisions of the Customs Tariff (Primage Duties) Act and the Customs Act respectively. Consequently these concessions do not appear in the tariff proposals before the committee. It is proposed to reduce the duty on wireless valves, under both the customs and the excise tariffs, by ls. a valve. This reduction should have some bearing on the prices charged for these essential components of wireless sets and for the wireless sets themselves. The Government has decided that duties on outside packages should be removed. The operation of this duty, which imposes additional costs on industry, has been reported upon adversely by the Tariff Board. The removal of the duty will facilitate the work of both the Department of Trade and Customs and the importers. The proposal to grant some concessional treatment to passengers bringing into Australia dutiable goods of a limited value for their own personal use or as gifts will relieve passengers of the payment of protective rates of duty on such of the goods as are not imported for purposes of trade. The proposal will also facilitate the work of the Department of Trade and Customs and will ease the congestion at the wharfs when a vessel arrives carrying a large complement of passengers. The proposal is that goods, ordinarily dutiable, up to £30 in value, not being for sale, brought in by a passenger wiil be admitted free of duty. Dutiable goods in excess of £30 and up to a value of £110 will be entitled to entry at a flat rate of 25 per cent, ad valorem. The operation of the concession has been made subject to departmental by-law, which will provide for flexibility in administration, and adequate safeguards  will be taken to ensure that the concession will not be abused. It will be realized that this proposal could provide an incentive for greater tourist traflic. The protective items involved include corsets, fuel injection equipment, cooking stoves, cinematographs and surgical and dental instruments. Although the tariif proposals in respect of these goods do not in each case constitute increased protection to local industry, the incidence of protection has been inquired into by the Tariff Board and the proposed amendments to the items conform to the board's recommendations. In regard to corsets, the rates of duty are unchanged but the item has been widened to include combined garments of which corsets form a part. A new item is proposed to cover fuel injection equipment at protective rates of duty. Equipment of this kind was previously admitted under various items of the tariff at different rates of duty. The duties now proposed are in accordance with the Tariff Board's recommendation. The duties on cooking stoves designed to function on the heat storage principle have bo.en varied in accordance with the recommendation of the Tariff Board. Generally speaking the proposal is that commercial stoves and ranges will be subject to protective rates of duty and domestic types which are not manufactured in Australia at non-protective rates. The Tariff Board in its report on cinematographs has recommended that protective rates of duty should apply where the film width capacity exceeds 9.5 millimetres. Previously, protective rates of duty applied only to cinematographs greater than 17.5 millimetres in width. The proposed rates therefore will assist local industry in the production of the popular 16 millimetre projector. To conform with treaty obligations a consequential amendment is necessary under the Customs Tariff (New Zealand Preference). Local manufacturers are now producing certain surgical and dental instruments which were previously admitted under departmental by-law at concessional rates of duty. The Tariff Board in its report said that it felt that local manufacturers should be assisted in respect of the types of instruments made by them by the imposition of the' rates of duty shown in the proposal. The Tariff Board reports covering the various protective items in the proposals now before the committee were tabled in the Parliament by me - earlier today and are available for perusal by honourable members. The proposals under the heading "" Administrative Items"" are as follows. Tariff Item 118 (D) (2) has been amended by the addition of the words, "" Carpeting, - Carpet Mats, Carpet Rugs and Carpet Door Slips "". The item is a non-protective - one and it covers types of carpets not pro-duced in Australia. The amendment is proposed merely to overcome classification difficulties. Ornamental figures of the type ordinarily used in the household have been admitted as Statuary under Tariff Item 427 (c) for many years. Hbwever, doubt has arisen regarding this classification in view of the reference in item 809 (B ) to ""Ivory and other ornamental figures "". In order to clarify the position it is proposed to exclude the words, "" Ivory and other ornamental figures"" from item 309 (B ) and to include in item 427 (c) the words, "" Figures of the types ordinarily used in the household "". It is proposed to insert an item in the tariff to cover films of a scenic, tourist or travel nature produced or issued by or on behalf of government authorities and railway, airway or steamship authorities. The proposal to insert this item in the tariff follows negotiations with Canada for some reciprocal arrangement in regard to these films which are not ordinarily imported for commercial purposes. Canada has already extended this benefit to films produced by the Australian National Film Board, and the proposed action by Australia is therefore a measure of reciprocity. The item is subject to departmental by-law which will provide for flexibility in administration. The tariff provides for free entry under tariff item 373 (A ) of goods imported by representatives of overseas countries. It is now proposed that any eligible person who wishes to obtain admission of goods free of duty under this item will be required to agree, before free admission under the item is granted, that in the event of the goods being sold or otherwise disposed of in Australia within a period of two years after the date of entry of the goods, the person will pay the duty which would otherwise have been paid upon importation. The amendment is so designed that if special circumstances exist the Minister may determine that duty shall not be payable. A number of cases have come under notice in which representatives of overseas countries have imported goods free of duty and have desired subsequently to dispose of them in Australia. However, as the persons obtained free admission of the goods, they have felt that the sale or disposal without the payment of duty would be a breach of the privilege afforded under the item. The amendments under tariff items 410 (B) (2) and 427 (A ) covering oil and water-colour paintings and works of art are merely administrative and have been made on legal advice to define more clearly the intention of the items. A summary of alterations showing in detail the amendments to be effected by these tariff proposals and the relative by-laws prescribed has been circulated for the information of honourable members.

76,Unknown,Unknown,"Sitting suspended from 63 to 8 p.m. NA ROYAL COMMISSION. REPOBT. Debate resumed from the 7th July (vide page 2236), on motion by Mr. CHIFLEYThat the following paper be printed:New Guinea Timber Rights Koyal Commission-Eeport .",61
77,Mr BEALE,Unknown,"Parramatta) [8.0] On the 7th July last, this House debated the report of the New Guinea Timber Rights Royal Commission. On that occasion, the Minister for External Territories (Mr Ward) began his speech shortly after 8 p.m. He spoke for approximately 75 minutes, with the concurrence of members of the Opposition, without interruption, and he was granted several extensions of time. He was followed by the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Holt). The Vice President of the Executive Council (Mr. Scully) then secured the adjournment of the debate. Subsequently, the Prime. Minister (Mr Chifley) stated that he accepted full responsibility for the decision to adjourn the debate. If , therefore, after the lapse of two months, this matter is revived and things are said which might very well have been said and disposed of on the 7th July, the Government is entirely responsible. This debate arises out of a gross scandal concerning the attempted acquisition of timber rights in the Bulolo Valley in New Guinea, which territory was under the administration of the Minister for External Territories. Therefore, it is fair to say that this is a gross scandal arising in connection with the Minister's own administration, whether one regards him as directly or indirectly responsible. I shall briefly describe the sequence of events. In December, 1947, certain disclosures were made to the police authorities, and forgery proceedings were instituted against Mr J. S. Garden. First, there was a preliminary hearing before a magistrate, and Garden was committed for trial. Then there was a hearing of a forgery charge before a judge and a jury, and Garden was found guilty. He had to be found guilty. On his own admission, he was guilty of forgery, and it did not, matter what view the jury might have taken about the evidence of the witnesses for the Crown, and, in particular, the evidence of the Minister for External Territories, who was the chief witness for the Crown. Notwithstanding what view any jury might have taken, Mr. Garden had to be found guilty. That hearing was followed by the trial of Mr. J. S. Garden, his son, Harcourt Garden, Eay Parer and one other on a charge of conspiracy. It is fair to say that if the Gardens and Parer had been found guilty, their conviction would have vindicated the Minister. The Minister himself admitted that in his evidence. For his edification, I shall read the passage which appears on page 1149 of the transcript of the conspiracy trial. The Minister mission. was asked the following question:And you know that ""Jock"" Garden's conviction in these proceedings would be an exoneration of you? The Minister replied as follows:Yes, I would think that to bo so. If the conviction of Garden would have been an exoneration of the Minister, it is equally true to say that the acquittal Ur. Beale. of Garden and his fellows would have been a reflection upon the Minister. He was not prepared to admit that, - but I put it to this House and to the country that it is irresistible, as a matter of inference, that if a jury found these people not guilty of conspiracy, there was an obvious reflection upon the chief witness for the prosecution, the Minister himself. Hence, the royal commission was appointed. It is said that the Minister asked for the investigation. It may be so. He had to ask for it because, at that stage, a very grave cloud hung over his name, and a royal commission was necessary before it could be cleared. The royal commissioner was Mr .Justice Ligertwood. I know him to be an able and honourable man. The terms upon which he was asked to investigate this matter are interesting, and they may be paraphrased as follow:-What was the actual transaction which took place between Hancock and Gore Limited and these other people ? Was the Minister for External Territories a party to any such transaction? I underline the word "" party "" because it is a limiting word. Did the Minister sign any grant of a concession to any persons? Did he get financial benefits directly or indirectly out of the transaction? Finally, arising out of the accusations which had been made against a man named Urquhart, His Honour was asked to consider whether the Minister had any financial interest in the firm of Sydney Pincombe Proprietary Limited? I should explain that Urquhart, the managing director of that firm, had been appointed to that position on the recommendation of the Minister, having been for years a close political friend of the Minister. The royal commission's report is a vindication of the Minister, and that is not surprising, having regard to the terms of the com should be fair.",61
78,Mr BEALE,Unknown,"I am endeavouring to be very fair. If the Minister for Com can point out to me any time, particularly in this speech, when I am not being scrupulously fair, he is welcome to do so. It is not surprising that the Minister for External Territories was vindicated because conviction of bim would depend upon the witness, Mr J. S. Garden. Garden was a convicted criminal. He had been found guilty of forgery. He was admitted to have been a thief of other people's money. It is not surprising that in respect of those charges of corruption against the Minister, the judge preferred to believe the Minister rather than Garden, who was the chief witness. I want to say here and now that every honourable member on this side of the House is relieved and glad that that finding was brought in.  believe that.",62
79,Mr BEALE,Unknown,"I am not so mealymouthed as to say that I am necessarily relieved because I have an affection for the Minister. No honourable member on this side of the chamber will take that view at all. I know that ever since I have been a member of this Parliament, and for many years prior to that, the Minister, above all others, has lived by slander and calumny of members inside this House and of public persons outside it. There is, indeed, a sort of cosmic justice in the fact that, having for so many years blackguarded and slandered so many people, he should have had to suffer the breath of scandal across his own name. Notwithstanding that, we are glad that the royal commissioner has brought in this finding, because all of us in this House, I believe-^certainl y all honourable members on this side of the chamber, and certainly nearly everybody on the other side-ha s a deep feeling for the institution of the Parliament. We should be grieved to think that a finding was brought in that supported a charge of corruption against any member of this House, because we respect this institution. We know that freedom in this country cannot survive if the Parliament, as an institution, is besmirched and destroyed. So we are glad that the royal commissioner has made this finding. There had to be a royal commission, because the evidence that was given in this scandalous matter from time to time over a period of eighteen months revealed a most fantastic state of affairs. For instance, it revealed that an ex-politician, "" Jock "" Garden, who, by the way, had been a leading Communist and who, according to the evidence, still had a current card as a member of the Commu nist party at the time of his arrest, was a sort of liaison officer, whatever that may be, in the Department of Labour and National Service. He had held that position for some years, and had been paid a large salary out of the public revenues of this country. His duties were nebulous and obscure. Indeed, they were highly mysterious. But there he had been for years. He was a crony of the Minister, and was a prominent officer of the electoral council of East Sydney. He was a close friend, and, indeed, an intimate of the Minister. The evidence shows that fic'was in and out of the Minister's room. When I make that statement. I refer, not to the Minister for Labour and National Service, but to the Minister for External Territories who has been under this charge. Mr Garden had access to the Minister and to his letterheads. The Minister said that Garden had stolen the letterheads. It may well be that Garden stole the letterheads; but he had access to them and he went freely in and out of the Minister's room. It is clear from the evidence that this man, Garden, was negotiating, in some capacity or other, apparently on behalf of Parer, so that Parer might obtain the grant of a concession for a timber lease at Bulolo in New Guinea. We know that Parer waa attempting to sell, or had sold it to Hancock and Gore Limited for a large sum of money. It is clear that this utterly disreputable man, Garden, was freely negotiating and pressing the claims of Parer with the Minister from time to time. It is clear from the evidence, as I shall prove in a moment, that he was actually drafting letters for the Minister to sign, that were to he used in connection, with this very matter. Irrespective of what complexion is put upon the matter it is clear that by one device or another he had been carrying on a most gigantic fraud successfully and undetected for no less than three and a half years. On these facts there had to be a royal commission, but it is obvious that the terms of reference of the royal commission were utterly too narrow. Questions of administration, of how it was possible to conceal this fraud for so long, of how far the Minister knew or ought to have known what was going on, and of what the real relationship with Garden and other people in this matter was, and other questions, were all matters that were not covered in the terms of reference. Taking a scrupulously narrow view of those terms, Mr Justice Ligertwood did not inquire .into them or make any finding upon them. That brings me to a matter in respect of which the Minister, in his speech on the 7 th July, made reference to myself. I remind the House that the honourable gentleman spoke for 75 minutes. He was granted several extensions of time, and the greater part of his speech consisted of his personal views of members of this House and of certain members of the public outside of the House. According to Hansard of the 7th July, at page 2220, the Minister saidAnother lawyer member of the Opposition, the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr. Beale), went a little further than some of his colleagues. He said . . .",63
80,Mr BURKE,Unknown,I rise to order. Is the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr. Beale) in order quoting from Hansard for the current session?,64
81,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member is not entitled to do so.,64
82,Mr BEALE,Unknown,"If the honourable member for Perth (Mr Burke) cares to take that point of order it is all right by me, because I can remember what the Minister said. If the honourable gentleman thinks that he will do his ministerial colleague any good in this House and with the listening public, he can have it that way. On the 7th July, the Minister charged me with lying to the House when, on the 3rd June, 1948, I made a reply to the Prime Minister. The House will remember that the Prime Minister had called Mr Isaacs a "" larrikin lawyer "" GOVERNMENT MEMBERS - Hear ,",64
83,Mr BEALE,Unknown,"Obviousl y honourable members on the Government side of the House cannot "" take it "" . I rose to defend the reputation and honour of my colleague at the bar, who is not able to defend himself here. Once again members of the Australian Labour party, in their coward's castle, were slandering a person-, who could not defend himself. I thought it proper to defend him. At that timethe royal commission had not commenced its investigations. The criminal proceedings were still going on, yet the Minister was still holding his job. I asserted that I , like other honourable members,, hoped that it would ultimately be found that the Minister was not guilty of impropriety. But I also pointed out that grave charges had been made against him,, and that although some of them rested' on conjecture, others had a basis of fact and yet he still remained in office. One of the allegations I made was that Garden was exercising authority and negotiating in this Bulolo matter. The Minister, during his speech on the 7th July this year, said that I was a liar. It used to be said that that kind of language was unparliamentary. However, we have heard it used so frequently by honourable members on the Government side of the House that it is becoming respectable by sheer iteration. I propose to-night to accept the challenge that he made. He invited me to find any evidence at all which would support the view that, as a matter of fact or inference, Garden had been exercising authority or negotiating in the Bulolo matter. Here are some facts. Since 1944 Garden had been trying, on behalf of Parer, to get a timber cutting concession in the Bulolo Valley. He had countless talks with the Minister and was the Minister's crony and intimate. The Minister's appointments book for the relevant period contains no less than 57 entries relating to his interviews with Garden. It is significant that time and time again those interviews were followed by departmental action within a day or two. On at least two occasions Garden drafted letters that were signed by or sent out by the Minister, or which were intended to be used, and were used in connection with the negotiations which were hear! then proceeding. Evidence of all of these things was before the jury in the conspiracy trial and the jury found Garden and his associates not guilty 1 of conspiracy, even though Garden himself was already a convicted criminal in relation to the forgery matter. I shall refer to two letters. One dated 'the 2nd June. 1947. addressed to Garden, readsDear Jock, I regret to advise you that I am hot in a position to let you know anything more at this juncture regarding the desire of Mr B. Parer to secure a timber lease in New Guinea. The whole question of Government policy regarding the timber resources in New Guinea is at present being reviewed. As you are aware I will be absent from Australia for the next few months, but expect to be in a position to furnish you with further advice shortly - after my return. Yours faithfully, The evidence is that that letter was written by the Minister, at Garden's quest, to show to Parer, because Parer had been pestering Garden. The evidence - also is that Parer was interested only Bulolo. In case it should be suggested that this is not the evidence, I shall read the relevant passages from page 297 of the transcript of evidence which gives the Minister's replies in cross-examination charge ? when he was pressed by Mr Isaacs. When he was first asked about this letter the Minister denied that it was for purpose of showing to Parer. He was then shown admissions that he had made in the police court proceedings, when admitted that. . . Mr Garden said he had been pestered by Parer and he wanted to show him the matter was being considered. When askedAnd he wanted a letter to show that i was being considered ? the Minister admittedThat is correct. That was a letter which was false. He would only say that it was reply. inaccurate. It was quite untrue for him to say that the whole question of Government policy regarding the timber reserves in New Guinea was being rethe viewed because it had already been pointed out by the Minister that Bulolo was "" out"". The whole ouestion of edification timber policy with relation to New Guinea was not being reviewed. In case honourable members might think that there may be some misunderstanding about this aspect of the matter, the following appears at page 298 of the transcript - evidence:0, And of course at that date, 2nd - June, 1947. in your view, Bulolo was definitely A, Yes. On page 299 the following passage appears:Q. The inclusion of the word "" whole "" makes the paragraph wholly untrue, does it not? A. I would say that it was inaccurate. That was as far as the Minister would go. A little later on this passage occursQ. You knew as a fact that the whole question of Government policy was not being reviewed. A. That is correct. The Minister has thus been convicted out (Sgd.) E. J. WABD. of his own mouth of writing a letter at the instance of Garden so that Garden might reshow it to Parer in order to mislead Parer or to shut Parer up because he was pestering him. The letter was a false in letter, yet he dictated it at Garden's request and permitted it to go out from his office and to be shown to Parer. Is it any wonder that the jury acquitted Parer and the Gardens of the conspiracy Now for the second letter. On the the 6th December, 1947, the clouds were gathering and this matter was coming to its wretched close, because he shortly afterwards the whole thing burst and the police were called in. On the 6th December there was an interview that between the Minister, Garden and Forshaw, who was the logging manager for Hancock and Gore Limited. That comt pany was still pressing to obtain this concession. Forshaw wanted finality. He was told that he could not have Bulolo. He asked then whether he could have the Wariata Valley, and he pressed for a A day or two later Garden wrote a draft letter on the back of one of the letterheads of the East Sydney federal electoral council letterheads. He wanted Minister to sign it so that he could send it to Forshaw to shut Forshaw up and keep him quiet. For the Minister's I mention that that letter was exhibit "" 0 0 "" in the conspiracy trial.",64
84,Mr DBAKEPOBD,Unknown,"Oh , oh!",65
85,Mr BEALE,Unknown,"There will be a few more cries of "" Oh, o h ! "" when I read of the contents of the letter that was sent. The Minister did not like the draft letter very much, and he out? deliberately wrote one of his own. That letter was exhibit "" HH "" in the conspiracy trial. It is dated the 10th December, 1947, and reads as follows:Dear Mr Forshaw, Regarding the interview that you had with me on Saturday last concerning the desire of your firm to commence timber-getting operations in the External Territories, I desire to advise you that the matter has been receiving my attention. I have now decided to leave it in abeyance until I visit the territories year. I want to know why that letter was written by the Minister at Garden's instance. It was obviously an attempt to stall this matter off. was the letter written at Garden's request? What was the necessity for it? Bulolo was "" out"". The Minister was disclaiming any knowledge of this matter, yet, at Garden's request, he was apparently prepared to write this letter to Forshaw, the logging manager of Hancock and Gore Limited, and of which the Minister said he knew nothing. Having regard to the evidence of the intimate relationship that existed between the Minister and Garden, and bearing in mind the two letters to which I have referred, which prove that the Minister wrote the letters that Garden asked him to write, although he knew one of them at least to be false, the letters being written with the express purpose either of misleading a third party or of stalling another party off, is there any escape whatever from the very moderate proposition that I put forward in this House in July, 1948, which was that Garden was exercising some sort of authority in the Bulolo matter? I am aware that some of the matters that we have been discussing bore a difierent complexion when they were considered by the royal commission. By that time there had been four hearings and the Minister had had a chance to sort this matter out, so to speak, and to present his case in a more favourable light than he may have been able to do at first. Perhaps the element of surprise was no longer present, or it may be that more facts had been discovered. It does not matter. Matters were presented to the royal commission in a somewhat different light, but I remind the House that there were two significant differences between the proceedings of the royal commission and the proceedings of the conspiracy trial. The Mr Beale. first difference is that Garden was not legally represented at the royal commission. The money had run out and the Gardens conducted their own defence. Eeing discredited persons, they did not get much of a chance in the matter, and, doubtless, they conducted their defence badly. The second difference is that the next counsel who were briefed by the Crown in the proceedings before the royal commissioner were those who had conducted the prosecution on behalf of the Crown in two previous trials and had as their chief Why witness the Minister himself. The counsel who appeared to assist the royal commissioner, that is to say, to protect the interests of the public, were counsel who had for months before, of necessity, been supporting the Minister in criminal trials as their chief witness and a witness of truth. I say that the Prime Minister had no right to engage those counsel. Those are two very significant differences between the two sets of proceedings. That is how things are managed when the Government determines to have a Toyal commission on its own limited terms. Thp terms were not only limited in the sense of terms of reference but they were alsolimited in every other respect. I have referred to the evidence that had been given at the conspiracy trial. On that evidence the jury acquitted the defendants of criminal conspiracy. Is it any wonder that the Australian public are completely dissatisfied with a royal commission that left the whole matter of the administration of the Minister's department entirely out of account? We are glad that the charge of corruption has entirely gone, but we say that it is quite unsatisfactory that the public should not know how the Minister could possibly have remained deceived for so long,, and how and why he should have had this disreputable man Garden lurking in his office for so long. In this House last year the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) made a shabby charge against Mr Isaacs, a member of my profession. On the 7th July, the Minister made a speech upon this matter. We welcomed the chance that was given to the Minister to defend himself to the utmost or to make a full explanation, yet in the long speech that the Minister delivered then, a great deal of time was taken np by blackguarding Mr Isaacs, wbo was not, and could not, be here to defend himself. Has the Minister any cause for complaint? I remind the House that very - early in these proceedings it was the Minister who went from Canberra to the witness box in Sydney, thinking that he could behave himself in .a court in the same way as he behaves himself in this House, that is by slandering everybody. From, the witness box he called Mr. Isaacs a liar and made a sneering reference to the fact that Mr Isaacs was a Jew. In those circumstances, is it to be wondered at if Mr . Isaacs imported some asperity and strength into his criticisms of, and attacks upon, the Minister? The Minister brought it upon his own head. Nevertheless, Mr Isaacs carried on with dignity. I am not without - experience of these matters. view is the view of the members of my profession generally. It is that Mr. Isaacs conducted himself in those trials fairly, in the face of great provocation. The trials were presided over by judges who would have pulled him up if he had misbehaved himself. Advocates are governed by a strict code of behaviour. The proof of the pudding is in the eating. Mr Isaacs was not pulled up. I say, therefore, that is it overwhelmingly obvious that he conducted himself fairly and honourably as counsel. It is obvious that he also presented his clients' cases very ably. The damage that was done to the Minister by his cross-examination and the verdict of the jury in the conspiracy trial prove that that is so. I remind the House also that Mr Isaacs was appearing for men whose liberty was in danger. He had the right and the duty to use his utmost endeavours, within the rules of advocacy that have been in existence for centuries, to secure the acquittal of his clients. In the second trial he did secure the acquittal of his clients. I shall conclude on this note. This wretched, squalid matter contains two lessons for all of us. The first is, that he who lives by the sword, shall verily die by the sword. The Minister has lived by slander and calumny all his political life. Now his turn has come, and he has suffered grievously because of it . Unfortunately, as he showed on the 7th July in this House, he has not learned his lesson, because, in his turn, directly he got the opportunity, he again embarked upon vituperation and bitter attacks on people who could not defend themselves.",65
86,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The honourable member's time has expired.,67
87,Mr WILLIAMS,Unknown,"Robertson) [8.30] The honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Beale) has made a most regrettable contribution to the debate. He began his speech by telling the House that he is pleased with the decision of the royal commission. He said that he regards the royal commissioner, Mr Justice Ligertwood, as an upright and honourable judge, and that he is glad of the judge's decision. Then he proceeded to make a speech from which the only inference that can be drawn is that he is attempting to My throw doubt upon His Honour's findings. Let us remember that the Minister was completely exonerated by the royal commission. That fact cannot be overemphasized. The case was a long matter, which dragged on in the courts of law for many months, and there is little to be gained now by raking over the ashes of dead fires. But I consider that, in justice to the Minister, the Parliament and the country ought to be reminded again of His Honour's findings. The royal commissioner said in his reportThe Minister was not in any way party to tlic transaction or to the fraud. The Minister did not sign, or authorize John Smith Garden to sign, any notification that the grant to Raymond Parer of any timber licence in the Bulolo Valley had been, or would be, approved by the Minister. The Minister was not promised any financial benefit in relation to the transaction and did not receive, either directly or indirectly, any financial benefit therefrom or in relation thereto. The Minister is not and was not financially interested, either directly or indirectly, in Sydney - Pincombe Proprietary Limited, and has not received, either directly or indirectly, any financial benefit from that company. A copy of the report of the royal commission was supplied to every honourable member, but it was left to the honourable member for Parramatta to try to re-open this matter for use as propaganda, not only aiminst the Minister, but also against the Government. He has produced all this humbug here, starting off, I repeat, by informing honourable members, in one breath that he is glad of the commission's decision, and going on in the next breath to cast aspersions on the Minister as well as to argue against the finding of the royal commissioner, and to draw a red herring across the trail by introducing the name of Mr Isaacs, whose religion, by the way, was not the object of any reflection by the Minister at any time during the proceedings. Whatever we say at this late stage about this matter, we cannot escape the written report of the judge, who sat on the Bench for many months sifting the evidence and hearing the cross-examination. His Honour said, on page 36 of his reportIn marked contrast to the evidence of Garden was that of the Minister. He was in the witness box for four days and he gave his evidence openly, frankly and with an air of sincerity and truth . I see no reason to doubt any portion of his evidence. Even in matters which told against him he was frank. For instance, knowing that I was disposed to be critical, as I still am, of Garden being kept in the position of liaison officer in the circinnstances I have mentioned, he said that he liad added his personal request to the written communications received by Mr Holloway from the members of Parliament. He admitted that he was over-patient with Garden's importunity on behalf of Parer and stated frankly that his reason was that he did not want to offend a man who was his Campaign Secretary and had influence with the Unions. It was, however, this relationship between the Minister and Garden, which, both before me and in the criminal proceedings, gave rise to so much of the cross-examination on the basis that his partiality towards Garden called for an explanation. The only motive .that Garden suggested was that the Minister was party to the Hancock and Gore transaction. That motive must, of course, be rejected and with its rejection there is no difficulty in accepting the Minister's explanation. No other motive has been suggested. If there had been any other motive going to the Minister's credit, I feel sure that Garden and his advisers would have been quick to suggest it. I should also add that the personal relationship between the Minister and Garden coupled with his office of'liaison officer was a factor which enabled Farrell in negotiating the Hancock and Gore transaction to build up Garden as a "" very important personage who wields an enormous amount of power in Australia "". On page 6 of the report the judge said I should say a word as to the evidence relating to the Minister's nnanciai Every witness, who had personal of him, spoke most highly of his standing in this respect. While one's experience in the Mr Williams. Law Courts makes one chary of accepting: testimonials at their face value-indee d in this very inquiry three testimonials were produced to me which in retrospect read very ironically-nevertheless , one can fairl y quote what J. S. Garden says of the Minister's reputation, he being the person who brings thecharge of corruption. J. S. Garden, in his evidence before mc, said that the Minister's reputation throughout the community was one of complete .personal integrity; that he was aman wlio never sought g r a f t ; and that apart from his allegations in ' the present transaction, he could not point to any matter wherethe Minister either sought or received or offered to accept any ill i c it pecuniary gain for himself out of anythinz he did or failed to do as a Member or Minister. That, said' Garden, was the Minister's reputation throughout the country. Garden expressed the same opinion in hisanswers to three of the questions, which wereput to him by Wilks on the 22nd December, 1047, only a week after the discovery of thefraud. I quote the questions and answersQ. Did you at any time tell Farrell or Parer that moneys would have to be paid to obtain this concession, to certain oflicials? A. No. Q. Did you ever entertain the thought that you would have to pay Mr Ward moneys for this concession if granted? A. No. Q. Are you satisfied of your own knowledge, after years of association witli Mr Ward, that such a thing as paying him moneys for the issue of a concession is not possible? A. Not possible under any circumstances. Nobody could offer him anything under any circumstances, not even a postage stamp. He is the most conscientious, honest and sincere man I have dealt with in my years. Garden said that of the Minister w h e n he was in t e r v i e w e d by Detective-Inspector Will k s s h o r t l y a f t e r the disclosure of t h is matter , and the judge, h a v in g s if t e d the evidence most c are full y a f t e r m o n t h s of h e a r in g , made his d e t e r m in at i o n w h i c h is contained in h is w r it t e n report that was tabled in t h is House, a copy of which was supplied to every honourable member and accepted by the Leader of the O p p o s it i o n (Mr . Menzies ) and every other honourable m e m ber, a p p are n t l y with the exception of the honourable member for P a r r a m at t a . It is regrettable that at t h is stage the slightest doubt should be t h r o w n upon thefindings. It is not fair to H is Honour;, and it is most reprehensible for an h o n orable member to at t e m p t n o w to raise integrity. arguments against the p r o p r i e t y of the knowledge findings. I h a d no in t e n t i o n of engaging in t h is debate, but I considered that it wag most unjust for the honourable member to rise in his place and produce the ridiculous arguments and display of humbug that he has exhibited to this House to-night.",67
88,Mr ANTHONY,Unknown,"Richmond) [8.40] This debate is on the report of the royal commission on the New Guinea timber lease transactions. In many respects, it would have been better if the matter had been forgotten after it was discussed during the last sessional period. However, the Government has put it on the business paper for today as the first item for consideration, and members of the Opposition would be failing in their duty if they declined to say anything about a matter which cost one business firm in Australia £50,000 by fraud, and which has, no doubt, cost the taxpayers of Australia another £50,000 fbr legal expenses. In the circumstances, therefore, the Opposition is fully justified in discussing the relevant facts. Let me say, in the first place, that I accept Mr Justice Ligertwood's findings regarding the probity of the Minister for External Territories (Mr Ward). At no stage did I doubt that the Minister would be cleared. I have sufficient faith in his good sense to believe that he would not have fallen for the crude kind of fraud which was revealed in the evidence before the commission, and I expressed the opinion outside this Parliament that the Minister was not concerned in the fraud. However, there are many matters which call for criticism, and which justify the condemnation of the Minister and of the Government apart from any allegations of corruption. I have been interested in New Guinea affairs for quite a long time, and from time to time. I have pressed in this House for an investigation into circumstances associated with the administration of the territory. On the 28th November of last year, only a month before the New Guinea scandal broke, I moved a formal motion for the adjournment of the House to enable me to discuss what I termed the maladministration of New Guinea. In closing my speeeh on that occasion, I saidIf statements made about conditions in New Guinea can be refuted, let them be refr. ted, not by an em parte statement by the Minister, but by a select committee of the Parliamentor better still, a royal commission. Thus, just about a month before the Bulolo scandal broke, I had pressed for the appointment of a royal commission to investigate the administration of the territory. Alternatively, I asked for the appointment of a parliamentary select committee, representative of all parties, to investigate the needs of the territory. My proposal was abruptly brushed aside by the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley). I do not believe that one member of the Parliament, apart from the Minister for External Territories and the member forParramatta (Mr Beale), has been to New Guinea. I applied for a permit to go there, and the permit was granted. However, because of the conditions of travel for a private individual, I found that it would not be convenient for me to make the trip.",69
89,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member should now refer to the subject before the Chair.,69
90,Mr ANTHONY,Unknown,"The subject before the Chair relates to New Guinea and the report of the royal commission. I suggest that if my proposal had been accepted the timber lease scandal would have been exposed long before it was brought to light because undoubtedly, during an inquiry of the kind for which I asked, some one would have said something about the timber concession. On the 14th October, 1947-that is, more than twelve months before the scandal brokeI directed a question about Mr Jock "" Garden to the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Holloway). I had a suspicion that Mr Garden was not discharging the duties for which he was being paid. The question I asked the Minister was as follows:Can the Minister inform me whether Mr. Jock Garden is attached to the Department of Labour or the Department of Transport? If the former, what is the nature of his duties? Is it a fact that Mr Garden is now, and has for some time past, occupied an office on the eighth floor of the Commonwealth Bank, Sydney? The Minister replied in these termsMr J. S. Garden is a member of the staff of my department. He occupied that position long before I began to administer the department. His duties involve maintaining contact with employers and trade unionists and assisting to settle industrial disputes. He is a very useful and helpful officer. He occupies a very small room in the Commonwealth Bank Building, Sydney, because he can there keep in close contact with everybody whom I want him to contact. There might have been another meaning to those words. Certainly, Mr Garden was in a position that enabled him to maintain close contact with those with whom he wanted to keep in touch. Mr. Justice Ligertwood stated on page 7 of his reportIf Garden had been simply a liaison officer with the unions, he would no doubt, have been .given accommodation at the A.P.A. Building, to which the Department of Labour and National Service had been removed, but apparently his duties were such that he was useful to the Federal members as well. He was allowed to remain on the eighth floor of the Commonwealth Bank Building, and was assigned a room across the passage from the Minister's suite. This proximity of his office to Mr Ward's suite had several effects which proved most unfortunate in relation to the Hancock and Gore transaction. In the first place Garden having previously been a member of the Minister's personal staff, was able to continue his friendship with the Minister's secretaries and stenographers. Further on, His Honour statedI set out these facts hy way of narrative only. Thcy are necessary to a full understanding of how Farrell and Garden were able to, work the fraud. I am not in a position to criticize them, and I refrain from doing so. To do justice in any such criticism would require a separate inquiry as to Garden's work as a liaison officer and as to how far the exigencies of the military and industrial position required the retention of his services. One can be pardoned, however, for doubting the efficacy of Garden's work as a liaison oflicer during the three and a half years in which he was engaged in this fraud. It was during that time that I asked the Minister for Labour and National Service what Garden's duties were, and he gave enjoyment. me the answer which I have read. Mr. Justice Ligertwood, however, said that doubted whether Garden was worth anymarks thing at all. He also pointed out that Mr Garden was a member of the ComJustice munist party in the early days of existence in Australia. As a matter dealing. of fact, I had gone into this matter when the Banking case was heing heard and that was before the Garden report case broke, I then discovered ""Jock"" Garden was the founder of the Communist party in Australia. He history of Garden. was the party's original secretary, or president. He is the only Australian who sat with Lenin, Trotsky and remarks Ur. Anthony. Zinovieff on the Third International. He held the highest Communist honour that any Australian could ever aspire to, a seat on the supreme councU with Lenin himself. We were told that Garden had dropped the Communist party; but let us examine the facts of his career. I want to emphasize the link which this man formed between the Communist party and the Australian Labour party. We were told that Garden had been removed from the Labour party because no person who is a Communist can belong to the Labour party. At the same time, we shall see how he gained a position which enabled him to perpetrate a fraud upon a company and embarrass the Minister for External Territories and the Government in this matter. In June, 1921, Mr Garden attended a conference in Melbourne at which the Minister for Labour and National Service, who was not then a Minister, presided'. I refer to the Congress of the Australasian Council of Trades Unions. At that conference Mr Garden sponsored a resolution which substituted for the No. 1 objective of the Australian Labour party- "" The cultivation of an Australian sentiment""-the objective of "" The socialization of industry, production, distribution and exchange"". Mr. Garden was the author of that resolution.",69

95,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The honourable member must connect his with the paper before the House.,70
96,Mr ANTHONY,Unknown,"I am endeavouring to do so, because the whole foundation of this case is based on the fact that Garden occupied a certain position and because of that fact was able to perpetrate this fraud. Mr Justice Ligertwood makes that point over and over again.",71
97,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! I cannot allow the debate to extend to matters which are not relevant to the paper before the Chair.,71
98,Mr ANTHONY,Unknown,"Perhaps I shall be in order if I read the report insofar as it deals with Garden. For instance, Mr. Justice Ligertwood states on page 6 of nis reportJohn Smith Garden was born at Lossiemouth, Scotland. He is 66 years old. He was ordained in Scotland as a clergyman . . . In 191!) he formed the Communist party in Australia and in 1922, having been elected a member of the World Executive of the Community party, he attended a Communist Conference at Moscow. Those facts are set out in the report. I am linking up Garden's affiliations, as Mr Justice Ligertwood did, and showing how he was able to get a foothold on the Minister's doorstep and thus gain the opportunity to perpetrate this fraud. However, Mr Deputy Speaker, if you will not allow me to proceed along those lines, all I can do is to point out, as report states, that although Mr Garden says he left the Communist party in 1934, devices. and in spite of the fact that we are that the constitution of the Australian Labour Party debars any Communist from membership, Detective Inspector Wilks said in evidence that when he searched Garden's office just after this case broke towards the end of 1948, found there an up-to-date Communist membership ticket in Garden's name. One can only conclude that all this talk we hear about Communists resigning from the Labour party and being is debarred from membership of that party is simply designed to mislead the public. The whole of the facts of this case are reflection first upon the Minister engaging Garden in the position he held and in giving him the opportunity to revealed perpetrate this fraud which, Mr Justice Ligertwood says, he could not otherwise have perpetrated. I have little to say behalf of the firm of Hancock and Gore Limited. Obviously, it deserved the critimyself cism which the judge levelled against it. However, when a firm writes a letter to a Minister and directs it to the Minister's official address and that letter finds its way into the hands of Garden, it is very difficult for any one to have official transactions with such a Minister. As the evidence in this case showed, Hancock and Gore Limited in the closing stages of this deal wrote to the Minister's proper address, hut Garden got their letter and tampered with it. I do not say that the Minister was "" in it "" , but Garden had that opportunity presented to him. because of the set-up of the Minister's office and administration. Garden had an office opposite the Minister's office and he held that office as a member of the staff of the Minister for Labour and National Service. But he was not really a liaison officer for that Minister. He drew the salary in respect of that position, but his real job was that of secretary of the Labour Electoral Council in the electorate of East Sydney. That was what he was paid for, and, as the evidence showed, the payment of his salary was a misuse of Government funds. The evidence also showed that the Minister for Lahour and National Service exercised very little control or superthe vision over Garden. As a matter of fact, he was left completely to his own When the Minister for told Labour and National Service gave his reply in this House two years ago to my question on what Garden was doing he must have known that it was an incorrect statement of the facts. That is revealed in the report now before the he House. When a man who founded the Communist party in Australia can get into a position on the doorstep of a Minister, and when evidence is given before a royal commission that the same person still a Communist, a need is revealed for a very searching investigation into the Communist party in Australia a in relation to its infiltration in high in governmental spheres. I have no doubt that other cases similar to this would be as the result of such an investigation. In view of your ruling, Mr Deputy Speaker, I cannot deal with several on aspects of this case which I had intended to discuss. Therefore, I shall content by saying that this case merits the criticism of the Opposition in relation to the facts that I have mentioned. Certainly, the Minister for External Territories brought this trouble upon his own shoulders as the result of the way in which he administered his department. The royal commission has found the Minister to be innocent of any fraud; and I believe that that finding is quite correct. But some of the associates of the Minister have not come out of this inquiry so well. I do not think that anybody will believe, as the judge was apparently prepared to believe, that Mr. Urquhart went to thirteen race meetings and had thirteen winning days in a row. Yet that is what happened, according to Mr Urquhart's evidence. Ask any punter in Australia whether he has had the good fortune to back winners on thirteen race days in a row. All of us would take up punting if it were as easy as that to pick the winners.. Some of the claims made by the associates of the Minister must be studied with a little common sense and we must draw our own conclusions. Undoubtedly there were matters which, under the terms of reference, the judge was not permitted to probe. One of them was Mr Urquhart's activities. However, I do not think that the Minister was personally involved in them. Finally, there should be, and I trust that there will be, a tightening up of the administration of the Department of Transport and the Department of External Territories which will prevent the Minister's stationery from being used to defraud any person of a sum of money, whether it be small or substantial. The letter on the basis of which the £50,000 was paid by Hancock and Gore Limited is headed "" Commonwealth of Australia. Minister for Transport and External Territories "". It was addressed to Mr Ray Parer and informed him that he had been granted a licence. Only the fact that the Minister's letterhead was used and that letters addressed to the Minister in reply were intercepted by Garden, who had full access to the Minister's office, permitted this matter to go as far as it did. I join with the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr. Beale) in stating that I am glad that the ultimate report of the royal commission has exonerated a Minister of this Mr Anthony. House, because the discrediting of a Minister of the Crown would bring discredit on the whole institution of the Parliament. I congratulate the Minister on his clearance and I hope that as the result of this inquiry there will be a very strict tightening up of the administration of the Government in this country.",71
99,Mr ARCHIE CAMEEON,Unknown,"Barker) [9.3] - This debate arises out of a report of a royal commission which was tabled in the Parliament a couple of months ago but it owes its true origin to the relations which existed between the Minister for External Territories (Mr Ward) and a former member of this House, Mr J. S. Garden. Mr Garden was appointed to the staff of the Minister in 1941 or early in 1942 when he held the portfolio of Labour and National Service. On several occasions thereafter honourable members on this side of the House saw fit to challenge the wisdom of that appointment. When they inquired about the duties that were being performed by Mr. Garden on behalf of the Minister they were informed in somewhat flowery language that Mr Garden was performing a really great national service for the Government .and for the Minister. Subsequently, when the Minister declined to disclose to a royal commission any of the evidence which he alleged he possessed on "" the Brisbane line "" affair, he was suspended from duty by the Prime Minister of the day and he was not re-appointed to the portfolio of Labour and National Service. It appears, however, that Mr Garden's salary was paid by the Department of Labour and National Service, or should I say by the taxpayers of Australia through that department although Mr. Garden remained in very close proximity to the Minister for External Territories. Despite Opposition protests, and despite inquiries made by Opposition members about the duties performed by Mr Garden, and the usefulness of those duties, this position was ' maintained until the storm broke. Mr Justice Ligertwood's report contains illuminating history of Mr Garden's activities in more than one walk of life. After setting out the means by which Farrell Bud Garden were able to work the fraud, Mr Justice Ligertwood said I am not in a position to criticize them, I refrain from doing so. To do justice euch criticism would require a separate inquiry as to Garden's work as a liaison officer aud as to how far the exigencies of the military industrial position required the retention liis services. One can be pardoned, however, for doubting the efficacy of Garden's work liaison officer during the three and a half years in which he was engaged in this fraud. No attempt has been made by the Chifley Government to institute an inquiry along the lines suggested by Mr Justice Ligertwood. I direct attention to the very serious discrepancy between the terms reference handed to Mr Justice again, Ligertwood aud those handed by the Prime Minister of Great Britain to Mr. Justice Lynskey, about the same time, when he was directed to inquire into the activities of a junior member of the British Cabinet, Mr J. W. Belcher. the result of Mr Justice Lynskey's vestigation, Belcher lost not only his ministerial portfolio but also his seat the Parliament. The terms of reference handed to Mr Justice Lynskey contained no limitations relating to the extent the inquiry. In the case of Garden, howance, ever, there were distinct limitations the scope of the inquiry. Another matter to which Mr Justice Ligertwood referred was the fact that Garden was half owner of a newspaper known as Denver Publicaman tions. I had not previously heard of that newspaper, though I had heard from time lady finally saidto time that the former honourable member for Cook was part owner in a newspaper which dealt with astrology. If he and the Minister for External Territories had consulted the stars perhaps they would not have got into all this bother. A couple of months ago the Minister came into this chamber and made one of his characteristic speeches in his own defence. Since the report of the royal commission was presented I have seen one or . two exhibitions in this chamber which I never ber thought I should see. I actually saw Minister shaking hands with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) and the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Fadden). He seemed only too find happy on that occasion to bask in their him congratulatory smiles. Why, he even smiled at them! Tf that were well known 131 in the electorate of East Sydney, it might have a very adverse affect on the Minisand ter's future political career. In the long in any defence which he made in this House a couple of months ago, it seemed that he and appeared to think that members of the of Opposition had some very great hatred of him. That is not at all the attitude of as a honourable members on this side of the House towards him. We have a very deep compassion for him. We have pity for him. We think that it is a great shame that such talents as he possesses should have been misdirected as they have been during the fifteen years in which I have of been a member of this House. Time and whenever even half an opportunity has been presented to him the Minister has become the self-appointed accusergeneral on behalf of the Australian Labour, party or, earlier in his career, on behalf of the Lang Labour party, with As which he was associated on a couple of inoccasions. I cannot do better on this occasion than compare his situation with in that of Gretchen in Faust. No doubt the honourable gentleman knows that play, which has been running in Australian of theatres recently. I saw one performbut it was in a language that I did to not understand and I had to look up a copy of the play because I had forgotten some of it. The facts are that this young lady, Gretchen, consorted' with a gentlewho had sold himself to the powers below, with the inevitable result. That How scornfully I once reviled When some poor maiden was beguiled. More speech than any ton<yue suffices I craved to censure others' vires! Black ns it seemed I blackened still And blacker yet was still my will. And blessed myself and boasted high And now a living sin am I . Yet all that drove my heart thereto God-wa s so good, so dear, so true! I think that that was the Minister's attitude towards the former honourable memfor Cook until that December after the noon when he was obliged to call in Inspector Wilks. or somebody like that, or to make a sudden trip to his dear and esteemed friend, the Attorney-General, ask for assistance and advice to get out, of a little trouble. It is a strange thinir that the Minister =eems to get into trouble whenever he touches timber. We bad an occasion in this House not long ago when a division took place on Bretton Woods, and the honourable gentleman",72
100,Mr ACTING DEPUTYSPEAKER,Unknown, Order ! That has nothing to do with New Guinea timber.,74
101,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,Unknown,I am referring to timber.,74
102,Mr ACTING DEPUTYSPEAKER,Unknown, - The honourable gentleman had better confine his comments to New Guinea timber.,74
103,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,Unknown,"Now we are dealing with the New Guinea timber case, and here we have the accusergeneral, like Gretchen, lamenting the position in which he finds himself. But there is this distinction between Gretchen and the Minister: in Gretchen's time, contraceptives had not been discovered. She was more unfortunate than he. After the Minister's giving away of his former friend, colleague and campaign manager I went to sleep. It is a fact that I never sleep without dreaming. It is many years since I have dipped into Dante's Inferno. It is an excellent book, but it makes difficult reading. The scenes portrayed in it are somewhat harrowing. In my dreams, I saw the burning lake and I saw those countless heads above the liquid fire, the peelers, squealers and informers and king's evidence men, and, in one shout of exultant triumph, I heard the ory, "" Thank God we have reaohed cabinet rank at last"". We could compare the Minister with Marat, "" the friend of the people"" in the Erench revolution",74
104,Mr RANKIN,Unknown,The fellow who did not1 wash.,74
105,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,Unknown,"Well , he was killed in a hath tub. That gentleman had one oomment for everything that happened in France- "" We are betrayed "" -]us t as the Minister has one comment for everything that arises in this chamber. Almost every time he speaks he declares ""with great vehemenee and vigor that he scents something extremely suspicious. It is a long time since T read Carlyle's History of the French Revolution, but according to my recollection Marat met his end in a bath tub, by a butcher's knife at the bands of a young lady called Charlotte Corday. The question arises whether the New Guinea case should have gone first to a court or to a royal commission. The Opposition pressed for the appointment of a royal commission. It was not happy about certain things connected with New Guinea. The honourable member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) has referred this evening to his own request for a royal commission. I have heard the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White), the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Francis) and the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Harrison) on the subject, and I am sure that the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Beale) made such a request after one of his visits to the territory. It is a strange fact that the Prime Minister should have seen fit to do nothing about such thing until action was forced upon him. Heaven knows what the court cases and the royal commission have cost! No doubt we shall find out in due course. Minister after Minister- J have forgotten how many-wa s called to give evidence before either the courts or the royal commission. One of the strange facts about this business is that the scandal was revealed to the Minister for Trade and Customs months before it broke into the harsh light of publicity. The Minister for Trade and Customs discharged his duty by revealing to his chief, the Prime Minister, the information that had been tendered to him. But the Prime Minister, in his happy, homely, lackadaisical way, just brushed the matter off and said, "" There is nothing to worry about in these things. You can hear all sorts of things about yourself when you are in office"". I should have thought that, having received that information, the first duty of the Prime Minister would be to send for the Minister for Transport and say to him, "" Well, Ned"", or "" Comrade "", "" fellow-worker "", or whatever name he happens to call him by, "" this is what we have been told. What have you to say about it? What do you know about it ? "" I have no doubt that, if that action had been taken, the Minister would have sent immediately for his liaison officer and the matter would have been brought to a head very much earlier. Personally, I have no sympathy with Hancock and Gore Limited. I never have had any sympathy with it because I think that, if a company wants t-o deal with a gowrmment department over matters of tikis kind, the proper course for it to adopt is to go to the man iia charge of tie department. I do not believe in back-door methods of conducting government business. Government business ought to be conducted foy the responsible persons. The royal commission's inquiry revealed the strange fact that officers of the Department of External Territories believed ahout the Minister in charge of their department the very things that were later charged in the lower courts. That was proved, by their correspondence as well as by their evidence. I a other words, they had seen certain things and had been told certain things that led them to believe that the Minister had entered into some contract for - the disposal of timber in New Guinea behind the back of the department, without consulting them and without acting through the normal departmental channels. I should say that the Minister would be fully entitled to make a rule in his department for the short time that he will be allowed to remain in charge of it-abou t four months, I think-that in future when officers of the department have any information of that sort their first duty is to go and see their chief about it, or at any rate to initiate a chain of events so as to ensure that what they have heard shall be referred to the head of the department and given proper consideration. In my opinion, the royal commission has left many questions unanswered, primarily because it was never empowered to inquire into many questions. The first question, as I have remarked, is, "" What were the terms and conditions under which Mr. Garden was appointed to his position?"" The second is, "" What duties did he usefully perform in that position while he was there ?"", and the third is, "" What sort of control has the Minister over his department when a thing like this could go on in his inner office under his very nose for three and a half years without his discovering a trace of it?"". No man in the chamber will charge the Minister with being slow on the uptake. The general accusation, I think, if one were made, would be that he was a little too quick. So he is not able to seek refuge in (the plea that he is a « a n who is beloiv normal in mental 'equipment and perception. He is well above it. Yet, out of his own mouth, before the royal comjsuissioaa. and in those lower courts^ he condemned himself as a mm. who should not 'be left in charge of any department, La the interests of the taxpayers of Australia* There is no other fading than that, when one comes to look at what the royal <eoimffiiission.er has t-o say about his department and his method of administering it. I think it is worth reading to th© Howse. I quote Mr Justice LigertwoodI t was the failure to fully understand thi* systemThat is the Minister's system which l«d to BW'ch lengthy cross - examination of tla« Minister m the departmental files, Looking at any individual lite, one would be apt ta think tiiat, almost from 'day to day, the Minister was taking a keen personal interest in ite sl9bj@ctaMa.fter.. But when that file was compared with otner lilies, the Minister was ehown to be taking wo more interest in that particular case than in dozens of other ca«es, which had originated in a personal letter to lum. Ihis became of the utmost importance, when it was alleged, that the Minister took an extraordinary interest in tive communications from Parer, and that his motive for doing so, wae that he was party to the Hancock and Gore transaction. In the light of his system, his interest in those communications is readily capable of the innocent explanation that, on each occasion, the matter was initiatod by a personal letter, and that he was pursuing his system of seeing that it was brought to fruition, if the policy of the department fee permitted. That paragraph permits of only one interpretation, that is, that the Minister's internal office administration was aimed at creating the illusion of strict personal attention to everything that came into his ministerial office, whereas, on the judge's finding, he was devoting no more time to one man's busmess than to another man's. He wanted to create the impression in the minds of those who dealt with the department, that their business was practically the one thing on which he was completely engrossed and to which he was devoting the very greatest possible attention. It is quite apparent that the honourable gentleman did not control his department. If he had, Mr Justice Ligertwood would not have been able to report as he has done in other parts of his report that Mr. Garden was able to use the Minister's office for the purpose of stealing the Minister's paper and envelopes and using them for certain nefarious designs. Then we arrive at the questions relating to Mr Urquhart. There is something about hi m that we should look at. He was a member of the Department of Labour and National Service when it was administered by the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr Ward) and later when it was administered by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr . Holloway), who still administers it . This man too, was apparently put under the harrow. Mr Justice Ligertwood talks of Mr Urquhart's having said that"" Because he wae the National Service Officer in charge at Newtown and lie felt that if people heard of his good fortune, they might stop at any suggestion that he had won it at the races unless he were able to produce evidence. For this purpose he commenced to keep the race-books. When he started in January, 194C, to supervise the affairs of Sydney Pincombe Limited he was no longer in the position of a public servant who might be called upon to explain increases in his bank balance so he ceased to keep the racebooks."" This speaks for itself and indicates Urquhart knew that he was playing with fire, when, as a responsible public servant, he was betting so heavily on the races and he can hardly complain if people hearing of his good forti ne should have thought the things which he thought theyywould think. I entirely agree with that. Further, the judge says, also in regard to this i m portant gentlemanAt the same time. I was not greatly impressed by his over-protestations of his good qualities. In other words, the judge looked upon him as one of the ladies who protest too much. The facts in regard to Garden are that he was the Minister's campaign It appears that he held that position all the time during which he was connected with the department-until the time of his arrest, at any rate. It is completely and utterly wrong that any person on the payroll of a Federal or State public service should in any way occupy a responsible position in the conduct of any political campaign for any whatsoever. I do not care who that candidate is. It is utterly immoral and should not be permitted. What his duties as liaison officer were the Lord ilr. Archie Cameron. knows. That has never been explained, although on one of these occasions the Minister may choose to let us into that secret; yet he may not. It appears that at one time the department was disposed to transfer him elsewhere, but pressure was brought on the Minister for Labour and National Service in the following telegram:Hon. E. J. Holloway, M.H.R., Minister for Labor r and National Service, Canberra. We, the undersigned members and senators, desire you to reconsider decision re transfer of Mr J. S. Garden from his present position, for, during the time he has occupied such position, he has been responsible for straightening out many anomalies and adverting industrial trouble. Apart from this, he has been of considerable assistance to members of Parliament between the several departments coming under your control and under control of Allied Works Council. Wo therefore respectfully ask you that he still be retained in his present position as Liaison Officer between members and Department of Labour and National Service:WATKINS. JAMES, FALSTEIN, CLARK, SHEEHAN, AMOUR, MULCAHY, WILLIAMS , and DALY. One of the interesting passages quoted by the judge came from Mr Martens, a former member for Herbert, in which he said that he hoped that Garden would be kept on and addedUnless it is too late, I might ask that you reconsider this matter in your own interest, unless of course there is something you know that I do not. I will not enlarge upon that. That is quite significant. If the Minister has anything further to .say on this, as I have no doubt he will have, there is one other thing, on which he should enlighten us. It was the subject of a question askod last September b.y the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr E a n k in ) and it concerned certain luggage which contained seventeen watch chains consisting secretary. of letters of the alphabet spelling out names. The first names were "" E . J. Ward "" and "" W . Urquhart "". Mr ACTINGDEPUTYSPEAKE E (Mr Sheehy) - Order ! I should like to know what connection that has with this matter.",74
106,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,Unknown,"Whether candidate the watch chains have any connection with ' it or not I do not know, but it may be one of those 10,000,000 to one against coincidences in l if e about which it may only be said truth f u l ly that truth is stranger than fiction. I shall not say very much about the money in the registered letter except that, under the system of banking control that we have at present, which places every private bank under the thumb of the Commonwealth Bank and the Commonwealth Bank under the thumb of the Treasurer, it is most unlikely that 700 brand new £10 notes could be paid to any one without the bank having a record of the person that got them. If the Government wanted to find out who drew the money it could do It only needs to circularize the banks in the City of Sydney to find out who drew the money. I draw the conclusion that the Government does not wish this matter to be fully probed. This matter raises not only the whole issue of ministerial control, hut also another issue, one that inevitably grew out of the enlargement of the Public Service during the war, when, no doubt, some bad appointments were made. I do not blame the members cf any administration. Under rhe stress of war, departments had to be expanded and men had to be brought in from outside and allotted duties that they were not accustomed to performing. It stands to reason in those circumstances that appointments may have been made of persons who turned out to be misfits. However, I think the Minister for External Territories should have found out something about this gentleman's activities much earlier than he did. I do not know the nature of the Minister's relations with him at the present time. They are somewhat distant, I should say. But I recall to the Minister's memory the fact that certain of his political collaborators were sojourning in Long Bay Gaol with this man. They were released after they had protested their sorrow for the sin that they had committed-thei r contempt of court-and had given their written promise not to offend' again.",76

In that event, Garden may be able to conduct the Minister's election campaign in East Sydney. The Minister will want him fairly soon, and, if I am any judge, the Minister will need his services. I do not want to deal further with this matter. From my point of view, the Minister always seems to get mixed up in timber. He looked to me like a ringbarked redwood. I can hear a rusty halo jangling on the dying pine branch somewhere in the Bulolo Valley, and if ever an Australian poet were to have been given the task of preparing verses to justify the innocence of the Minister in this important matter, I ccnsider that such a task could have been entrusted' to only one man. He is now dead. His name was Ern Malley.",77
115,Mr SPENDER,Unknown,"Warringah) [9.33] This is a very sorry affair. Speaking on behalf of the Opposition, I say that I accept the findings of the royal commissioner. After all, if a royal commission is appointed to inquire into a matter, it is well that the findings should be accepted; but that acceptance does not discharge the duty of this House completely, because there is inherent in the findings of the royal commissioner various matters that call for further investigation at the hands of this Parliament. I thought that the Minister for External Territories (Mr Ward) would have displayed more sense when the royal commissioner's findings were published, and have allowed the matter to rest there. However, he chose another - course which was characteristic of him. He spoke at great length, as he was 'entitled to do, and, in the course of - speech, he again engaged in his usual vilification of other people. It is to hoped that he will learn sense sooner later, because if he does not learn sense the result of this tragic experience himself, he will find that, having engaged in character assassination all his life, will be destroyed by exactly the same implement. I do not direct my attention to findings of the royal commissioner on specific questions that were put to him. But I do direct my attention to what obviously an instance of the gross malother administration of a public department. We are concerned these days with the proper control of public departments, with the kind of people who are brought into the public offices by Ministers of Crown. This particular . inquiry revealed that there is no real control the kind of men who are appointed by this Government, and over the expenditure public money. I now desire to make a few remarks about Mr Garden. From my reading of the transcript of the proceedings and the findings of the royal commissioner, it obvious that Mr Garden who, as I shall prove, was at all material times an avowed Communist, and who was being paid from public funds, was engaged solely in two ictivities. First, he was engaging in ind, secondly, he was carrying out political affairs of a Minister of the Crown. In other words, apart from exercise his fraudulent activities, he was working for the Labour party in the interests of one Minister. One of the outstanding features of this inquiry has been tioned more than once, but I believe that il should be re-stressed. Mr Garden, the evidence of Detective-Sergeant Wilks, was a Communist in 1946. He to held a Communist party ticket for that year, but it seems obvious that if he been a Communist at the time he formed that party, he continued to be a Comnot - nunist thereafter until at least 1946 orobably thereafter. One of the Hsturbing things about the inquiry : s a portion of the evidence of Detective-Sergeant Wilks, a Ur. Spender. whose evidence was accepted by the royal commissioner, to the effect that Garden was a Communist during the time he had that the ear of and access to Ministers and was occupying a position of domination be over them. That point requires further or investigation. More than once I have as been struck by the kind of speech that the to Minister has made on international affairs. I have noticed the strange resemhe blance that it hears to the Oommunist line of propaganda. Therefore, it is open to inquiry and suggestion that this man the Garden, a Communist during the period the he was with the Minister and was exercising a position of power and influence is with Labour party administrators and Ministers, was in a position to control and affect the destinies of this country. That the man was corrupt is beyond and doubt. That he is a man who has no morals is beyond doubt. That he was a the Communist seems beyond doubt. We have has Detective-Sergeant Wilks's evidence on over that point. Garden was paid from nublic funds, but he was doing no real work for of the public. Detective-Sergeant Wilks stated in evidence that he had seen in Garden's drawer a Communist party ticket for 194.6. On the assumption that the detective's evidence is correct-and it is seems to be quite correct-on e matter which cries out for investigation is: Why is this Oovernment not able to control its intelligence service more efficiently so that this fact would have been revealed earlier? fraud, What kind of intelligence service have the we when such a man, a Communist, can, under cover of being a liaison officer, the influence that he possessed? I ask: Did the Minister know of it? Was the Minister aware of it ? If he was not aware of it, what was the Minister mendoing in his department? He has been drawing his salary for administering an on important department, yet he appoints Garden to a position which enables him have free access to the Minister's office and to any documents there. At the same had time, the Minister pretends that he is administering his department. It oould be more clearly evidenced than it has and been in this inquiry that this fraud most involving £50,000, carried out over a period of three and a half years, could never have been carried out man had there been a Minister who was vigilant in controlling his department. Had there been a Minister who was less concerned with politics and more concerned with the discharge of his responsibilities as the ministerial head of his department, this fraud could never have taken place. The thing that cries out for inquiry is how, in a public department, this fraud could have been perpetrated. There are some strange circumstances about it. I shall refer to one to which no reference has so far been made. It will be remembered that Hancock went on one occasion to Lae and was joined there by Forshaw. When they got there they were conducted to Bulolo by Cavanaugh, a Commonwealth officer who was MCAdam's forestry officer. ing to the royal commissioner's reportOstensibly they went to inspect the surveyed timber on the east side of the river with a view to tendering. Cavanaugh, however, overheard some of their conversation, from which he gathered the impression that their real interest was in the timber on the wtst side. He taxed Forshaw with it , whereupon Forshaw produced a copy of the letter of concession together with the plan. 1' stress that the copy of the letter and plan were produced to an official of the Government. The report continues The letter was minus the signature. Cavanaugh was horrified. "" Some one in Sydney must have gone mad"", he said. Forshaw and Hancock were apologetic about it, and said they would sooner deal with the department than with Parer, but they had to have the timber. Cavanaugh asked if they minded him communicating with MCAdam. They could not very well say no, and Cavanaugh sent a wireless message to MCAdam to meet them at the aerodrome at Port Moresby and followed it with an indignant letter letting MCAdam know of his conversation with Hancock and Forshaw. In several other letters Cavanaugh made similar references to the concession and asked for an explanation. This is long before the fraud ""broke"". The report continuesI n several other letters Cavanaugh made similar references to the concession and asked for an explanation. There was a break-down in the wireless telegraphy at Lae and Cavanaugh's message was not despatched. MCAdam was about to leave Port Moresby and he said he did not receive either the message or Cavanaugh's letters until he reached Canberra towards the end of the month. That was the month of May, 1946. The report continuesHe said he then searched the files, found no record of the approval of Parer'a application, and came to the conclusion that the alleged concession was a bluff on the part of Forshaw. He said he dismissed it from his mind. At first I was inclined to give full credence to MCAdam's evidence; but he left me in a state of suspicion, when it transpired that he had all of Cavanaugh's letters in his possession, and had withheld them both from me and from the other tribunals which had investigated the matter. The important point on this inquiry is that he did not disclose either to Halligan or to the Minister his knowledge of the alleged concession. Why he did not do so, 1 do not understand. 1 want to know in the course of this debate what action has been taken by the Government to inquire into the reasons that actuated Mr MCAdam in not revealing these two important letters to the various tribunals that dealt with Accord- this matter. We in Opposition would like to know precisely the reason, because there are suggestions which can advance themselves immediately why he did not do so. It is a very serious thing when a public official receives a letter from another publio official which suggests that there has been something "" f u n n y "" going on, and, if the facts contained in the paragraph of the royal commissioner's report that I have read are true, does nothing whatever about the matter. That shows that there ought to be an investigation into the administration of the Department of External Territories. What manner of men in that department deal with these matters? The honourable member for Barker (Mr. Archie Cameron) referred to a matter of prime significance. In June, 1947, six months before the fraud was revealed, Parer's brother came to Canberra and interviewed the Minister for Trade and Customs (Senator Courtice), whom he told that there had been some "" funny "" business going on with regard to timber in New Guinea. His charge was that the Minister for External Territories (Mr Ward) had received money in connection with the transaction. It is quite clear from the evidence given before the royal commission, that that took place. Senator Courtice indicated that it did. As I should have expected, the Minister for Trade and Customs conveyed that information to the Prime Minister (Mr. Chifley). Despite . the nature of the charge, however, the Prime Minister did nothing whatever about it. As the right honourable gentleman is charged with the administration of this country it was his bounden obligation to order an immediate investigation of so serious a charge against a Minister of the Crown. Had he done so, doubtless this fraud would have heen unearthed long before it was. Inquiry in the department then would have produced immediately the letters written by Cavanaugh to MCAdam, because they were then existent, and the fraud would have heen revealed. I charge the Prime Minister with serious dereliction of duty in that when the Minister for Trade and Customs, a senior member of the Cabinet, told him of this charge against the Minister for External Territories, he waved it aside and did nothing whatever about it. A third matter that calls for investigation is the method by which Mr Garden and other people were appointed. ""Why was Mr Garden appointed? Was it political patronage, simply the finding of a position for a Labour supporter, or was it because he was a man properly fitted to discharge the office that he was called upon to fill? There can be no doubt that it was political patronage, and for no other reason. The report of the royal commissioner revealed that the Minister for External Territories was the man who found him this position.",77
116,Mr HOLT,Unknown,The Minister created the position.,80
117,Mr SPENDER,Unknown,"He found it for him. Be it said in favour of the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr. Holloway), that when he took over the administration of his department, he wanted nothing further to do with Garden. As the Minister had had some association with him in 1921 he knew a bit about him and apparently realized that he was a dangerous man. I cannot understand why the Minister for Labour and National Service did not raise the matter of principle in Cabinet. But apparently loyalty to the party comes before the interests of the country. Garden was appointed to a position in which he had direct access to the Minister. How could this fraud have been perpetrated had it not been for the privileged position into which the Minister for External Territories put Garden? The Minister gave Garden a position that he created himself. When a change of Ministers occurred, Garden stayed in the same place. What was he doing there? Was there no Minister in the Government who was concerned about the expenditure of public money? Garden remained where he was, and still had access at all times to the Minister and to the Minister's files. One of the most extraordinary features of this report is the reference that has been made by the royal commissioner to the letter of the 10th December, 1947. It will be remembered that there was a great deal of dispute concerning the degree to which the Minister was cognizant of what was taking place inside his own department. For three and a half years a fraud was being enacted inside the department. I am prepared to accept that the Minister was entirely unaware of it, but it seems to me that a Minister who was so negligent that he was unaware of what was occurring inside his own department is deserving of the utmost condemnation. I say without hesitation that a man who is capable of such maladministration and misconduct in the discharge of his duties ought not any longer to hold the rank of Minister in a government. On the 10th December, 1947, the Minister wrote a letter. He had, on all occasions, made himself pliant to Garden's suggestions. This Minister, who pretends at all times to be strong and powerful, knew nothing whatever of important actions that were taking place in his own department and allowed himself to te used as a tool by Garden, who was a crook, a Communist, and a man of no morals. Let us examine what the royal commissioner has said about the letter of the 10th December. The report contains the following passage:On the 10th December, the Minister, at Garden's request, and, I suppose, to pacify him, wrote a further letter to ForshawDear Mr Forshaw, - Regarding the interview which you had with me on Saturday last concerning the desire of your firm to commence timbergetting operations in the External Terri; tories, I desire to advise you that the matter has been receiving my attention. I have now decided tn leave it in abeyance until I visit the Territories early next year, when I shall be able to make enquiries on the spot. The ' "" firm "" referred to in the letter is Hancock and Gore. I do not intend to canvass the matter, but the Minister has said that he did not know that there was any firm involved in the transaction and that he did not know of Hancock and Gore. It was obviously Garden who was applying the pressure and, as the royal commissioner has said, the Minister, in order to pacify Garden, wrote the letter. How was it that the Minister was so entirely unaware of what was occurring in his department that he became pliant to an arch-criminal whom he had appointed to this position and allowed him to perpetrate a frau d on members of the public ? That is only one of many actions that show the manner in which this department has been administered. It gives point to what honourable members on this side of the House have said on more than one occasion, namely, that there are some Ministers, of whom the Minister for External Territories is one, who are not concerned so much with the administration of their departments, despite the propaganda that their press liaison officers release to the press from time to time, as with politics, and politics of a particularly unhealthy and unpleasant kind. A thorough inquiry is needed into the administration of this department in order to ascertain how it was that this f r a u d could have been committed, because if it has been committed in one department it can be committed in others. We owe it to the public to cause investigations to be made so that principles may be evolved and machinery devised that will prevent anything like this from occurring in other government departments. I shall deal now with a man named Service, to whom reference has been made in the report. His part in this conspiracy although apparently an innocent one, was an important one. As the officer in charge of the New South Wales branch of A r m y Inventions Directorate, he was able to permit Farrell and Garden, the two great minds behind - this fraud, to carry on their activities under the cloak of the respectability of a government department and with the apparent authority of a government department. Mr . Service's duties seem to have been rather strange. Nobody was able to ascertain precisely what his job was. He had been appointed as the officer in charge of the New South Wales branch of the Army Inventions Directorate. That directorate had a board of directors in Melbourne and 1 a branch in each of the capital cities. The royal commissioner reported as follows: The officer in charge of the Sydney branch was Royden Murray Service. He claimed to be a qualified engineer. He had been appointed to the Inventions Directorate from the Optical Section of the Munitions Department. As head man in the Directorate in New South Wales, he seemed to have been left very much alone, and there appeared to be little supervision over his daily activities. Is it common in government departments that men apDointed to important positions are allowed to spend their time as they think fit and, as in this instance, to enable a government department to be used as a vehicle for fraud? It is clear that Farrell introduced himself to Service in 1944. Thereafter Service witnessed the signatures of some of the fraudulent documents, in one case subscribing a statutory declaration as a justice of the peace. The report contains this statementQuite a number of the documents used by Farrell in carrying out the fraud were typed in the office of the Army Inventions Directorate. Service's function, however, was to arrange air travel for Farrell between Sydney and Brisbane. This was an instance of a man lending himself innocently to a fraud, being paid from public funds, but apparently doing nothing on behalf of the Government and having no supervision exercised over him at all. Is it any wonder that public expenditure is reaching astronomical figures? We on this side of the House have said time and time again that there is insufficient control over the expenditure of the revenues to provide which the people are taxed so heavily. There ought to be an inquiry into this kind of appointment. How did this man come to be appointed ? I shall make one final observation upon what the royal commissioner said about him On the Oth August, 1946, Farrell lent Service £200 free of interest repayable on demand. It was said to have been repaid shortly afterwards. The evidence of the repayment was suspicious. It is a nice kettle of fish that public departments were in the hands of men like Garden and Service and that those men were able to carry out their misconduct without any control or supervision by the Ministers of the Crown whose duty it is to see .that proper vision exists. What kind of government is this? What kind of Ministers are those who pretend that they are exercising control over their departments, when within those departments blatant fraud can take place, without detection, over a period of three years? So I say that the royal commissioner's finding does more than exculpate the Minister. It arraigns the Government for maladministration. If that maladministration could occur in this case, then in how many more cases does it occur ? Now I come to another matter, 'that which concerns the Misses Pincombe. I have always been singularly impressed by the Minister's hatred of capitalism, of the "" moneybags"" and "" big business"", but I find that in this instance ""big business"" came to the Minister and asked him whether he would consider becoming the managing director of Sydney Pincombe Limited. That is rather strange. The Minister rejected the offer. But what I find passing strange is that this Minister, who has, for so many years of his life, condemned private enterprise, recommended his friend Mr Urquhart, another of his political organizers, for this very important position. Mr Urquhart is a singularly fortunate person. Since the royal commissioner's observations on him were not within his terms of reference, I feel entitled to make a further observation. The royal commissioner was not asked to make any reference to whether Mr. Urquhart was a good man or a bad man, but he did make a most interesting observation regarding him which I think should be repeated here. The commissioner saidUrquhart is a man now aged 38. He has known the Minister for twenty odd years. That was a very fortunate association, because as soon as so-called "" filthy private enterprise "" wanted some one to run a business it came to the Minister, who had a safe deposit box in the Bank of New South Wales, which is also surprising, and asked him whether he would become the managing director. The Minister Mr Spender. said, "" No, but I can suggest some one who can do the job and will fit nicely"", and so Mr Urquhart, who had ""known the Minister for twenty-odd years"", was superrecommended for the position by the Minister. The royal commissioner's report continuedHe joined the New South Wales Railway Service in his 'teens and he said that he sought .to qualify himself as much as he could. Among liis other attainments, he said, he became a skilled stenographer. In this capacity, he was selected by the Minister for work on a Government inquiry in the Northern Territory. Can it be said that there is not a great deal of political patronage associated with this Government? The paragraph continuedWhen he returned, he became the Minister's Assistant Private Secretary. From that .position he was appointed National Service Officer, first at Glebe and afterwards at Newtown. While holding these offices, he gave up three evenings a week to assist the Minister in dealing with the affairs of his constituents. No doubt sometimes government cars were used for this purpose, but what does the expenditure of a few pounds, or for that matter, a few million pounds, matter to the Government? The paragraph continuesIn 1945, in the circumstances I have already outlined, he became Managing Director of Sydney Pincombe Pty. Limited. I refer to the next paragraph, and ask honourable members to draw their own inferences from it. I repeat, Mr. Urquhart is a very lucky man. The paragraph readsHe said that he found his duties as National Service Officer at Newtown very arduous, and he sought relaxation on the racecourse, "" to get away"", he said, ""from people pestering me"". He had a current bank account, which he said he used as his betting account. During 1944, he said, he commenced betting in a fairly big way. Each Friday . . . - I remind honourable members that this occurred while he was employed as national service officer at Glebe. . . he would draw £500 from his account and on the Monday he would redeposit the amount together with his winnings, if any. On the 19th December, 1944, he said, be had a big win on "" Precise"" which brought him a profit of over £900. Then he had a lucky run. For thirteen consecutive meetings, he said, he .found himself a substantial winner at the end of the day, with the result that over a period he accumulated £3,000.",80
118,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,On the Flat.,82
119,Mr SPENDER,Unknown,"All I have to say about that is that I wish he would tell me his system. The paragraph continuesHe explained that he bet mostly on two-yearolds "" because anybody who follows racing knows that two-year-olds have not learned the tricks of the old horses"". Now we know how to win on thirteen consecutive Saturdays. The paragraph continuesHe said he wagered up to £100 or more with bookmakers on the Flat and in the Leger enclosure. I find it very hard to have that amount of money in my pocket at any time. Now I come to the paragraph that intrigues me most. It readsFollowing his succession of wins, he said, his luck showed signs of receding, and after he had suffered a substantial loss or two a good friend suggested that he was being foolish. He said he placed his winnings in various savings banks accounts in the names of himself, his wife and his children. He limited the amount of each account to £500 so that he might get the maximum interest rate. Two paragraphs later the royal commissioner says that in support of his denial that this money had anything to do with his activities as a national service officer at Glebe, Urquhart produced racebooks. I have seen race-books produced many times in court for the same reason, but not always gaining the same acceptance as was gained in this instance. A man may be perfectly innocent and keep his race-books so that he will have a means of explaining should questions be asked how he came by certain money. But I am not satisfied as easily as apparently the judge was satisfied that the evidence of the race-books Concludes the matter. I say that all the things in relation to this matter- Mr Garden, the friend of the Minister; Mr Urquhart, the friend of the Minister; political patronage in public office; and Mr. Service in public office-cr y out for investigation, and I do not think that the publio will be satisfied until such an investigation takes place.",83

126,Mr CHAMBERS,Unknown,"That was the general trend of the speeches of the Opposition. Honourable members opposite have expressed doubts that Urquhart could bave won so much money at the races. They say that it was impossible to lay a £100 bet on the Flat. I remind them that bookmakers, who were called before the commission, gave evidence on oath that Flat bookmakers would accept £100 bets. It was reported some time ago that the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Holt) had won a considerable amount of money at the races. Was anything alleged against him on that account? We did not ask for the appointment of a royal commission to inquire into the matter. It is significant that Mr Justice Ligertwood's report has been pushed into the background during this debate, and members of the Opposition have used this opportunity to condemn the Minister and the Government for the administration of the external territories, and particularly of Papua and New Guinea. I know something of the conditions with which the Minister was faced' when he took over the portfolio of External Territories. Not one member of the Opposition has been honest enough or fair enough to point out that New Guinea and Papua were devastated territories when the Minister took over during the war, and that he was faced with a very difficultthe task in rehabilitating them. I visited New Guinea before the war. I went there again during the war, and I again visited the area a few months ago. I wish to pay a tribute to the Minister for the success he has achieved' in rehabilitating the war-devastated territories of Papua and New Guinea. I felt that it was the duty of a Minister to rise in his place to defend the Minister for External Territories, and to reply to the unfair criticism of honourable members opposite. The appointment of Mr Justice Ligertwood as commissioner to inquire into the New Guinea timber leases was not a political one. Honourable members from South Australia know that he is not a political supporter of this Government. Therefore, I had assumed that all honourable members of this Parliament would have been prepared to accept his findings. I remind honourable members that they should be careful to protect the good name of members of this House and of the Senate. Public men are always open to criticism. This case has shown that public men, unless they receive the protection of their colleagues, may at any time be charged with all sorts of crimes. It has been said that at some time in his career Mr. "" Jock"" Garden was a member of the Communist party. When I look around this House I see men who have changed their political allegiance, but no one demns them for that. There are in Australia many people who were at one time Communists. A man who did a great Mr Chambers. deal during the recent coal strike to assist the Government and to end the strike was at one time a Communist. To-day, he is the greatest enemy of the Communists. It has been said that a current Communist party ticket belonging to ""Jock"" Garden was found. I do not think that the honourable member who made that charge really believed' it to be true. The ticket was not current, and it did not bear the name of "" Jock "" Garden. Honourable members opposite have attempted, during this debate, to blacken the good name of the Minister for External Territories, and to condemn the Government for its administration of our external territories, but the royal commissioner, Mr Justice Ligertwood', complimented Minister for External Territories upon his behaviour. He declared that the Minister was not guilty of the charges made against him, and had done everything in his power to bring the fraud to light. Mr Justice Ligertwood made no criticism of the Minister's administration of the territories.",83
127,Mr HABBISON,Unknown,"Wentworth) [10.20]. - I propose to he very brief in dealing with this matter, but I believe that I should say something with respect to certain aspects of it. I am particularly concerned about the fact that, although members of the Opposition have launched a sustained attack not upon the integrity of the Minister for External Territories (Mr Ward), but upon the administration of his department, not one senior Minister has come to his aid in this debate. It is perfectly true that we have heard from a back-bencher who, I might say with respect, would have done a great service to the Minister had he kept quiet and not made the contribution that he made to this discussion. Then, a junior Minister said that we are criticizing the Minister for External Territories and the Government in respect of only one observation contained in the report of the royal commission. However, the honourable member for Robertson (Mr. Williams) went to great pains to quote that passage of the report to the House. con- What I am concerned about is that although the Minister has come through a royal commission and his administration has been adversely commented upon by the royal commissioner",84
128,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,Where ?,85
129,Mr HARRISON,Unknown,"I shall read the passage to the Minister for Information (Mr Calwell) in a moment. However, notwithstanding the fact that the adminisjunior tration of the Minister for External ritories has heen adversely commented upon by the royal commissioner, not one of the Minister's colleagues, with the exception of a junior Minister, has come to his defence in this debate which in its closing stages. The general public should be made perfectly nware of that fact because it is a mast damning indictment of the Minister's administration. And his colleagues, by (lunr silence, to support the charges mnde by members of the Opposition in that respect. I shall now have a look at what was said by the junior Minister, the Minister for the Army (Mr Chambers) who, of course, had a loyalty to the Minister for External Territories because he administered the latter's department while the Minister was going through his travail. Consequently, he was to some, degree forced to participate in. this debate. Indeed, he said that it was time that some one took up the cudgels on behalf .of the Minister for External Territories. I have been thinking for some time that some one on the Government side should do so. However, the Minister's colleagues have "" ratted "" on him. They have left him to carry his own cross and bear the attack made by the Opposition, because, apparently, they have not been game to defend him. Such a thing has' never before been heard of in this House; but those are the facts. Then, a junior Minister complained that members of the Opposition were continuing the debate on the paper now before the Chair. Who opened the debate on this paper? It was the Minister himself; and he was given a number of extensions of time which he used to vilify and blackguard people inside and outside the Parliament. The Minister for External Territories himself initiated this debate which, on the motion of the Vice-President of the Executive Council (Mr Scully), was adjourned at the close of the last sessional period. However, when the resumption of the debate was called on this evening, the Vice-President of the Executive Council walked away and thus allowed an Opposition member to resume it. The Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) made the resumption of the debate the first item on the notice-paper. If the Minister to whom I have referred Ter- complains about the debate being continued, he should refer his complaint to the Prime Minister and the Minister for External Territories. That junior Minister then asked, ""Who wanted this royal is now commission ?"". When we pointed out that the Minister for External Territories asked that the commission be appointed, that junior Minister replied, ""No, it was the Opposition "". Let us look at the seem facts. It is perfectly true that the Opposition asked the Prime Minister to appoint a royal commission to inquire into this matter, but it is equally true that the Prime Minister refused that request. The right honourable gentleman said that he would not accept the evidence of a "" larrikin lawyer "". However, when the jury which heard the conspiracy trial acquitted the accused, the Minister for External Territories asked the Prime Minister to appoint a royal commission, and it was only then, when the jury, the honest men and true, the backbone of the legal system in this country, turned him down that the Minister sought a royal commission; and it was only then that the Prime Minister, who had refused the Opposition's earlier request for a royal commission, agreed to institute such an inquiry. Those are the facts concerning the appointment of the royal commission. I shall now examine the remarks made by the junior Minister who has spoken with respect to the report. I shall quote from that report a passage similar to that quoted by the honourable member for Robertson, the only other ministerial supporter who has sought to defend the Minister for External Territories. As I said earlier, it would have been far better for the Minister had the honourable member left his remarks unsaid. Mr. Justice Ligertwood, on page 7 of his report, deals with the rather extraordinary influence which Mr Garden exercised over the Minister for External Territories and the extraordinary access that Garden had to the Minister's correspondence and office. His Honour saidIn the first place, Garden having previously been a member of the Minister's personal staff, wa» able to oonti-n.ue hi* friendshipwith the Sn'nisiei''s secretaries and"" stenographers-.

130,Mr HARRISON,Unknown,"I suggest that the Minister for the A r m y (Mr Chambers) should address that question to Mr . Justice Ligertwood. If the Minister contends that the report gives a; complete clearance to the Minister for External Territories, he must accept it as a whole : he cannot quibble about the matter. Dealing with Garden the report continuesIf he wantedletters typed, he was allowed to use the sevvices of the Minister's: typists. The opportunity was thus afforded to him o< doin'g what he in fact did, namely bf steatl'mg. the Minister's departmental paper, for the purpose of giving to framdtu'lent letters the appearance of ibeing official.

Garden is a notorious man. Much has beensaid about him! during this debate which I do not wish toreiterate. He was clearly employed by the Minister for External Territories (Mr W a r d ) . As the result of certain circumstances the Minister when administering the portfolio of Labour and National Service was suspended from' duty and Garden was forced upon h'is successor. In the evidence given before the royal commission 1 it is interesting to find! that the Minister for External Territories had lent a hand in forcing the Minister for Labour and National Service to appoint Garden as his liaison officer. Dealing with the evidence of the Minister for External Territories, at page 36 of his report, Mr Justice Ligertwood saidMr Justice Se said that he had added his personal request to the written communications received by Mr HoJiowayi' from ihe members of Pa'rHaiment. The Minister for ExternaT Territories, whoemployed Garden as his liaison officer, exerted pressure on the Minister for Labtfur a-nd' National Service to continue' Garden' in his appointment as liaison efffie'er it i the Department of Labour and National Service. When asked a question if i this Honise' about the work that Garden was' doing asliaison officer, the Minister for La'bduf and National Service replied 1 that he wascontacting employers and employees with regard' to industrial matters. It isinteresting to consider, what Mr Justice Ligertwood had to say 1 fft that respect Dealing-with the evidence of the Minister for External Territories"", tcf pa-ge36' of the report, Mr JusticeLigertwood s a i d That is the He admitted that he was over-patient with (Sairdeu's importunity oft Behalf of Parer and stinted! ftfarilfly tftstt h'iS re'ateo'n* wa's tKffit Tfedid not want to offend a man who was his campaign secretary and had influence with the unions. . . . I should also add that the personal relationship between the Miuister and Garden, coupled with his office of liaison was a factor which enabled Farrell in negotiating the Hancock and Gore transaction to build up Garden as a "" very important personage who wields an enormous amount of power in Australia"". Mr Justice Ligertwood also said of the evidence of the MinisterEven in matters which told against him he was frank. For instance, knowing that I was disposed to be critical, as I still Garden being kept in a position of liaison officer in the circumstances I have mentioned he said that he had added his personal request to the written communications received Mr Holloway from the members of Parliament. He was referring to the fact that he graA'e doubts whether Garden had been referred. carrying out the duties of a liaison officer in the Department of Labour and National Service. I believe that the Minister for Labour and National Serhonorable vice was aware that Garden was not carrysubject ing out any useful duties for him, and that Garden had been appointed solely because he was campaign secretary for the Minister for External Territories, who had appointed him and paid him out of the taxpayers' money solely in order keep him on side as his campaign evidence secretary.",86
133,Mr CHAMBERS,Unknown,"What justification has the honourable gentleman for saying that? name? Mr HAEEISON"" - If the junior MinGreenfield. ister will read the report of the royal comto mission he will find that it contains ample evidence to support my statement. There is no doubt in my mind on this matter. The royal commissioner made it clear he did not agree that Garden had been doing any useful work as a liaison officer in the Department of Labour and because National Service. The Minister for Labour and National Service was aware made that no useful purpose was being served by Garden's employment. He well that Garden was appointed to his position solely because he was campaign secretary for the Minister for External Territories. Garden Garden was found a job, as many other mission defeated members of the Parliament have been found jobs, under a direction issued add by a member of the Government. If that be so surely it constitutes a damning indictment of the Minister for Labour and guilt National Service. Let me carry this (Judge matter a step farther. It is interesting to note the circumstances associated with the first charge of forgery in thia mattei' oflicer, of which ""Jock"" Garden was convicted.

He said that the jury was convinced that the Minister's evidence could that not be believed and that some further action should be taken in relation to the case. I took no action on the matter the case was then sub judice. It appears that a similar statement was to the press for the following article appeared in the Sydney Daily Telegraph knew of the 9th June, 1948 :The foreman and four members of the J. S. trial jury said last night that the Federal Government should hold a royal cominto Garden's allegations at his trial. The jurors revealed that the jury sought to to its verdict a rider that it was dissatisfied with some aspects of the Crown evidence on matters outside the question of Garden's or innocence. They said they drafted this decision in a letter to the trial judge Stacey) but did not send it to him on the advice of a court official. The jurors were those who recently sat in the t r i al which ended with the conviction and imprisonment of Garden for forgery. The five jurors said they resented recent references by the Prime Minister (Mr. Chifley), to a larrikin lawyeT. (In the House of Representatives last Thursday Mr Chifley said that the only charges or statements likely to reflect upon Mr Ward were those made by a convicted criminal). Refusing the Opposition demand for a royal commission into Garden's sworn allegations against Mr Ward, Mr Chifley said he would not accept the word of a convicted criminal or the innuendoes of any larrikin lawyer. The foreman of the trial jury said last night, "" All the jury were quite prepared to see after the trial ended that an additional inquiry would be held. Not one of us thought the position would stand where it was. Throughout the trial each member of the j u r y commented upon how well Mr Simon Isaacs (Counsel for Garden) conducted his defence; hia wholo cross-examination was in accord wit h our impressions of some important aspects of the occurrences which we did not think made any difference on the question of Garden's innocence or guilt. Mr Isaacs obviously is the larrikin lawyer Mr Chifley referred to. In my opinion Isaacs did his job w e l l "" . The Daily Telegraph then quoted the opinions of the second, third, fourth and fifth jurors, each of whom was in complete accord with the statement made by the foreman. Here there was one jury, which convicted Garden but obviously disbelieved the Minister",87
143,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,How does the honourable gentleman know that?,88
144,Mr HARRISON,Unknown,Because of the letter that was sent to me by the foreman of the jury.,88
145,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,Will the honourable gentleman lay it on the table?,88
146,Mr HARRISON,Unknown,Neve r mind about laying it on the table. The foreman made the same statement in the letter from which I have quoted.,88
147,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,I want to know whether the honourable gentleman wrote it himself.,88
148,Mr HARRISON,Unknown,"Possibl y the letter printed in the Daily Telegraph was written hy somebody employed on the newspaper! It is a queer fact that the letter quoted in the article and the letter that I received coincide. Here we had one jury that doubted the Minister's word and a second jury that discharged the accused in the conspiracy trial, both prepared to go against the Minister. Two juries, representing the legal backbone of justice in this community",88
149,Mr CHAMBERS,Unknown,Were there not twelve members of the jury?,88
150,Mr HARRISON,Unknown,"Not in the forgery trial. There were five jurors in the case who objected to the evidence of the Minister. Here we had two jurors that took a stand adverse to the Minister and his evidence, yet honourable members opposite say that this House has no right to express an opinion about such a .momentous matter. Even the royal commissioner included in his report a severe and damning indictment of the Minister and his method of administering his department. In the light of that fact and the fact that two juries were prepared to disbelieve the evidence given by the Minister on oath, I say that it is essential that action be taken to ventilate the matter in this House. Whilst we accept the fact that Mr Justice Ligertwood has absolved the Minister, there are certain factors associated with the affair that must be ventilated in the public interest. The proper forum for such a discussion is this House. I shall not discuss the matter further. I conclude by saying that, until the charges of maladministration can be refuted, and until the Government is prepared to authorize the inquiry that Mr. Justice Ligertwood said would be necessary to enable him to clear his mind about certain aspects of the case, the Minister will remain an object of suspicion in the minds of the general public. For the sake of his own good name, to prevent any further criticism by the public, and to allay suspicion, the honourable gentleman should ask for a further inquiry to he held along the lines suggested by the royal commissioner.",88
151,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,"Melbourne-Minister for Information and Minister for Im-migation) [10.45] - The Minister for External Territories (Mr Ward) himself requested that a royal commission be appointed to examine the allegations that had been made against his administration and against his personal integrity. The Minister knew in his own conscience that he had nothing to hide in connection with the allegations. The royal commisof the sioner, Mr Justice Ligertwood, said destroy ahout his conduct- I repeat what the Prime Minister has already read to the HousePerhaps the best testimonial to the Miniswas ter's integrity in financial matters is to be found in the fact that, throughout the of the year 1948, continuous efforts were to unearth material, which might be used destroy his credit. It was of no avail. would seem that when nothing based upon fact could be discovered, resort was had rumours and insinuations. That is as clear and unequivocal testimony as has ever been delivered respect of a public man by any royal commissioner. And who was Mr Justice Ligertwood? He was not a Labour appointee to a Supreme Court bench. every criterion he would be unfamiliar with, if not opposed to, men associated with Labour politics. By birth, by edueither cation, by professional association and by every other association, he would at least have preconceived notions opposed to Labour men and the things that judge Lahour men stand for. But he revealed himself in this case as an honest man gave an honest decision upon the facts advanced before him in evidence. He gave that decision in respect of a public figure, in the person of the Minister External Territories, who has been as much maligned, as much traduced, and as much vilified as any man in the publio life of this country. Attempts to create an atmosphere adverse to my colleague were resorted with very few exceptions, by the newssee papers of Australia. Anything that could be suggested by innuendo against the character and integrity of the Minisfor ter for External Territories was sugnever gested . Nevertheless, when the fierce 1 spotlight of investigation was turned upon the Minister in the box, upon all those who gave evidence against him and for him, and upon his few business transacthe tions, as in the miserable incident of safe deposit box, the royal commisfor sioner had no hesitation in saying, withcampaign out the slightest qualification and without the slightest reservation, the words that I have quoted . I repeat some of them1 Perhaps the best testimonial to the ter's integrity in financial matters is found in the fact that, throughout the whole year 1948, continuous efforts were made to unearth material, which might be used to his credit. And nothing was found! The royal commissioner decided that here, in the person of the Minister for External Territories, one who, by his conduct over the long whole years during which he had been a member made of the Commonwealth Parliament, dating to back to 1931, was an example of all It that was good and proper in just and to honest administration. There was nothing against the Minister. There was nothing against his family. Miserable and cona temptible attempts had been made to in drag his wife's name into the case. The mental torture that was perpetrated for eighteen months upon the Minister, upon his wife especially, because a man can By always stand up to such attacks better than a woman, and upon tlieir children was such that no honourable member on side of this House would want to have to suffer it. The Minister for External Territories maintained his position from the beginning to the end, and the 1 vindicated him as completely as ever a man was vindicated. But honourable who members opposite can only say, "" Well, there is something that Garden said or did. Garden was on the government pay-roll. Garden was employed in the Minister's for office when he was Minister for Labour and National Service. Garden's services were continued. Garden was retained by the present Minister for Labour and National Service "". If one examines the association between Garden and the Minto, ister for External Territories, one will that there is not the slightest scintilla of evidence to suggest that they had even a close social relationship. The Minister External Territories and his wife once visited Garden and his wife. They never had any association except an association that, in the circumstances, was a proper association between two members of the Labour party, one being Minister for External Territories and the the honourable member in this Parliament East Sydney and the other being his director and the president of a branch of the Labour party in his electorate. If Garden had never been a member of the Darlinghurst branch of the Labour party, he would not have been Minisbrought into association with the Ministo be ter at all. The royal commissioner took these facts into consideration when he made his observations, and, whatever else he may have said in his report, he did not derogate in the slightest degree from the complete acquittal that he gave to the Minister for External Territories of any charge of wrongdoing and the complete vindication that he gave to his character and integrity. Though honourable members may disagree with the Minister for External Territories on political matters and though he may have disagreement on occasion with members of his own party on political matters, no one has ever dreamt for a moment that he was a corrupt or venal man or that he would do any mean or contemptible thing at the expense of the Commonwealth. No one believes for a second that he would take a bribe to forgo his duty or break his oath of omce as a Minister of State for the Commonwealth of Australia. All the evidence given by his friends tallied exactly with what he gave. The attempts by the larrikin lawyer to besmirch him failed.",88
152,Mr GEORGE LAWSON,Unknown,The Communist lawyer.,90
153,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,"Yes , we may even amend the phrase of the Prime Minister and call him the Communist lawyer, because, in subsequent court proceedings in connection with the recent strike, the same gentleman, who sought to blacken the reputation of the Minister for External Territories, appeared as counsel for those people who were appearing in the court in answer to summonses from the judges on charges of having violated the arbitration laws of this country. I am not suggesting that any one charged in the court should not be able to use the services of the best lawyers available. A man in court may use the services of any lawyer at all. I do not seek to deny to any one the right to a fair presentation of his case, whether he be a Communist or an anti-Communist; but it is significant that the man who traduced the Minister for External Territories should have been the first man to appear in the courts for members of the Communist party. I mention the case not for the purpose of reflecttho ing in any respect upon the proceedings of the Arbitration Court, but just to show that there was a united front by certain members of the Liberal party and the Communist party to try to drive the Minister for External Territories out of the public life of this country. Simon Isaacs refused to go into the witness box to answer the allegations of Mr Breen. He was afraid. He was so contemptibly miserable that he pleaded some sort of privilege. The Bar Association in New South Wales has not yet dealt v/ith him for his actions on that occasion. The judge said that he would refer the evidence given by Mr Breen to the Bar Association after Mr Miller, KC., who appeared for the Minister for External Territories, had asked him to summon this particular lawyer to answer the allegations made by Mr Breen. Isaacs has not yet appeared before any one. I have heard of people being struck off the roll before today. If I were a member of the New South Wales Cabinet I would have tried to have passed a special piece of legislation to remove Isaacs from the roll of legal practitioners in New South Wales. That would not be too severe a penalty for his contemptible conduct. It was admitted by Garden that in respect of every allegation made by Isaacs, except that in respect of the £5,000, he had not instructed his counsel to make the allegations. My friends, the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Williams) and the honourable member for Watson (Mr Falstein), who are barristers, will be ahle to advise upon the point; but I understand that any accused person must instruct his counsel on the lines on which he desires his defence to be based. It is not permissible for counsel to invent a defence or to attack any person in a responsible position or involved in a case without firm instructions from the accused person. Isaacs threw caution to the winds, threw decency to the winds, and set out in a campaign to blackguard the Minister for External Territories, who. after eighteen months, and in spite nf all the calumny, emerges completely vindicated.",90
154,Mr CHAMBERS,Unknown,Isaac s did not throw politics to the winds.,90
155,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,"The Minister for Army says that Isaacs did not throw politics to the winds. That was painfullv obvious from the moment the proceeding began. Whether he was working for certain elements of the Liberal party - becaus e there was the evidence of Mr. Breen to suggest that certain people in the Liberal party were involved in the attack on the Minister-o r whether he was working for the Communist party alone, wr for both the Liberal party and the Communist party, or for his own malevolent design, no one can say, but he gave a display as a barrister that was a disgrace to the legal profession of Australia. The honourable member for ""Wentworth ' Mr Harrison) says that the chairman o£ the jury wrote him a letter after the first conspiracy triaL",90
156,Mr RAKKIK,Unknown,-There is no chairman of a jury; the Minister means the foreman of the jury.,91
157,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,"Well , the foreman of the jury. I accept the amendment of the honourable member for Bendigo, who is about to leave us for another sphere. The foreman of the jury wrote a letter to the honourable member for Wentworth. Why did he write a letter to the honourable member for Wentworth? Why did he not write it to the Prime Minister or to Mr Speaker? Anyhow, what was he doing writing letters about a case which had been adjudicated' upon ? His action was most improper. I have never heard the like of it. We did not know that the honourable member _ for Wentworth had received the letter until tonight. When he knows that the Minister for External Territories has no right of reply. He made his allegation, not before the Minister for External Territories made his defence of himself, but after the Minister had exhausted hie right of reply. I agree with honourable members who have interjected, that the foreman of the jury did something which is indefensible. Perhaps he was a member of the Liberal party. Perhaps he, too, wanted to make capital at the expensfi of the Minister. Perhaps, like Mr Simon Isaacs, be was playing politics. If he were, the case against Garden must have been overwhelming, when the jury, consisting of people of the type 'of the foreman, convicted Garden of the offences that he had committed. Now, the honourable member for Wentworth says that the foreman of the jury stated that the members of the jury wanted to add a rider to their Verdict in regard to the Minister for External Territories. I put it to the House that the jury which heard the case did not know that Forshaw had received £4,000. I think that my colleague, the Minister for External Territories, will verify that fact. The jurymen did not know that Forshaw had received £4,000 when they wanted, if they did want, to add their particular rider. The fact that Forshaw received £4,000 was disclosed only when the royal commissioner began his investigations, and that was some time later. Are we to believe that the foreman of the jury was a better judge of what was right and proper than was the royal commissioner who examined all the circumstances of :-c case, and who was not bound by the laws of evidence as are judges and juries in cases in which persons are accused of having committed offences? A royal commissioner may admit any evidence that he likes, and may explore all sorts of possibilities and even probabilities in order to inform his mind so that he may make a right judgment. Does the observation of the honourable member for Wentworth suggest that the foreman of this jury, who is unnamed",91
158,Mr MOLEOD,Unknown,The name of the foreman was Greenfield.,91
159,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,"I shall put it this way: Does the view of the foreman of the jury rank as being of greater importance than the opinion of the royal commissioner? The royal commissioner, at least by training, by long years of service at the South Australian bar and by honourable association with the Supreme Court Bench of that State, is a man of integrity. The person who, in a moment of spleen, writes a letter after the case, is guilty of a cowardly and contemptible action. The opinion of the foreman of that jury is in direct conflict with the royal commissioner's report. It seems to me that another royal commission should inquire into the allegations of the honourable member for Wentworth, and yet another royal commission should investigate the manner in which the honourable member got hold of this letter from the foreman of the jury. But we are not anxious to waste the country's money in pursuing Greenfields or in f o llowing the honourable member for Wentworth in the bypaths which he himself has created, still socking an opportunity to besmirch the name of the Minister for External Territories. It is to the credit of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Menzies) and the Leader of the Australian Country party (Mr Fadden) that they have publicly declared that never for one moment did they believe that the integrity of the Minister was involved. Neither of those right honourable gentlemen has any reason to be grateful to the Minister for External Territories for sparing their feelings in political conflict. The Minister has been as severe on them as any honourable member could possibly be, ancl they, knowing him over the years, knowing his associations and knowing how he hated them in a political sense, were still prepared to give him the character which every other honourable member who knows him is prepared to give him. They have done the honest things and it is a pity that their followers have not lived up to their standards in that respect. It is regrettable that certain honourable members have occupied their time this evening in a meandering way, seeking through all the labyrinths of suggestion and innuendo to find something, if they possibly could, which would linger in the public mind to the discredit of the Minister for External Territories. The Minister has lived a long time in the political lif e of this country, and he will continue to do so.",91
160,Mr FULLER,Unknown,He is too clean for them. was frank.,92
161,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,"He is clean f r o stand-point of personal integrity and than that? personal honesty. He will fight his fights continuedi n his own way. He knows what he believes, and he has the courage to say what he believes. Everybody may not agree kept with what he says. He may not agree with me personally on the things that, perhaps, I want t.o do for the good of this nation, but at least he is honest i way in which he expresses his views. He never lacks the courage to say what he wants to say, and to take the consequences after he has made his statement. Honourable members who have attempted to besmirch his name to-night have read portions of the royal commissioner's port, but they have not read the essential portions and they have even misread the portions which they have quoted to the House. They have torn various phrases from their context. They have avoided referring to that particular portion of the report which the Prime Minister (Mr Chifley) has quoted and to which I have already made reference. They have failed to deal with other sections of the report to which I should like to refer. On page 36 of the document, the royal commissioner deals with the Minister's evidence. Indeed, that part of the report is entitled "" The Minister's Evidence"". The royal commissioner considered that the whole .of the circumstances of the case demanded that he should set aside a particular portion of the report which should be headed "" The Minister's Evidence "" . His Honour saidIn marked contrast to the evidence of Oarden was that of the Minister. He was in the witness box for four days and he gave his evidence openly, frankly and with an air of sincerity and truth. Does anybody attempt to belie that! Does any honourable member opposite who has spoken in this debate questipn the judgment of the royal commissioner in that connection? Has any honourable member opposite challenged the following sentence in that report:I see no reason to doubt any portion of his evidence. The royal commissioner continuedEven in matters which told against him he m the What greater testimony can a man have The royal commisioner For instance, knowing that I was disposed to be critical, as I still am, of Garden being in the position of liaison officer in the circumstance I have mentioned, he said that he liad added his personal request to the written communications received by Mr. Holloway from the Members of Parliament. n the What was the request? It was that Garden's services should be. retained. The Minister for External Territories, if he erred at all in that matter, erred in a spirit of friendship for a man who was powerful in the trade union movement when the Minister was a struggling young reman in politics. Times had changed, and ""the Minister was in a position of great in fluence in this community. Garden had been rejected by the trade union movement. The Minister, in a spirit of friendship, wanted to do something for him. That is all that can ever be adduced against the Minister in that connection. What he did was the natural sort - of thing that the average person would do for somebody who had befriended him at an earlier period. He might not have thought too highly of Garden's politics. He might not have regarded Garden as being a very important person any longer. JBut the Minister knew that Garden was important in his own electorate, and he was entitled, on that ground, to have some consideration for a man who, at all events, had been a member of a municipal council of a capital city in Australia and had been the member for Cook in this House for three years. The report continuesHe admitted that he waa over-patient with Garden's importunity on behalf of Parer and stated frankly that his reason was that he did not want to offend a man who was his campaign secretary, and had influence with the unions. The Minister could have avoided saying that if he wanted to be shrewd. But he was honest, and admitted that he had made a mistake. The report continuesI t was, however, this relationship between the Minister and Garden, who, both before me and in the criminal proceedings, gave rise to so much of the cross-examination on the basis that his partiality towards Garden called for an explanation. The only motive that Garden suggested was that the Minister was party to the Hancock and Gore transaction. That motive must, of course, be rejected and with its rejection there is no difficulty in accepting the Minister's explanation. I remind the House that those are the royal commissioner's own words. H is report continuesNo other motive has been suggested. If there had been any other motive going to the Minister's credit, I feel sure that Garden and his advisers would have been quick to suggest it. I should also add that the personal relationship between the Minister and Garden coupled with his office of liaison officer was a factor which enabled Farrell in negotiating the Hancock and Gore transaction to build up Garden as a "" very important personage who wields an enormous power in Australia "". The great misfortune of this royal commission, ""Tirl nf flll nt the thinirs that preceded it , was that Farrell avoided going on his trial for conspiracy. If he had done so, not only "" J o c k "" Garden would be in gaol to-night, because Farrell and certain other people also would be there with him. I do not think that any member of this House could regard Farrell as other than an unmitigated scoundrel who inspired the whole thing from beginning to end. He inspired Garden to try and use the Minister to get something that he had been trying to get for many years from Ministers in non-Labour governments as well as from the present Labour Government. Although Farrell failed everywhere, he is free to-night. Other men have had their reputations besmirched. I offer no criticism of Harcourt Garden and Parer, because they were acquitted. It is important that the House and the country should know what the royal commissioner said. It should be printed in Hansard so that it w i ll be on record for contemporary history, and for the information of those people who will not be reading the report of the royal commissioner. This paragraph appears in the reportThe Minister laid the whole of his financial affairs open to examination by an independent auditor. What more could a man do than that? The paragraph continuesNeither in his nor his wife's bank accounts nor in his property holdings was there a trace of the ffi.QOO said to have been paid to him by Garden. The same thing applied to his safe deposit. It was shown to have contained only the Minister's will, the certificates of title to his house at Paddington and to five vacant allotments of land at Sutherland and elsewhere, his life insurance policies and documents relating to investments he has made in Commonwealth Loans out of savings from his salary. This kind of evidence is, of course, negative, but it is typical of the open and frank manner in which the Minister was prepared to give every assistance in the inquiry. I do not think that I could say any mora in defence of the Minister, and I do not think that I need say any more in justification of the belief that is universally held of the Minister. No matter how people may like or dislike him politically, he is one of the cleanest men in public lif e in Australia.",92
162,Mr WHITE,Unknown,"Balaclava) r/11.15] We can understand the Minister for Information (Mr Calwell) doing the best he can for his friend, because he ancl the Minister for External Territories (Mr Ward) have been political friends for a long time. But t could not help feeling that his apologia for the Minister in the unfortunate circumstances in which he finds himself is rather like the story of the negress who went to the funeral of her husband. At the grave side, when the clergyman recited the great qualities of the man, his cleanliness, and goodness, she said "" J ust a minute parson, I think you have the wrong man in the box. Let us open it . "" This is not the man that we know. The Minister for Information says the man whom he has been praising is a great democrat, the friend of the world. We know quite a different person, whose character has been referred to over the years. However, I shall not throw any stones at him because he has been through a purgatory. It was wrong for the Ministei for the Army (Mr. Chambers) to say that the Opposition sought this royal commission. What we sought was a different kind of inquiry. This royal commission was appointed at the Minister's own request, and it has exonerated him within the narrow confines of its terms of reference. We sought a royal commission to investigate affairs generally in New Guinea. We knew nothing of the timber trouble. T have before me the notice-paper of the 29th April, 1947, in which the following motion stands in my name:T moveTliat a Joint Select Committee be appointed to inquire into and report the following: The inadequacy of the administration which has been set up under the New Guinea Act",93
163,Mr ACTING DEPUTYSPEAKER,Unknown, That has nothing to do with the matter before the House.,94
164,Mr WHITE,Unknown,"Wit h respect, I say that it has. The concluding paragraph of Mr Justice Ligertwood's report refers specifically to administration, the loose method of control brought into operation, and the calibre of appointees to the Government service. Although I do not want to be lengthy, I shall read lengthy extracts to prove my point, if the Chair forces me to do so. I think that the Chair will agree that my remarks are related to the matter before the House.",94
165,Mr ACTING DEPUTYSPEAKER,Unknown, - Order ! I ask the honourable memher to desist.,94
166,Mr WHITE,Unknown,"In the penultimate paragraph of his report the royal commissioner saidThere are just two comments which I wish to add. First, I think that the authorities should give consideration to the question of prosecuting Farrell criminally. We all agree with that, and I think that honourable members will agree, also, with the remainder of his honour's comments in that paragraphh. Portion of the final paragraph of the report readsEach of them was brought temporarily into the Public Service and was given a responsible office. Each of them was allowed a measure of trust and discretion outside the routine of the department to which he was attached. Each of them betrayed his trust. In marked contrast was Mr Halligan, the Secretary and Permanent Head of the Department of External Territories, who, over a long period, had faithfully discharged his administrative duties. In the routine of his department with its files and memoranda, were found . the solutions to many of the questions which arose in the course of the inquiry. These are the matters to which we have been trying to direct attention over the years. They are the matters, the solution of which prompted me to speak on this aspect to-night. A committee of the House should inquire into New Guinea affairs. The Minister has talked about peregrinations in New Guinea. I remind the House that when in government we of the Opposition gave New Guinea local government, yet the Minister has made it a closed country upon which might have been in Siberia or Tibet for all we knew. Had my proposal been accepted at that time and a joint committee of the Parliament gone to New Guinea, I am convinced that this scandal would have been unearthed, and that muddle ancl degradation would have been avoided. This blot would not have been put upon the name of the Parliament. I am glad that the Minister was not found guilty as it affects the whole Parliamentary institution. But when this Government uses the powers of the Parliament to blot out discussion because",94
167,Mr ACTING DEPUTYSPEAKER,Unknown," - The honourable gentleman has reflected on a ruling of the Chair. I ask him to witlidraw his remark and apologize to the Chair. Mr 'WHITE - I withdraw the remark and apologize to the Chair. I am afraid that you have misunderstood me, Mr. Acting Deputy Speaker. I was not talking of your actions to-night. T am sorry that you are so touchy.",94
168,Mr ACTING DEPUTYSPEAKER,Unknown, - Order ! The honourable gentleman must withdraw that remark.,95
169,Mr WHITE,Unknown,"I withdraw the remark. Over the years the maladministration of onr external territories by this Government has been notorious. Honourable members on this side of the House have pressed for inquiries to be made into, among other things, the treatment of the natives by the Government anrl the discontent that is rife among public servants in the territories. I have read in this House telegrams that I have received from public servants there. Mr. Justice Ligertwood has referred to the integrity of the Secretary of the Department of External Territories, Mr Halligan, who has been a public servant for many years, compared with that of men like Mr Garden, Mr. Service and Mr Urquhart another appointee is a political supporter of the Minister for External Territories who was lifted from the obscurity of some seafaring job and appointed to the important position of Director of Shipping in New Guinea. The royal commission should have inquired into the whole of the administration of these great and valuable territories by the Minister. New Guinea wa3 and is one of our outposts. It contains graves of many fine young Australians. It has heen used as a stepping stone attempted invasion of Australia and it may be so used again. It may be that some eastern nations will infiltrate into it and make it very difficult for us to oust them. Papua and New Guinea have been placed in the custody of one man, who has refused to restore to the people there the degree of self-government that they once enjoyed, although recently a bill was passed by the Parliament which provided for a semblance of local government in one part of the territory only and for the merging of the two administrations. All these matters cry aloud for action, yet we are expected to forget the past, to say that the Minister for External Territories has done a good job and to agree with the Prime Minister when the right honourable gentleman says of him, "" Well done, thou good and faithful servant"". The Minister has been a liability to the Government. The Prime Minister musr. very often have said of him something similar to what was said by one of the English kings of Thomas a Becket, "" 0, that I could be rid of this turbulent priest! "" We all know the old tag that it is the insolence of demagogues that is the ruin of democracy. This demagogue has lowered the standard of political ethics. Because I dared to say that the judge specifically criticized the ethics involved in an outsider, Garden, who is on the payroll of one department being given access, to the departmental files and records of another department, I was vilified by the Minister. We hope that the honourable gentleman will reform, but 1 do not think that he will. I was interested to-night to hear the Minister for Information (Mr Calwell) make one of his characteristic speeches. Lately, the honourable gentleman has become an authority on concentration camps and deportation. They should be anathema to an Australian if he knew anything about them. The Minister for Information referred to a certain barrister-at-law in a manner that would not be tolerated outside the Parliament. I do not know the gentleman concerned, who may be good, bad or indifferent. But speeches of that kind are bringing the Parliament into disrepute. It is ceasing to the be adeliberative assembly in which great national affairs can be dealt with and in for an which the views of honourable members can be put forward. If the administration of New Guinea had been the subject of inquiry by a joint committee of the Parliament, all this unpleasantness might have been avoided. The failure to appoint such a committee is one of the things that will bring the Chifley Government down. The Prime Minister has never said anything in support of the criticisms that have been uttered, but has done his best to clear the matter up satisfactorily for himself and the Government. The people will not tolerate actions of that kind. The right honourable gentleman will find very shortly that it is one of the factors that will force his Government out of office and bring back in its place a decent democratic government. Question resolved in the affirmative. ADJOUBNMENT. DEATH OF MK . G. W. MARTENS AND MB . J. A. BEASLEY. Motion (by Mr SCULLY) proposed - That the House do now adjourn.",95
170,Mr LANG,Unknown,"Eeid) [11.25] - I wish to mention a matter that has appalled me. During today's proceedings no reference has been made to the passing of two former honourable members who rendered considerable service to the Parliament. I allude to the late Mr G. W. Martens and the late Mr J. A. Beasley. Mr Martens was a member of the Public ""Works Committee of this Parliament during the session 1940-43. He was a member of the Printing Committee for the sessions 1943-44, 1944-45, 1945-46 and of the House Oommittee for the sessions 1932-34, 1934-37, and 1937. He was also honoured by this House by being selected to serve as a member of the Select Comsented :mittee on Tohacco in the sessions 1929 and 1929-31. Mr Beasley was for more than a quarter of a century identified with soino of the most critical moments of Labour's history in this country. As a young man he was entrusted with the presidency of the Sydney Trades and Labour Council, a most difficult position. It was his responsibility to interpret the decisions of that body, which represented the great mass of Australian unionists in New South Wales. It is a field in which there are many bitter struggles and constant conflicts of opinion. It is a miniature working-class parliament on its own. Then ho was entrusted by the Labour movement with the right of representing in this Parliament the traditional Labour stronghold of West Sydney. Service to the people is full of personal problems. Whatever material rewards there may be for a young and ambitious man in politics they are more than offset by the great personal sacrifices that are called for. Then there are the worries and the perpetual struggle to interpret the wishes of the people correctly. In the turbulence of politics in the New South Wales and Commonwealth spheres, Mr Beasley was called upon to make many critical decisions that determined the course of his career. Thpre is no middle course in such matters, and the final judgment about what is right and what is wrong must be left for history to determine. Such a life must of necessity he far more strenuous than the life of the ordinary citizen. Mr Beasley's death at a comparatively young ag<s is yet another example of how much the nation and the Labour movement exact from those who serve them. Mr Beasley is just another victim. The tragedy is that in the past many have served and have paid a heavy penalty. Yet after they have paid that penalty their families have been forgotten. I hope that that will not happen in this instance. Question resolved in the affirmative. PAPEES.

174,Mr BABNABD,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable .member's questions are as follows:1. The commission is dependent on the various State governments for the preparation - of figures because the custodial care is under State laws, and the figures supplied by them .as at the 30th April , 1949, are as follow:Victoria . . .. .. New South Wales . . Queensland South Australia Western Australia .. Tasmania Total The figures for Victoria include patients who were transferred or discharged from the Reception House. 2.

Yes. Certain recommendations have been made hv Dr Stol'cr. 5. Expansion nf the repatriation medical services by the establishment of psychiatric teams in each State comprising the patient's doctor, a clinical psychologist, occupational therapists, psychiatric social workers, education and training oflicers. The aim of the psychiatric service of the Repatriation Commission is to deal wit h cases at the earliest possible stage and to treat them at out-patient and general hospital level and so allow for application of modern therapies and techniques and to avoid certification as far as possible. 6. These and many other plans have been implemented since the appointment of Dr Stoller to the staff of the Repatriation Commission. To implement f u l ly the plans of the Repatriation Conimission there is taking place the appointment of psychiatrists, psychologists, psychiatric social workers and other expert members of the teams required in the treatment of these patients. Some difficulty is being experienced, however, in securing suitable trained staff in Australia, and advertisements have been placed abroad for the position of psychiatrists and psychiatric social workers. Further difficulties are being experienced in the provision of suitable buildings for treatment of these patients. 129 7. Modernization of the psychiatric wards 29 at the Repatriation General Hospital, Green44 slopes, Queensland, is now almost completed. 17 The new psychiatric out-patient clinic at 22 Rosemount, is also nearing completion. On the 7 26th January, 1948, the Repatriation Pavilion at Wacol, Queensland, regarded as the most 248 modern of its kind in Australia, was opened foT the treatment of ex-service personnel suffering mental illnesses accepted as being due to service wit h the forces. A modern and up-to-date psychiatric out-patient clinic is in course of construction at the St. Kilda-road offices of the Repatriation Commission in 558 Melbourne.

175,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"On the l l t h F e b r u a r y the honourable member for B o u r k e (Mrs . B l a c k b u r n ) asked a question concerning seating accommodation for pensioners at p a y in g centres. The Postmaster-General has supplied the following in for m at i o n : W it h further reference to your representations in connection with the desired provision of seating accommodation at post offices - where social service payments are made, the inquiries disclose that chairs or forms are provided at most pension paying halls, and the larger post offices throughout the Commonwealth. There are, of course, some buildings in which the accommodation is so Umited that space is not available for seating facilities, whilst in other cases where the number of payments made is small, the callers are given prompt attention ancl the need for rest facilities is not so great as at the busier centres. However, steps have been taken to ensure that suitable accommodation will be made available at all paying offices where the number of payments made justifies that course, provided that space is available for the purpose and that no congestion will be caused in the public portion of the office. You may be interested to learn that the department's plans for new post office buildings and remodelled structures envisage the installation of a bench to seat several persons, primarily for use of callers awaiting telephone trunk line calls. The accommodation will be available to pensioners, of course and, as it is seldom that there is any appreciable delay in effecting social service payments, it is felt that this provision will meet all reasonable requirements.",99
176,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"On the 15th February, the honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons) asked me a question concerning pensioners who have to leave their homes in order to receive care during illness. The Minister for Social Services has supplied the following information:Under the present law, an age or invalid pensioner may have an income of up to £78 per annum (£156 for a married couple) without the rate of pension being affected. The maximum rate of pension, £110 10s. per annum, is reduced by the amount of any income in excess of £78 per annum or, in the case of a married couple, by half the amount of any income in excess of £150 per annum. The term ""income"", of course, includes net rent derived from property (after allowing for outgoings such as rates insurance repairs, &c.) The value of any property owned by a sioner, including house property and other assets, is also taken into account, but cation does not arise unless the value of property exceeds £750 (£1,500 in the case of a married couple). Where the value is less than £750 (£1,500 in the case of a married couple), the annual rate of pension is reduced by £1 for every complete £10' by which the value (or half the value of their combined property in the case of a married couple) exceeds £100 but docs not exceed £450, £2 for every complete £10 of any excess £450. The home in which a pensioner per1934 manently resides, furniture and personal effects are disregarded in determining eligibility pension. There is no specific power under the Social Services Consolidation Act which would mit the value of a house in which a pensioner is not permanently residing to be disregarded in considering eligibility for pension. The Prime Minister's reply to your question, however, outlined generally the practice of my department in dealing with cases where a pensioner is absent fro m his home. If the absenceis for a period of only a few months and thehome is not let to i i tenant, the property is still regarded as the pensioner's permanent home and no alteration in the rate of pensionis made. A longer period of absence is allowed where my department is satisfied that there are good reasons for the pensioner's continued absence from the home such as medical treatment over an extended period and that the absence is only of a temporary nature. Where, however, the house is occupied by a tenant, the net rental derived from the property and itsvalue are taken into account and the pension is reassessed. The question of providing discretionary power to disregard income and property in order to afford relief in cases of the kind mentioned by you was discussed with the Treasurer in connection with the preparation of the Social Services Consolidation Bill in 1947. After careful consideration of all aspects involved, the decision was reached that this concession should not be made as it would inevitably lead to a demand for still f u r the i concessions of similar nature which, if granted, would render the means test almost nugatory. Recently, 1 again discussed this matter f u l ly with the Treasurer, who, however, took the view that the reasons advanced for an amendment of the law to provide discretionary power were not strong enough to warrant a reversal of the earlier decision. I should like, in conclusion, to assure you that the existing provisions of the law are administered as sympathetically as possible in the cases to which you have drawn attention. TRADE UNIONS. Mr CH.IFLEY - On the 24th June the honourable member for Moreton (Mr. penFrancis) asked me whether certain organizations had failed to cdinply with the disqualiprovisions of the Commonwealth Conthe ciliation and Arbitration Act 1904-1934 relating to the filing of balance-sheets with the Industrial Registrar. As promised, I have had inquiries made into the matter and find that the facts are substantially as stated by him. This situation arose from 1 and by the fact that, while the Commonwealth over Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904provided that balance-sheets should for be lodged annually, the act did not prescribe any penalty for failure to do so. There was some laxity on the part or orgapernizations in complying with the act as it then stood, bnt the Industrial Registrar was not in a position to enforce compliance with the act. To overcome this anomaly, provision was made in the amending act of 1947 for a heavy penalty for failure to lodge balance-sheets, as prescribed, and when the amending act came into operation, the Industrial Registrar initiated attempts to secure observance of the law. The majority Of unions have now complied with the law and the Industrial Registrar is taking measures to obtain the compliance of all unions. PASSPORTS: ME . E. V. ELLIOTT.",100
177,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"On the 21st June the honourable member for Reid (Mr Lang) asked me the following questions:1. Whether a. passport has been issued to Eliot Volans Elliott, the Communist general secretary of the Seamen's TJnion, to enable him to attend a Communist conference in Italy J 2. Will the right honourable gentleman indicate the countries that Elliott has been given permission to visit? 3. The text of the official endorsement on the passport? 4. Is Elliott still a member of the Maritime Industry Commission and has he been granted leave of absence by the Commission to attend the conference? 5. What steps are being taken to ensure I hat information that has been made available to Elliott in his official position w i he taken out of this country? B. Will the Registrar of the Commonwealth Uourt of Conciliation and Arbitration be asked to ascertain what union funds are being expended on the trip 7. Has the attention of the Prime Minister been directed to Elliott's statement that he had proposed to visit the TJnited States of America on his return home but that he had heen refused a vise by the TJnited States Consulate? 8. Will the right honourable gentleman state whether the Government is providing funds abroad for Elliott, who has only arranged for a one-way air passage. The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l l o w s : 1, 2 and 3. E. V. Elliott applied for passport facilities and as he complied with all the required conditions a passport was issued in his favour. The document was made valid for travel to all countries witliin the British Empire and all foreign countries excepting India, the latter country being excluded in conformity with a request by the Indian authorities that passport facilities for travel to India should not he granted to Communists No official endorsement was inscribed in the passport for the purpose of obtaining special facilities in Mr Elliott's favour. 4. Mr Elliott is still a member of the Maritime Industry Commission. It has not been customary for members of the commission to seek leave when any long absence is proposed, nor do the National Security (Maritime Industry) Regulations under which the commission is constituted require it . Mr Elliott was not granted and did not apply for leave. Each member has a deputy who attends in his stead and during the absence of Mr. Elliott his deputy will attend any meetings. 5. It is not considered that during his membership of the comniission he gathered any information which should not be taken out of the country. d. The Registrar has no power to compel the union to submit details of individual expenditure from union funds. 7. I am informed that a vis6 to visit the United States of America was refused to Mr. Elliott. The reason was not disclosed, but it is understood is known to him. S. I refer the honourable member to the answer given by me to this question on the 21st June. HOUSING.",101
178,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"On the 8th June the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr. Holt) asked me a question concerning the sale of houses under the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement. Further to the reply given by me to the l l not honourable member on that date, I desire to inform him that the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement in clause 14 (1.) provides as follows:A dwelling may be sold by a State at any time after its completion but except witli the consent in writing of the Treasurer of the Commonwealth a dwelling shall not be sold at or for a price less than the capital cost of the dwelling ascertained in accordance with the provisions of the First Schedule to this Agreement provided that the total repayments of principal (included in the annual amortisation allowance mentioned in sub-paragraph (a) of paragraph 4 of the First Schedule to this Agreement) in respect of the dwelling may be regarded as part of the purchase price for the purpose of this sub-clause. It was felt by the Commonwealth to Be desirable that a uniform basis of sale be adopted in all States. As I indicated in my oral reply to the honourable member, discussions have taken place between the Commonwealth and States with a view to agreeing upon such a uniform policj. It has, however, been found impossible to obtain a uniform basis acceptable to all States. In a recent letter to the Premier of Victoria, I stated that as it appeared impossible to obtain a uniform basis of sale of dwellings, I was prepared to agree, in principle, to his proposals for the sale of houses in Victoria on the basis of average cost, provided the State pays to the Commonwealth each quarter the full purchase price of the dwelling payable by the purchaser, in accordance with clause 14 (2.) of the Agreement and, in addition, assumes for all time responsibility for the full amount of any net losses arising under clause 14 (3.). Further information as to details of how the system is to be applied in Victoria is awaited from that State.",101
179,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"the Minister for the Army, upon notice I. Is it a fact that the pay of members of the Citizen Military Forces is taxed? 2. Is it a fact that such earnings were not taxable before the last war? 3. If so, will he confer with the Treasurer with a vicw to the waiving of taxation on such payments, in the interests of recruiting for home defence?",102
180,Mr CHAMBERS,Unknown,"The answers to the right honourable gentleman's questions are as follows:1. No provision exists in the Income Tax Assessment Act for pay earned by a member of the Citizen Militar y Forces to be excluded from his total earnings when submitting his income tax return for the purpose of determining his taxation assessment. 2. The conditions as in paragraph 1 also applied at that time. 3. This position has already been given caref u l consideration, and it is not proposed to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act, but to adhere to the policy that has been consistently applied, that the measure of income tax payable should be based _on the total income receipts from whatever source, including overtime earnings and all other extraneous income. The Commonwealth policy of taxing the pay earned by members of the Citizen Military Forces is in keeping with the policy that is in force in the United Kingdom in relation to pay earned by members of the Territorial Army.",102
181,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"On the 5th July, the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr. Beale) asked me a question regarding delays in the issue of income tax assessments. I promised to obtain further information for him on this subject. I have now ascertained that 2,657,739 taxable returns of income derived during the income year 1947-48 had been received by the Taxation Department at the SOth June, 1949. At that date assessments had issued for all save 79,371 of those returns. In addition 412,539 assessments for income years prior to 1947-48 were issued during the year ended the 30th June, 1949. Since that date assessments have been issued for some of the 79,371 returns mentioned and the department is still issuing assessments for these remaining returns. As I indicated in my reply in the House, delays in the issue of assessments are, for the most part, due to the failure of taxpayers to lodge returns promptly. The CommisINCOME TAX; sioner of Taxation has kept me informed of the efforts made to overtake the arrears of work which accumulated in his department during the war. I am satisfied that considerable progress has been made in the issue of outstanding assessments, and I share the Commissioner's confidence that the arrears will be speedily overtaken. In reply to the honourable member's question regarding the amount of income tax outstanding, I desire to inform him that the amounts outstanding at the 30th June, 1949, were-Individuals , £43,796,186; companies, £11,911,865; war-time company tax, £176,075. SUPERANNUATION.",102
182,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"On the 23rd June, the honourable member fov Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons) asked me a question, concerning the position under the Commonwealth Superannuation Act of married women employed in the Commonwealth Public Service who have been deserted by their husbands or whose husbands are invalids. Supplementing my reply to the honourable member on that date, I now advise that the position under the Superannuation Act as it stands is that section 4c provides that a married women who becomes an employee after the commencement of that section, i.e., the 3rd August, 1945, shall not be entitled to, or required to, contribute to the fund or the provident account. There are many married women in the Public Service, some of whom have been deserted by their husbands, some capital living apart from their husbands and directors some who are not supported by their husbands. An y concession designed admit them to the Superannuation Fund nominees ? with the right to retirement on pension on the grounds of invalidity, or of contributions in the event of retirement on the re-establishment of the marriage on a normal basis, would have wide repertralasia) cussions. It would also be most to administer. Moreover, the Superannuation Fund has been established on an actuarial basis, which does not provide shares); for the inherent risk involved in the mission of married women employed contributors. The 1945 amendment of the act was very carefully considered the Government before it was implemented by Parliament and I regret that, in view of the considerations involved, I cannot sponsor an amendment designed to meet the request of the honourable member. COAL STRIKE.",102
183,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"On the 7th July , the honourable member for Reid (Mr Lang) tors; asked me questions concerning unemploytheir ment occasioned by the recent coal strike.
