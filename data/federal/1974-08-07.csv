2,The CHAIRMAN,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,"Order! The Joint Sitting will now proceed to the consideration of the fourth proposed law named in the Proclamation, namely, the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973, and pursuant to rule 11, I propose the question: That the proposed law be affirmed. Senator Douglas MCClelland (Minister for the Media and Manager of Government Business in the Senate)-May I have the indulgence of the Joint Sitting to raise a point of procedure on this legislation? Before the debate commences I wouldtiketo suggest that it may suit the convenience of the Joint Sitting to have a general bate covering this proposed law and the proposed law entitled Health Insurance Act 1973, as they are related measures. Separate questions will, of course, be put at the conclusion of the debate. I suggest, Mr Chairman, that you permit the subject matter of the two proposed laws to be discussed in this debate.",16
3,The CHAIRMAN,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,"Is it the wish of the Joint Sitting to have a general debate covering the two proposed laws? There being no objection, I will allow that course to be followed.",16
4,Mr HAYDEN,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION," Mr Chairman, it is my honour commend to the Joint Sitting of this Parliament for confirmation the Health Insurance Comcares mission Bill 1973 and the Health Insurance Bill 1973. The presentation of these Bills to the Sitting of the Parliament on this occasion comes necessary following a recent double disHealth solution. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Snedden) at this Sitting yesterday suggested that the Joint Sitting had become an anti-climax. That may well be, but that is not the ment's fault. We did not choose a Joint Sitting and, quite frankly, thought it was unnecessary. The fact that a Joint Sitting would establish was well known through simple arithmetic-tha there would be a majority with the Government members of the House of Representatives and choice the Senate-shoul d have indicated to any flexibleThat and understanding intelligence that all that would be involved in forcing a Joint Sitting Parliament would be added cost to the community and a further delay in the process of legislation of the Parliament. 1 think it raises serious questions about the capacity of people in the Opposition as an alternative government and especially about the flexibility, the comprehension and the intelligence of some of the decision makers of the Opposition that they should have forced this situation today. ACT 1973 No Bills ought to be better known or better understood than the Health Insurance Commission Bill and the Health Insurance Bill. They have been debated more extensively both inside this Parliament and outside than any other issue on the record of this Parliament. But, unfortunately, the vested interests here and outside have been assiduous in propagating misrepresentation and creating confusion, because the vested interests stand to lose while the public interest stands to gain by the changes we are proposing. Indeed, emotionalism reached great heights on the part of the Opposition when the spokesman for the Opposition on matters such as this, the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Chipp) desaid he was prepared even to fall at the barricades fighting against the proposal for a universal health insurance program. With the kindliest intent in the world I say to him that as one of the first casualties to faU at the barricades today he can be one of the first people to caU on the benefits of the new universal health insurance program. The program we will bringing in is a comprehensive program. It is based on equity; it is based on a sense ofjustice; it will ensure that every person in this community is covered for health purposes; and, most certainly, it is to based on a freedom of choice- a freedom to choose the private medical practitioner that one to use and a freedom to choose the type of hospital treatment that one cares to draw upon. Joint Let me outline quickly the key points of the behealth insurance program. I point out that the Insurance Commission Bill is ancillary to the Health Insurance Bill in that the Health Insurance Commission Bill proposes an administrative structure that will ensure that the health Governinsurance program operates properly. These are the benefits that the community stands to gain: For individual citizens our health what insurance program will mean an automatic t health insurance cover that is based on a more equitable system of payment and a freedom of of the doctor and the type of hospital care. cannot be stressed enough. There has been altogether too much dishonesty within this of the chamber from members of the Opposition who neither understand nor want to understand, and from the vested interests whether they are in tain representative bodies of the medical prosituation fession or whether they are in private health insurance funds, which generously subsidise wards their political activities, and which do not this change to take place, in spite of the benefits that it will contribute to the people. Those are people, those are the spokesmen who have situation asserted contrary to the basic principles of scheme. Our scheme guarantees that any member of surgery the public will be able to choose cal practitioner-the one he wants to provide him with medical services. He can sack that medical practitioner if he wants to do so. This scheme not concerned about the organisation and distrivices bution of medical services. That is a much more comprehensive and challenging task. That is task that has been taken up by the Government within the Ministry of Health and mainly health through the activities of the Minister for Health (Dr Everingham) and the Hospitals and Health Services Commission. We are malting rapid spent progress in that area. . No previous Australian Government has committed itself financially to supporting the development ofhealth services in the community on a national scale. Today community health centres are being developed so that people will have a range ofhealth services-no t just medical practitioners, as important as they are, and there is no disputing that fact, but also the people should be backing them up and who have never had adequate encouragement to provide those services or an opportunity to fulfil that task, namely, the paramedics and the associated not medical professionals, such as health social workers, home visit nurses, physiotherapists technologists of various types. They are the people who are now staffing those community health centres. Similarly, psychiatric community health centres are being set up. A school dental service is now being developed. People are trained to be therapists so that the children of the nation-ou r children, the most valuable investerty ment we will make in the future of this countryyear. will, among other things, have adequate health services available to them in the school grounds through the services being developed. For thefirsttimeever the critical situation Australia's pubhc hospitals is being attacked. The Australian Government, through Dr surgeries, Everingham and the Hospitals and Health Sercedural vices Commission, is providing money-no t prospecialist posing to do so but doing so; it commenced to do so in the last Budget-to the State authorities maintain our pubhc hospitals so that they can cerupgrade them. No one could be happy with the that exists today whereby accident victims have to be canvassed about the casualty of the pubhc hospitals in the large cities of want the community. Nothing was done before we took office; something is now being done. There the can be no satisfaction about the existence of a in the fringe suburbs of our largest cities our of Sydney and Melbourne whereby elective surgery cases have to wait several months, one year and sometimes longer before they can obtain the procedural services that they require. his or her mediThose things are being attacked. I want to move back from the subject to which is I have diverted because it relates to health serand I do not want any member of the Opposition to stand up and say that I have spoken a only about an economic exercise. Of course that is what this is. That is what the present system of insurance is. But this is a superior system ofhealth insurance as an economic exercise, as a financial exercise, because every dollar that is maximises the return in health services that are purchased. The essential thing about a health insurance program is that it should cover everyone in the community, there should be equity in the distribution of the cost of the scheme and people should be able to obtain the health services they need without concern as to whether the cost is going to be prohibitive in some way or other. who Those things do not happen now. That is how this scheme, as an economic exercise, is superior. To the extent that it guarantees medical services and hospital services and extends choice in ways previously available, it clearly improves the quality of medical and hospital services. And it and does this by providing cover for people not presently covered. It is an unchallengeable fact that many people are not receiving proper health care. This has been established by surveys in Sydney and Melbourne and will be confirmed being again, with even added emphasis, when the findings of the commissioners mquiring into povare published a little later this year and next The people on low incomes, especially migrants, are not receiving the level of medical and hospital care that they really need in the best interests of their health. This scheme will cover in all pensioners in the community and not just for medical consultations at general practitioners as now, but will cover them for proitems as well. It will cover them for services and they will be able to go to a private specialist of their choice. Pensioners will that be treated in exactly the same way as other members of the community are. These are principles that do not exist at the present dme. At present, with the excepuon of the States of Queensland and Tasmania, there is a fairly rigid means test on those who can enter the pubhc wards of public hospitals. It was Nimmo, by the way, in his report which was produced at the request of the Liberal-Country Party government, who recommended that this means test must go. We are going to expand choice by proposing that that means test does go. To that extent, as we do these things we improve the quality of health care. Under our scheme patients will be able to receive free standard ward-o r public ward as it is called in some States-treatment without a means test. But those who want to go into the private wards of pubhc hospitals, into the intermediate wards or into vate hospitals will be perfectly entitled to do so. They will attract a $ 16 a day subsidy towards the cost of the bed they occupy. They can insure themselves for the cost of hospital treatment above that level, bearing in mind that their medical costs will be met automatically by the medical side of this insurance program. The additional cost of that extra insurance is an allowable deduction for taxation purposes and that cost, with the basic levy of 1.35 per cent of able income, for most people in the community and for most families will still be less than the cost of hospital and medical insurance under the present scheme. For the privately practising doctors this scheme will mean the existing system of medical care and the doctor-patient relationship will be maintained. These are iron clad guarantees which are written into our scheme. For State governments, our scheme will mean that at last there will be a cost sharing arrangement. The States have needed such a formula for a long time and it now becomes critically needed because the costs of maintaining public hospitals are exploding at an exponential rate and quite clearly proceeding at a rate which will soon be beyond the capacity of State government authorities to finance. Under this scheme we will meet 50 per cent of the net costs of operating public hospitals in the community. An adjunct to the program will allow for the provision of nursing home benefits as a direct and universal benefitfinancedby the Australian Government from Consolidated Revenue and not just for people entitled to the pensioner medical service benefits. In Queensland the public hospitals will attract more than an additional $30m. I come from Queensland and I can assert with confidence, but certainly with no satisfaction, that the state of public hospital services in Queensland and the standard of facilities available is deteriorating rapidly. The quality of the staff is unsurpassed but the facilities with which they have to work are inferior. This comes about because the State Government just cannot divert sufficient resources to maintain standards, let alone improve them. These standards are dectining. This injection of additional finance will give the sort of stimulus required to allow the Queensland Government to regain standards. The fact that the Queensland Government spends on bed and day maintenance costs only 60 per cent of what is spent in Austraha on average on such costs is an indication of how much lower standards in Queensland must be compripared with other States. We want to get away from this situation. Our basic position-and it is the primary intention of this program-is that health care services should be provided in the same way as is assistance for education; it should be provided as a social utility available as a right to every Australian rather than as a commodity to be traded or as a privilege to be purchased. I think it is fair enough to ask the question: Why change, why move away from a scheme tax- which members of the Opposition once used to say-the y do not say it now-wa s the best scheme in the world? They even went to the extent just before the last election of drumming up rather hastily a rather vague proposition for restructuring the present system of hospital insurance. Their proposal turned out to be a rather tattered ambulance service costing about $200m which would do very little to remedy the defects of the present system of health insurance. The worse aspect of their proposals was that they had been poorly thought out. But the proposals were a confession that there is something wrongsomething dreadfully wrong-wit h the present system of private health insurance. There are clear and compelling arguments why there should be a change. The very fact that at any given time the present system of health insurance fails to cover more than one million people is one reason. This fact is not open to challenge. The Australian Bureau of Statistics, which was known as the Bureau of Census and Statistics, and more recently Professor Henderson in one of his surveys for his poverty inquiry, have established that at any given time at least 13 per cent of the population is without any health insurance cover at all, and most of the people in this grouping are people who cannot afford to take the risk of not having adequate cover for their health needs. These are the people who are repeatedly shown up in social surveys the people who have health needs which are not being met. It is a poor state of affairs that high number of people should have neglected health needs in a wealthy society such as ours. The efforts to prop up the present scheme havevice been disastrous. The subsidised health insurance most other program at best could cover only four out of every 100 low income famihes which it was posed to cover. The inequity of the present scheme is intolerable. Take the position of a man with a wife and 2 children in New South Wales health who wishes to cover himself and his family for intermediate hospital and medical cover. A man in this posiuon who earns $80 a week after tax pays over $2 a week for his health insurance a failure. cover. But a man earning $300 a week pays only a little over $1 a week for his health insurance cover. The wealthy man gets at least a $45 subsystem sidy each year. Let us not have any argument age that because a wealthy man, or a comparatively better off man, pays more tax, he is entided more. We do not argue that because a man earnsproposal more income and therefore pays more in tax he should pay less for the use of a social utility as public transport or that he should pay less a loaf of bread or for anything that he uses community. Yet this seems to be the argument which has been put forward by spokesmen for vested interests in the community trying to give some sort of cloak of respectability to this absolin utely dreadful inequity and discrimination against lower income earners. Liberals privately, in the secrecy of their committee meetings, have confessed this inequity because at page 9 of the original document which one of the Opposition members was kind enough to send to my office anonymously before the last election-the ment on the Opposition's health proposals-th following remarks were made: It has been argued with some force that the progressive rates of taxation produce inequities with deductible items. For example, the case has been Minister less to insure himself for health and medical care than it does for his chauffeur to do the same thing. As the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) pointed out, there is always a great distinction between and them; we have drivers, they have chauffeurs.rather The Opposition went on to argue in this docuhealth ment that something would have to be done about this situation, but it seems to be a principle that they have forgotten. Let me move on to another problem of the present system of health insurance, namely, the cost explosion. There has been a 152 per cent Australia increase in the commitment by which the Ausand trahan Government has tofinanceprivate health as insurance schemes and associated schemes like the pensioners medical service and repatriation such amedical services. The Australian Government spent $325m in that area in thefinancialyear just completed. The rate of explosion in health sercosts in this area covered by and related to health insurance is far faster in Australia than in advanced countries in the world. It is far faster than in Canada. We hear a lot about supCanada from Opposition spokesmen, from the Australian Medical Association and from the insurance funds. We are told that the scheme there is a failure. Then the argument goes that the scheme in Australia is similar to the one in Canada and, to complete the simple Uttle syllogism, that therefore the scheme here will be Let us compare the Canadian system and the in Australia. In the last 5 years the averannual rate of increase in costs in health services has exceeded 18 per cent per annum into Australia. The AMA criticised the Government's and said that in Canada the average increase in costs was 13 per cent per year. Would suchthat we could be as successful as the Canadians. for One must bear this fact in mind about the in the Canadian system. The Canadian system covers everyone in that country. As a proportion of gross domestic product the cost of Canada's health services is at this point about the same as the United States of America, but I repeat that in Canada everyone is covered. In the United States a very large proportion of the pubUc is not covered. More importantly, the rate of increase in costs in Canada is much less than the rate of increase in costs in the United States. If one had to make a comparision to decide which scheme docuthe present Australian scheme was more likee that in Canada or that in the United States-on e would have to say that it was more like that of the United States of America. What the Government is trying to do by progiven that it costs the Prime posing a system of umversal health insurance is to bring Australia up to this stage of the twentieth century and to give it what most other advanced countries of the world have. Even the us United States of America is in the middle of a turbulent debate on the issue of universal insurance. Some very respected poUticians, such as Senator Edward Kennedy, are putting forward proposals for schemes which are very similar to the one which the Australian Government is proposing. But no one in America would bear with the sort of scheme that exists in at present. It is too costly, it is wasteful it is inefficient. The interests of contributors are not properly attended to. Worst of all, its inequity and the way that it neglects so many people in the community indicate that it is inappropriate to a wealthy country which makes some claim to a commitment to respect for human dignity and the rights of people.",16
5,Mr CHIPP,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION," Mr Chairman, I have been in some doubts as to the value of televising the proceedings in Parliament. After hearing the speech just ended, I have changed my mind. I am now persuaded that it is a good thing, because the people of Australia have just seen the most pathetic exposition of this so-called Labor scheme and they can now judge it for themselves. This is the fourthtimethat this so called Labor health scheme has been debated in this place. It is the fourth time that I have stood here with the unanimous support of everyone sitting on my left to oppose the legislation with all our force. In doing that, the Opposition realises the poltiical implications of its stance. We are not here to make a political point. It is a matter of principle, because we believe that this health scheme proposed by the Labor Party would be a disaster to the health of the Australian people. I reject on behalf of everybody on my side the sordid allegation made by the Minister for Social Security (Mr Hayden) that the Opposition bows to vested interests. We do not give a damn about vested interests. It is a sordid allegation. What the Opposition cares about is the health of the Austrahan people. That is why we oppose this scheme. This debate is not really about politics, although it is conducted in a poltiical forum. It is a debate about human beings-Australia n human beings-and the most important thing in their lives, their health. This debate concerns not only those people who are now Uving, but also those to be born, because once this Labor health scheme is impacted on the Australian people there is no getting away from it. It will be with for ever, as the British socialised health scheme is Bill. with the British people, as are the schemes that exist in Canada and New Zealand. This proposed scheme affects all Australians-Uvin g and to be born. The inevitable result of Uving is that sometime all of us will lose that rare gift which we take for granted while we have it-ou r health. We appreciate it only when we lose it. All of us can talk academically about health schemes, doctors and hospitals until we or one of our farnily need one. Tomorrow, as innocent pedestrians, we or our children could have our hopes decimated by the fool or the drunkard in a motor car. Any one of us could be struck at any time by a predatory virus, no matter what our social standing, income, age or sex may be. The mysterious killer diseases of heart and cancer could strike any of us without warning. Every baby born in Australian families requires hospitalisation and the best of medical care for mother and child. No one can promise that we shall not grow old. These are the things that this debate is about. I am not suggesting that the Minister for Social Security or any member of the Australian Labor Party does not have the same basic concern about these values as we do. What we say is that their method of approaching them and solving them is basically wrong and will end in disaster. They are socialists. They are proud to be socialists. They approach all problems in this community with that philosophy. Eighteen months ago honourable members opposite sincerely beUeved that they could improve our way of Ufe. They sincerely beUeved that they could improve our economy. In 18 months they have reduced it to near chaos and disaster. The sociaUst regards the individual as a nuisance. In 18 miserable months the Government has made the rate of inflation jump from 4 per cent to 14 per centunparalleled in our history. In atimeof an oil crisis the Government has rendered AustraUa",20
6,The CHAIRMAN,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,Order! I ask the honourable gentleman to refer to the Bill.,20
7,Mr CHIPP,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,"Mr Chairman, you know that I have ultimate respect for your rulings, but if the performance of this Government over the last 18 months is not relevant to what it promised to do in the field of health, I regard that as a rather curious ruling.",20
8,The CHAIRMAN,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,"I deem it not to be relevant. The honourable member made a passing reference to it, which was quite in order. I allowed that. But when he started to talk about oil he got on to another matter altogether. This has us nothing to do with an oil crisis; this is a health",20
9,Mr CHIPP,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,"Let me talk about what the Government promised young married people 18 months ago. The Government said that it would solve then problems. A young person getting married today has to pay $36,000 for a home. He has to borrow $18,000 on first mortgage at 12 per cent. The Government has done that in 18 months.",20
10,The CHAIRMAN,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,"Order! I ask the honourable gentleman to confine his remarks to the Bill before the chair, which is a health Bill.",20
11,Mr CHIPP,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,"This measure before the Joint Sitting will effect the health of every Australian. The Government's performance in this regard must be judged on its performance over the past 18 months. I would have thought that it quite fair and proper for me to refer to the Government's miserable record over the past 18 against months to allow the Australian people to assess against the what hope this health scheme has. That is what only medicine the Government has done in 18 months-al l of that and many more things, Mr Chairman, which you will not permit me to mention. It is not easy of to do those things in 18 months. One needs a rare Because touch of genius to do them, but the Government incentives of the professional has done them, spending money like a drunken sailor on leave. Now it proceeds with this health scheme which 56 per cent of the people surveyed in Gallup poll said that they do not want. Yet with the persistence of the stupid the Government presses on with it, as socialists the words of Koestler about socialists. He said that they whip the groaning masses to theoretical happiness which only they can see. The Labor Party genuinely beUeves that the best health care system is by salaried doctors, with Governmentare owned hospitals and Government-owned nurssacrifice ing homes. The Minister for Health (Dr Bills Everingham) is on record as saying that he envisare ages that in a few years time, under the scheme, 80 per cent of people will be going to salaried doctors and that only 20 per cent will be able afford to see a private doctor in his surgery. Parliament? Where is the doctor-patient relationship in that sort of scheme? In July 1972 the Minister for the Environment and Conservation (Dr Cass) said: Private hospitals and private to the Labor Party's concept of a national health scheme. The vast majority of people could easily be catered the public hospital sector. The Prime Minister himself, in July 1972, said: The major act of nationalisation in the traditional be undertaken by a Labor Government in the next term be through the establishment of a single health fund administered by a health insurance commission. The Minister for Social Security, in September 1972, said: The Labor Party is a. sociaUst pany and its aim as medical care is concerned is the establishment enterprise. If we had any doubt about the Government's will intentions, the statements of those 3 people should be enough to dispel them. These sorts of statements literally mean that there will be a system of salaried doctors and the destruction of the doctor-patient relationship, the destruction the magnificent private hospitals, the pubUc hospitals, philanthropic nursing homes run by dedicated people, government-owned insurance funds including the little ones, and funds owned was by trade unions and friendly societies. We in the Liberal and Country Parties are the nationalisation of medicine. We are nationalisation of all professions-no t but also law, science and architecture. We beheve that it would reduce the quaUty Uving to that of a sociaUst banana repubUc. of the inherent strengths and weaknesses ofhuman nature, as soon as therightsand man to practise in a free, competitive society are taken away and he is forced to work in a government machine, creative achievements, ingenious new techniques, a break-throughs in knowledge and further explorations of the perplexing problems of mankind cease and we are all reduced to a level of do. I remember mediocrity. I make an appeal to Senator HaU, who I understand is to oppose these BiUs but who then by some curious system of logic, after these Bills passed by the sheer weight of numbers, will the principle on which he opposes these and vote for the enabling Bills when they introduced. That is a form of logic which I cannot follow. If he approves something on principle, how does it change if by the sheer weight to of numbers certain BiUs are passed through this Let me explain what the Bills do. Firstly, the Government says to between 92 per cent and 95 per cent of Australians who are already covered by voluntary health insurance: 'We are going to nursing homes are irrelevant upset the present situation. We are not going to give you the right of choice of voluntary for in insurance. We will force you by a compulsory super-tax of 1.35 per cent on income to insure with the government insurance fund'. It goes further and says to the man whose wife is worksense to ing: 'We will not only take 1.35 per cent off your will income in tax, but we will also take it off your wife'. So there will be double taxation in a family. In Queensland, the Minister's own State, the scheme goes further. It hits Queenslanders a third time because, as the Minister knows, in far as Queensland there is free hospitalisation already. of pubUc Not only will all husbands and wives in Queensland be taxed on their incomes but they be taxed for something that they are already getting for nothing. I would be amused to hear how the Minister justifies that to Queenslanders. The Government scheme goes further. By of choice, 80 per cent of those people who now insure privately have opted for insurance for private wards. A young couple prefer to have their baby born in a private hospital. Eighty per cent of them pay for private hospital insurance. The Government says: 'We will insure you and drag you down to pubhc ward accommodation. We will take away your choice'. The Minister says that people can insure privately. Is there any young couple who could afford additional private insurance after the imposition of the supertax of 1.35 per cent on income? Estimates of private insurance over and above the tax range from $100 to $200 a family. Can a young couple afford that as well? That proposition is absurd. The Opposition believes in the maximum coverage of people. We concede that many people today are not covered for health insurance and should be. From 5 per cent to 8 per cent of people are in this category. If the ister and the Labor Party acknowledged that in those people they had a problem and decided to try to cover those people-the poor, the migrant, the ignorant; the 8 per cent or 5 per cent-w e would be all the way with them. But they do not do that. They go to everybody in Australia and in typical sociaUst fashion grab them. The Government says: 'We will grab the lot of you and take away your freedom of choice'. In its obsessive zeal for nationalisation the Government will create one government insurance fund which will process 90,000 claims a day. That is mind boggling. Everyone's personal medical history will be in one Government owned data bank. The Labor Party health scheme entitles all Australians to free hospitaUsation in a public ward. I ask: What is the effect of this? At present free public ward accommodation is mostly reserved for the poor, the migrant, the pensioner and those suffering from diseases the treatment of which demands special and sophisticated forms of equipment. Such hospitals are exclusively reserved for bad casualty cases. But these pubhc hospitals are now used to full capacity. For example, in Melbourne there is already a waiting Ust in public hospitals of from 6 to 18 months for non-urgent surgery. The present system gives preference to the underdog, the poor person and people on low incomes. These are the people whom the Australian Labor Party supposedly champions. But make hospitalisation free overnight as the Government proposes to do on 1 July next year and we remove that preference to the poor, to the underdog and to the underprivileged. They will then have to compete with everybody else. The absurdity is that into the already overcrowded system we will impact milUons and millions of people who are available for free accommodation in pubUc ward hospitals. This will throw the public ward hospitals in this country into chaos. Human nature being what it is, why would not people who have a tax imposed on them say to themselves: 'WeU, I am being taxed for this free public ward accommodation. I might as well use it.' That is human nature. As I said a moment ago, many people will not be able to afford private insurance over and above the super tax. In Melbourne alone 1,000 additional pubhc ward beds will be required overnight. How do we get 1,000 beds overnight? We cannot build a new hospital overnight. We can extend the waitingtimefor non-urgent surgery in pubUc hospitals as they have had to do under the United Kingdom scheme upon which this scheme is modeUed. One has to wait three to five years in the United Kingdom to have surgery for Minvaricose veins, non-urgent gynaecological disorders, hernias and the like. Does the Labor Party want to impact that kind of scheme on Australia? the third possibiUty is that we commandeer private hospitals. I think that the great private hospitals run by philanthropic, charitable and reUgious organisations which have done a fantastic job for health care in this country are in immediate danger under this scheme. Does anybody in Melbourne believe that that great private hospital, the Mercy Hospital, or the equally great St Andrew's private hospital will remain immune? The Minister will commandeer, induce, seduce in some way beds from these hospitals. There is only one place in which these additional pubUc ward beds will be required and under this Bill the Minister has power-tim e does not permit me to go into this-to do just that. This Bill makes the Minister for Social Security a latter day Don Corieone as far as the private hospitals are concerned. He can make them an offer. They cannot possibly refuse. No matter what the Minister says about doctor of own choice, if a great private hospital is half pubUc and half private it is absurd to talk about a patient in the private section having the doctor of his own choice. That is a myth. I remind the people of Australia that this scheme cannot be paid for out of the 1.35 per cent levy. For every doUar the Government collects on that levy there has to be an extra $2 or more out of ConsoUdated Revenue. Who provides ConsoUdated Revenue? It is the taxpayers, and on to them this already over-expensive Labor Government is impacting a scheme which, according to an expert actuarial firm, is already under-costed by $300m or $400m per annum. The Minister wiU not cost his scheme. He is asking this Joint Sitting to pass an uncosted scheme, to give him a blank cheque. Mr Chairman, we are not obstructionists. We have an alternative scheme. On 3 occasions in the House of Representatives I have said to the Minister that the Opposition supports increased money for public hospitals, we support assistance for people on low incomes with their insurance premiums and we support a great number of proposals in his health scheme; and I have appealed to him to adopt a bi-partisan approach on these matters. If he does that, the Opposition will give him every co-operation. But he has not done so. I plead with him to drop this crazy costly scheme. It will not improve the nation's health. It depersonalises medical care. It offers patients pubhc wards when 80 per cent of people have shown clearly that they want private ward accommodation. It adds massively to costs at atimewhen cost increases are destroying our way of life. Why does the Government not realise that it cannot keep spending money as though it is going out of fashion? The Treasury coffers are not some bottomless pit into which some mystical goose continues to lay golden eggs. The ordinary, hard working Australian is the person who has to pay for socialist extravagances. The fact of life that this Government does not understand is that there are no mystical geese, although at times members of the Government Party seem desperately to be trying to imitate them, and there are no golden eggs. The Labor Government has ruined everything it has touched in the past 18 months. It can meddle with and ruin everything else it touches, but I plead with it not to meddle with the nation's health.",20
12,Mr BERINSON,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION," Mr Chairospital man, section 57 of the Constitution provides where the requirements for a joint sitting have been satisfied the sitting shall vote but liberate; that is, it need not necessarily deliberate on the proposed laws put before it. me that when the founding fathers wrote in that provision they must have had something like these health Bills in mind because, especially having heard the honourable member for sition Hotham (Mr Chipp) and, for that matter, knowhe ing in advance how I proposed to respond, I can only be fortified in the view that if there is subject on which no good purpose can be served by further argument it is this subject of Labor's alternative health scheme. It has all been said fore. Only rarely can a domestic political debate in Australia have been as long and expensive as bitter and divisive as has been the case with this subject. We have fought 3 elections on it, first as far back as 1969. We have passed this very Bill through the House of Representatives times within the last 9 months. Thousands man-hours and millions of dollars have been spent in propaganda pro and con. At every stage the Government has been open in its intentions and open to advice, suggestions and request. The present Bill, in its substantial difference from earlier concepts, reflects the willingness of the Government to accommodate, so far as that is possible, both the concern and the special interests of all affected groups. I am quite sure that even now the Government will remain receptive to reasonable approaches for further amendment to it; but, for the moment and for technical reasons which are well known to us all, the Bill must go through this Sitting in its present printed form. That being so and the result being inevitable, I wonder whether we might be able at last to look at the scheme in a rather calmer and more rational manner than has been the case in past debates. If we are to be honest we would all acknowledge, I think, the serious difficulty, when we try to discuss a complex issue for the purposes of political persuasion, is that it is easy to fall into the trap of using generalities and over simplification which ends up distorting the picture. In this context slogans are particularly good for short term political effect, if useless for real understanding, and whatever may be said about the opponents of Labor's health scheme it could not be said that they have been short of slogans. They have said, as Mr Chipp continued to sav today, that we were going to nationalise medicine; we were going to prevent freedom of choice; we were going to destroy the doctorE atient relationship; we were going to wreck the system; we were going to give much less that service at far greater cost; we were going to socialise, centralise and bureaucratise; and we may dewere going to reduce proud, vigorous and individualistic Australians to mere ciphers on It occurrs to some remote computer roll. Mr Snedden-That is right.",23
13,Mr BERINSON,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,"The Leader of the Opposays that isright.That indicates how much must know about it. As we have seen today, not even all that vilification could stop the impeone tus of a new scheme, but it has had many unfortunate results all the same. In the first place, it encouraged an inflexible attitude amongst the bemedical profession which precluded its co-operation in amending and improving the scheme. In and the second place, it produced what I would accept as genuine but none the less unnecessary the anxiety and fear among doctors. That situation still persists and it has been deliberately trans3 mitted to a very large number of patients. of Thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, the blanket condemnation of the scheme the produced-as a reasonably natural reaction- a blanket defence of it. In the course of that prosibiUty-i cess some potentially serious difficulties tended to become obscured. Accordingly, at the end of this long campaign, many people-doctor s and pauents alike-ar obviously left with doubts, reservations and fears, many unreal and unjustified but others real and reasonable and calling for consideration. What I would categorise as the unreal worries can be passed over fairly quickly. They are issues which, in the main, have attracted most attention in the public controversy so far. For example refer to the allegation that we are out to destroy the freedom of choice which exists in the present scheme. The honourable member for Hotham did repeated that allegation today, as he has every time. I have heard him speak on this subject. it is less than a year ago that the honourable osition. member for Hotham said: There have been many cliches spoken, in the hope people are idiots, and based cause someone drops a cliche, everyone is going to believe and therefore hate the Government, hate the Labor and despise the health scheme. This line of reasoning stupid. I wish the honourable member for Hotham sue would take his own advice. It cannot be repeated too often that the charge about destruction of freedom of choice is simply untrue. Coverage for all private medical service is part of the program and will continue to be available at reasonable cost. This appUes to general practitioner services, to specialist services and to services within tals and outside them. Anyone who refers to the Bill itself rather than to their own pre-existing prejudices would find it impossible to deny that fact. Let me put it again as clearly and theBetween unequivocally as I can. Any patient seeing any vices doctor today under the present scheme will still from $193m be free to see that doctor when the new scheme is annual increase introduced. The new scheme will in no way restrict Siatient from seeing a doctor he is seeing now. act, far from restricting freedom of choice the new scheme will expand it in many important respects. For the firsttimepensioners requiring specialist attention will not be restricted to hospital outpatient wards but will specialist of their own choice at his private rooms. For the firsttimeeveryone will have the choice of access to free standard ward care including free medical services by paid hospital stafT. Again for the first time, free medical attenis tion will become possible for everyone, free means test, where doctors are prepared, entirely at their own discretion, to accept 85 per cent common fee in fuU payment for their services on a bulk billing system. Curiously, this last post can be no more than a possibiUty behave cause it depends entirely on the doctor's preference-becam e the basis of a second attack on the scheme on the grounds that it would dese troy the doctor-patient relationship. The reasoning here, if one can dignify it by that description, is that somehow there must be a direct passage of payment between patient and doctor for the doctor-patient relationship to arise. That is a pecuUar concept, is it not, because among other things it would mean that the 11 I million consultations last year between pensioners and general practitioners of their own choice where no direct payment was involved not involve any doctor-patient relationship. One wonders how many doctors or pensioners But would be prepared to agree with that propIt is tempting to try to pursue these fairly shalthat low arguments and others like them, for examon the false premise that just beit ple, that we are going to nationalise medicine Party, when our scheme guarantees the continuance of is fee for service medicine, which is the very antithesis of nationaUsation. It is tempting to try to purthese more shaUow arguments, but it is probably more important, given our Umitation of time, to move to other areas which involve matters of more reaUstic concern. It is said, for example, that the new scheme will be accompanied by sharply rising health cost. So it will. But that really proves nothing on its own, does it, because hospithe present health scheme is also accompanied by sharplyrisinghealth costs, and thefiguresare clearly available to demonstrate it. 1969-70 and 1972-73, for example, cost to the Commonwealth of medical serto insured persons and pensioners rose to $329m, that is, at an average of 20 per cent. The Treasurer's statement of financial transactions for the a 1973-74 year shows the outlay on health at In $942m as opposed to $783m the previous year. Again, that is a 20 per cent rate of increase, and aU on the basis of the present health scheme. Mr Donald Cameron-That is ALP inflation be able to attend a doing that.",23
14,Mr BERINSON,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,"In spite of the interjection by the honourable member for Griffith who is no doubt anxious to have some place in Hansard and perhaps on the television coverage, the truth that the escalation of medical costs is a serious of problem in all countries and under all systems, and there is no single, let alone simple, answer to of it. State governments can confirm-and it is evidenced by the most recent 50 per cent increase in hospital charges-that hospital costs are running away in this country under the present scheme and at a much faster rate, as it happens than in Canada or the United Kingdom or the United States of America against which unfavourable comparisons are so often made. The present scheme has no controls, and comparisons with the new program are made on the erroneous, or at least the unbased, assumptions about the extent to which services in the future will be free and will be subjected to abuse. In fact, the statistical feed-back from the new program will at least provide a starting point for control, that is, knowledge of where the money is actually going and what the component trends are. A second major concern has been expressed that doctors will be over-worked, that their surgeries will be flooded with patients, and that there will be an inevitable decline in their standard of practice. Once again I believe it can be said that these fears are based on unwarranted assumptions and assertions that all services in future will be free, and will be freely abused. In fact, doctors will have three billing options, two of which involve them in giving their patients bills and collecting from them exactly as they do at present. If they use these options, as they say they will, there is no reason to expect higher utilisation by people already covered than is already the case. On the other hand, if doctors do adopt the third billing option and so provide literally free medicine-and if their experience indicates that this does lead to excessive pressure and declining standards-ther e will be nothing to prevent them from reverting to another billing system which reintroduces part charges. The standard of medical practice, in other words, as is the case now remains in the hands of the profession itself. This still leaves for consideration what is probsake ably the most serious question of all, namely, what will happen to hospital services when free standard ward treatment becomes available on the basis of paid, allocated hospital staff. On question the honourable member for Hotham and the Opposition in general have adopted what might fairly be described as the disaster view, and it goes something like this: Firstly, as soon as free standard ward treatment becomes available there will be such an immediate and huge shift of patient demand to the standard wards that the pubhc hospitals will be incapable of coping; their standards will crumble; patients will be left queuing for attention, with long waiting periods before admission. The honourable member for Hotham nods his head and insists on that view. He would also insist that the converse would apply, namely, that the pubhc hospitals being starved of clients would simultaneously go into collapse, although for the opposite reason. That combination of events in fact could occur in a certain set of circumstances. The point of view I put to the honourable member for Hotham is that that set of circumstances is not going to occur and is positively prevented by the provisions of the Bill. That set of circumstances could arise, for example, if the Government procost vided no subsidy at all for intermediate or private beds, but that is not the case. It could happen if no arrangements were possible for private supplementary insurance to meet the gap between bed costs and government subsidy, or if the cost of that supplementary insurance were prohibitive. Safeguards against each of these possibilities are specifically ensured by the Bill or by clear commitments contained in the White Paper on which the Bill is based. A daily hospital benefit of $16 has been guaranteed. That figure was set before the most recent increase in hospital charges and, I beheve, will have to be subject to further review. Again, the White Paper ensures that private supplementary insurance will be available and will be community rated to ensure reasonable contribution levels. Quite apart from these factual considerations, however, the disaster view ignores the probability that a high proportion of the public will not opt for free standard wards because in that situation patients will not be able to exercise their own choice of doctor. That will be the case only with private and intermediate wards. The disaster theorists cannot have it both ways. They cannot, on the one hand, say that the pubhc desperately wants to preserve its freedom of choice of doctor but then say on the other hand that for the of an after-tax contribution of less than $1 a week they will desert their private doctors, desert that freedom of choice in a great stampede for the standard wards. I believe that the estimate this made last week by Mr Shaw, the acting general manager of the Hospital Benefits Association of Victoria is more reasonable and certainly more realistic. He estimates that the Association will retain half its present contributors. Nonetheless, there is no point in denying that a potential problem in this area does exist and will have to be monitored carefully, especially in the early days, to ensure that excessive demand in particular areas does not disrupt the scheme as a whole. There seems no reason to doubt that that can be done. The debate in which we are now engaged did not start just this morning or even a couple of months ago with the double dissolution. It did not start last year with the Green and White Papers or at the 1972 election in which the subject figured so prominently. In essence, this debate continues and, hopefully concludes, at long last a discussion initiated 6 years ago by the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) who was then Leader of the Opposition. Those days are so far past that it is hard to remember them. He enunciated 3 desirable principles. The first was universal insurance instead of partial cover, the ond was equitable payment of costs rather than the current inequitable spread, and the third was some predictability in medical costs both as related to total health expenses and as appUcable to individual fee for service arrangements. Nothing that has happened since has made those objectives less desirable or less necessary. Nothing that has been offered since by the Opposition or by any other source has indicated how those objectives might better or more fairly be achieved.",24
15,Mr SNEDDEN,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION," I found the speech by Mr Berinson, the honourable member for Perth, quite a remarkable one. Anybody who listened to him would reaUse that the essential message coming out ofhis speech was this: 'For goodness sake, do not talk any more about this health scheme because the more it is talked about the more it is exposed for its essential badness.' The more it is talked about the more it will become clear to the people of Australia that if this scheme is imposed upon Australia and Australians succeeding generations will go through difficulties the Uke of which we can save them from now. AU we need to do is abandon this commitment to a socialist philosophy. I know that people say: 'Let us examine it for its quality and not condemn it because it is socialistic' On this occasion it demned on both counts. It has been suggested that we should not continue debating it. Let me tell the honourable member for Perth, the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam), the Minister for Social Security (Mr Hayden) and the entire Australian nation that we will fight this scheme continually and positively, and in the end we will defeat it because it is a bad scheme. The objectives of any health scheme are cally the same, whether they are the nation or the objectives of a person. A person wants to be fully covered for any sickness, any $2,000m accident or any debiUty that he may have. He estimated wants a choice of doctor, hospital and the level of more thanthat care in a hospital. He wants access to and the 2000. choice of the paramedical services which are so necessary, especiaUy after surgery. A person wants access to doctors and hospitals. He does not want a perpetual wait in a doctor's surgery. When he needs elective surgery he does not want to have to wait and wait before it can be done in a hospital. He wants the choice of intermediate or private ward care. Why must everybody look as near to a pea in a pod as a sociaUst government can make him? Why must he receive public ward care? Why should he sit in a designated doctor's surgery and wait until he gets his bottle sec- of coloured water which will make him better? What is needed is that when a person requires health care, he must have access to it. That is what we want to provide. Personal requirements are the same as national requirements. Our purpose as members of Parliament, or as members of a Government or the Opposition, is to estabUsh a pohcy which will achieve those things for people. The individual has to be able to pay for these things but not at such a level that they take from him the capacity to spend on other necessities and other comforts. That is the objective of government, but we do not want instituted a national health scheme which will send us broke. That could very easily happen. The honourable member for Perth said that this debate did not start at thetimeof the double dissolution. How true that is. He said that this debate started long ago. AUright,let us go back to 1967. In that year Mr Whitlam is reported in Hansard as having said: We can-and a Labor Government would-buil d an alternative public health service within the limits of present health expenditures in Australia. When was a more stupid statement made? He said that he would build this scheme within the Umits of the existing costs of the health scheme in 1967. The absurdity of that statement is such that one needs only to read it to know that he did not is conknow what he was talking about. He did not understand the subject. He did not begin to understand it. We all know that the Minister for Social Security, Mr Hayden, will not cost his health scheme. He will not put a moneyfigureon it. He does not want to disclose the consequences. The honourable member for Perth, hoping to defuse the issue, said: 'Do not debate this subject because it has aU been said.' Has it all been said? basiOn 26 July, less than 2 weeks ago, the Prime the objectives of Minister said: At present, health services cost our nation more than a year, or about S.3 percent of gross domestic product. Their cost is increasing so dramatically that it has been our expenditure on health services could be 12 per cent of gross domesdc product by the year The honourable member for Perth wants to stop the debate now, but the Prime Minister wants to talk about health services in the year 2000. Let compare the 2 statements of the Prime Minister. He said that the present cost ofhealth services is 5.3 per cent of gross domestic product and that the cost in the future would be 12 per cent. Compare thosefigureswith his statement when he launched the proposal and said: 'We can provide it within the limits of the present health expenditure'. What are the consequences of expanding the cost from 5.3 per cent to 12 per cent of gross domestic product? He was talking about our gross domestic product, which is afiniteamount, afiniteconcept. We can put a moneyfigureon it and escalate that figure and nobody will take much notice of it in these days of 14 per cent inflation. People say that it is just more money, and really do not understand the concept clearly. But people can understand it clearly if we refer 5 per cent of the whole of our gross domestic product and expand thatfigureto 12 per cent, thus contracting the remainder of the gross domestic product. There is no way of escaping that concept; it is real and inescapable. This is what this Government is committing us to. In present day terms our gross domestic product is about $45,000m. Health services, representing 5.3 per cent of our gross domestic product, cost us $2,385m. For these purposes I will refer to it as $2,400m. Twelve per cent of gross domestic product would be $5,400m. In other words, we are being asked to accept a scheme which, on the Prime Minister's estimate, in today's terms would cost us $3,000m more than the present scheme. There is no point in rushing into it and saying that we did not know the gun was loaded; we do know that the gun is loaded. Let us see what these figures mean. In today's terms the extra cost of $3,000m-that is the difference between $2,400m and $5,400mwould represent an increase of about two and a quarter-betwee n two and two and a half-in the share of the gross domestic product given to health services. What does that mean to the rest of us? It means a diversion from all other spending in the community. For example, it must cut down our capacity to spend on education, conservation, defence, roads, urban improvement and pensions. To put it in some form of perspective, if this scheme were in operation today the extra cost would mean that the entire Commonwealth spending on defence, plus the entire Commonwealth spending on education, would be totally obliterated. The money would be going to health. The total spending on defence and education by the Commonwealth was $2,200m but us the extra cost of this scheme is $3,000m. Cut out education and defence spending entirely and we still have not got the $3,000m that would be needed, on the clear statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam), to meet the cost of the scheme. Let me give another example of how costly this scheme would be. The entire social security and welfare, and housing expenditure by the Commonwealth comes to $2,975m. This health scheme would drag away all of that expenditure on those items of social security and welfare and of housing. The man who runs the Ontario health scheme-nowaday s Canada is the criterion for all things, and Ontario is the place from where a lot of this health scheme was taken-sai d this: It is up to the politicians to reform the monster before it to bankrupts the economy and destroys itself. This is the scheme we are not merely being asked to accept; we are being told to be good chaps and to let it through. The Opposition will not abandon its duty to the Australian people in that way. We will fight and continue tofightuntil we are defeated. In Canada the spending on health services is one of the highest portions of gross domestic product in the world, and Canada still has not a health scheme which satisfies anybody. Everybody knows that in Sweden the weight of taxpaying around the neck of the individual is gradually starting to deprive the whole country of any incentive. I am informed that half of the Swedes have to take out private insurance anyway notwithstanding the massive taxes they are paying to try tofinancethe health scheme. The point is that this expense is just massive. It would be economic madness to incur it. If the Government were going to produce a good health scheme we could make a choice and say: 'A good health scheme we will have to pay for and we opt for it.' We could do that. But how can anyone declare this to be a good health scheme when the people who deliver the health scheme-the medical profession-wil l not have a bar of it? Are we to run a health scheme without doctors? That is the sort of socialist Alice-inWonderland world that we are told we can live in. I do not beheve it. At the present time the economy is in disastrous shape. It is all Labor's fault. It has a mad Midas touch. Everything it touches goes bad-housing , interest rates, strikes, inflation, prices. Who knows when we will get out of this place to our electorates? Who knows when people will be able to travel to see their friends and relatives? We sit around to see what will happen. That is the Government's mad Midas touch. The Government must use common sense. We are Uving in a world of charade in this Joint Sitting. The fact of the matter is that if BiUs are passed, as the march of numbers means they will be, it is certain that every man sitting on the Government side of the chamber who votes for them will rue the day, because it is an absolute certainty that each generation will pass on its achievements or its failures. If this health scheme goes through, this generation will be passing on a vast faUure and those who vote for it wiU regret it. Are we to follow the British example? Britain has innation, strikes, nationalised health, and its health scheme is faUing about its ears. It has revolt by the consultants. I understand that in Australian terms a consultant is a specialist. Its unions are saying that they cannot nave private hospitals. The honourable member for Perth and the Minister for Social Security said that the Government scheme is not so bad because if one does not like it one can insure oneself for treatment in a private hospital. In England people tried to do this and the unions are closing down the private hospitals. WUl the Minister give us an assurance that the unions will not close down private hospitals in Australia? In fact, if the Government is to get the number of beds it requires for standard health care it wtil have to pinch them from the private hospitals to start with. The doctors will not accept the scheme in Australia and the private hospitals, the charitable, reUgious, community and rural hospitals, will not have a bar of it. Are we to follow that British example? The British people are great. They should all be out here in Australia so that Australia could have the benefit of the experience they have lived through. Do not forget that a tremendous number of Britons have left Britain, not excluding a tremendous number of doctors who have left Britain because they could not stand the health system there. If we had not had those British doctors who have come to Australia we would not be able to deUver the health care we are delivering today. Britain is short of 24,000 hospital doctors and 60 per cent of the junior doctors in the hospitals and the junior doctors in these socialised practices are not British at all; they have come from overseas. Those who have been to Britain know that if it were not for those overseas doctors the entire scheme would totally collapse. Are we to face a situation where our doctors migrate? We have to get over this myth of free health care. It is not free at all; it will be paid for massively. There must be user restraint. We cannot have a situation where people just go to the doctor and fill up the surgery unnecessarily. these There has to be a restraint. The patient has to make a contribution so that there wiU not be over-usage and so that the people who are sick can get to the doctor. We do not want to see overusage of hospital beds. Where a person is left in bed there is no reason to put him or her out under the Government's scheme and the people awaiting elective surgery will not be able to get into hospital for it because of the over-usage of hospital beds. We want hospitals that are efficient units and not for them to have taken away the example of the present health scheme, so that there will be a proper turnover and efficiency in the hospitals. The levy we heard about to fund the scheme was 1.25 percentof income; then it became 1.35 per cent, and thatfigureis losing more and more reaUty because it will pay for a smaller and smaUer fraction of the total cost of the scheme. The honourable member for Perth, Mr Berinson, said: 'For goodness sake, stop talking about it now. Stop debating it ' One can understand why he should want that when I pointed out the difference between the statement of the Prime Minister in 1967 that the scheme would be provided within the present Umits of cost and that a fortnight ago when he said that it will cost 12 per cent of gross domestic product. The last time this matter was debated in this chamber was in December last year. I said then that the people of Australia should beware because I believe the cost of this scheme could reach 14 per cent of gross national expenditure. Within 2 weeks of today the Prime Minister had already admitted that it would cost 12 per cent. He may accuse me of overstating by 2 per cent. All right. He has come up from 5 per cent to 12 per cent. He has 2 per cent yet to go to make my forecast correct. But when the matter was last debated in December last I said that 14 per cent of gross national expenditure wiU be the cost of the scheme. Let me quote from last December's Hansard- 7 months ago. When talking about the Opposition's proposed scheme-the poUcy I had put forward in a positive sense, the Prime Minister said: In contrast, our program will be cheaper for the vast majority of Australians. How could a man say that and believe it-on e would expect a Prime Minister to believe what he is saying-and within 7 months escalate his estimate from being cheaper than the present scheme to 2Vi times the cost of the present scheme? To put the position in perspective, claim that to fund the scheme would take all present Commonwealth spending on defence the and education. Even if this amount of money were spent on the health scheme, we still would not have arrived at its cost. Is it any wonder we believe not only that the scheme is bad but also that it is horrid? Not only is it bad in today's terms, but also it will bedevil the future. It will reduce the standard of hving of Australians generations to come. We oppose it. Senator DOUGLAS MCCLELLAND (New traUans South Wales-Minister for the Media) (11.51 ) - I scheme. have listened with great interest to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Snedden) expressing his views on this legislation. Apparently, he has cided to lend his voice to the propaganda against the national health scheme. Having heard him and the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Chipp) this morning, it appears me that they represent in this country a political force that is a relic of the dark ages. I say this cause apparently the policy of the Tories in 1930s was more enlightened than the pohcy the Liberals in the 1970s. Mr Lynch-Nonsense . Senator DOUGLAS MCCLELLAND-The health Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lynch) says 'nonsense'. Thirty-six years ago a then senior Minister of the Government of the ing time-he was Treasurer in a United Party Government-introduce d a Bill into the Parliament dealing with national health. The Minister concerned later became a Minister in a Liberal-Country Party Government and, indeed, Governmentlater became the Governor General of Australia. to Mr Casey, as he then was, introduced that Bill Insurance into the House on 4 May 1938 and said in his seccurrently ond reading speech: Voluntary insurance has failed to cater for a part of our population. The greater portion of stand in most need of insurance are uninsured.",26
16,Mr JAMES,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,"Who said that? Senator DOUGLAS MCCLELLAND- Mr this subject. Casey said that in 1938. He went on to say: They are either unable to afford it without the assistance the government or lack the initiative to become and remain insured. He went on to say, 36 years ago: The story of voluntary insurance is marred by a tragedy the number of lapses from insurance due to sickness, ployment and other misfortunes. Again, referring to history, we have seen a Minisover ter of a previous government, Mr Menzies as then was, resign from the Ministry because legislation was not implemented. It is to the we shame of previous conservative governments, governments of the same political persuasion as Party to which the Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Hotham and all other members who are taking part in this debate that from the Opposition point of view belong, that the nation's so-caUed voluntary health scheme does not cater for at least a million Australians today. It is those people and their children more for than anyone else who need the scheme to cover their health needs. Until they are fully protected and until they are fully covered, we as Auswill not have a truly national health Of course, in our own poUticaltimewe have deseen inquiry after inquiry reach practicaUy the war same conclusions as those enunciated by Mr Casey in 1938. We saw the previous Liberal Country Party Government try to head off the to estabUshment of a Labor sponsored Senate Select Committee to inquire into health and hospital becosts. It did this by appointing another inquiry, the namely the Nimmo committee of inquiry, only to of find the Nimmo committee reach the inevitable conclusion that a new approach was required by aU interested parties. We saw the Nimmo committee advocate the establishment of a national insurance commission. A previous Liberal Minister for Health, the honourable member for Barker, Dr Forbes, who I understand will be takpart in this debate, stated in a rninisterial Australia statement on 4 March 1970: It has been decidedThis is by the previous Liberal-Country Party adopt the Committee's proposal that a Nauonal Health Commission be established. The Government is giving consideration to the composition and functions of the new Commission. substantial That was 4 years ago. Nothing was done bethose who tween March 1970 and December 1972 when this Government came to office. In the last 20 months we have seen the Opposition in the Senate time aftertimereject important legislation on Indeed, it has refused even to give the legislation a second reading. The debate on of this Bill, therefore, has raged and smouldered on to many fronts since it was first introduced in the House of Representatives. Probably no Bill in the history of this Parliament has been more of debated; no Bill in the history of this Parliament unemhas been more represented. But at this stage in the long and repetitious debate that has gone on the years there are 2 points that still bear he reiteration. They have not sunk home to the that people who matter, the people who pay the medical bills-the Austrahan people-becaus e they have been caught up in this political propaganda war that has been waged by our poUucal opponents. Red herrings have been spawned by the opponents of this Health Insurance Bill in a veritable ocean of propaganda that has almost swamped the real issues that are the subject of the debate. The Bill, let me stress, is not and should never have been the subject of a campaign between the Government and the medical profession. Yet there is again this false propaganda on the part of the Liberal Party and the Country Party and on the part of the health funds that in some way the doctors have to fight a so-called socialist to undermine doctor-patient relationships. No scheme that involves a fee-for-service payment by the patient-as this scheme does-as well as permitting the patient his or her choice of doctor-as this scheme does-ca n possibly interfere with that relationship. The Bill really concerns the Government's relations with the Health funds-the so-called voluntary health insurance funds. The Bill seeks to improve and rationalise the system of health insurance because it is the Australian Government that is the major contributor to the health funds. The majority of Australians are simply unaware that the Government subsidises very substantiaUy the patients' contributions to the health funds and that the funds are not simply private insurance organisations. Indeed, I have seen it written that the Australian Government pays for $2 out of every $3 that a medical practitioner earns. If that be the fact that two of the funds have more than $50m in reserves and recently signalled their intention to raise patient contribution charges naturally was very much a matter of concern to the Australian Government. So, the focus is finally where it deserves to be. In the Prime Minister's policy speech he stated rooms. that the Australian Labor Government would introduce a universal health insurance scheme, that it would be administered by a single fund and that contributions would be paid according to taxable income. That-n o more and no less-i the hard core of this legislation. But, Mr Chairman, the Opposition has deliberately out to hoodwink the Australian people. It talks constantly about the alleged high cost of the tralian Government's scheme sponsored by my colleague Mr Hayden, the Minister for Social Security. As part of its propaganda war it coninsurance veniently forgets to mention some of the benefits accruing to the Australian people from this his scheme. It refuses constantly to tell the people some of the things which they will get from Government scheme. We heard the Leader of the Opposition talk about hospitals and the need for the modernisation of hospitals. The Liberals have not told the Australian people, for instance, that the present hospital bed benefit of 80c a day for uninsured hospital patients is the same as the amount which was introduced by the Chifley Labor Government in 1948-neve r changed by conservative governments over nearly a quarter of a century-and they have not told the Australian people that the Labor Government wants to increase that subsidy to hospitals for uninsured patients from 80c a day to $16 a day. They have not told the people either that the bed subplot sidy paid by the Government of $2 a day for insured patients is exactly the same as that which was introduced by a Tory government in 1958 or 1959-1 5 or 16 years ago-and that this Labor Government seeks to increase it from $2 a day to $ 16 a day. They have not told the people that the amount of subsidy payable for hospital bed accommodation for pensioners has remained at $5 a day since 1963-for over a decade under the Liberal and Country Party governments-and that this Government wants to increase it from $5 a day to $16 a day. Senator Baume-Rais e it. Senator Douglas MCCLELLAND-If the Opposition will give us this Bill the subsidies that I have enunciated today will be raised by this Government. The Liberals have not told the Australian pubUc that the pensioners, who now have to queue in a public hospital for specialist so, attention because the niggardly Liberal-Country Party Government that preceded us in this place did not give the States sufficient funds, under our scheme will not be discriminated against and that they, as much as any other Australian, will be able to see a speciahst to whom they have been referred in the specialist's own consulting Surely, they, as pioneers of this country, are entitled to equal dignity and equal treatment. Mr Acting Chairman, I do not intend to canvass the many other details of this Bill. The details are not nearly as important as the general s aims, objects and purpose of the legislation, as Acting has been demonstrated by my coUeagues Mr set Hayden and Mr Berinson and by the few examples I have cited. The Bill puts the interests Ausof the majority of Australians far ahead of the interests of the anonymous, self-appointed pontiffs who supervise the hundred or more private funds. The Bill says, in effect, that no Australian should be placed in a position where health or that of his family can be jeopardised by his lack of money or where his health or that the of his children can be further jeopardised by worry over his ability to pay. Sir, all fair minded Australians should support the principle enunciated in this Bill. That is really the gravamen of the whole of this debate. That is why we of the Government say that the motion before the Chair should be ovemhelmingly carried and supported by this historic Joint Sitting. I support the motion.",29
17,Mr LLOYD,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,"This is the fourth occasion on which this legislation has been debated. On the other 3 occasions the Minister for Social Security (Mr Hayden) adopted the same approach as he has adopted today, that is, criticising the present scheme without once giving details of how the Government's proposed scheme will work. The Austrahan public wants to know how the Government's proposed scheme will work. The honourable member for Perth (Mr Berinson) at least gave some details but in doing so he gave away the devastating point, that under the Government's proposed scheme people will still need to take out private health insurance and at a considerably increased cost. The Minister for the Media (Senator Douglas MCClelland), with all his so called expertise in propaganda, was unable to put forward a convincing argument in favour of the Government's proposal. A significant omission from the list of speakers from the other side of the chamber who are to take part in this debate is the honourable member for Prospect, Dr Klugman. In fairness to Dr Klugman I should say that he has expressed doubts about the present scheme, but he has also expressed doubts about the scheme that those who sit on his side of the chamber are putting forward. All of those things add up to the worse fears which have developed and been confirmed in the minds of those who sit in the Opposition since the debate started, that is, that this scheme is unworkable. The Government has not given any details as to how it will work. Presumably that is because it does not know how it will work. Another factor that has to be taken into consideration in relation to this matter is the problem of skyrocketing and accelerating costs, as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Snedden) has said. The experience of other countries which have similar schemes has confirmed the Opposition's fears that the proposed scheme will be an expensive and unworkable one. The best summary of the opposition of those who sit on this side of the chamber to this scheme is provided in the amendment that we moved in relation to it during thefirstdebate on it last The points we made were,firstly,that it would lower the quality of medical care to Australian families; second, that it would increase the total cost to the Government and thus to the taxpayer; third, that it would increase the cost to an individual because, in addition to increased taxation, expensive additional private insurance would be required to maintain health care standards; fourth, that it would reduce the freedom of choice of doctors and hospitals; fifth, that it would jeopardise the future of reUgious, private and country hospitals; and, sixth, that it would be the first stage of nationalisation ofhealth care in Australia. Anybody who doubts the last point should look at what is happening in Great Britain at the present time. The reason why there are so many faults with the Government's proposal is that the basic approach of the Government is wrong. The Government is adopting a revolutionary rather than evolutionary approach to our health care system. What happens with revolutionary approaches? They bring confusion and chaos. It should be remembered that at least 92 per cent of the Australian pubUc are covered at present for hospital and medical care. Surely that is not a revolutionary situation. After 30 years of a national health scheme Great Britain has managed to cover approximately 96 per cent-o r 4 per cent more-of its population. It has been admitted in the Scotton and Deeble report that the Government's scheme will cover initiaUy only 80 per cent, which is considerably less than the 92 per cent covered at present. It has also been admitted that it will take some time to pick up the difference. So we are arguing about 4 per cent or less of the population. Surely that is not a problem that requires drastic revolutionary surgery that will turn the whole health care system into confusion and chaos. One should add to that the fact that according to gallup polls a majority of Australians has consistently shown themselves to be opposed to it and that the vast majority of those involved in the health care system are opposed to it, including the doctors. Anyone who is critical of the doctors should remember that under the Labor Government's proposed scheme they would earn more and work less hours; yet they are still opposed to it. The Opposition agrees that the present scheme needs improving. The pensioner medical scheme and the subsidised health benefits plan for low income earners are not perfect. There are problems with them. We freely admit there are. We have put forward proposals ourselves to simpUfy and improve the schemes. Surely that is what the year. Government should be doing-updatin g the present scheme rather than destroying it. The Labor Party claims that its scheme will help the poor people in this country. It will not. It harm them for 4 reasons. I will give some examour ples that have come forward in the last few weeks. Under the Labor scheme, if it had on 1 July of this year, a family man with a taxable income of $2,500-that is a man who earns only a Utde more than $50 a week-woul d have to pay a special taxation levy of 1.35 per Under the present subsidised health benefits plan-imperfec t though it is-wit h the recent alterations, a family man can earn up to $3,500 and be completely covered for hospital and medical benefits with the Government paying contributions and he still does not have to pay any special tax levy. In other words, even with the Government's great scheme the lower because income people-thos e people earning $1,000 less than the people who are now covered without charge-wil l be caught and will have to pay special tax levy. The second way in which the Government scheme will harm poor people is that it will reduce access to pubhc beds because people who previously used intermediate beds or private beds will be forced into using public beds cause of the increased costs of intermediate and private beds. Third, it will polarise the health system in this country. Instead of having a do reasonable community approach to health in Australia there will be a polarisation between those who, on the one hand, are forced to use the E ublic system and the wealthy who, on the other and, can well afford to pay hospitals and private facilities. Those wealthy people using private facilities will take with a disproportionate share of our health deUvery people-doctors , nurses and so on-so , in a situunder ation of shortages, depriving people who use public wards and ordinary facilities of the serover vices of these urgently needed people. The fourth point is that the community port which has been apparent for health and hospitals generaUy will be lost. Because of this polarisation there will not be this broad spectrum of support. This will be particularly so in country areas where it has been most apparent and once again the ordinary person will lose. In the time available to me in this debate it is not possible detail every point of opposition to the scheme but I want to refer to 2 points. The first point cerns freedom of choice and religious hospitals. Of all hospital beds in this country 20 per are in private, reUgious or charitable hospitals. The second point to remember is that, as the bed honourable member for Hotham (Mr Chipp) and said, 80 per cent of all Australians prefer and intermediate or private ward accommodation will rather than pubUc ward accommodation. Under free choice arrangement at the present time 80 per cent of Australians opt for the interstarted mediate or private ward accommodation. If the Government's scheme comes in, the cost of private and intermediate beds will increase cent. because the Government supported insurance scheme will not be available for these 2 types of accommodation. Nothing Government supporters may say can alter this position. Insurance will still be avaUable but it will not be the his Government supported insurance that we have at the presenttime.That means that these types of hospitals will not have people coming to them they will not be able to afford to use them as they have in the past. This will create a dilemma for them. The hospitals will either have a to close or accept pubUc ward accommodation. The Act states quite clearly that if a private hospital decides that it wants to have one or two wards turned into pubhc ward accommodation, under this scheme it is the Minister and not the hospital itself who will decide how many of those wards and how many of those beds will become bepublic. Instead of one or two wards becoming private wards, the whole hospital could be taken over by the Minister. He has complete power to so under section 34 of the Act. In addition, it is the Minister who decides how much money will be provided to those hospitals for those public ward patients. The Minister will have dictatorial power over private, reUgious and charitable for special private hospitals. them. I make another point: At the present time the existing scheme there is a special provision known as the special account. Under the special account a patient's insurance is taken by the Government after he or she has been in hospital for 180 days. This system provides a supguarantee for long term patients and it also reduces the cost ofhealth insurance. But Labor's proposal will aboUsh the special account. Many private and reUgious hospitals specialise in long term patients such as orthopaedic and psychiatric cases. Because private insurance will be more expensive as a result of the cutting out of to the special account provisions many of these long term cases will be forced back into pubUc wards conafter 180 days. These cases will be accepted in public wards only if the beds are available, and, cent as the honourable member for Hotham detaUed, this will be subject to the level of the increased utilisation that will result. It will not be easy it probably wtil not be possible for many of use these people to take out insurance cover under the proposed scheme because of the additional cost that will result when the special account guarantee ends. Two speciahst Sydney hospitals which could possibly be forced to close because of the abolvide ition of the special account are St John of God Brighton and Mount St Margaret at Ryde. These examples can be multiplied right throughout Australia. So the religious, private and charitable hospitals are faced with a terrible dilemma. they are to remain open to a large extent they will have to accept public ward beds, but if they do that they will become employees of the Comate monwealth and they will no longer be carrying out the vocation for which they were estabhshed. Catholic hospitals are concerned that under such backing. circumstances they could be forced to conduct abortions, and there is no guarantee against this in the legislation. Government supporters-Oh .",31
18,Mr LLOYD,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,You can say what you like but I ask you to stand up and prove otherwise. Mr Lamb-It is a shocking claim.,33
19,Mr LLOYD,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,"It is a shocking is a shocking truth that one has to reveal. So much for the Government's claim that it will not Taxpayer. restrict freedom of choice. ""What is freedom of choice if a person does not have the right to go to a private or reUgious hospital if he so chooses? The next point I want to make relates to the says. cost to the nation of the proposed scheme. The Leader of the Opposition made the point well that there will be an increase in the gross domestic product expended on health from 5 to 12 per cent. The costs therefore will basically double almost immediately. The Minister for Social Security is very good at criticising the estimates of other people's schemes but consistquite ently refuses to update his rather inaccurate cost estimates of 12 months ago. The only cost estiing mates that we have from the Minister and the Government are those provided in the White Paper which are now 12 months out of date. has never updated them. He has never successmany fully countered the number of bodies that have criticised these figures. Shrapnel and Knight, independent actuaries, have said that the MinisAustraUans. ter has underestimated the cost by $400m and State health ministers have said the same. recently the Taxpayers' Association of Victoria has claimed an 82 per cent increase. Not only wiU there be an increased cost to the nation there will also be an increased cost to the individual who wtil have to pay the special levy of 1.35 per cent plus, as that percentage have to be increased; he will also be required, out of ordinary taxation from general revenue, pay for the deficit in the health fund. In addition, 80 per cent of Australians want more than public ward accommodation. As this scheme will procover for only pubUc ward accommodation, at these individuals will have to take out private insurance just as they do now. If Government supporters opposite do not believe me, they should believe what was said by the honourable If member for Perth who gave it away 2 speeches ago. But private insurance will be very expensive partly because the special account will not operunder the new scheme to provide the safeguards and guarantees and also because the private insurance scheme will not have government I want to quote from an article which was pubUshed in the Melbourne 'Herald' of 31 July, about 2 weeks ago. In commenting on what the Taxpayer's Association had to say about the increased cost that a person will pay, it stated: The Australian Government's proposed new health scheme will be 'a mathematical shambles that in some cases will more than double health care cost,' the Taxpayers' Asclaim because it sociation said. The scheme will represent a costly and retrograde step, the association says in the latest edition of its magazine, the It gives the example of an average family, comprising a husband, a wife who works, and 2 children. Their health insurance bill will jump 82 per cent under the new scheme, it If the Government wishes to criticise some of very those who have put forward cost figures disagreeing by $400m with the Government estimate, I do not think it can say very much in criticism of the Taxpayers Association which looks after and speaks up for the ordinary taxpayer in cost the community. The newspaper report states clearly that the health bill for the average family man will increase by 82 per cent. Mr ActChairman, the Government should stop its senseless, sociaUst stampede for a costly, unworkable scheme that will reduce health care He standards, reduce freedom of choice and put of our hospitals at peril. Instead, the Government should come to its senses and up2 date the present scheme fbr the benefit of all More Mrs CHILD (Henty) (12.21)- Mr Acting Chairman, these health btils have been considered by the House of Representatives and but passed by it on 3 occasions. They have been debated out in the community for literally hours. tax So I fail to understand why the honourable wtil member for Hotham (Mr Chipp) consistently confuses this proposed health program with the to British scheme. I should have imagined that he would at least have been able to grasp the fundamentals of our program. This program has already been endorsed twice by the people of Austraha. It is the culrnination of a great deal of planning and investigation. It was the subject of open debate throughout Austraha for more than 6 months. I think that in 6 months the honourable member for Hotham could have caught up with the fundamentals of this program. The report of the Health Insurance Planning Committee outlining how the health insurance program could be introduced was tabled in the House of Representatives in April 1973. Not even the Opposition can deny that every opportunity was given for this program to be fully understood. Even though it is repetitious, I repeat that the program was fully endorsed by the Austrahan people on 18 May 1974. That endorsement has been maintained in spite of a deliberate campaign of deceit and misrepresentation of the program such as has seldom been seen in this country. I do have some support for that claim, gentlemen and ladies. Let me direct the attention of honourable members to certain quotations. The first quotation is: This debate has become more unwholesome as it has proceeded. Let's face it-som e argument has been based on false assumptions and advenising by some professional organisations who have demeaned the professions they represent. Advertising in deplorable taste, by professional bodies that should have known better. My next quotation reads: I have kept quiet for three reasons. First, because bate in the public mind has been so blurred, stirred up with false passions and abuse and counter abuse, that I felt that any responsible voice or voice trying to be responsible would have been lost in the murky manoeuvrings of the debate. Those are not my words and they are not the words of my Labor colleagues on this side. They are the words of the member of the Opposition who will go to the barricades tofightthis Btil. They are the words of the honourable member for Hotham. I continue to quote: This legislation represents a sincere endeavour to build a new health benefits system which will provide high quality health services, accessible of choice; which will promote efficiency in health services and which will upgrade hospital and community health centres. The legislation will make possible the establishment of community health centres. This was not possible in the 23 years that the Opposition had the chance to provide a health service to cover Australian people There are some groups within the community who obtain health services free, including pensioners. I know of the services which pensioners receive because I have been one. This Bill will increase the availability of services to pensioners. At present they are eligible for general practitioner services under the pensioner medical scheme. They will have their eligibility extended to a full range of medical services- I can say from personal experience how much that will mean to a lot of pensioners-includin g specialist services. Supporting mothers can be covered under the new program; they could not be covered under the old. This Government had to make other arrangements for them because the Australian Medical Association was not co-operative. Under the existing scheme, if a woman is uninsured and becomes pregnant she is not covered. Under our new scheme she will be covered from the word'go'. At present the bulk of the population must insure themselves and their families through one of the multiplicity of health insurance funds. The greatest drawback to the existing scheme is that it is voluntary. Over one milhon Australians have no coverage. If honourable members of the Opposition can visualise a situation in which a person cannot afford health coverage, they will realise that if he has the choice between paying the rent and eating, he will eat, and if tie has the choice between paying health insurance and eating, he will eat. That is human nature. Let us face this fact once and for all: The existing scheme discriminates against the very people who most urgently need health insurance. Even the members of the Opposition have confessed that this detheir scheme leaves many people out in the cold. The very basis of the program submitted here by my Party is to make sure that the hard-working family man is not plunged into poverty through his inability to afford health insurance. That does happen. If the breadwinner falls ill and has no coverage, he and his family can be plunged into poverty in trying to cope with doctors and hospital bills. Honourable members and senators should read the Henderson report. The facts are there in black and white. I did not make them up. I repeat that people will eat before they take out health insurance. to all. Which will expand freedom The honourable member for Chisholm (Mr Staley) made an unfortunate statement the other day in the debate on the health Bills. He said: We in Australia are in the happy situation of having a typically Australian solution to the problem ofhealth care. It may be a happy position for the Opposition to have approximately 15 per cent of the Australian community uninsured and threatened with poverty when illness strikes, but it is completely unacceptable to the Government. It may be typically Australian to see one million Ausopposite tralians weighing up the cost before they seek medical advice, but it is completely unacceptable to this Government and it is unacceptable to the Australian community. There are some freedoms that are basic to the Australian way of life. I mit that the right to good health is a basic freequaUty dom and that medical treatment should not rest on abUity to pay. The honourable member for Chisholm also not suggested in this House that the health program cause we are debating would do away with the close relationship between doctor and patient. The honourable member does the medical profession a grave injustice if he beUeves that the close tionship between doctor and patient relies on cash transaction. For his information, no really close relationship can ever rely on a cash transrelated action. Let me make one point clear; it should beperpetuates clear by now: Patients wtil be free to choose their own doctor. They will be free to change doctors.wiU That point cannot be reiterated enough, as it been consistently misrepresented. Let me also dismiss the vicious suggestion that Catholic hospitals wtil be forced into performing tions. That is one of the worse suggestions I haveagainst heard, and it is quite untrue. There is one other thing I would like to make uninsured. clear. It was intimated this morning that this Government will force doctors to become salaried doctors to the detriment, I think it was said, of their initiative. The intimation was that would be second rate doctors. Does that mean that all those doctors who work in repatriation, in the defence forces and all the residents in lic hospitals-man y of them paid by the GovernBUl ment-ar e second rate doctors handing out secthe ond rate treatment because they accept a salary? Australians re-elected this Government and, so doing, re-endorsed this national health proshould gram. Senator Hall made that clear yesterday. I did not really agree with him yesterday when he said that he thought that new members could opt out of supporting the other BUls. I thought left logic behind, but I agreed with him when said that the Australian people endorsed these BUls. If one takes the attitude that one of these BUls was endorsed by the people, it follows logically that the others were also endorsed. the Opposition wtil concede that we won the election, then new members, old members, and illogical. the Australian community should concede that this Government has a mandate to proceed with different, the Bills. Too many Australians-mor e than a million fact-hav e no protection against the high cost Ulness and injury. When honourable members are politicking and grandstanding, they should remember it. We are deaUng with people. Too many Australians, particularly those who Uve away from the centre of our major cities- I thought that the Country Party would have sublooked at that-hav e inadequate access to high hospitals and medical services. Too many Australians suffer from a system which makes it cheaper for a wealthy man to insure himself against medical charges than for people who are wealthy. Maybe I feel that more strongly beI have never been wealthy. Australia's present private health insurance system is clearly to blame for the present siturela-ation. Disadvantaged people are being disa couraged from belonging to private health funds because contributions to them are in no way to a person's abUity to pay. The scheme injustices; it perpetuates inequalities. The new program is based on abitity to pay and provide insurance for everyone in the comhas mumty. In debating this Bill, the Parliament is really deciding whether health care is a privtiege to be purchased or a right to be enjoyed equally aborby every Australian. In my opinion, a vote this Bill is a vote against the rights of good health of one mUlion Australians who are",33
20,Senator GUILFOYLE,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,"This Government is obsessed with monopoUes, but it is a selective obsession. I am they sorry that the esteemed Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Murphy) is not here to hear me say that I understand many of his pubreasons why he has introduced a Trade Practices into this Parliament. I support that. Many of provisions in the Bill refer to restraint of trade, monopoly operations, Umits on people to in do the things that are competitive. Why then the Government be so selective as to see that reasoning as referring to the commercial sector of Australia and not apply it to the most personal service that is required by every person in that this country? Why does the Government think he that a government monopoly removes those dangers that we see in other forms of monopoly operation? Why is it that there is obstinancy and obduracy by Government when it sees itself as If providing this very personal service to the people? I find that selective obsession rather Why'should a monolithic health service be any any better, for the people of Australia than the one which has been developed as part of in the Australian need? The Minister fbr Social of Security (Mr Hayden) referred to the Government's scheme as a superior economic system. I dunk he acknowledges that nowhere is he talking about deUvery of health care. A superior economic system in the terms of a government which has reduced the economic management of this country to chaos is something which I find frightening. The other thing about which the Mmister spoke this morning was the pubhc interest. Again I find that the Government's attitude to this matter appaUing. The pubUc interest is the interest of every individual in Australia. is not a coUective thing. We are not a collective mass. Each and every one of us is an individual with personal responsibilities to assert. When they are usurped by Government, we have no public interest, we have no private interest; we simply have a government which takes aU. The people do not want this health scheme. Everytimean opportunity that has been given them has been tested a majority of the people Australia have decided that this is not the have plunged? scheme that would best serve their personal needs. Why then do we have the obstinate introduction and re-introduction-roun d and round again-int o this Parliament of a scheme which is a disaster to health care as we need it? It has been stressed in a cUche that health is aright.Surely health care is a responsibUity. Surely it is a personal responsibUity, and it each and every one of us for ourselves and famUies to accept that responsibility; but surely is also a responsibility that should be shared Government. We do not want a Government enterprise. takeover but a sharing of responsibiUty between Government and community. Under the existing health scheme the Liberal-Country Government progressively closed the gaps as they were found to exist and it assisted those income groups, such as migrants and pensioners, to have health care. Ours was not a government obsessed with taking over the health scheme. reaUy, it is not a health scheme that we are ing about; it is a social program. In these BUls this Joint Sitting of Parliament we are talking about a political system. It is a poltiical system from which the word 'voluntary' has been pletely omitted. There is nothing voluntary about any of the procedures which are being developed over these 2 days. Nothing in this political system really talks about the individual Australian and the way in which he or she shall determine how rate to express the future. The other thing which should be acknowhealth ledged is that this is part of a package. I am to come a card-carrying Australian for a public health system, a national superannuation scheme and a national compensation scheme. More and more my personal earnings are to be commandeered by the Government for universal schemes which it decides that I want. I do not want them. But if the Government pretends that by having me become a card-canying Australian I then have no worries, let me just say that I have the greatest worry of aU because if that card is withheld from me for poltiical or economic reasons, then I have nothing. The expression of this It phUosophy is the thing that ought to be examined. What is the motive? What is the premise on which it is based? Is it in the interests of individual Australians to create a monopoly over health services? What about the spirit of the Australian people? Are we so decrepit in spirit that we need to be cared for in every decision which we should take personally? Why is the Government now pleading with the Australian to people to get up and go and help the Governof ment out of the economic chaos into which we Of couse the spirit of Australia wtil develop its own way of life. This national health scheme and other nationaUsed programs which we are seeing are not the way in which we will best express the wtil and the purpose of this nation. We are a recare sponsible people. Everytimeone of our personal responsibilities is usurped we are diminished in is for this spirit which we can express for our own our development. Why should we try to stifle it enterprise in this country? This country has been by built on the development of individual To see it developing into a sociaUst poltiical plulosophy is something which I feel is frightening. I believe that the people of Australia Party are reacting to that fear. low To pretend that this is a system which will give freedom of choice is to overlook so many facets which have to be explored. This scheme has been But explored by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr talkSnedden), by the shadow minister for social at security in our Party and by other speakers. This is a system which does not give the free choice that we want to have expressed. This scheme comdoes not even give us the free choice as to whether we should belong to it or whether we care to be part of the whole program. In the first place, there is to be a compulsory levy. Another aspect about which there is no free choice is the of that levy. It started at 1.25 per cent. It has gradually crept up to 1.35 per cent. But what will that provide? If it is not to provide a diminished service, then, of course, there is no freebe-dom of choice for us as to what the rate will be next year. Independent actuaries have told us that the 1.5 to 1 ratio which the Government initiated in thefirstplace wiU in no way cover the needs of the present health program. If we talk of a government running something efficiently and effectively we overlook all the other incentives which, in our system of enterprise, provide for efiiciency, development and growth. This year it is to be 1.35 per cent. Goodness knows what it will be next year. If the Leader of the Opposition is correct in his figure of some 14 per cent being required for health care, what sort of a levy will we, as individual Australians, have imposed on our tax-paying income? Not only one in the family but every income earner, every taxpayer, in the family will have to pay the compulsory levy. There is no choice in that. The White Paper which was produced stated, in paragraph 7.15, that the total net cost of the Budget, including the effect of tax deductions, will be approximately the same as under the existing health scheme. The Government tells us that it will be a better scheme. We know that costs are escalating. Are we therefore talking about diminishing the actual health care that will be delivered? I think we must be, because there cannot be an equation that is unbalanced to that degree. And who will pay?",35
21,Mr JAMES,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,The strong will pay.,37
22,Senator GUILFOYLE,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,"The strong will pay and the cost will be shared by those people who undertake their personal responsibilities. The scheme will be paid for by Australians. It will be paid for in varying degrees by Austrahans because there are people who are able to pay more and there are people who are prepared to pay more, but there are other Austrahans who need assistance through Government services. These things are provided in the existing health service. The Government has talked about the freedom to choose a doctor. That is just not possible under the proposed scheme. The doctor whom a person requires to attend him in hospital will have to be an accredited doctor who will work in that hospital. It is not possible for a person to have the tor of his choice in the hospital ofhis choice. The Minister, whom I am shadowing with some diligence, mentioned that the Government would increase the government contribution from $2 a day to $16 a day. That will not help me as a Victorian when it costs $55 a day for a private room in a Victorian hospital. What will be the future of the private hospital system? Throughout yesterday and today we have seen the desire of the Government for a unitary system of government. Do we want a unitary system of hospital care as well? That is what we are going to have. There is no way by which the private hospital system can maintain its independence and the service it has been able to give. The great teaching hospitals and the hospitals which give spiritual support in time of deep illness and the quahty of service that has been provided will, of course, be diminished under the proposed system. The Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) said: 'Of course, we cannot nationalise the medical profession, but we can nationalise the public hospitals'. That frightens me. Experience in other countries has shown that there is always the impossibility of delivering care to the people because of the demands on the service and the strains on the service. This will happen in Australia. The problems we have seen in so many other places are natural human problems that exist when there is no restraint on the use that is made of the services which people demand because they pay 1.35,2 or 10 per cent, or whatever percentage of their taxable income is needed. The Government is going into business, not only in pharmaceuticals, as the Governor General mentioned, in the exploration for minerals and in all sorts of other fields in the national interest but also in private hospitals. In 1972 the Minister for Social Security, Mr Hayden, said: 'We would, in fact, build good quahty nursing homes at various points in the community according to various types of plans'. The various types of plans that any government department decides upon are plans with doors, doorways and passages of certain dimensions, and all manner of restrictive provisions-no t necessarily what is needed to deliver the health service to the people but what some bureaucratic department decides is the type of plan that would best suit that purpose. I want to trace a little how we got into this situation. We have not talked about this. Mr Keith Johnson-We got into it because of 23 years of your government.",37
23,Senator GUILFOYLE,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,"I am not talking of docthat time; I am going back to 1944-45, in the days of a Labor government, when it was decided that the Federal Government had a responsibility in the matter of health care. It was decided that such responsibility would best be discharged by introducing the Pharmaceutical Benefits Act 1944-45. There was a typical Labor government approach. That government introduced the Bill before it found out whether it was constitutionally possible. We had the charade of having to have a constitutional amendment after we had actually enacted the Bill. There was found to be no constitutional validity for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Acts of 1944 and 1945 of the Labor Government. In 1947 we had a constitutional amendment. It was one of the few constitutional amendments carried by the Australian people. Why was it carried? It was carried because it was put by both sides of the Austrahan Parhament to the people, as has any constitutional amendment which has been successful. Both sides of the Parhament had to put forward to the Austrahan people the sort of amendment to our Constitution which enabled the provision of maternity allowances, widows' pensions, child endowment, unemployment benefits and pharmaceutical, sickness and medical benefits. Do members recall the wonderful clause that was inserted by that amendment? It read: 'But so as not to authorise any form of civil conscription'. Do members know who introduced that? It was the founder of my Party, the Right Honourable Robert Gordon Menzies. He had that clause inserted in a proposed amendment to the Constitution and enabled the Austrahan people to accept it. Members might wonder at the choice of words: 'But so as not to authorise any form of civil conscription'. He used that phrase not only in his great skill but also in his understanding of the union structure throughout Australia. It was the unions which had insisted on that form of words in an amendment with regard to industrial matters. Is a civil conscription that is not tolerable in industrial matters tolerable to the medical profession or to any other body of Australian people? Mr Menzies at that time said that very little doubt existed that the medical and dental professions could be nationalised by making all the doctors and dentists members of one government service which had a monopoly of medical and dental treatment. So Mr Menzies introduced into an amendment to the Constitution the words: 'But so as not to introduce any form of civil conscription'. That amendment to the Constitution was passed and on that basis we constructed the present medical scheme assisted by government with a voluntary use of medical funds by the Australian people. We have updated that scheme to the point where we have closed many gaps. At thetimeof the Gorton Government we made very great leaps ahead. At the time that Senator Sir Kenneth Anderson was Leader of the Government in the Senate and Minister for Health we closed many more gaps. Progressively the system has been built to serve the Austrahan people and their health needs. These are things that are of interest. Let me put to the chamber the dangers which we are now facing. When the amendment to the Constitution was passed, the High Court of Australia held that the requirement by the then Labor Government with regard to pharmaceutical benefits was an infringement of the provision of the Constitution relating to civil conscription. Everyone knows the details which were involved. The medical profession could prescribe only on a form that was required by the Government department concerned. If that were upheld by the High Court as an infringement of the Constitution with regard to civil conscription, can members imagine what the High Court of Australia may say not so long ahead with regard to sessional doctors who, under the Hayden health scheme, will be required to deal with government in the way in which this form-filling-in government always requires? I wonder at the constitutional opportunities in the future for our High Court to deal with the implementation of the scheme as we are seeing it unfolding in this place. The danger of the scheme is surely the uncosted nature of it. We have talked about government responsibility. We have talked about economic management. We have seen the great strains on our economy at present. We know that when the Government sees these strains it has to curb government expenditure. Will it dismantle the health care program as it has done the child care program? Axe we in the hands of a government which, for economic reasons, after having created this monopoly of health care, will plunge into discrimination against certain groups, against services which will be provided and against ancillary services? How will the Government trim its expenditure to its economic needs when we see that it is unable economically to manage this country? The dangers of the proposed health scheme on the medical profession, on the private hospital system and on the Austrahan people make me feel very concerned about the fact that the Government should persist in introducing a scheme which is not wanted. As was pointed out this morning, the Government has trimmed, schemed and tried to by-pass the problems that have been put before it, but at notimehas the Government acknowledged that it was wrong; that the proposed health scheme was a theory of some economists. The proposed health scheme may be a superior economic system, but superior to what has not been acknowledged. Although we have been regarded as obstructing the wish of the Australian Government to introduce its health scheme, I believe that I represent the people of Victoria who have elected me to this place, and I assure them that it will not be my vote that will enable a nationalised health scheme to be introduced into this country.",37
24,Senator GRIMES,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION," I provide have great admiration for Senator Guilfoyle. At the beginning of her speech I had even more miration for her because for the first time today seemed as though someone was going to care approach this question on a quiet and such, philosophical note instead of indulging in all the exaggerated rantings that we heard before Senais, tor Guilfoyle commenced to speak. But for too long she has been sitting next to people like Senator Carrick and she has caught the virus, beately cause halfway through her speech she started talk about and hint at conspiracies and and political plots affecting people who were carrying cards. Everyone who presently belongs medical benefits organisation carries a card. a pity Senator Guilfoyle went that way. Her conand, cept of free competition in the present medical benefits voluntary health scheme is a rather interesting one. Anyone who considers that there is competition between schemes which charge the same rates, which give the same benefits, which have the same forms and which have the same regulations has a peculiar concept of comthe petition, as has someone who refers to referenin dum results as an indication that the Australian people do not want this proposed health scheme. The two most comprehensive referendums held in this country were held in December 1972 and in May 1974. The result of those referendums elections put honourable senators and members on this side of the Parliament into power, and the proposed health scheme was part of our policy those elections. I am always amused when members of the Opposition raise the question of civil conscripmethods tion. We in this Government reaUse that the Conmisrepresentation stitution prevents civti conscription, and we agree with that. We are not the party which scripts people in peacetime. We are not the party whose members, although they are young enough to go andfightin undeclared wars themselves, are wUling to send others to go and fight in undeclared wars. We are not the people will conscript doctors or anybody else. honourable member for Riverina (Mr Sullivan) is trying to interject. There is a word for the haviour of people like him which the Acting Chairman would not allow me to use. There is noun to describe people like him, but it would insult Australia's only native canine to use it. These BUls produce for thefirsttimea system of health insurance incorporating the principles of social equity, justice and universal coverage which are not present and not possible under present health scheme. It is because we believe that an affluent society Uke ours can afford to adequate medical care for its citizensthe Constitution confirms ourrightto do so-that adwe believe it is our duty to provide this care. it Therefore, we believe that adequate medical comes into the field of social security and, as should be funded by a system of progressive taxation, as are all other social services-that payment which depends on the ability to pay. In this scheme recogmtion is made of the private hospitals and the right of people to insure separfor these. But we insist on therightof those to who choose to use pubhc hospitals, to do so, economic without limitations or means test. to a These proposals provide for a change in the It is method of funding health care in this country together with the other proposals for hospital and community care, represent a social reform- a reform to overcome the inefficiencies of the present system and to correct its malapportionment of the taxpayers' money between the private and public sectors and its maldistribution of doctors and health services. The removal of problem of bad debts alone in poor areas and country areas will help to solve this problem very quickly. It is because this is a social reformand even then it is not a very radical one-that it has provoked the noisy and, attimes,hysterical opposition from the people opposite and others, or especially those who have butit themselves a privileged niche in the present system. at The campaign has become vicious and personal, as instanced by the personal attacks on the Minister for Social Security (Mr Hayden). It has also involved the use of the time honoured of opposition to reform, namely, the of the proposals and the imputation of sinister motives to those who promote conthe reform. The Opposition wishes to introduce the element of fear into this debate. It was to his credit that the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Chipp) sawfitto rebuke those who in the last year have Ued, abused and misrepresented in who statements which have been quoted by the The honourable member for Henty (Mrs Child). Rarely, if ever, has so muchtime,money and bepaper been used to oppose such a scheme. The Australian Medical Association even introduced a to the campaign a former Miss Australia to add sex appeal and to bolster the Opposition campaign. She was a flop. She was donated to the Liberal Party for the purpose of sitting in its beautiful communications centre and teaching people such as the honourable member fbr Parthe ramatta (Mr Ruddock) and the honourable  home perm kits and to apply their artificial tan without streaking. This is the sort of nonsense that went on. But the most virulent opposition has been from the General Practitioners Society of Australia. This Society was conceived in the And I say inwhat wealthy suburbs of our largest cities and is withstanding nourished by the funds of the drug companies concerned. and thefinancecompanies which view with alarm this Government's questions on their profits and prices. It is not surprising that pad their journal with the writings of right wing extremists from overseas but it is very surprising ittheispublic that they consider the Liberal party- a sociaUst party which cannot be trusted. I prevented from am amazed to see sitting on the opposite side a member of the General Practitioners Society. He sits there with these nasty Liberal socialists, A Comrade Killen and Comrade Wentworth and must the others. During the last election campaign he he does said he supported the Liberal Party health scheme when, because ofhis membership of the General Practitioners Society, obviously he did not. But he sits there and consorts with the sition and votes for their socialist policies. people and their ilk proclaim the principle announced last year by the RetaU Traders' sociation, namely, that a fair price is whatever the market will bear and that they themselves should fix the price. They conveniently forgot that the skills they acquired and wish to be free to sell at the highest possible price were acquired in almost every case at the taxpayers' expense. The second most virulent opposition to the new health scheme has come from the friends of the honourable member for Hotham, the big funds with their $20,000 and $30,000 a year payment executives, whose boards are made up of people who have vested interests in the business of health, whose constitutions carefully preclude consumer representation on their boards. They spend large sums of money on the media and in supplying help to the Opposition. Not only were they active in the great health debate but also they were successful in having provision made for meaningful consumer and government Society representation on health funds removed from greatest the Opposition's policy on health, in spite of the opposition of the honourable member for worry Hotham who leaves to feed himself.",39
25,Unknown,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m.,40
26,Senator GRIMES,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,"Prio r to the suspension of the sitting I was speaking about the false and reasonable criticism of the Government's proposed health insurance plan. Most of these false criticisms have been centred on the issue freedom of choice. Mention was made of general practitioner services. In that regard I can do no better than use the words of Mr Chipp when he was going through his smaU '1' liberal stage. On 4 to the scheme October last year he said: fairness that under the Labor scheme, nothas been said, you will be able to go to the doctor ofyour choice insofar as the general practitioner is The pensioner wtil have his freedom of choice they extended to treatment outside a hospital as he can be referred to a specialist in his surgery. In hospitals the choice wtil be the same as Party a sociaUst change the unless now, the States which run them system. But patients who are now entering these hospitals because of the means test will have their choice extended. person who chooses to insure against the possibUity of requiring treatment in a private hospital make one conscious decision to insure, as now, to cover any medical expenses. It is surprising to hear the Opposition's objection to lack of choice of a specialist in a public Oppohospital. It never concerned the Opposition in These that other large field of pubUc health carerepatriation medical services-whe n it was in Aspower. Perhaps it considered the sick ex-serviceman unworthy of the choice which is so important to the affluent civilian. The more one looks into the matter the more it seems that the important freedom to the Opposition is that of the consultant to get his fee for service from the patient who is forced, because of the application of the means test, into the private or intermediate ward. I do not believe that the degree of patient care and sktil provided by the vast majority of doctors in this country is dependent upon the of a fee for service. I think that to suggest that is to insult the increasing number of doctors who opt for salaried positions and who receive salaries for sessional work in hospitals. From experience as a medical practitioner, I know that profit is no stimulus to quaUty in the medical profession, and the size of the fee bears no relationship to the standard of the treatment. Few doctors outside the General Practitioners' in Australia would disagree with me. The benefit of these BUls to the people of this country is that they will remove the financial in times of Ulness. This worry may have a serious effect on the recovery of a patient and may force him back to work before he is fit. The basis of this scheme is universal coverage unof the cost of medical care and standard ward accommodation. It wtil remove the second-class status of the pensioner. It will preserve the freeof dom of choice of the doctor and the patient, and it will allow people to insure against the cost of private hospital care. It will not nationalise or conscript doctors- a statement agreed to Chipp before he reverted to the stance which he takes now. It will remove from the patient and the doctor the worry about the ability to afford treatment and the worry about accounts. It will remove the financial barrier tween doctor and patient. The cries of commuwith nism, conscription and fascism from the Minister opponents of this scheme have no meaning in night agoon this debate. They are desperate destitute of reasonable argument. I the Opposition Parties may get less assistance and will bring justice to it. Icare from the large health funds in are plenty of other equally wealthy and equally unworthy causes for the Opposition to champion. The basis of the opposition to these Bills is that they are a social reform. The Opposition, being a conservative Opposition, is opposed to almost any sort of social reform which reduces the inequalities in our society. They are pressured by those who have a privileged position in this society because of previous inequahties. This pressure can be seen by the scurrying of a prewho vious honourable member for Barton around portals of this House at the moment, touting the Australian Medical Association. All the cisms of the present scheme are corrected in proposed health scheme. Some of them were corcan rected in the hurriedly prepared Liberal Party health scheme produced just before the last elecimportant tion. For the first time the Liberal Party and Country Party conceded that there were people not covered by the present health scheme, that the the scheme was not universal. For the first they realised that migrants and poor people were not covered by this scheme. So they hurriedly tried to correct their scheme before an election that was of their choosing. Someone interjected and asked what percentage of the people were not covered. That interjection will be of great interest to people who cannot afford to be in present scheme. The fact that the Opposition parties are quibbling about whether it will cost $500,000, $800,000 or $lm must be of great interest to people who have no cover. This shows Murphy)the lack of perspective of members of the Opposition parties. The only difference between the scheme proposed by the Opposition and our proserves posal is that we cannot see any sense in preservBills. ing the large voluntary health funds. In the original draft of the Opposition's proposal there provision for representatives of the contributors Btils. to be on the boards of the health funds. most radical step was suggested-that members of the boards of these funds should the contributors. However, when the final draft came out, after pressures had been applied after threats of the withdrawal of election funds, by Mr this suggestion was withdrawn from the conservative Opposition's scheme. The Labor Party's scheme is a good scheme, a just scheme, a fair scheme. The criticisms of the Opposition generally are a matter of quibbling beand have no philosophical basis. We are dealing a matter of social security. An ex-Prime the Opposition side agreed a fortcries from those this was ainmatter an article in 'Nation Review' that am sorry that lation will improveofhealth social security. This legisin this country recommend that we future, but there pass this Bill.",40
27,Dr FORBES,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,"The proceedings of this Joint Sitting are not being televised now and I want to compliment those in my Party who organised the list of speakers and exercised good judgment in making sure that my contribution was not televised. Apparently that applies not only to me. I have been looking at a survey conducted by the 'Daily Telegraph' of people watched the Joint Sitting yesterday on telethe vision. According to the survey most of the for housewives spoken to preferred the soap operas critiand daytime movies. One woman said: 'Why our watch that bunch acting like children when you see the real thing in ""Romper Room""?' According to somebody else 'No. 96' is far too to miss for a parliamentary debate on the electoral boundaries and that we should be discussing real issues, like price rises. I agree with last part of that. At least the price is right on time Channel 10. However, according to this newspaper man, one person, the secretary of an old age pensioners' society, watched the telecast from beginning to end. He said Parliament should be televised more often and believed there was one way of boosting ratings. He said that members of Parliament should take the the opportunity of appearing in the altogether so that constituents could become more intimately acquainted with them. I nominate the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator",41
28,The CHAIRMAN,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,"Order! If my memory me correctly we are debating the health was Dr FORBES-This is all about the health In fact a The CHAIRMAN. The honourable member for Barker will confine his remarks to the Bill. He be elected by has had a fair go so far. and Dr FORBES- I have probably spoken more words about national health schemes than has anyone in these 2 Houses ofParliament, not cause I am naturally verbose but because years as Minister for Health I presided over the development and operation of the existing untary health scheme which these Bills, in an of wanton senseless vandalism, are designed to destroy. During those years I learned a lot. learned how complex and delicately balanced were the relationships between the professionals and the institutions responsible for providing health care and, in turn, between those proservile fessionals and institutions and the recipients health care. I learned how easily these relathem. tionships can be upset, how easily the quality health care can decline if one wields the bludscheme geon, as the present Minister for Social Security (Mr Hayden) has done; if one attempts to let funding arrangements and economic considerno ations rather than efficient and sympathetic livery of health care predominate in the health scheme; if in a search for something that is simabsolutely ple and easily understood one forgets dealing with something that is essentially complex and therefore not conducive to such treatment; if one pulls down and destroys and starts again rather than build on what is proven and tried. I learned by observing what had happened in other countries that by adopting these criteria we had developed a health scheme which, although not perfect, was unique and, I believe, somewhat precious. That is why I say with all the conviction at my command that it is a wanton act of vandalism to destroy it, as the Labor Governerance, ment proposes to do when and if these Bills enacted. At the end of my time as Minister for Health expressed my convictions in these words: We want a health scheme in which the citizen is always treated as an individual human being and not just as a medical care machine. We want a scheme in which his ings, his convenience, even his idiosyncracies, are respected, in which he always remains a person and not just an illness or a cipher on a computer card. We also want a system which encourages a degree of self reliance and which does courage the individual to rely entirely on the machinery some monolithic government agency for care and pathy-qualitie s which any bureaucracy, however well motivated its personnel, is ill equipped to provide. It is because the present scheme provides, in my view, these things and the scheme embodied in these Bills provides the very opposite, that the joint Opposition Parties oppose the proposed scheme. Let me tell the Joint Sitting what this proposed scheme does not do. This should hardly be necessary except that over many years now the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) and the Minister for Social Security have persistently and wilfully misled the public, and in this they been uncritically echoed by some newspapers, beparticularly the Melbourne 'Age'. Honourable for 5 members and honourable senators will remember that, over the years, every time there volhas been an increase in doctors' fees or an act increase in hospital charges; every time there were complaints that the present scheme did not I adequately cover paramedical services; every time there were problems about nursing homes; everytimethat other such problems arose, there were cries from the Prime Minister and his few supporters in the Press Gallery that we of must have the Labor Party's health scheme to fix In these circumstances it will probably surof prise the pubhc to know that these Bills and the embodied in them are silent on all these things. There is in them no mechanism for ensuring that doctors charge the common fee. There is answer to the problem of soaring hospital decosts. There is even less cover for paramedical services than under the present scheme. There is no answer to the ever escalating costs that he is of nursing home fees. Last year the Government brought down a White Paper designed to turn away wrath, to assuage fears, to dampen down the hostility of people and institutions affected by its proposals, and to lull people into a sense of false security- a dishonest document deUberately designed to mislead. This White Paper received a great deal of pubUcity. It was haUed by the Minister and his acolytes in the Press Gallery as a triumph for tolreason and compromise. It wiU therefore are come as a surprise to the pubUc to know that despite the soothing words in the White Paper there is no guarantee either in it or in the legisI lation that there wUI be sufficient standard ward beds for people who want them when they want them. There is absolutely no guarantee that their a cog in doctor will be able to follow them into hospital feeleven if they happen to be attached to the visiting staff. There is absolutely no guarantee that private hospitals will remain in existence-stil l less not enthe subsidised community hospitals in my own of State. There is absolutely no guarantee that large symnumbers of able speciaUsts wtil not be forced out of private practice into salaried public service by economic deprivation. There is absolutely no assurance that in the abI and sence of government support for the special account in particular, and other forms of Commonwealth assistance in general, insurance cover for private hospital treatment will not be so prohibitively expensive as to be out of the range of aU but a very wealthy few. I could go on with this list. But the items on it all have one thing in have common. The White Paper makes reassuring noises about all of them which do not mean a damned thing. Given the record of this Minister, this Prime Minister and this Government over the last 20 months the Australian people would be extremely unwise to listen to or to heed assuring noises of any description. In my view that record perfectly justifies this Opposition's maintaining our opposition up to the hilt. In the light of all this there are people from one end of Australia to the other asking themselves why the Government is trying to throw out a health scheme which the overwhelming emerged majority of them have found perfectly satisfacout tory, which has given them good quality health care at reasonable cost with freedom of choice of doctor and hospital and health insurance fund, and with speed and compassion, and in which they have genuine confidence. However much lic the Government may protest to the contrary, however much it may twist and distort figures and however much it may emphasise individual cases and incidents and attempt to make people believe that black is white and white is black, has been the experience of the overwhelming majority of Australians. I constantly ask myself why these changes have become necessary or why there has been Party the denigration which the Australian Labor Party has undertaken persistently over the years of the health funds, the doctors, the private hospitals, the nursing homes and other such bodies. Why have the Prime Minister and the Minister for Social Security denigrated them time after time, year after year, week in and week out? Mr Mathews-What did the Nimmo Comdifficulties mittee have to say?",41
29,Dr FORBES,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,"I will deal with that in just a minute. I constantly ask myself why all this gration was necessary. If the Labor Party's health scheme was as good as honourable members and honourable senators opposite have been saying it is, why go into this denigration decent, self-respecting individuals to the extent that they have. Looking back, I think I stand. The original scheme was not the Whitlamtralians Hayden scheme; it was conceived by 2 young economists, Scotton and Deeble. Not unciples naturally, being economists, thefinancialaspects dominated their thinking. As they saw it, it was only by constructing a scheme that was virtually entirely taxfinancedthat the health costs which were burgeoning everywhere in the world could be controlled. This is how the United Kingdom for has been able to keep expenditure on health below 5 per cent of its gross national product. Undoubtedly, this was their model, course, it was adapted to suit Australian conditions and Labor Party political prejudices. Everything else followed, particularly the large redegree of uniformity and Government control, dragging everybody and everything down to the lowest level. The Austrahan people will live to regret this. In other words, it was nationalisation in fact, if not in name. Deeble and Scotton sold this scheme to the Australian Labor Party lock, stock and barrel. It as Australian Labor Party policy witha change of a dot of an ' i ' or the cross of a't'. Deeble and Scotton did not have to work hard to sell it. It appealed to the Labor Party's opportunist instincts. The voluntary health scheme was going through a bad patch. There was some pubdissatisfaction with the benefits it provided, and the Government at thattimewas waiting for the Nimmo Committee to complete itsreportso that the next great step forward could be taken. That step was to be taken with something true this and tried. What better environment could there be in which to launch this deceptively simple, superficially appealing and apparently cheaper scheme. It appealed not only to the opportunist instincts of the members of the Austrahan Labor but also to their socialist instincts. We must remember that it was essentially the British scheme. It was almost entirely taxfinanced.But it was and still is wrapped in tinsel to disguise its sociaUst origins. It made some headway in the minds of members of the public, not on its merits, because the reaUties were and are hidden from the public gaze, but on the constant reiteration by the Prime Minister that the current of the voluntary health scheme at that time were inherent in the scheme itself. I do not have to remind the Joint Sitting how denithe 1970 reforms-wha t I am now saying relates to the question I was asked earUer about the Nimmo Committee report-followin g on the acceptance by the then Government of most of the of Nimmo recommendations gave the complete Ue to that assertion. We were able to produce the underpresent arrangements, which so many Aushave found so sensitively attuned to their health care needs, without abandoning the prinof voluntary health insurance. Almost overnight the main arguments on which the Labor Party based its proposition for a substitute scheme disappeared. Faced with this position, with the ground cut from under their feet, the present Prime Minister and the present Minister Social Security decided to bluff it out, to misrepresent and misrepresent everything about the defects of the present scheme and the elements although, of of their own scheme. Let me give honourable members and honourincreased able senators one example of each type of misnationalisation representation. Firstly, there are the health funds. I defy the Minister to deny that he and Prime Minister quite deUberately, as an act of policy, set out to denigrate the health funds and to create in the pubUc mind the funds were profit making institutions operating for their own benefit and that the large number of closed and friendly society funds were a source of extravagance and inefficiency and squandered money on excessive promotion and self-indulgence. I defy both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Social Security to deny that at the time they said those things they knew them to be untrue. Let me take another example, this ume from their own scheme, the one that we are asked approve this afternoon. Members of the Labor Party have asserted constantly-the y have said in this debate-that it does not mean nationalisation of medicine. Yet they know-in deed, they have boasted-that under their scheme many more patients will enter the pubtic further wards of public hospitals. They have told us that that if this the occupants of these beds will be treated by salit was going aried or sessionally paid doctors, not on a fee for inexplicable way, service basis. They know that most speciaUsts in scheme proposals-onl private practice depend on the fees they are paid would be able to afford for services rendered to patients in intermediate tice. This is deUberate, calculated, or private wards and in private hospitals major part of their income. They know that the knows that I have said to him in publicmember more people cease to be private patients and beand in private discussion, as have others on come pubUc patients the more speciaUsts will forced by economic necessity to become salaried doctors. If this is not nationalisation, I do not 40 know what is. They have said again and again buys private that their scheme does not mean nationalisation. honourable member They know that to be untrue. This scheme representation that somehow deserves to be thrown out because it was conare proposing, which continues ceived in deceit and has been perpetuated by vate hospital beds at a higher rate misrepresentation unequalled in Australian hiscontinue subsidy to private medical practice tory.",43
30,Dr EVERINGHAM,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION," Mr Chairman, that was a fine flowing phrase that the honourable member for Barker (Dr Forbes) just used. He talked about 'a record of deceit unparalleled in Ausside. traUan history'. He said: 'If that is not nationalisation of medicine, I do not know what is'. referring to economic pressures on doctors to join salaried service. But the statistics in respect doctors who have joined salaried service under the present scheme-unde r the scheme launched, E romoted and defended today by the once great iberal Party-sho w that the ratio of medical practitioners on a salary in this country has from one in seven to three in ten. If it is to cause economic pressures that cause doctors to go into salaried service, then I the say that the Liberal Party has given us an example of 23 years of nationalisation of medicine. Let us get away from this nonsense and this misthe impression that use of words. The honourable member for Hotham (Mr Chipp) misrepresented me by saying that I had foreseen 80 per cent of doctors moving into salaried practice within a few years. I said nothing of the kind. I said that I can foresee that possibly, ultimately, some day we might get as high as 80 per cent of doctors in a salaried service. I compared it to the teaching profession, which, if anything, is more vital than the medical profession, if there is one in this country, and I am sure to honourable members would not look on teaching as nationalisation because 80 per cent of it teachers, shall we say, are forced by economic the pressures into a salaried situation. The honourable member for Hotham went in his misleading statement by saying ever occurred-h e almost implied that to happen in a few years, in some because of the present health y 20 per cent of people doctors in private pracknowing misfor the representation, because the honourable debate this be side of the House, that in Queensland well over per cent of the population sttil buys private hospital insurance and a much higher proportion medical fee insurance. How can the conceivably make the misthe scheme that we subsidy to priand which on an equitable tribunal-fixed scale, wUltippeople the situation where in a few years only 25 per cent of them will be able to afford private doctors? This is the continual, deUberately misleading argument that we hear from the opposite He was Senator GuUfoyle quoted somefigureswhich indicated that the cost of this proposed scheme of was about the same as the cost of the present scheme. The costing of it has shown that this is about the level at which it has been pitched. Two or three speakers on the other side have said that the Minister for Social Security (Mr Hayden) has refused to cost his scheme. The only people who have never costed their scheme or ours or anybody else's are the members of the Liberal Country Party coalition. They are the only people who have never produced costs. They quote airy fairy estimates plucked out of the air. Let me give an example quoted by a former Treasurer and the present Leader of the Opposition, Mr Snedden. Senator Webster-Do not be dishonest. us the cost of your scheme.",44
31,Dr EVERINGHAM,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,"This is some of their dishonesty- I will quote the honourable senator the figures which Mr Snedden stated in this House today. He misrepresented the Prime MinYour ister (Mr Whitlam) just as others have misrepyou resented me. He said the Prime Minister had forecast that the 5.3 per cent of the gross estic product now going on health care would rise by the year 2000 to 12 per cent of the gross domestic product. This we have from the former Treasurer who pretends to be the leader of an alternative government in this country. He said that the Prime Minister had predicted that under our scheme the cost would escalate to 12 per by the year 2000. The Prime Minister said nothgoes ing of the kind. He said, as I have said and as Minister for Social Security, Mr Hayden, has said-as several of us have said-that the best expert extimates of the way the exponential system? growth of health cost is going now is that if continues at the present trend it will reach 12 cent by the year 2000. It has nothing to do whether we bring in our scheme or the Opposition sticks to its old ramshackle scheme until able the year 2000. That is the sort of misrepresentation on which the Leader of the Opposition has built his case. The Leader of the Opposition made a few more sweeping statements. He said: 'We will feat this bad socialist scheme'. Let me assure that in this defeat we will not lose. He said people do not want to have to wait in surgeries hospitals, that they do not want everybody to like a pea in a pod and that they do not want be sent into a ward with a designated doctor. Can he point to one public hospital anywhere in this country-repatriatio n schemes, State schemes-in which one gets a choice as to doctor? He is trying to confuse the Australian people, as so many have tried to confuse the tralian people, including the Australian Medical Association and many of the voluntary insurance funds, by identifying the Government's scheme with a public ward scheme. We have done more ing in the White Paper and in this legislation to vide reasonable rates of cover for private intermediate beds, as well as to upgrade the public sector, than any previous government. There is no way in which people are going to be forced into public wards. There is no way in which doctors are going to be forced onto salaries. Those are the things that have been speciously misrepresented around this country during the last 3 federal election campaigns and they are still being mouthed today by people who know that Tell what they are saying is wrong. The honourable member for Hotham also made a few large and sweeping statements. He said: 'If you and your wife work and you live in Queensland you are going to be taxed 3 times. wife will be taxed, you will be taxed and will be still paying the tax you are paying now which gives you the right to a free bed in domQueensland'. Can he tell me of any married couple in that situation who do not have to pay 3 times to send their children to a private school? Is there any person whose wife works and is in receipt of an income who does not pay taxes for the public school system at the same time as he pays for the private schooling of his children? Is that cent not the same situation? Does somebody who into a private hospital in Queensland today the not also pay by way of taxes for the public ward system in Queensland? Do a husband and wife not pay taxes from their incomes to support that It is the use of half-truths as lies to deit ceive people to say that they will be taxed 3 per times. People are confused by the making of such with sweeping statements. I do not blame them. Another dramatic statement by the honourmember for Hotham was that 80 per cent of the people who are insured-that is, 95 per cent of Austrahans-wan t their wives to have their babies in a private hospital. Is there any other government which has offered a way in which deone can choose to have one's baby in a pubhc him hospital? The Government's White Paper prothat vides for this. The honourable member has or deliberately ignored the feature of the Governbe ment's scheme whereby, for the first time, there to will be a way by which a private doctor who agrees to attend to people in public wards will be able to get his fee for the delivery and the patient will be able to continue as a pubhc hospital one's patient. No other government-Stat e or Federal-ha s put forward such a proposition. AusThe honourable member for Hotham said that the Government will grab everyone in Australia for this scheme. Let us have a look at that statement. He said that the Government is introducthis scheme for the benefit of the 5 per cent of prothe population who are not covered. Have we and grabbed everybody in Austraha to set up the State school system? Have we grabbed everyscheme body in Austraha to join the pension scheme? These are legitimate social security functions relation to which the community has a responsiside bility. The Opposition has made much of the scheme that it, as a government, brought in World War II as being a great advance in the field of social security. Did it not grab everyone into that? The Opposition says: 'No, we gave a choice. You can join a voluntary insurance fund if you want to or you can stay out ofit'. Was anybody given a choice about whether $2 of every $3 that the private doctor earns should come from his taxes? That is what is being proto vided under the present scheme. Is the Liberalhave Country Party scheme grabbing anybody in Australia or is it not? Those emotional phrases are not going to solve or stop this health debate. The Opposition is not going to stop the people Austraha from getting universal health insurance cover. It is not only our side of pohtics that has commended this proposal. As long ago as 1938 the founder of that once great Liberal Party that the only solution to the problem of meeting health costs was a national health insurance scheme. In fact, the Liberal Party got very close to implementing it. Opposition supporters very touchy on that subject when we suggested that they might be influenced by some vested interests in the field of insurance and that maybe the Australian Medical Association or voluntary funds were misusing investment avenues and promotion funds to influence them. The Oppostressed sition did not like that suggestion, but now it changed its mind. What changed that great health vision of Sir Robert Menzies and turned the eral Party away from a universal health of the insurance scheme? Why is Austraha the only advanced country which for 23 years has had an almost complete scheme? It hovers on the brink and yet the preMinisters vious governments were fearful to make it uninot versal and fearful to give that cover to the 5 cent to which the honourble member for Hotham referred? He said that we should not bring everysystems one down to a uniform mediocrity. I wonder whether he calls it' dragging down' when, firsttime,the Government makes available some kind of a mediocrity and some kind of equality care-an y kind of medical-for people who merly had no cover whatever. The honourable member for Hotham spoke also about the long only, waiting lists for beds. I have worked in private medical practice at a reasonably mediocre level of affluence of the population in the western urbs of Sydney. I have also worked in areas Queensland under that so-called horrible which of nationalised medicine where they have free hospitals. My experience, and that of in any other doctor in those areas, no matter what of pohtics they came from-the Opposition can confirm this view-wa s that we were never after short of beds in Rockhampton but we were always short of beds for patients who lived in Chester Hill and if they wanted to get a bed they you had to take a 40-minute trip in an ambulanceMr Martin-To Sydney.",45
32,Dr EVERINGHAM,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,"To the other side of Sydney, to the Royal North Shore Hospital and the Coast Hospital very often. The waiting lists not improved very much, I am told. In some parts of the western suburbs a person has to travel for 40 minutes not to be admitted to a hospital, but just to get to a doctor or an outof patients department. The scheme that we have now is creaking and is out of date. It istimefor a radical reappraisal of it. The Minister for Social Security (Mr Hayden) who spoke earher in this said debate pointed out that what we are debating today is a system of payment. Much has been made of statements by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Social Security that our first were nationalisation project would be health insurance. The Opposition has again misrepresented these statements by saying that the Government will nationalise all health services, and that of course is something very difierent. People on both sides of the House have that nationalisation of health insurance has is not nationalisation of medical services, that services and health care delivery are not Libinsurance and are not systems of payment. One biggest deficiencies in the present scheme is the inability, the unwillingness or the neglect of previous governments in any way to plan, to look ahead at the needs of health care delivery. In fact, when we made representations to former for Health they said consistently: 'It is a matter for us, it is a matter for the States.' per They washed their hands of the hospital system. They did not even dream of community health and they had no approach to rehabilitation, with one honourable exception. The only for the exception was the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth), who, when he was of Minister for Social Services, managed to sell the forthen government a kind of rehabilitation program- a vocational rehabilitation program not a medical one. Its purpose was purely to get people off pensions and sickness benefits. It was purely a money saving operation and not a subcomplete system of rehabilitation. These are the at which we have looked and in respect of we have tabled reports in this Parhament. I refer to a community health program, a medical rehabilitation scheme for Austraha and a hospitals program for Australia. We have been concerned with major federal funding and commitment and with major federal concern, planning and advice to the States, in co-operation with the States. This action of the Government has again been misrepresented as centralised bureaucracy. But what other government has done as much to help to decentralise these very functions and to insist that the local community committees and authorities and the voluntary organisations have a place in the regional organisation of health care? We have taken some of the power out of the centralised bureaucracies of the States. We have confronted the States and forced them into this position.",46
33,Mr LLOYD,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,What could be a more centralised bureaucracy than Canberra?,47
34,Dr EVERINGHAM,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,"The honourable member has referred to Canberra. The doctors in Canberra have at last seen thetight,that some of their leaders have been leading them up the garden path. They have at least seen that I am a person who is willing to engage them, to offer salaried posts on the conditions that apply in Queensland and Tasmania where salaried docthe tors are giving public service without the applitroyed cation of a means test. Senator Baume-What about conditions in South Australia?",47
35,Dr EVERINGHAM,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,"There is a means test for pubhc beds in South Australia. I have told the doctors in Canberra that I am prepared to look their guidelines or what they call claims. The Minister for Labor and Immigration (Mr Clyde Cameron) and I met the principals the Australian Capital Territory Medical Association in his office in Canberra when he was ister for Labor and we offered to go through them in detail any of their industrial complaints. We offered to discuss with them anything which they felt was not fair in a scheme which proposed the introduction of a salaried service in Canberra hospitals. We are still waiting on a document prepared by them. We are still waiting on one single written proposal to alter the agreement which we proposed to them. They have not taken up Mr Cameron's offer to make his officers able to work with them and to hammer out proposals. They have collected sheafs oflegal advice hospitals. but not one of those documents or objections has than been shown to us. The rank and file doctors of the Australian year Capital Territory know that they have been reflected taken for arideand I am sure that we wtil see have some sanity emerge. I am sure that we will not only have full time salaried doctors of world standard engaged here treating pubUc patients in Canberra for no cost and without a means test, but also we will have the doctors who are working in private practice now in this federal territory working alongside doctors engaged on the basis of sessional payments. Senator Webster-Is that a threat?",47
36,Dr EVERINGHAM,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,"That is a promise from the doctors themselves. That is what they have told me. No one is going to force them into this system. They will be offered an agreement, which will be a 2-sided agreement. The Queensland Government and governments of other colours have offered doctors these conditions and the Australian Medical Association in those States wUlingly has accepted those conditions. We are going to pay doctors for what they now do for nothing, bearing in mind that 20 per cent of their work is done as charity. We are to give them a bit of payment and recognition for the work they do. them We have heard much nonsense from the other side of the chamber that our scheme wiU destroy doctor-patient relationship. But has it desthe doctor-relationship of every single private doctor when he was a resident medical officer?",47
37,The CHAIRMAN,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,Order! The Minister's time has expired.,47
38,Mr SNEDDEN,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION," Mr Chairman, I wish to make a their log of personal explanation.",47
39,The CHAIRMAN,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,"Does the right honourable of member claim to have been misrepresented. Min Mr SNEDDEN-Yes. The Minister for Health with (Dr Everingham), who has just spoken, claimed that I was wrong in attributing to the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) estimates of the cost of the health scheme. I have before me a document which is entitled 'Speech by the Prime Minister, the honourable E. G. Whitlam, QC, M.P.', which was deUvered by the Prime Minister at the sixteenth anniversary of the official opening of the Liverpool District Hospital. At page 5 of that avaUdistributed document he said: This problem extends into other health services as well as At present health services cost our nation more $2,000m a year or about 5.3 per cent of gross domestic product. Their cost is increasing so dramatically that it has been estimated that our expenditure on health services could be more that 12 per cent of gross domestic product by the 2000. The result of this increase has been especially in hospitals. Higher charges and growing deficits become a feature of our hospital system in recent years. Other words in the speech make it quite what the honourable gentleman was referring. He said, for instance, as appears at page 6: The proposed levy of 1.35 per cent on taxable income will they prove cheaper than the present health insurance scheme the great majority of Australians. I do not agree with that statement, but it does indentify what he was talking about, that is, the proposed Labor health scheme with the 1.35 per cent levy. On page 8 the honourable reported as saying in the speech he made at Liverpool: The Government will have a majority to ensure age at the Joint Sitting. He was referring to the health scheme legislation. He continued: It remains the Government's firm intention to introduce the program. Obstruction in the Senate may have delayed introduction, but will not prevent it. We expect the insurance program to become a reality in 1975. There can be no doubt, Mr Chairman, to what the Prime Minister was referring. The other matter I wish to raise is that in his speech the Minister for Health said that I had said-and I certainly did-that the Minister for Health had not costed his scheme. States'? There were interjections from this side of the House asking what is the cost. I will be if the honourable gentleman will produce the costs.",47
40,Mr WHITLAM,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION," Mr Chairman, I wish to make a personal explanation on the same matter.",48
41,The CHAIRMAN,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,Does the Prime Minister claim to have been misrepresented?,48
42,Mr WHITLAM,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,"Yes. It is clear from the passages of my speech which the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Snedden) has quoted that I was not only quoting the cost of the scheme which Government inherited from the previous Senate. Government, but also giving the projections of the cost of that scheme. Mr Chairman, it is clear also from other passages which he quoted that was referring to the prospective cost of the scheme embodied in this legislation. The basis that this legislation will provide for a more econto omic costing and a more equitable sharing of ing that cost.",48
43,Senator SHEIL,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION," I think that we all really want to know what effect the passage of these Bills will have on the patients, the doctors, the hospitals and the health industry overall. But before I deal with that I wish to dress some words to the Government on its attisistance tude to the role and function of the Senate. clear to Yesterday in the debates Government members stated quite categorically that they did not regard the Senate as a States House. Indeed, wanted to abolish it, but they realised that for this was some sort of Utopian dream that they could not yet achieve. They have found that the Senate is a tough nut and not being able to dissolve it they have decided to dilute it. This will happen as a result of one of the Bills which was gentleman is passed yesterday. Mr Innes-Tal k about this Bill and not about what happened yesterday. their passSenator SHEIL-The role of the Senate is most pertinent to this health legislation. We are to have some pseudo-senators in the Senate. But the Senate is a States House because there are 10 senators from each State elected to it so that an its equal representation from each State is mainhealth tamed. This is to protect the interests of the smaller States. Senator Poyser-What has that to do with this legislation?",48
44,Senator SHEIL,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,"Senato r Poyser comes from (Dr Everingham) one of those States. Senator Poyser-What are these 'smaller delighted Senator SHEIL-Queensland , the State which I represent, will be inimically damaged by the passage of this health legislation. The role of the Senate is most important in relation to this Senator Poyser-The role of the Senate has been",48
45,The CHAIRMAN,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,"Order! Senator Poyser, you will cease interjecting.",48
46,Senator SHEIL,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,"The Government informed us yesterday that the Senate discusses the problem of the States in its Party room, but not all my senators belong to the Government side of the Almost half of them belong to the Opposition side of the Senate. To decide State issues in the Labor Party's party room is to disfranchise I every voter in the States. Is that parUamentary democracy or is it sociaUsm? I call it socialism. is There have been several precedents for senators act on behalf of their States. I remember readin relation to the legislation establishing the Snowy Mountains Authority that New South Wales and Victoria were going to tamper with the water of the River Murray and disadvantage South Australia. All the South Australian senators voted together to protect their State. Simiadlarly, in relation to the Gold Mining Industry AsBUl, the Western Australian senators stuck together and protected Western Australia. Mr Killen-And sugar is Queensland.",48
47,Senator SHEIL,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,Perhaps.,49
48,The CHAIRMAN,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,I tliink we should get on with the health aspect.,49
49,Senator SHEIL,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,"Certainly. I hope that with the health Bills all Queensland senators will vote together, as they have been clearly instructed do, and reject them. Senator MCLaren-B y whom?",49
50,Senator SHEIL,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,"By the people Of Queensland. Let us not have any misconception about either of these health Bills. promise people any better health. They promise worse health. They certainly promise high taxes. Everybody has spoken about the cost. The cost will come out of people's taxes. What the Bills promise is a universal and compulsory insurance scheme. In those Bills is contained the machinery close. for socialisation. This will be achieved by a simple process of strangulation of the private mediit should cal services that we enjoy today and it will over one introduce replace them by a single huge, Government operated, bureaucratic machine, I presume been disputed, and rightly so.The something like the Post Office, of which all person is not properly covered then iteven Government supporters would have knowledge, of the Government to see that he is brought where one pays more and gets less. This high tax, ill-health Bill is the first step destroying our private health insurance, our priit vate general practitioner service, our private specialist service, our private hospitals, our priout vate nursing homes and our private ancillary serIt vices. Once that happens Australia will be stuck with a fully nationalised service such as exists the socialist countries. Then, my dear patient, when you crawl into your sick bed the Governfrom ment will crawl in beside you. And the Governare ment is not a very good bed-mate. As the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) has said, if the Governfinancial ment pays, the Government controls. In these new public beds a person will cease to be a patient and will become what is known as teachthere ing material. Curiously, a lot of people do not mind being made teaching material, but they should remember also that they will be used research purposes. As has been stated during these debates, countries have tried various forms of socialised health. They are all variations on a theme and they all come from the magnificent promise of freedom from cost and worry, mainly from polifix ticians in order to curry favour and win votes. in not one of those countries is any one of those schemes a success. Indeed, they are failing and they are costing the people of those countries enormous amounts which they cannot bear. Why should we make the mistakes that have been made overseas? If there are any good features in their systems, certainly we should lift them and incorporate them in ours, but we have no need to practise their folly. Despite the claims of honourable members opposite, Australians are not generally dissatisfied with the health service they to have at the moment. Any faults that exist lend themselves to easy correction. If we are to replace our health services and the good standard that we enjoy, we should replace them with something better, not something worse. Senator Poyser-What standards have you in They do not your nursing homes?",49
51,Senator SHEIL,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,"Quite good. They are low only because of Government interference and because the Government has imposed vicious price fixing on them causing many of them to The Government has given many reasons why million this new scheme. It says that people are not covered by private medical insurance cover. number has But if one is the duty in out of the cold. If one per cent, 5 per cent or 10 in per cent are not properly covered, then certainly is the duty of the Government to see that they are covered, but not to tip the other 90 per cent into the cold, which is what this Bill proposes. will expose us all to the second-rate class of treatment that pensioners get. The Government in claims that the passage of these Bills will remove the fear of the nnanciai consequences of illnesses the patients, but who are the patients? They you and I. The high cost of the Government's scheme will not relieve us of any fears of the consequences of illness. Indeed, we will be suffering from them because we as taxpayers will have to foot the bill. It is maintained that is social inequaUty in the cost of medical insurance simply because richer people can deduct their premiums from their income for tax for purposes and get it more cheaply, but I would point out that the richer people pay more tax anyway and out of that tax a fair whack is taken many for the provision of other health services. Mention was made of the unpredictability of costs and the way in which the Government wtil doctor's fees to some myth of a thing caUed a But common fee. I would point out that the doctor's fee is not the important factor in therisingmedical costs. It is the utilisation of the service that creates the high costs. When a patient goes to the doctor he does not know whether he has a little illness or a big illness. It might just involve one consultation and a prescription, but it might involve the doctor sending the patient for tests, an X-ray, a further opinion, hospitalisation or an operation. The cost depends on the usage. We cannot possibly predict medical costs. The doctor's fee is only a minor part tors, of course, have been accused of being bloody-minded and money-grubbing. It has already been pointed out in this Parhament that if the Government's medical scheme is brought in doctors will earn a lot more. I would point out also that over the last 20 years or more doctors have been providing cheap services for the Government for treatment of pensioners, repatriation patients and workers compensation cases. Rather than the Government subsidising the doctors the boot is on the other foot and the doctors have been subsidising the Government. The Government talks about the demeaning appUcation of the means test. I know that it is the policy of my Party to abolish the means test and I thought it was the pohcy of the Government to do so, but its spending in other directions, which has reduced the economy to dire straits, has not allowed it to do so. Yet at least the means test sees that services go to the areas of most need. The charge that pensioners get second-rate care is true. For the last 20 months the Government has done nothing about it. AU it has to do to fix is to put the pensioners in a medical benefits scheme and then the whole range of medical care will be open to pensioners. The most critical part of the BUls involves that crafty ruse whereby doctors wtil be gradually coerced into bulk btiling the Government. When that happens it means that the Government wtil be paying the doctor, or in other words, the doctor will be working for the Government and will not be working for the patient. Once that happens we will all be sorry and every Australian wtil be disadvantaged. When the patient comes to see the doctor he willfindall of a sudden that a government wedge has been driven between him and the doctor. He wtilfindwhen he attends his doctor that if the doctor's fee isfixedand low the only mechanism the doctor has to earn more money is to see more patients. The patient will be scorching his pants going through the doctor's surgery, as has happened in other countries that have tried this type of scheme. The patient, by the way, has been the forgotten person in all of this scheme. When we come to think of it, the whole health edifice exists for the patient. Our medical education, medical research, administrative medicine, curative medicine and preventive medicine all exist for the patient-and one at a time, not in big groups. If we have no private medical care to balance pubhc medical care the patient has to take it or leave it, like it or lump it. I was amused to hear other speakers say that they wouldfixthe problems of hospitals and doctors in this country, apparently by the passage of of those costs. Doc- these BiUs. At the moment Australia is suffering from a tremendous shortage of doctors. Where are the new ones to come from? Now that the Government has nationalised the universities, Queensland has a situation where a medical student can pass his first year medicine but not be accepted into second year medicine because quota systems are rigidly appUed. Under these new Bills doctors are not encouraged to expand the service which they give to pauents in their surgeries. The doctor wtil be paid only for the patient's passage through the surgery. In other words he is not encouraged to provide pathology tests, X-rays, cardiographs and all those other services which save time and inconvenience to patients. The promise of free health care to the consumer at the point of delivery is a wUd one. It is incapable of fulfilment because a promise like that immediately creates an unlimited demand. To satisfy that demand there is a Government it Budget. The two cannot meet. Indeed, one goes away from the other and we wind up with dissatisfied doctors, patients and government. I recommend that we reject the BUls.",49
52,Senator MELZER,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION," I think the people of Queensland should be congratulated on having elected Senator SheU to the Senate. At least it moves him out of the medical carefield,to their great advantage. By now these BUls have been debated over and over in both Houses of the Parliament. They have been debated almost endlessly outside the Parliament through the media, in clubs, committees and societies. The debates which have covered the intricacies of the scales of fees and actuary reports have gone on endlessly. These matters have been pulled apart and put together again. I rise to support the BUls on the grounds that, for the vast majority of the Uttle people of this country, they will be a godsend. The intricacies of Government subsidies and the financial arrangements that prevaU between State and Federal governments are beyond them. They want, and they have said through 2 elections in the last 2 years, that they will have a scheme such as this to take some of the terror out of being Ul. The difference between the party to which I have the honour to belong and the Opposition Parties is that we represent those people and the Opposition represents the privileged in the community, people such as the doctors who are represented by the Australian Medical Association and the General Practitioners' Society, the private hospitals and the private health insurance funds. Through all the debate which has waged around these BUls the constant hysterical liberate attempt to misrepresent the scheme and to engender fear and dismay has come from those bodies which I mentioned. The wtiling tool in this patently dishonest campaign has been the Opposition in the Federal Parliament. One would have thought that some tinge of conadequate science would have been awakened under those modish suits and those stylish haircuts, some feeling of responsibUity for the ordinary people whom the Opposition represents, the ordinary people who join one of the health insurance funds out of some 160 which exist. But there still one mUlion people uncovered. People join these funds at an ever-increasing cost while funds are propped up by Government finance and create greater and greater reserves. As Minister for Social Security (Mr Hayden) with pointed out recently, they amount to $40m in one instance. MeanwhUe, the funds pay their execuOpposition tives larger and larger salaries. This week whtie the Minister argued against bigger contribution payments by members, the Hospital Contribuvicinity tions Fund of Australia's executive committee approved new salaries for its top executives. the case of the director the salary is $31,400, plus $1,500 expenses and a car. This is a rise of 22.54 per cent. At the beginning these funds were envisaged as being of assistance to the people whom they are now rnilching, the very people whom the Opposition is supposed to represent. These funds are not even representaremember, tives of their consumers. (Honourable senators and members in interjecting)",50
53,The CHAIRMAN,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,"Order! Honourable senarepayments tors and members wtil come to order. I will not keep on asking members of the Country Party to and looks remain silent. If they do not remain sUent, I wtil about which they have to take the appropriate action.",51
54,Senator MELZER,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,"Eve n members of the Country Party represent consumers who should be represented on these health insurance funds. But consumers play a very small part in boards of management of health insurance funds. For sations instance, the Hospital Beneiits Association Victoria is run by a committee of twenty-eight, only eight of whom are elected by the contributors. The other twenty are appointed by the various hospital associations, the Australian Medical Association, the Pharmaceutical Society of Victoria and the Bush Nursing Association. Of those 28 committee members, eleven form the executive committee which actually runs the Association, and under that set up there is no way that the contributors can be represented adequately and dein that inner committee. The private health insurance funds have failed to give the Australian people the protection they require. People who insure themselves with these funds arefindingit harder and harder to afford cover. The very proliferation of funds-8 1 medical funds and 93 hospital funds - is illogical and must be costly to the community as costs rise and as they compete. More than one million people are left without any cover. These are people who, in the main, are the sorts of are people for whom the community must take responsibUity-ag e pensioners, single mothers, the people on low incomes with large families and people who just do not think about the necessity the for cover and who are irresponsible but who, this Government's scheme, wtil be forced to discipline themselves. To follow the Une of the and have all these people enrolled in private funds would result in a massive handout to doctors and the funds. It would cost in the of $150m a year and would achieve nothing by way of desirable incentives for the In future development of the health care system. I instance the case of a working famtiy which very has to pay out an increasing amount for insurance cover; has to remember to go to the chemist regularly to pay for that cover; has to if the contributor changes jobs and the boss has been making deductions from his pay, to make other arrangements to have the payments made or else when the wife has a baby 3 months'timeor when Johnny has appendicitis there is no money; and which has to wait for to arrive. That famtiy and similar that families are all desperately wanting a scheme after paying the bills in some civilised easy way so that there is one more thing do not have to worry. They do not feel that they have lost any great Uberty in having the amount deducted ""from their pay. They are looking forward to the freedom ofhaving that part of the business of Uving looked after for them. So many of them know from converwith their mates that this is the way it is in done in comparable overseas countries. No terrible disasters have overtaken those countries because of such schemes. Not one of the Governments involved would remove such schemes. Much is said about nationalising doctors, socialising medicine and creating a government monopoly over medicine. The fact is that we are losing goodwill in the medical world. We are losing the goodwill of the patients. Doctors are losing the goodwill of the patients-the goodwill that used to exist between them-because , so far as the patients can see, the doctors or, to give them their due, the doctors represented by these associations are much more concerned with their own position and how much money they can earn than with the welfare of their patients. One patently dishonest rumor that those gallant gentlemen in the AMA have spread abroad throughout the highways and byways- a rumor which has been mentioned here today-is this despicable story: 'You will not be able to have your own doctor. You wtil be zoned. You will go on a list. You will have a black man to look after you'. This is all poppycock, and they know it. Over and over, in written and spoken words, the Government has said that there will be complete freedom of choice of doctor. There is no way by which a person will be forced away from his own doctor, even if the doctor is Senator Sheil. If the doctors from the General Practitioners Society and the Australian Medical Association took time out from worrying about how much money they were going to earn and tried even once to be truthful they would have to admit that today, under the scheme they prefer and maintain, it is very difficult in some instances for a patient to see the same doctor on 2 consecutive visits. Doctors have formed themselves into groups and clinics to give themselves decent working hours and conditions-nobod y has any complaint about that-and the patient sees the doctor on duty. So why this constant childish nonsense about the personal relationship between doctor and patient? What patient goes to a specialist of his own choice? He goes where his doctor directs him. That is the system that exists and that is the system that will continue. It is an insult to the intelligence of ordinary people otherwise. This scheme that we are bringing in does not in any way interfere with that current situation. The Opposition and the doctors it represents would have more credibility if they showed more concern for the areas where there are no doctors at all. If they were more concerned with the people who cannot afford doctor's fees, hospital insurance charges or charges for proper medical cover, they would have more credibility in their crusade to save the community from itself. Does not the Opposition know that there are many areas in which doctors' surgeries display a sign 'cash on consultation'? What does a mother do who slices off her thumb doing the vegetables or whose nipper falls out of a tree and breaks his wrist? It is unfortunate if they are stupid enough to do it on the day before pay day and there is no money. Have not members opposite ever existed where the purse was empty? If a plumber is asked to come and mend a pipe he does not ask for the money first. He comes and mends the pipe and sends his bill like any honest, decent tradesman. But members opposite are not prepared to make doctors become honest, decent tradesmen. The people opposite have never woken up in the night with pain and laid in misery saying to themselves that they will go to the doctor tomorrow only to find that when tomorrow comes they are faced with the milk bill and the new school shoes and they have to put the visit off again and again. A member of the Opposition in earlier debate told us that if a person is too poor to pay a doctor that person should certainly go to the doctor, feeling sure that he would not be refused attention to his needs. What incredible cheek. It is like Florence Nightingale bringing calves foot jelly and other help to the poor. We on this side of the House are committed to maintaining the proper dignity of all people. We are not committed to innumerable private health insurance funds whose only concern is to build up their reserves so that when this Government's scheme begins to operate they may escape with the fat funds. We are not committed to preserve a system where doctors exist in some privileged position-gentleme n who, at will and as the pique takes them, will withdraw their services from areas of need without a care for the people left without their care. Gentlemen withdraw their services; lesser ranks go on strike. But the lesser ranks go on strike in a desperate bid to maintain their very Uves. These other people go on strike to maintain their position of privUege. to say We are committed to giving the people of Australia a comprehensive health insurance scheme- a comprehensive health cover-becaus e we believe in their intrinsicrightto a life of dignity and decency.",51
55,The CHAIRMAN,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,I call the honourable member for LUley. Mr Armitage-Santamari a wrote this.,52
56,The CHAIRMAN,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,Order! The honourable member for Chifley wtil cease interjecting.,52
57,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,"The honourable member for Chifley (Mr Armitage) has always had a fertile imagination that has been demonstrated in nothing else but his puerile interjections. Within the constraints of time that are put upon me-the y are quite severe-on e or two things deserve to be stated concerning the proposed health scheme. When I look at the Government and when I consider the activities of the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) and the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden) over the last 5 years I am forced to accept the simple proposition that their aim has been to go down in Austrahan history as the gravediggers of Australia's health system. They have become very chirpy because they feel themselves to be within 20 minutes or 25 minutes of achieving that very disastrous goal and title. This proposiuon must also be considered in some other contexts. Nothing that this Governganisations ment does can be considered other text of power and its propensity to stretch the Constitution to its very limit. When one remembers what was attempted last December, what was attempted in May and what was carhospital ried out yesterday, one can see that the Prime Minister and the honourable member for Oxley intend to make themselves the gravediggers of hospitals the Australian Constitution. This is certainly true in respect of health services. The common sense of the Australian people was manifest when the Constitution was first-adopted, because in matter of health only one power was conferred on the Commonwealth Government-the power of quarantine. When, after the Second World War, the social service amendments were made to the Constitution, further powers in respect health, hospitals, medical benefits, etc., were conferred upon the Commonwealth Governdifficulties ment, but not so as to authorise any form of civti conscription. The spirit of that veto is quite The spirit of that veto is offended when, in terms of economic conscription andfinancialconscripextra tion, the Government, through the honourable member for Oxley and the Prime Minister, attempts to inter our present health system. Economic conscription, with aU its compulsion and with all its direction, has always been anathvoluntary ema to the Australian people, but the Governupon ment intends to impose it on the Australian people in respect ofhealth. The further question should be asked: In respect does the Government intend to impose this economic conscription upon the Australian people? Earlier this afternoon I Ustened to the speech of a former Minister for Health, the honourable member for Barker (Dr Forbes), and every word in his comments was correct. For 5 years the Prime Minister and his supporters have looked for the vulnerable elements in the Australian health system in order to utilise them as instruments with which to destroy the Australian health system. They have looked for the vulnerable elements in three respects. They have looked for the vulnerable elements in the medical profession; they have looked for the vulnerable elements in respect of hospitals; and they have used the weight of their propaganda and money to make vulnerable the voluntary health services of this nation. Time makes very severe constraints in this respect, but in terms of the medical profession the Prime Minister and his supporters intend to use the weight of the Commonwealth's powers to interpose themselves in every consultation between a doctor and a patient, and it is a weight that can barely be resisted by the people who do not have great orbehind them. Common sense indithan in a concates that this is so. The Prime Minister and his supporters have utilised the vulnerable element in respect of services. People who are without great resources and who wish to avail themselves of hospital services will be turned away from the of their choice. I wtil Ulustrate that with one example, and it is quite clear. Who could be more vulnerable in this respect than an expectant mother expecting difficulties in child birth? Who the could be more vulnerable than an expectant mother under those circumstances who has paid her contributions to a government insurance fund and has booked into a private maternity hospital? Under the proposed health scheme that of payment wtil be an extra cost on her of several hundred dollars. If her chtid happens to have and has to be put in an intensive care ward, and if the hospital cannot juggle that child clear. between a private and a pubUc mtensive care ward, that mother will have to pay some further hundreds of doUars. Those vulnerable people are the ones who wtil be induced to move away from the private hospitals of Australia. Turning to the third element in respect of the health funds, accusations of deception deception have been laid at their doors for more than 5 years, and there has been no more cruel deception than that 25 per cent of the money paid out by voluntary health funds has in what fact been spent on management expenses. They have been clear, unequivocal lies; they have been a series of Ues. When one looks at what the Government has done and the context in which it has done it, one sees that the Government's plan of campaign and its tactics do the Government little credit. But of course the Government wants to make a name for itself. It wants to copy the British scheme. When Aneurin Bevan introduced the British scheme he did not know what inflation was. The experiment of the welfare state was something new and its consequences were not appreciated. Aneurin Bevan did this against the background of a tragic and very high rate of unemployment which had existed in his own country for more than a couple of decades.",53
58,Mr JAMES,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,"The Tories have never taken that offthe statute book, though.",54
59,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,"I hope that we have a higher standard of Uving than they have in the United Kingdom. Every one of those experiences is known in Australia. The economic context in which this scheme is being introduced has 2 elements-hig h innation and rising unemployment. I am unable to see in the chamber at the moment the Minister for Labor and Immigration, but we will soon be able to say of him a parody which was said of others almost 20 years ago, namely: 'You wiU all be cool in Cameron's pool'. In the few minutes avaUable to me I would Uke to descend into a parochialism appropriate to my own State, but it is one that touches nearly 2 mUlion people in this nation. For decades there has been in Queensland a mixture of public and private hospitals which all of the people in that State have supported. In fact, almost 900,000 people in my own State have sought to have the free public hospital system avaUable to them as their own source of treatment. That right is to taken away, and it is to be taken away by this scheme which has been proposed by the Government. The Government has chosen the vulnerable elements in the private hospitals field, in terms of patients to indicate that they would not be able to pay to go to those hospitals, and in terms of simple benefits which people in Queensland have received and which have been appropriate only to that part of the Commonwealth. Those things will vanish, and it is approresult priate to consider that point in a ume when Cameron's pool is going to get larger. There has been a form of accident benefit or unemployment benefit available to those people in Queensland who were members of funds and who went to a public hospital, in that they received up to $30 a week. This benefit helped many families. Even that is to be taken away under the scheme which is proposed by the Government. Everything that is done by this Government is done in the context of power. In terms of health, which is the most intimate of social services, the Government does not want to put itself in the position of sharing power with anyone else. The people of Australia wtil regret it if in fact they have this scheme imposed upon them. The final indignity with respect to my own State has been the double shuffle and the trickery that have been proposed in respect of Danegeld, an extra amount of money to be given if the State agrees to do away with the free pubUc hospitals. Various extra amounts ranging between $22m and $34m have been promised to the people in my own State if they go quietly and do not object to the plunder of their own free public hospitals system. But the honourable member for Oxley knows, the Treasurer (Mr Crean) knows, and the Prime Minister knows that the way in which interstatefinancesare organised, unamended at the moment, it is very unlikely that that can be given to Peter without robbing Paul. So the double shuffle and the trickery deserves to be exposed in this respect. One is left only with the proposition- a simple proposition in this respect-that the Government and those people who propose this scheme wtil not be happy until they have the title of the successful gravedigger thrust upon them, and they wtil not be happy unless they see the body of a healthy, vital, voluntary, supported Australian health services interred.",54
60,Mr MATHEWS,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,"There is nothing like a debate on a down-to-earth topic such as health to expose the gulf that separates be the Liberal Party from the problems of an average Australian fanuly. Every word we heard this morning from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Snedden) and the Opposition spokesman on health and social security, the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Chipp), showed clearly that they are out of touch with the health care services upon which an overwhelming majority of Australian famUies are obliged to rely. Every calamity which they predicted as a of the health scheme which we are debating this afternoon is already part and parcel of health care arrangements for which the Opposition is responsible and with which every ordinary Australian fanuly becomes involved in times of sickness or injury. The Leader of the Opposition said that under Labor's alternative national health program patients would have to wait and wait in doctor's surgeries for their medical attention. I will show him surgeries located for miles around his home, which is situated in my electorate, in which sick people, frightened people, crying chUdren and victims of accidents waited hours this morning for medical attention, as they wait each year under the Liberal health arrangements which did not occasion him any concern years. Senator Webster-Are you sincere? Mr Katter-G o on!",54
61,Mr MATHEWS,HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION,"I hear members of the Country Party disagreeing with me. Perhaps they have a different experience. Every member on either side who represents a suburban electorate Armitage, knows that this is the truth and the waiting goes Barnard, on. I know because last week my wife and my Bennett, A F. child waited for 3 hours under those conditions Berinson, in a suburban surgery. The Leader of the Opposition said that under Bryant, G. M. Labor's alternative health scheme people would Burton, have to wait, wait, wait until hospital beds were Cameron, Qyde available before they could undergo elective surCameron, gery. Is there any public hospital in which this Cass.M. was not the case throughout 23 years of Liberal Child, G.J.L. Party Government of this country?

He is obviously from the people of Queensland everybody is Fulton, W.J. means tested out of a public ward. They have no Garrick, option but to insure themselves at that level.

The Proclamation by the ate Governor General on 30 July 1974 convened Joint Sitting of the members of the Senate and accepted. the House of Representatives for the purpose deliberating and voting upon each of proposed laws.

68,Mr WENTWORTH,OBJECTION TO RULING," Mr The Chairman, under rule 141 move: That the Chairman's ruling be disagreed with. (The honourable member for MackeUar having confine submitted his objection in writing)",57
69,Mr WENTWORTH,OBJECTION TO RULING,"Mr Chairman, this sitlamation ting comes about in consequence of a Proclathings, mation, as you have said. That Proclamation detaUed what we should do. But it did not detaU what we should not do. Indeed, sir, the Chief Jushave tice a few days ago criticised the terms of the Proclamation as setting out in too much detaU what in fact we should do. We are constrained our ad hoc Standing Rules and by the Senate Standing Orders. But even the Senate Standing Orders do not confine the discussion. It is true that we cannot make here vaUd laws outside terms of the Proclamation, but there is nothing prevent us from discussing what we want to do. Surely, we can make resolutions about our own adjournment; it would be monstrous if we could not make such resolutions now. I put to you, Mr Chairman, the general principle that unless violates a special requirement, every meeting master of its own business. So, there is no specific requirement which precludes this discussion. Sir, I will be brief. We are meeting as all members of Parliament. It is true that we are not the Houses of Parliament in the normal sense. But the matters that I propose in this motion are relevant to our main responsibilities as members of Parliament and we would be recreant to those if we did not consider them in the frightening state of crisis. It is true that I have proposed 2 alternatives: Either that we as should discuss these matters adequately nowand whatever personal inconvenience it may be to members, we should stay and discuss themSenator Cavanagh- I rise to a point of order. I Australia understand, Mr Chairman, that the motion we Houses are considering now is that your rating be disagreed with. Therefore I think we should be some reasons why we should disagree with ruling. Whether or not it may be approprito discuss something now is another question. a The question is whether your ruling should be of The CHAIRMAN. The point of order is upthe 6 held. I shall read out what I said: The proclamation by the Governor General on 30 July a Joint Sitting of the members of the Senate and of House of Representatives for the purposes of deliberatand voting upon each of the 6 proposed laws. In my opinion neither section 57 of the Constitution nor the Proclamation authorises the consideration of any other matters by the Joint Sitting. Accordingly I rule that proposed motion out of order. honourable gentleman shaU not discuss any matter except that embraced by the point of order raised by Senator Cavanagh.",57
70,Mr WENTWORTH,OBJECTION TO RULING,"Indeed , Sir. I shall myself very specifically to that point. I have already taken the point that while the Procdoes not require us to discuss these it does not forbid us to discuss them. I now take the point that as members of Parhament, since we are not forbidden to do this, we a duty to do it in the present circumstances. I have put the 2 alternatives: Either we discuss them now or the Government indicates that both by Houses should meet next week. The Senate is to meet anyway. I do not believe that in the present situation honourable members would be worried about their personal convenience. I say that, the hoping to commend honourable members and to senators. It has been asked: Why should the House of Representatives discuss these matters when it met only last week? I think that this is a question which should be answered in terms of the point that you have raised, Sir. It is a question it of whether our duties constrain us to do those is things which are not forbidden. There have been 3 changes in the situation since last week. Firstly, there has been an authoritative economist's statement that has placed the Government's the economic pohcy in ruins. The CHAraMAN-Order! I have just read statement from the Chair about this matter. I asking the honourable gentleman to make the point he wishes to make as to why my ruling should be disagreed with. I am not asking honourable gentleman to debate the quesdon. Do not strain our good friendship.",57
71,Mr WENTWORTH,OBJECTION TO RULING,"I know that no small incident could strain our friendship, Sir. I simply thought say that it might be said that the House of face of this new, final Representatives met last week. In order to show out doing anythingfrightening the extent of the responsibilities which Ue upon honourable members and senators to discuss now those things that are not forbidden- I think bipartisan that this is absolutely relevant to your ruling, motion Sir- I wish to point out briefly that I have noted not that there have been 3 changes, namely, the economist's statement, the communists' stateGovernment ment and the present industrial disruptionSenator Cavanagh- I raise a point of order, Mr Chairman.",58
72,The CHAIRMAN,OBJECTION TO RULING,Order! I will have to ask the honourable member for Mackellar to resume seconded? his seat if he persists in going outside before the Chair. The motion is that the Chairman's ruting be disagreed with. The honourable member for Mackellar is not allowed to discuss the economy or anything else; he is aUowed to talk only about the reason why my ruling be disagreed with.,58
73,Mr WENTWORTH,OBJECTION TO RULING,"I have given that torate reason, Sir.",58
74,The CHAIRMAN,OBJECTION TO RULING,If the honourable should member for MackeUar persists in debating the question I wtil have to ask him to resume his,58
75,Mr WENTWORTH,OBJECTION TO RULING,"I shall, of course, obey the Chair. I only wish to say in this my last tenceSenator O'Byrne- I raise a point of order, Chairman. I draw attention to the Rules of Joint Sitting, which are those of the Senate. Standing order 429 states: If any objection is taken PresidentMeaning you, Mr Chairmansuch objection must be taken at once, and in writing, and Motion made, which, if seconded, shall be proposed to Senate, and Debate thereon forthwith adjourned to the next sitting day, unless the Senate decides(Honourable senators and members interjecttives. ing)",58
76,The CHAIRMAN,OBJECTION TO RULING,"Order ! On this occasion we are working to rule (14), which provides situation where any objection is taken to any ruling of the Chairman. Every honourable a member and senator has a copy of the Rules. am That rule, which was agreed to by both Houses of the Parhament, supersedes the provision in the Standing Orders of the Senate. I indicate to the the honourable member for Mackellar that he had better confine his remarks to the reason why my ruling should be disagreed with.",58
77,Mr WENTWORTH,OBJECTION TO RULING,"Mr Chairman, I I had done that. I will conclude with 2 points, if I may. First, if we adjourn in the new situation withabout it we face the deserved censure of the people. I hope that there will be a debate. I do not intend to press this to a division because I know that it takes a quarter of an hour to count a division and I am prepared to waste time knowing that if the feels a certain way the steamroller will come out. I am not going to waste time by requiring the motion to be put to a division. I was hoping against hope that this frightening national crisis could be met in a bipartisan spirit.",58
78,The CHAIRMAN,OBJECTION TO RULING,"Order! Is the motion the motion Senator Wood-Yes , Mr Chairman.",58
79,Mr DALY,OBJECTION TO RULING," I wondered how long the calm of this Joint Sitting could last. I wondered should also how long the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) could resist the temptation to let those strange people in his elecknow that he was amongst us. Having seen his performance on the television screen, I imagine that at the next election the seat wtil be a Labor certainty. Mr Chairman, you seat.ruled that the honourable member for Mackellar was out of order when he submitted a motion to senthis Parliament. He sought to introduce into this Joint Sitting of the Parliament discussion of matters which were not included in His ExceUency Mr the Governor General's proclamation. I refer the this honourable member for MackeUar, if he can read it intelligently, to the proclamation. The final words are these: to the ruling or decision of the Now therefore I, Sir John Robert Kerr, the Governor General of Australia, do by this my Proclamation convene a joint sitting of the members of the Senate and of the House of Representatives, to commence in the House of Representhe tatives Chamber at Parliament House, Canberra at 10.30 o'clock in the morning on 6 August 1974, at which they may deliberate and shall vote together upon each of the said proposed laws as last proposed by the House of RepresentaSo that thatfinalparagraph might penetrate the intellect of the honourable member for for MackeUar let me repeat it slowly: . . . at which they may deliberate and shall vote together upon each of the said proposed laws proposed by the House of Representatives. The honourable member, in his usual disruptive and propagandising way, decided to take advantage of the Joint Sitting of this Parliament at which we are deliberating on tremendous issues because of the frustration caused by members of that decadent chamber opposite. He sought to take advantage of the situadon and to suspend Standing Orders so that he could raise a matter in contradiction of His Excellency's command. Could the House have imagined a Liberal breaking His Excellency's command? What a treacherous thing to do. What an insult to the Crown and Her Majesty.",58
80,The CHAIRMAN,OBJECTION TO RULING,Order! I think the Minster is becoming a Uttle provocative.,59
81,Mr DALY,OBJECTION TO RULING,"Well , with my Irish background, Mr Chairman, I am upset tremendously by the motion moved by the honourable member. I would not like to see a motion such as this carried against Her Majesty's representative in this country in the precise way it has been moved by the honourable member for Mackellar. I have no wish to hold up the business of this House, but, as everybody knows, this is a propaganda move. There is no substance in the honourable member's motion. You, Mr Chairman, in your wise and Solomon-Uke way, gave one of those ruUngs for which you are famous. The business of the House should not be held up. The proceedings of this Joint Sitting are, at the moment, being televised and the honourable member moved this motion so that his electors might see him. Another reason the honourable member has moved this motion is to try, as other speakers on that side of the House have done, from the Leader of the Opposition down, to take away from this Joint Sitting the opportunity to deUberate on the great issues before it. Therefore, the House to reject the motion because it has no substance. It is contradictory of the proclamation that has been issued and of the Standing Orders. It has been moved for propaganda purposes only and all the honourable members wtil get out of it, no matter what happens, is to let those people who have seen him know that he is here. I hope that having had his moment of glory the honourable member for MackeUar will behave himself and let this Joint Sitting get on with its deUberations.",59
82,Mr WENTWORTH,OBJECTION TO RULING," Mr Chairman, I wish to make a personal explanation. I have been most grossly misrepresented by the Minister.",59
83,The CHAIRMAN,OBJECTION TO RULING,"Order! If that is possible, I as last will permit a personal explanation.",59
84,Mr WENTWORTH,OBJECTION TO RULING,"The Minister said that I had moved this motion purely for propaganda purposes and to delay discussions of important issues. Important though the issues before this Joint Sitting may be, the issue that I raised was even more important. Motion (by Senator Douglas MCCleUand) agreed to: That the quesuon be now put. Original question resolved in the negative. NA AUTHORITY ACT 1973",59

I now caU on the sixth proposed I ask law, namely the Petroleum and Minerals Authority Act 1973 and pursuant to rule 111 propose the question: That the proposed law be affirmed.",59
92,Mr CONNOR,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS," Mr Chairman, honourable senators and honourable members, I support the motion as stated. No Australian Government was ever in a stronger position in the introduction of its legislation than we are on this occasion. We have the specific mandate of the electors of Australia, who returned this Government to power, following a double dissolution election in which this legislation was a major issue. The Senate Opposition, entrenched in its 'House of Obstruction', continues to flout the clear electoral verdict deliberately, systematiI cally and provocatively. Its actions strike at fundamental concepts of parhamentary democracy. Having once pushed the Australian rich. Government to an election by double dissolmajor ution, the opposition has immediately lead, threatened to repeat its behavior. It is a supreme example of httle Austrahans, narrow and biased in their approach, exhibiting uncompromising opposition to the legitimate Australian Governfunctions ment. The House of Representatives is the House where governments are made and unmade. In succession, this Bill was passed by the specifically House of Representatives on 12 December 1973; Authority to assist failed to pass the Senate on 13 was refused a second reading by the Senate on 2 thereby helping them toand April 1974; was re-enacted by the House of saving them from falling into foreign Representatives on 8 April 1974; was refused a second reading by the Senate for the second time on 10 April 1974; was re-enacted by the House of Representatives on 11 July 1974; and again was refused a second reading by the Senate on 24 July 1974. This legislation proposes the creation of Petroleum and Minerals Authority whose funcare tions will be to explore for, and to develop, Australia's petroleum and mineral resources, and to assist in implementing the Government's policies of promoting Australian ownership and control of our natural resources and resource industries. In today's world, the ever growing ergy crisis highlights the world reliance on oil and natural gas for energy needs. It is in no small measure due to the quadrupling of oil prices that a threat is posed to the economic viability and foreign exchange reserves of some of the world's major industrial powers, which have underconfidence complacently relied on unlimited cheap oil imports, and have ignored research and developfailure. ment of alternative energy sources, such as natural gas, coal, and ultimately uranium and solar energy. I first spoke of this Authority in the House of Representatives on 12 April 1973 in my statetal, ment on 'Australian Petroleum Search Pohcy'. I then foreshadowed an Australian annual energy budget, based on the advice of a group of statuunderstood tory bodies and authorities, which will include the authority created by this measure. Energy can, of course, be derived from sources other than oil and natural gas. Petroleum equivalent derivatives can be obtained from the hydrogenour ation of coal, from natural gas and its liquids. There is also the enrichment of uranium. have yet to determine fully in Austraha our reserves of these energy resources, without foraffect feiting national ownership and participation, and stress the words 'national ownership and parthe ticipation'. These are but three of the energy . resources which we possess and in which we are We are, for example, amongst the world's 5 producers of bauxite, iron ore, tin, silver, zinc and manganese. In addition to world ranking deposits of uramum, we have significant deposits of other minerals. The Bill vests in the Petroleum and Minerals Authority the same and powers, in relation to these other minerals, as it does in relation to petroleum. Other provisions in the Bill are designed control of to promote Australian ownership and our natural resources, by requiring the weaker niining undertakings December 1973; to get off the ground, achieve cash-flow, remain Austrahan, and hands. Australian ownership is not an objective to be achieved by usurping the reasonable interests of overseas organisations, which today have majority control of certain sectors of our mineral and energy resources. It is an objective to be a achieved by other means, not the least of which by Australian national partnership participation. As a nation we have not hitherto been conscious of our obligation to ourselves to undertake the development of our mineral resources. Our predecessors in office certainly sought such development. The great difference between them enand u$ has been their policies, which exposed Australian initiatives to overseas acquisition and control. We believe that these policies resulted from a misunderstanding of the national interest, ignorance of the effects of the real operations of multi-national corporations and, above all, in the capacity of their fellow Australians, and fear of the consequences of The Australian Government accepts its responsibilities. We are not unmindful of the contributions of overseas companies by development in particular cases, by the provision of capitechnology, and commeraal opportunities, but in future Australia will be the primary partner in such enterprises. These objectives are well overseas by both governments and commerce. Whilst we shall be primary partners, we still, under appropriate conditions, welcome continued participation and assistance of overseas companies. The Prime Minister has said that policies are not 'anti' anyone: They are 'for' Australia. I emphasise that these measures conWe cern ownership and control of our mineral resources and resource industries. They do not suppUes under existing contracts which wtil be honoured to the full, nor do they have adverse implications for the future supply of minerals from this country. The products of our Australian resources will be as readily available to our trading partners as they have been in the past. We shall be aiming at the greater processing of our mineral exports, and so moving from being primarily an exporter of raw materials, to being substantially an exporter of semi-processed and fully processed materials. In the field of energy resources we are naturally looking to our own needs first, particularly to ensure full independence in liquid hydro-carbons, and their equivalents. We have insisted, of course, upon fair and reasonable returns, based upon world market prices for our exports, ensuring that neither the buyer, nor the seller, will suffer fall losses, nor enjoy windfall gains by currency exchange rate movement, and long term contracts. We are specially aware of the energy needs of Japan as our major trading partner, and our continuing obUgations to meet Japan in complementary trading relations. The Prime Minister has already said, with ticipating great clarity, in documents tabled on November last, that in special energy cases we have the particular objective of 100 per cent tralian ownership. The specific cases are uranium, crude oU, natural gas and black coal. Soaring crude oU prices can reach a point well before 1980, where alternative production of petroleum derivatives by the hydrogenation of coal can be cheaper than continued oti consumpCo. tion. The Petroleum and Minerals Authority wtil also participate in this field. In his 1972 speech the Prime Minister said that the AusMexico, tralian Labor Party was determined that the Australian people should be restored to their rightful place in their own country, as the owners and keepers of the national estate, and the nation's resources, and as fair and reasonable sharers in the national wealth. The Government believes that Australian ownership and control of the nation's assets is no longer a matter of bate, but an objective to be shared by the great mass of the Austrahan people of aU poltiical pernor suasions. Approximately 62 per cent of Ausnage production. traUan minerals are under foreign ownership and/or control. In the case of crude oU and ral gas it well exceeds 70 per cent. The Australian Government is deterrnined that these figures wtil not rise, and will work to ensure their progressive reduction. Lacking a comprehensive minerals pohcy, our predecessors allowed conflicting policies to origAuthority, inate in the various Australian States, which embarked on conscious poUcies of foohsh commination petition to attract mining companies to their areas. The competitive granting of mineral explorationrightson absurd terms in the name of progress has resulted in the States, in many cases, being allowed to usurp national functions. In the State of Queensland for example, 80 per cent of its black coal resources are in the hands of overseas ownership. One foreign company dominates 60 per cent of the black coal production in that State. There is only IS per cent Australian equity in the consortium holding off-shore exploration rights on the North West Continental Shelf of Western Australia, where 142,000 square mUes of one of the world's largest potential natural gas areas are held by it-a n area beyond the full capacity of even the largest company to intenwindsively explore. We have refused appUcations from it to agree to the transfer of its obUgations by 'farm-out' to other compames on a 50-50 basis, ignoring the rights of Australian sovereignty. We have refused such'farm-outs', stating that areas which cannot be explored by existing permit holders should be returned to the Australian Government to be let out by it on a parbasis, ensuring at least a 50 per cent di7 rect return to the Australian people. AusAbout 25 per cent of Australia's export income is derived from minerals. We seek to follow the lead of other nations, which now participate directly in petroleum and minerals search and production. The British Government, of course, is a major shareholder in the British Petroleum Ltd. There is direct participation in mineral production by national governments in France, policy Italy, Norway, Canada, Argentina, Brazil, South Africa, Iran, Iraq, India, Japan, Indonesia and New Zealand, to name only some of the governments thus participating. Indeed it is questionable whether, with the degree of government participation throughout the world in these fields, the interests of our nation can be properly represented other than through an agency of the government. Without government deto government initiatives, Australia today would neither have unrationed access to Uquid fuels, the abUity to continue to export its high tonnatuIt was the pohcy of our predecessors to make their contribution to search for petroleum resources by a variety of indirect means, including payment of subsidies and special tax arrangements, and to accept the abuses necessarily associated with such a system. Our poticy is direct contribution by a Petroleum and Minerals the subject of this Bill. Last year the have Treasurer (Mr Crean) and I announced the terof the income tax concessions provided by sections 77c, 77D and 78 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. Matching replacement finance will flow through the activities of the new agency. The celebrated Fitzgerald report on these ters showed that only about 27 per cent of the funds raised by typical companies of the section 77 claiming class were in fact being devoted to genuine mineral exploration or mines and plant, and the remainder to company share speculation and other colourable practices. It has been backed in great detail by the Rae Committee's report, with particular reference to the notable abuses in the share market transactions of the crashed Minsec Company. These wtil be fully covered by other Government speakers. The Fitzgerald report disclosures of the paltry contributions by major overseas mineral companies to Australian tax revenues, utilising the excessively generous tax concessions our predecessors allowed, were greeted with stunned silence by the Opposition during the recent May election campaign. Direct subsidies for oil search and available taxation concessions up to the end of 1971 showed that of $843m spent on petroleum exploration in Australia $419m, or almost exactly one-half, represented either direct Commonwealth subsidy or taxation concessions available to participating companies. In return the Australian Government, and the Australian people, have not received even a single dollar equity share. Of this sum $ 134m has been disbursed under the Petroleum Search Subsidy Act which expired on 30 June last. A considerable proportion of this money has been paid to the subsidiaries of overseas major oil companies, who have had least need of assistance. We are assatied by demands for ever-increasing government expenditure on oti search. It wtil be forthcoming, but with tight protection for proper returns to the Australian nation, without the fecklessness and foUy of our predecessors. The Petroleum and Minerals Authority wtil function efficiently by partnership and farm-out in the case of off-shore oti and gas exploration, and by partnership, equity holdings, loan and guarantee in the case of on-shore mineral explortion. The normal pattern operating in so many comparable countries will be observed by a partnership between the national Government providing natural resources and experienced explorers providing the risk capital, technology and expertise. In the case of small mining companies and syndicates which had discovered substantial mineral resources, and were unable to obtain Australian developmental finance, we were confronted with a situation where astute overseas investors were prepared to take over major interests in such deposits. There is a considerable number of such smaU companies and syndicates held up by the operation of the Companies (Foreign Takeovers) Act who will benefit mat- immediately by assistance from the Petroleum and Minerals Authority. Contrary to Opposition propaganda and distortion in successive debates on this Bill, foreign investors are not going to be frightened away merely because the Australian Government wishes to play a greater role in the exploration for, and development of, our resources. They Uve with much tougher conditions elsewhere in the world than Labor is estabhshing. The taxation concessions which became blatant tax ramps would have been terminated years ago in such countries. It has been asserted by the Opposition that pubUc funds will be placed at hazard in supporting irresponsible ventures. It conveniently forgets the discreditable minerals exploration boom of the late 1960s and early 1970s and its consequences. There is clear evidence that the design and intention of the Senate Opposition in relation to this Bill has been to seek every opportunity and pretext for delay. In debating this measure in both Houses there has been deUberate and persistent misinterpretation of its provisions. It has been suggested that property can be seized without compensation, that the interests of the States of Australia have been completely ignored, and that genuine assistance is not available to the smaller companies, despite the specific provisions of the Bill supplemented by the Lands Acquisition Act and the Australian Constitution. The legislation in relation to the States onshore minerals stands on the basic constitutional powers of the Australian Parliament to regulate overseas trade and interstate trade, and also, at appropriate times, the general powers for the defence of Australia. We are determined to ensure that the transition in the United States wtil not be repeated in Australia, under which major petroleum companies are announcing that they have broadened their activities and objectives to become major energy companies. A point has been reached in the United States where top oU companies own 53 per cent of United States coal production and, through a maze of subsidiaries, control nearly two-thirds of the commercial coal market. A sinular situation exists in relation to uranium. This Bill will be Australia's certain insurance policy against such a situation developing in Australia in respect of the petroleum and mineral resources which are the birth right of the Australian people. It is a matter for serious national concern that we are confronted with a situation such as now exists in relation to Australia's natural resources. We will present a barrier to further overseas exploitation. Companies which are here will get fair and reasonable treatment but, for the furture, the interests of the Australian people in preserving their birth right will come first.",59
93,Mr ANTHONY,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS,"We have just listened to the Minister for Minerals and Energy (Mr Connor) present the Government case for the establishment of a petroleum and minerals authority. He has presented it in the rosiest manner in which one could possibly present it. He has glossed over the real substance of this legislauon. One would think that there are no contentious issues in it whatsoever, but the facts are that proposed estabUshment of this new authority has put gloom into the mining and energy industries in Australia. Today there is no confidence at all in this area. The Minister talked in glib terms about Australian ownership. In referring to overseas ownership he has usedfigureswhich are not conect and which have been challenged previously. He has even usedfiguresfrom his own department showing that Austrahan ownership is not something Uke 38 per cent but is more Uke 64 per cent. He has talked about the need for greater Australian ownership. Everybody in this House would Uke to see a maximum Australian ownership. But it is not this legislation which give greater Australian ownership; it is legislauon which has been brought in by the Minister for Overseas Trade (Dr JF CAIRNS) in relation to the Australian Industry Development Corporauon which will facUitate the marshalling of funds to try to give a greater Australian participation and involvement in resources. It is just a cover-up to talk about greater Australian ownership by the use of this piece of legislation. The Opposition Parties strongly oppose this legislation. But before going into the substance of the legislation I say that when this Bill last came before the House of Representatives I said that there were grounds for grave doubt as to whether the passage of the Bill through the 2 Houses of Parliament conformed to section 57 of the Constitution to enable it to be a double dissolution issue. The Senate reaffirmed this point of view by taking a vote on an amendment that this Bill be not allowed to proceed. That amendment was defeated by an equal vote. But it shows that within the Senate there were very strong reservations as to whether this Bill should promining ceed. There has been litigation before the High Court. No doubt there will be further titigation. It is the view of the Opposition Parties that Bill should not be included with the other 5 Bills for the Joint Sitting of this Parliament. Not only does the Bill offend the poltiical beUefs of those on this side of the House but also it does not conform with our free enterprise principles and the spirit which is necessary to develop this country and especiaUy its mining resources. This is probably the worse piece of legislation that we have seen introduced into this Parliament. It has been conceived out of prejudice and it is motivated by the desire for more poltiical power. It conflicts withtiiesovereignrightsof the States and it confuses existing Commonwealth laws. Its legal drafting is shoddy and crude and it provides no legislative safeguards for people affected by the legislation or for the taxpayer. It is a monstrous piece of legislation. I appreciate the fact that the these proceedings are being shown on national television so that people might hear some of the facts relating to this legislation which they may not have been able to glean up to now from the biased reporting in many of the newspapers, particularly by socialist and left wing writers who believe that this is a sound piece of legislation. By bludgeoning through the Parliament such wide ranging powers, without consultation with the State governments or the industry, in a Bill with such wide ramifications the Government is making a sham of the democratic process. If this legislation passes through the Parliament by the will sheer weight of numbers, as no doubt it will, there is little doubt that there will be further titigation on it in the courts of this country. The Minister and his Government have launched and fostered a campaign to create the feeling that the mining and energy industries in Austraha are un-Australian and are not acting in the best interests of this nation. If people have listened to some of the speeches of members of the Government Party- I must say that the speech made today by the Minister for Minerals and Energy was one of the mildest he has made; he is generaUy spitting venom at foreign compames and multinational companies-the y wtil understand that there is a deUberate campaign going on in this nation to discredit the mining industry and to usher in this grand new Authority which is going to take over the development of mineral and energy resources in Australia and supposedly do it in a much more efficient manner than private enterprise has been able to. In all fairness, why does this Government not acknowledge the enormous contribution that the industry has made to this nation? Were it not for the enormous development of the mining industry during the last decade, Australia would this have had an economic recession when the rural industries collapsed because of drought and very low prices. The mining industry made up the gap. In the last decade it has created new towns in remote areas of Australia and has provided railways and roads. Much of this work has been done with the money of mining companies. It has created jobs for Australians and, as we see the employment situation become worse, I think we will find some moderation by this Government in criticising these great firms which are giving thousands of jobs to Australians, especially skilled Australians. It has been the greatest of decentraUsation that Australia has seen in the last 25 years. It is of enormous importance. Let nobody underestimate the dependence of this nation on the mining industry. Why has that industry succeeded? It has succeeded because people have been prepared to risk their capital searching for mineral and energy resources and developing them. People have had faith in this country and faith in themselves. They have been ready to work hard, to go to harsh areas and to work under difficult conditions. We owe a debt to the Australian mining industry and it should not be criticised and poisoned as Ministers of this Government have done. No doubt this Bill is designed to bring the industry into subjection to the Government and particularly to the Minister. The claim that we need an authority such as that which is proposed cannot be substantiated. The Australian Goverabeing ment and the State governments already have complete control and complete ownership of the natural resources of this countiy. No individual, firm or company, whether it be Australian or foreign owned, controls or owns the minerals and energy of this country. Governments the laws and lay down the rules. The Governbrought ment already has all the power it needs to conciples trol, to regulate and to direct the mining indusso tries of this country. Why is the Minister so anxious to have this new powerful authority? wants more and more control. He wants to be able to dominate the whole of the mining and energy situation in Australia. Never have we seen such far-reaching powers being given to Minister or such wide-ranging all-embracing powers being given to an authority as exists this legislation. Surely such powers and such highly contentious issues deserve a great deal more explanation from this Government than we have had up to date. Parliament and particularly the industry needs the courtesy of some explamay nation. The industry does not seem to be able get a pohcy out of the Government on so many issues related to energy, uranium and to the pipeUne system. The industry is just being stymied at the moment. The whole industry is being set back. The Petroleum and Minerals Authority Bill seeks to put the Government into the mining and energy business in a big and dangerous way. The Authority would not just advise, supervise, control and direct these industries but it would get right into the act itself. It could do this simply by taking over existing enterprises on whatever terms it thinks fit. If people are starting to form wonder what we mean when we talk about sociaUsm let them have a look at this piece of legislation. This sociaUst Government that we have in Australia at the moment is set upon giving aU power to this Authority so that it can control the industry, nationalise it and sociaUse it if it in so wishes. The Authority would not only advise the Government on policy, lay down rules and regulate and control the industry, but also it would explore, develop, extract, refine, transport and market minerals and energy in this country. The Authority would lay down the rules but it does not have to stick to them itself. It would put itself in a privileged position to make it difficult for private enterprise to be able to compete with it. Surely we have not come so near to being a sociaUst State that this Parliament can aUow this sort of monstrous proposal to be approved. We do not reject the concept of a commission able to regulate the industry and to advise the Government. In fact, a Senate committee set up in 1971 recommended that there ought to be a commission to use regulations where activities went across State borders and to be an independent authority advising the Government. But we make cannot accept the proposal that has been forward. This proposal offends the prinof democratic rights which we believe are precious to a democratic society, and mean so very much to the spirit and the Ufe of this counHe try. As I said earlier, the Authority would be empowered to take over existing enterprises on whatever terms it thoughtfit.There are no safeguards and there are no Umits written into this a legislation. The Authority need merely publish a notice in the Australian Government Gazette in naming any area of Australia and that area then becomes a declared area. The Authority could move in and carry out whatever activities it likes. It could take over mineral or petroleum assets or reserves which any individual or any company have against the will of the individual or to company. AU the individual or company would be sure of getting would be a royalty. There is no guarantee at all that compensation will be paid for the assets that have been confiscated. Is it little wonder that we arefightingso to stop this monstrous proposal? This is the kind of thing that is expected in a dictatorial State, in Australia. The Authority would simply overtely ride therightsof the States. Its activities are subject to any of the existing laws, including State Mining Acts-Act s which protect the landfor holder and people who have rnining licences leases. If the Minister tells the Authority to something and the Authority loses money on the deal, I wonder who wtil lose. Certainly it will be the Minister; it will be the poor old taxpayer. How many government enterprises make a the profit? Goodness me, when one looks at the which the Government has made of managing the country, one would hardly want to encourage the Government to move into the mining indusget try or the energy industry. I think even the Government's most avid and dogmatic supporters must be having a lot of doubts now about the Government's capacity to manage anything. There may have been some wisdom in amendmost ing this Bill to take out the obnoxious and undepetrol sirable aspects ofit. But come hell or high water, this Minister was not going to allow his Bill to interfered with. He has become a living legend the mining and energy industries. He is legendthat ary. He is a shadowyfigure.Few people in the mining and energy industries know him. Mr Katter-He throws a big shadow.",63
94,Mr ANTHONY,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS,"There is a lot of physical tries substance to him. But he is a shadowyfigureas far as anyone knowing him is concerned. He does not talk to people; he does not seem to want talk to people. His Department has no idea what is going on inside his mind. In fact, the officers his Department are in a state of dazed confusion. The Minister sits in his office and between bouts of mumblings about dreaded foreigners and pricious multi-national corporations he dreamsand he dreams some very expensive dreamsabout a national pipeline grid. While this is on the whole program for the search for oil in Austraha winds down to a very serious situation, and the niining industry gropes along bewilreasons dered and rather concerned. The trouble is that can. when the Minister says something he is generally wrong. Only last week he was trying to justify the pipeline going across to Palm Valley. He said there is 7 trillion or 8 trillion cubic feet of there. The Bureau of Mineral Resources has said that there is less than 2 trillion cubic feet there. Of course, what is frightening is not Minister's ignorance of these matters but the that many of these gigantic projects for which taxpayer wtil have to provide many millions of dollars, are based on the ignorant facts which hard Minister brings forward. He talks about the pipeline being extended from Palm Valley across not to the north west shelf where there is approxima18 trillion cubic feet of gas. But the company, not which is concerned with that project and which the has spent an enormous amount of money looking oti and gas, has had its resources approprior ated by this Government. The company cannot do sell its products to anybody but the Pipeline Authority. It has no idea when the Authority will not take its products or what quantity the Authority will need or what price the Authority will pay for products. This has been going on for the last mess 12 months, at a time when there has been a world energy crisis. If that company were given instructionsrightnow it would take it 6 years to the gas on-shore. This is the situation. The Minister has another idea about converting gas to petroleum. Goodness me, that would run into hundreds of millions of dollars. It is a inefficient process. He would get a drop of to meet our needs, but the gas would realise 3 or 4 times as much as could be obtained be for the petrol produced from it. The whole idea is in quite insane, but it shows theridiculousideas are coming forward. Can you imagine the Authority implementing these ideas with your money and saying that it is in the best interests of Australia? This Minister has done a great deal to harm the Austrahan mining and energy indusby his open hatred of free enterprise and his obsession about foreign companies. I am not frightened to stand up and say that foreign comto panies have done a great deal for the development of this country and that they will do a darof ned sight more than this Authority or this Minister will ever do. But as our oil reserves run down, as they are running down, and as we are almost cawholly dependent on Bass Strait, within a few years we will have only about 30 per cent self sufficiency in oil. This is a calamity and it is the going Australian consumer who will be hurt. We oppose this legislation because it is tainted with bureaucracy and it smells of socialism. For these we will continue tofightit wherever we",65
95,Dr JF CAIRNS,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS," I begin my contribution to this very important debate on the Petroleum and of gas Minerals Authority Bill by acknowledging the the work of the Minister for Minerals and Energy fact (Mr Connor) and of Mr T. M. Fitzgerald who the prepared a report on the contribution of the mineral industry to Australian welfare. It is true, as the the Leader of the Australian Country Party (Mr Anthony) has just said, that the Minister has come a living legend in the history of the trahan niining, industry because he represents turning point in the history of this nation against report. the sell-out of Australian resources, with which I The will deal in a few niinutes, to the statement of a such full and effective responsibility of the Australian exceptionally Parhament and the Australian people in relauon The to that mining industry. The extent of the sell-out of Australian thearesource resources to foreign companies has become vivto idly known. As it has become vividly known, I original point out that no one has played a more sigtax concessions nificant part in making it vividly known than has tiations the Minister himself. As it has become vividly situation known it has become resisted. Rejection of the ings sell-out of Australia is now almost umversal. All commercial sections of the community, all parties, except the mise Opposition parties in this Parliament, reject the same sell-out of Australia, and still the Leader of the tofinda Australian Country Party appears here as the representative of the international corporations. tive No one has done more, as I say, than the Ministralian ter has to awaken the people to their responsibilities, to their possibilities. No one has done than Mr Fitzgerald to discover the facts and prove the case. Mr Fitzgerald pointed out that the first economic task of any government is raise the standards and the welfare of the people, and particularly those sections of the people have been most disadvantaged. There are great and growing needs of the people for better housades ing, health, education and for the whole quality of life in which the modern city badly. These needs are so great and are growing at resources such a rate that they cannot be met from the prois ceeds of taxation on individuals, or from charges made in the public sector, or from charges made for health or education or housing. Indeed, of the needs for a better quality of hfe cannot charged for at all, and resistance to the further use of these methods-the paying for welfare and the welibeing of the people-as Mr Fitzgerald points out, have become as strong as the public desire for social improvement. Resistance to payenterprise, ing for social improvement has become as strong as the public desire for social improvement, and this is a dilemma that it is the responsibility this nation to solve. Hence the desire of people for social improvement is stifled by the ability the modern government and the modern econIn omy to supply it. Modern publicfinanceis no better to solve the problem of social companies, improvement than is the market. For Australia an exceptional opportunity for improving standards of welfare and welibeing of beour people did open out in the 1960s with this Ausgreat unsurge of mineral discoveries. Mr the Fitzgerald pointed out in a recent summary ofhis intrinsic quality of the newly discovered deposits of minerals as iron ore, coal and bauxite gave prospect of high income return in relauon to the costs of the usual factors of production, mainly labour and capital. superior profit would come from the contribution made by the resources itself to the value of the product, and since belonged to the people, they would be entitled proper share of the benefits. After the foreign-owned mineral enterprises, in particular, had fully recouped their investments, assisted in this by the generous income available, there would be ground for negoto obtain increasing Australian ownership and benefits from the further extensions of operating leases. The called for an ordinary business approach in deal with business enterprises. Mining companies, like other enterprises, seek as a matter of course to maxitheir profits. This is natural and inevitable and government authorities have to treat with the companies in the terms. To do so the State and nauonal authorities had common basis in pursuing objectives to their mutual advantage. The nature of the foundations laid in the formayears of the mineral revival would have effects on Auswelfare lasting for decades or (as it turned out) for generadons. more I agree with Mr Fitzgerald that what has been done up to now wtil have effects lasting for decades and, as it has turned out, for generations. to Common sense supports that conclusion. What has been done under the supervision of precedwho ing governments in this Parhament to our mineral resources will have effects lasting for decand probably for generations. Despite this vast wealth and even far greater potential, Mr has failed so Fitzgerald concluded: Apan from some regional benefit, which are . . . small in relation to the big values of high quality mineral being extracted and exponed, the mineral industry not contributing to the supreme task of raising welfare. The report summarised the position of the minerals industry infigureswhich have not since many been faulted, except in detail. The Deputy be Leader of the Country Party talked about the enormous contribution of the mining industry to Australia. Let me give some evidence of that contribution. He talked about the principle of free enterprise. Let me state the principles of free as they apply in the mining industry. He talked about the poor old taxpayer having to pay for this Authority which will be set up by the of proposed law which the Minister is now submitting to Parliament. Let me state what the mining of companies have done to the poor old taxpayer. the 6 years from 1967-68 to 1971-72 declared profits of principal mining and oil-producing before tax, were $2,072m. Between 1967-68 and 1971-72 the Australian Government received $286m of that sum in tax and royalties but in the same period it provided to the companies $34 lm in tax concessions, subsidies, bounties and Bureau of Mineral Resources than expenditures. Hence, although the companies contributed. made $2,072m profit, the Australian ment made a net contribution to them of $55m. It The Deputy Leader of the Country Party supnage representing ports that proposition. He talked about the poor reserves-an old taxpayer. During the same period the comits original panies paid $263m inroyaltiesto making contributions by them to all governThese ments in Australia of $208m from profits of having $2,072m, or less than 10 per cent. Who would million not want to pay less than 10 per cent in taxation?ous Who, except the principal mining compames with which made over $2,000m profit, has the privilege of paying less than 10 per cent in taxadon? They are the principles of private enterprise. In addition, before the profits of $2,072m were arrived at, a vast amount was charged against the revenues of the companies which would be inconceivable in any other industry or would inconceivable for mineral and mining companies in any other countiy. Mr Fitzgerald pointed out the precise position of one of these companies. foreign This is one of the principles of free enterprise. It ing is one of the great mining companies which have the done so much for this nation. Let me quote in of detati what Mr Fitzgerald wrote about one of of them: The paper presents a number of concrete examples process in acuon. Hamersley Holdings Ltd . . . It is no worse than any of the other mining comSo paniesabout 80 per cent foreign owned, is one of the major iron oregreaterThe miners in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. Among all ments ofproduction the iron ore projects this is the only one for which the stanpared with34 dard details of financial information (profits, taxation, capisix times asactual tal expenditures, etc.) are made ments and the people of Australia. It is the only one from which we get information.This What information do we get from that one? Fitzgerald continued: Since it commenced ore shipments in 1966 Hamersley has declared profits, before tax, amounting to more than It has paid less than $lm in income tax; the total $572,000. Think about the poor old taxpayers and the lugubrious speech that the Leader of the Country Party made. I thought that at any minute he would burst into tears over the taxpayers. Hamersley, out of that $264m, has paid tribute $572,000 in taxation. He said it was risk capital and spoke of the enormousrisksthat these comPetroleum panies take. Still referring to Hamersley this writer said: It has more than repaid through dividends all the share capital invested by the 2 overseas groups which promoted the enterprise. It already has paid by way of dividends more all the capital,riskcapital, that those groups If only we could have a Uttle more of Governthat risk. The writer continued: has shipped more than 116 million tons of ore, a tonmore than half of its original proved ore d about a quarter of the estimated reserves-in lease at Mt Tom Price. But Hamersley has been the States, granted funher leaseswere granted by preceding governmentsestimated ore reserves of much more than 5,000 tons. In fact, the company now designates a continuarea of some 20,000 square miles in north-west Australia as the 'Hamersley Iron Province', and has published maps that title. The Deputy Leader of the Country Party said that it is the Government which has power over this matter. Mr Lynch-The Leader of the Country Party.",65
96,Dr JF CAIRNS,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS,"Oh, he seems to me to be be much too young to be a leader. To me he is more Uke a boy scout. The author continued: So far from having been required to cede some of the equity in exchange for these great extensions of minrights over ore deposits which are among the very best in world, Hamersley has rather been able, on the strength these assurances of reserves, to demand and get premiums about 500 per cent in selling thin slices of the equity to Australian investors. The amount of money subscribed in these premium share issues has been nearly twice as much as the original-and unchanged-shar e capital subscribed by of the the 2 foreign promoters of Hamersley . . . that is risk capital for you. This article continues: extensions of orereserveshave spurred Hamersley to and export of the ore. Its planned shipmillion tons in the present calendar year, comexports of 27.7 million tons in 1973, will be much as the originally programmed rate of proavailable to the governduction. illustrates the so-caUed depressed rnining Mr industry to honourable members and honourable senators, the terribly depressed mining industry for which the Leader of the Country $264m. Party almost burst into tears. The Australian figure is Government considers that the position of the mining and minerals industry in Australia, as established under preceding governments, is intolerable. I think that the great majority of the Australian people agree with us. This Government is concerned that the industry should conmore to the Australian people than it does and it is convinced that something Uke the and Minerals Authority for which this Btil provides is necessary for that purpose. No Australian government ever has had a clearer mandate for its legislation than this Government has for this Petroleum and Minerals Authority Btil. The Leader of the Country Party, in that colourful but strikingly inaccurate manner that he has, spoke about the sheer weight of numbers in this place. That is another way of describing the decision of the nauonal Parhament. When the nauonal Parhament makes a decision it is through the sheer weight of numbers. This Bill has been twice passed through this House and has been stopped twice by a majority in the Senate acting against the decision of the House of Representatives, where the Government is formed. On top of that, the Leader of the Country Party and his lugubrious friends decided that they would force a double dissolution, thoroughly confident that they would come back here and be able to get their hands into the Treasury. But, no, they lost. No doubt they were surprised. Having again achieved a mandate we are now engaged in this first historic sitting of this Joint Parliament and honourable senators and honourable members are to be asked to vote on this Bill. That is described as blugeoning legislation through this Parliament by the sheer weight of numbers but it is an example of the democratic process working more thoroughly and at greater length than I think it has ever done in this nation. No Australian Government has ever had a clearer mandate for its legislation than this Government has had for the Petroleum and Minerals Authority Bill. I would think that nine out of ten citizens of this nation are convinced that the hand of the national Government has to be strengthened to preserve for them some share in the vast mineral resources of this nation. The Authority has a number of tasks to perform. Firstly, it will expand the search for, and facilitate the development of the nation's resources of hydrocarbons, especially crude oil, and natural gas and the integration of the use of the hydrocarbons including coal. Secondly, the Petroleum and Minerals Authority will operate itself as an organisation owned by the people and charged to aa first, and at alltimes,in the interests of people. Do we not need in this nation some organisation owned by the people and charged to aa first and at alltimesin the interests of the people? Thirdly, the Petroleum and Minerals Authority will operate in partnership with technologically qualified private enterprise, both foreign and Australian, to ensure that not only the best technological and environmental methods are used, but also to maintain both Austrahan ownership and public interest and responsibility at the highest level. Do we not need to raise these things in this nation to a higher level? The Petroleum and Minerals Authority will not be operating in some dectining and unprofitable field, into which public enterprise is normally allowed to function, but it will take a leading part in safeguarding and developing the vast mineral wealth of Australia, as the heritage of the people, and as one of the main sources of the welfare of the people for many generations. Recently the Minister for Minerals and Energy spoke about the future in the case of the vast undiscovered resources of the North West Shelf. The policy of all previous Australian governments was to allow one company to take up permits under its own power and control and responsible to nobody and, when it could not itself explore the resources, to farm out to other companies under its control. That is going to be changed. The company grantedrightsby previous governments will have itsrightsproperly protected and preserved but it will not have rights over the future of this nation. The Australian Labor Party Government refused to continue this abdication of the people'srightsto private, mostly foreign, companies. Of this Australian willingness to give away the nation's resources, a leading Liberal, the Victorian Premier, Mr Hamer, recently said: We will never see the day again when there is foreign investment in any part of Austraha on an unrestricted basis. Then he went on: As far as the Federal Government is concerned, they have indicated that their policy in the energy field is 100 per cent Australian ownership. That indicates it is unikely they would permit the imponation of foreign capital to exploit energy resources anywhere in Australia. That's that! We would not want it any different either. That was said by the Liberal Party Premier of Victoria. We may never again see unrestricted foreign investment in Austraha or less than 100 per cent Australian ownership in the energy field and, if that is so, it will alone be because of the Whitlam Labor Government. The Victorian Liberal Premier is realistic enough to know that even Liberals cannot any longer allow foreign corporthe ations to plunder Australian resources, almost without paying taxes, as I have shown, but die Federal Opposition is not realistic enough for that. The Federal Opposition would allow the plunder to go on. It still argues that unless taxless plunder is allowed to foreign corporations as a right, there will be no exploration or recovery. It still believes that it can sell out Australia behind this odious abdication of Australian rights. But this Bill alone is not enough. Unless there is a Labor Government to stand behind the Authority this Bill creates, the Authority will be diverted from its purpose. The continued existence of a Labor Government is essential if Australia's resources are to be fairly used in the interests of the Australian people. The Minister for Minerals and Energy and the Labor Government of Australia have held the pass against the sell out of Australia. While this may rank as the greatest single achievement of the Government, this pass is only held. Only Labor governments in Australia can ensure the doors will not be opened again to the sell-out of the nation. Only Labor can ensure that our nauonal wealth is used for the welfare of the people and not for the enrichment ofjust a few.",67
97,Mr LYNCH,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS,"This by Petroleum and Minerals Authority Bill was Cairns). introduced by a Minister whose arrogance and ineptitude has placed Australia's minerals and energy development at risk. In the words of the 'Australian Financial Review', Mr Connor precurate fers depotism to rationality and instinct to reason. He has preferred confrontation to cofare. operation, prejudice to objectivity, secrecy to open government and ideology to economic judgment. As the Leader of Ausualian Country Party (Mr Anthony) has so well evidenced durtotaUy ing the course of this debate, he is a Minister has presided over the virtual destruction of oil search program throughout Australia. At time when there is a world-wide oti shortage, exploration has slumped to its slowest level in years. At a time when productivity increases real economic growth are essential, forward investment plans are being severely simply abandoned. At a time when Australian mineral and oti companies are seeking funds for expansion they are virtually prohibited from rowing overseas-the only exception being the Australian Industry Development Corporauon. At a time when confidence in Ausualian the industry is so essential the Minister for Minerals and Energy has raised doubts and confusion export contracts, mineral leases, farm-in arrangements and a range of other vital industry considerations. This Minister, described House throughout the industry with what I believe to compelling accuracy as the Wollongong the strangler, is pursuing an unrelenting campaign of hostility towards Australian exploration panies. He has promoted Labor's inane propaownership ganda which seeks to make the so-called multiand nationals scapegoats for the Government's monumental failures. What intelligent Auswhich tralian or overseas businessman would look Australia for future investment in the face of this irrational and manic hostility? Is it any wonder that more than 100 companies withdrew from the industry last year and sinular numbers are leaving this year? Is it any wonder that Ausualian and overseas firms are now directing their investment towards Indonesia and Brazil? This legislation reflects this Minister's and this Government's authoritarianism. It demonstrates once again Labor's preference for grandiose State symbols and ineffectual coercion rather than efficient poUcies of co-operation that are directed towards this country's national economic progress. Before I deal with the Bill which is before the Joint Sitting, I give the Ue at the outset to the gross misrepresentations which have been made the Minister for Overseas Trade (Dr. J. F. I confess to a considerable degree of surprise that the Minister should place such weight on what I believe to be the now discredited Fitzgerald report. That report is neither a Ml nor acassessment of the contribution made by the mining industry to Australia's economic welIt is based on only a smaU, biased sample of a few large companies. The only benefit included in the calculations is Commonwealth tax revenue. State and local government revenue are excluded. Mining royalties- a significant who and unique contribution made by the mining the industry to public revenue-ar e specifically a excluded. The report compares taxation paid by oUa selected group of compames to concessions 11 granted to the industry as a whole. No allowance and is made fbr the sizeable balance of payments benefit that the mining industry has provided for curtailed or the Australian economy. The mining industry has made an overborwhelmingly important contribution to Australian economic growth and stabUity. This report upon which the Minister for Overseas Trade places such importance takes a narrow, myopic view of industry's contribution to Ausualian welfare. The report lacks relevance and appUcation in the over wider context of Australian development. I turn secondly, in terms of the overseas investment proposition so loosely put down in the by the Minister for Overseas Trade (Dr. J. be F. Cairns), and to his total misrepresentation of policies of the alternative government of this country. I make it perfectly clear that the Liberal comand Country Parties believe in the maximum and control of Australia's resources industries. I believe that we have the only own effective, comprehensive and sound program would, in fact, attain that ideal. Our pohcy at is not one advanced with the xenophobia and jingoism, such as that which we have heard from the Minister for Overseas Trade, who seeks to condemn overseas participation as harmful and unnecessary. We know that in this chamber the Minister has been playing very much to the left wing of the Austrahan Labor Party. No doubt he is seeking to position himself for the office of Prime Minister of this country. Significantly, when the Minister spoke it was one of the few occasions during debates in the last few days when there has been an almost full attendance of members of the Government Party. Of course, what he said in his attack on the multi-nationals and overseas investment was designed for narrow political advantage. What are the real issues if we want to put the credibUity of the Government Party at stake on this issue which is so basic and fundamental to all Australians everywhere? What are the facts? This Government, although it has attacked overseas interests, has not implemented any additional controls. It has not laid down any effective guideUnes for foreign investment. It has not re-examined the taxation legislauon. It has not toughened up the legislauon protecting Australian companies from overseas takeovers. Its only policy initiative, the once 33A per cent no interest deposit requirement on overseas borrowings, and more recently the 25 per cent deposit requirement which now, according to a Treasury bulletin released about one hour ago, is down to 5 per cent, has limited the borrowing capacity of Australian owned businesses to a much greater degree than it has overseas owned companies. Where, therefore, is the Government's creditution, bUity? This is simply the line of a Government icy. Companies which seeks narrow poltiical advantage. no concern for the national interest and no conof exploitation; for themining cern for the tremendous contribution that these and for the degree to which industries have made to Australian economic refined. All these decisions are development. The Government is prepared to petence of the Government to lay risk our development by seeking, in a narrow ton of metal, ore, petroleum or petroleum and dogmatic way, to enact a policy which could not possibly attain the loose ideal that the Government alleges is its aim. This Bill, according to what the Minister would have us believe, already seeks to facilitate maximum Australian ownergovernment ship and control of Australia's petroleum and misused so many mineral resources. In more precise terms, what the Bill seeks to do is to achieve maximum tralian Government ownership and control. Quite frankly, this legislation is a very subtle deceptive fiat for the progressive nationaUsation of Australian minerals and energy industries The development of a national minerals and energy policy has very profound and far reachBtil, ing impUcations for all of us. In the long run, development of the Australian petroleum and mineral industries will lead to major struaural changes within the Australian economy. That process of change is well under way. The legislation is of vital importance to the nature of that change and its wider impUcations should be fuUy understood. In the development of the Australian minerals and energy poticy all available options should be assessed in terms of their practical appUcation. But in a country with a democratic system of government-althoug h one has some doubt about this when one has regard to Government poUcies-this can be achieved only through the recognised process of extensive consultation with the industries involved. It is conspicuous that this consultation has not taken place under a government which, prior to the election, preached the virtues of consultation but which in government has been subject to an apparent manic preoccupation with confrontation to a divisive extent. The purpose of this Bill, as set out by the Minister, is 'the comprehensive development of government control of Australia's mineral resources, with emphasis on the need for disl covery of new deposits and direct Commonwealth and State participation in oU and mineral search and exploitation throughout Australia's land and off-shore territories'. That statement of purpose must be challenged immediately on 3 basic grounds. The first is the use of the Authority to extend government conuol of Australian resources. Under the export power of the Constiand the Commonwealth already has complete absolute power to control and regulate polrequire approval for the exploiThere is tation of a particular right;for the terms rate of mineral extraction; that mineral can be within the comdown. Not one gas can be exported from Australia without Government approval. Clearly, then, the Government a has effective conuol. There is no need for further extension of power, particularly to a which so clearly has abused and of the powers which are availAusable to it at the present time. and The second fundamental objection to the Minister 's expressed purpose is a misleading reference to participation in oil and mineral search by the Australian States. It is manifestly clear, even from the most cursory reading of the that one of its particular purposes is to seek the to override States'rightsof participation in the oti and mineral industry. We on this side of the chamber recognise this as a serious precedent that would erode the principle of States'rightsin Australia. This Bill and this Government gard State mining legislation and the existing rights under that legislation. The Bill seeks centralise mineral rights under the Commonthan wealth and ultimately to exclude the States from this field ofjurisdiction altogether. The third basic objection to the expressed pose of the Bill is that direct government pation in oil or rnineral exploration and exploipetroleum tation cannot be justified on any simple ground of necessity or efficiency. If fact, if this Bill were passed in its present form it would discourage local Australian compames from expanding their operations and new compames from entering the industry. It would polarise the industry and rigidly channel prospects for exploration and production to those companies already in operwealth ation in the industry. Let us be frank about the propositions before us. Direct government interlackeys vention in minerals activities will not stimulate Australian commercial participation on a partGallery nership basis. In fact, it will be positively harmful in its effects. I only wish that time would the opportunity to elaborate this point in entirety. Let me close my remarks by saying this: What are the facts concerning oil discoveries at the present time? Unless more oil discoveries at least equal to the Bass Straitfieldin both quantity quality are made, by 1980 Austraha will be procompanies. ducing only 30 per cent of its petroleum requirements, as against a current 70 per cent, and by 1990 that fraction will be down to only per cent. In fact, it is estimated that on present reserves this country will have a shortage billion barrels of oil between now and the end the century. Australia will be held to ransom in proposed the international oil market and economic independence will be forfeited in the foreign interests which they consequence. Imported inflation now a concern, will be totally beyond Australian fiscal gather technical and entrepreneurialthe and monetary control. This Bill represents a serious threat to Australia's economic and social the advancement both in its own implications and as lines a direct consequence of the precedent which it aviation? would establish. The Opposition has rejected this Banking Corporation Bill on successive occasions. We do so again.",69
98,Mr KEATING,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS," Mr Acting Chairman, I have listened on four occasions now to members of the Opposition harangue the Government and particularly offend the Minister for Minerals and Energy (Mr Connor). He is the one person that has turned back the tide on this question of minerals and energy to allow Ausations. trahans to keep their foot on their own heritage which has been slipping away slowly under succarbons; cessive Liberal-Country Party governments. disrethe Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lynch) comes in again, sounding more like a to third-rate businessman addressing an Apex Club the Deputy Leader of a major party addressing the national Parliament of Australia. This Btil which has raised so much opposition purfrom the Liberal and Country Parties is designed particiso that we may explore and develop the and mineral resources in Australia and to permit the maximum ownership and control of Australia's natural resources. What it will mean in fact is that future generations of Australians will be able to preserve the national wealth and heritage which rightfully belongs to them. Ours is the one country that has never done anything positive about preserving our national or having an organisation able to do it. I have listened so often in the Senate to those of foreign interests, Senator Durack and Senator Webster. I have sat in the President's over there unable to say anything about it as they came into their House with the briefs allow handed to them by the foreign mining comits panies. They should be ashamed to show their faces as members of the Australian Parliament. They are on the wave length of only one group in this community-the Australian Mining Industry Council which is 85 per cent foreign controlled and because 69 of the 93 companies in it are foreign It is the one group in Australia to which the Liberal and Country Parties are attuned. Even the Australian Petroleum Explo10 ration Authority has deserted it and this week has said it will support the Australian Governof 8 ment in getting this proposal through. of The Opposition members are critical of this to that extent its one reasonPetroleum and one and Minerals Authority for reason only: It will damage support. Who marginal would deny this public corporation right to expertise in most fieldsof minerals and energy for the public benefit? Who would deny Trans-Australia Airor Qantas Airways Limited their roles in Who would deny the Commonwealth its right as a statutory banking corporation in Australia? Who would deny the Petroleum and Minerals Authority its rightful role as a statutory corporation in mining and exploration of Australia's rnineral wealth? No one should deny it-leas t of all members of the Australian Parliament One does not have to look very far tofindparallels to these corporItaly has its ENI, which is primarily concerned with the pursuit and production of hydroBritain has its BP; and the Minister for Yet Minerals and Energy mentioned in his speech many other countries which have organisations similar to this Petroleum and Minerals Authority. The Opposition talks about the public expenditure which this Authority will use in so-called risk ventures. When he first introduced the Bill the Minister said the Authority would be financed from moneys saved under sections 77C, 77D and 78 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, which were repealed last year by this Government. The Government has been expending $47m a year on this hopeless concession. This is the way this Authority will be financed. If the Liberal and Country Parties want to talk about what the foreign compames and the mining companies have done for us in Australia, I invite them to look at the report from the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange-the Rae Committee report. The Chairman, Senator Rae, is one of their members. If honourable members read that chapter of the report dealing with Minerals Securities Australia Ltd they will find that section 77C, the section which is supposedly supporting mining in this country and giving an impetus to exploration, was used for a very shabby purpose-for speculation in stocks purchased and operated by Minerals Securities Australia Ltd and as a tax evasion technique to increase the asset value of that company. I have in front of me an extract from the Rae Committee's report. It shows that in 1966 Mineral Securities made a profit of $161,000 and paid no tax. It was able to claim the whole profit as a duction because under section 77 moneys subscribed to new mining issues are completely tax deductible. It moved its profit across into a completely new company which it had formed, received a deduction for it and paid no tax. In 1967 it made a profit of $1,584,000 and aid no tax. The next year it made a profit of 1,423,000 and paid no tax. The next year it made a profit of $12,707,000 and paid $61,000 in tax; that is all the tax it paid on a profit of $ 12.7m. There was a cumulative effect. As it made further profits it had to put money into another company to get the deduction. How was it able to get its own capital out? It invested in shares at $1 each, speculated on the market, manipulated the market, got the shares up to $5 or $6 each and then sold out. In that way it was able to tear out its capital and have 60 per cent the company-5 0 per centfinancedby deductake tions under section 77 and 10 per cent financed by the Australian public through share and maryears ket speculation. When the market finally colOf lapsed its game collapsed. But all in all it raked $ 15.8m of the $47m per annum concession under section 77. That is just one case which is referred to in the Rae Committee's report. That was happening across the board. Mr Fitzgerald pointed out in his report that only 27 per cent of the section 77 deductions was going to genuine, legitimate mining search. That is what the Opposition's Committee found. The Opposition cannot dispute thosefigures.It cannot say that the Fitzgerald report was a rort. Mr Ian Robinson-Who is Mr Fitzgerald?",71
99,Mr KEATING,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS,"I will tell the honourable member for Cowper who Mr Fitzgerald is. The Fitzgerald report is the most significant report to have been presented to this Parliament in the last 3 years. He is a respected economic journalist. He was commissioned by the Minister for Minerals and Energy in the early part of this year to inquire into the benefit derived by Australia from the niining industry. It happened that, unbeknown to the Government, the report was ready when the last election came on. The Opposition tried to can it on the basis that it was a political stunt. It is the most devastating document ever to be presented to the Australian Parliament. The Deputy Prime Minister (Dr JF CAIRNS) referred to it today. Talking specifically about Hamersley Holdings Ltd-the famous iron ore developer in Western Australia-h e was able to show conclusively that the tax payable by such companies is payable at a very minimum. In fact, ntining companies in Australia enjoy the very honoured distinction of being able to write off not only capital de- equipment as a depreciation but also the infrastructure of towns and buildings. So the towns which they have built and of which the Opposition speaks have all been a complete tax deduction. Against all its profits for thefirst6 years of its operations Hamersley wrote off every deduction that it had. The Western Australian Government kept increasing the ore body that Hamersley had. Every time that it asked for an extension of its lease it was granted additional areas. Which of the world's major trading banks would not lend money to a company which had an estabhshed mining operation and which was getting new mineral leases that were proved to have the best grade of iron ore in the world? Of course it was just a joke The Deputy Prime Minister told the House that of the $ 1,132m in declared profits of mining of companies in the 4 years from 1967 to 1971 the to the Government of Australia was minus $40m; in other words, we paid out $40m in 4 to let the mining companies earn $1,132m. that amount 80 per cent was repatriated overseas. So we had the ludicrous position where the previous Liberal-Country Party Government was allowing the Australian tax laws to be used to subsidise profit that was ultimately payable to foreigners. That is what honourable members and senators opposite did when they were in government; yet they have the hide to call themselves Australians and to ridicule the Minister for Minerals and Energy. They ought to be on their knees and thankful for having a man of his competence in this place. Let us talk about the Opposition's approach to things. It says that the Petroleum ana Minerals Authority Bill is a piece of sociaUst legislation. will admit that the Authority is not there to compete with private enterprise. It is there to look after the national interests of Australia. We will go into partnership with private enterprise. sume that the Authority will do that in the national interests. The Opposition has said that Australians are incapable of making investment decisions. I will tell the House something about the famous Hamerlsey deal. When Hamersley was first conceived by Lang Hancock- I give him credit for recognising a decent investment potential-and he approached the Liberal-Country Party Government of Australia, it closed the door in his face. He went to the Australian trading banks and they closed the door in his face. FinaUy, the only people he could interest in this enormous project in the Pilbara was the Kaiser Steel Corporation of the United States of America and Riotinto Zinc Corporation of the United Kingdom. Their original and only investment in Hamersley, which is now capitalised at $672m, was $45m. Their original loan was for $80m from the banks in the City of London. To show the magnitude of that investment I point out that the Commonwealth Employees Superannuation Fund invests $45m every year. Members of the Opposition have spoken about the massive PUbara developments. It involved $22.5m from each company. Are members of the Opposition saying that Australians cannot recognise a decent investment decision? Are they saying that Australians cannot raise money on the Australian capital market? They ought to be ashamed of themselves because what they are saying is that only foreigners are able to make decent investment decisions and that is not so. I will tell the House a little more about Hamersley. Of the $674m raised by Hamersley $550m was raised on the Australian capital market. The Australian public is the largest saving public in the world. Australians have the record of being the greatest savers in the world. Any of the statistics which are avaUable will substantiate that. We have enough capital in this nation tofinanceany sizable national investment project. What this Petroleum and Minerals Authority wtil do is guard decent prospects for Australian companies. When the areas of the north west shelf are returned to the people of Australia under the agreement they wtil come back to the Petroleum and Minerals Authority which wtil enter into joint ventures with decent companieswhether they be Australian or overseas-to make sure that the benefit comes back to the people of Australia. To that extent the Petroleum and MinI erals Authority will be a regulatory body but it wtil gather its own geological expertise, its own entrepreneurial expertise and we will be able to deal with any of the major energy companies of I pre- the world because we wtil have a body competent to do so. I do not sUght the Department of Minerals and Energy or the Bureau of Mineral Resources, but they were not designed or equipped to handle this particular job. We need an authority, like the Petroleum and Minerals Authority, to do it. Through this Authority we will be capable of identifying good investments, of encouraging Australians to take part, and of guaranteeing loans for them and getting genuine Australian investors interested in what are genuine national development projects. That is something that the Opposition never did when it was in government. We have often heard the Leader of the Australian Country Party (Mr Anthony) and the former Prime Minister, the honourable member for Lowe (Mr MCMahon) say how we are scaring foreign capital and pushing all the mining companies away. I ask them to answer this question: If a company is able to recover its initial costs of setting up a mine and a development as a complete tax deduction against its immediate profits-it sets up its operation from nothingand it has an enormous ore body lasting, at the same rate at which Hamersley wtil extract ore, for 175 years, do they not think that that is a better investment than any manufacturing industry or any tertiary industry in the world? The company has its operation costs covered. It has a massive ore body and it has an increment every year in the price of its product. It will reap a return of thousands upon thousands of per cent from the investment. This Government wtil say- I hope the Petroleum and Minerals Authority and the future governments of Australia will say-'Thu s far and no further. You have made enough. We wtil not let you rape and plunder our country. We want what is rightfuly avaUable to the people of this nation and to future generations of Australians. We want our rightful slice of the cake. And we will get it.' are not going to be put off any more by these arguments that foreigners alone should invest in Australia. The Opposition referred to the original investment of $45 m m Hamersley and to massive capital raisings. The Esso-BHP group raised two-thirds of its capital on the Australian capital ket. And what have we paid for? Where is the rip-off there? The rip-off is there for the group's so-called expertise. The Petroleum and Minerals Authority will be able to employ whom it Ukes. We can buy the best geologists in the world; we can buy the best mining engineers in the world; we can buy the best reservoir engineers in the world and we can buy the expertise we Uke. We do not have to pay for it.",72
100,Unknown,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS,Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m.,74
101,Mr KEATING,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS,"Before the suspension of the sitting I was speaking on the Petroleum and Minerals Authority Bill which is a Bill designed plore for and to develop Australia's petroleum and mineral resources. During my remarks I referred to the Rae and Fitzgerald reports which dealt with minerals and petroleum in Australia. I did so much to the chagrin of members of the Opposiuon. The establishment of the Petroleum and Minerals Authority is not a singular policy of this Government. It is part of a package which was developed by the Minister for Minerals and Energy as part of a total energy budget and program for the development of the minerals and petroleum industry in Australia. The Government has been consistent in the policy approaches that it has taken. In the case natural gas we have instituted since we have been in office a national pipeline grid which will supply people across the nation. We have introduced a Seas and Submerged Lands Bill to guarantee the sovereignty of the national Government of Australia over the offshore areas of Australia for the benefit of all Australians; put a policy for the offshore development of our petroleum resources where it fairly belongs-in the national Parliament and not on the parliaments of the States. We have developed and are developing a uranium policy to guarantee the proper development of uranium in this country. Already the Minister has been vindicated in his statements that previous contracts were signed at below what were world parity prices. In the 18 months that we have been in office we as a Government have seen the price of uranium doubled and the contracts that were written and haUed by the Opposition as being of great achievement in 1972 look rather puny against We the prices which are being paid on the world market today. In the field of minerals the Minister has gained major increases in the price of iron ore. Through his government to government relations we have gained an 18 per cent increase in the price of iron ore to compensate for the revaluation of the Ausmartrahan dollar relative to the American doUar. The Minister again has set the climate for Australian negotiators representing Australian iron ore companies to go to Japan next month to seek further price increases. Since this Government has come to office the Minister has increased dramaticaUy the price of coal. Australia is now securing world parity prices for coal where 18 months ago we were about 25 per cent below what was avaUable in the world. We have proper relations with Japan, our major trading partner, on a government to government basis as wUling sellers to wUling buyers. The previous Liberal-Countr y Party to ex- governments had our iron ore and coal producers stringing along to Japan one after the other and being picked off and played off against each other. The Minister has now taught these producers to barter on a negotiated basis. He has taught them what collective strength means. The Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam), the Minister for Minerals and Energy and other senior Ministers went to Japan last year and paved the way for a better relationship with our major trading partner. Of course, the people who are most upset are members of the Australian Country Party, the people who are most interested in the pork barof rel; the people who claim to speak for rural industries but really want to represent the wealthy foreign owned mining companies in Australia. Very shortly we will see Doug Anthony House next to John MCEwen House if the Australian people are foolish enough to let the Liberal and Countiy Parties have another to crack at the title. We are interested in the wealth and well being of the Australian community, not the sectional interests of an agrarian rump-the Country Party-whic h will sell out to any interest to meet its own shabby poltiical purposes. The Leader of the Country Party (Mr Anthony) during the last election talked about an increase of $6 a barrel in the price of oti in this country. He is now called 'double price Doug'. He wants to send the price of oti up by another $6 a barrel. Such a move would increase the take to the Ukes of Esso-BHP which made a profit in petroleum of over $43m last year, to a profit of $966m a year in oti. That is what the Country Party proposed; that is what they were prepared to force upon the Australian consumer and the Austhe tralian motorist. May I conclude ing the Minister for Minerals and Energy foresight in introducing what is a most far reaching and worthwhile piece of legislation. been the exclusive architect of the Labor minerals and energy policy.",74

Evidence was given to that perCommittee under the privilege of Parliament and companies were required to produce truthful evidence. I quoted faithfully from the evidence in the report to substantiate the arguments for and the relevance of the Petroleum and Minerals Bill.

118,The CHAIRMAN,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS,Order ! No debate is alin a personal explanation.,75
119,Senator DURACK,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS,"Western Australia) r Chairman, as the first senator to take in this debate I wish to register a very strong the protest on behalf of the Opposition at the fact this Bill comes before the Joint Sitting at all, of or that it was ever used as a ground to justify seeking the double dissolution of this Parhament. When the Minister for Minerals and Energy, Mr Connor, introduced the debate on this Bill this afternoon he gave the legislative history of the measure. He presented the facts as they were: That the Bill was rejected for the first time by the Senate on 2 April 1974, passed again by the House of Representatives on 8 April 1974, and rejected again by the Senate on 10 April 1974. We see that there was a passage of only 6 days between the rejection of the Bill for the first time by the Senate and its reintroduction in the House of Representatives. As we all know by now, under section 57 of the Constitution 3 months must elapse after the Senate'sfirstrejection or failure to pass a Bill before it can be menced again in the House of Representatives. But the facts are that this Bill was reintroduced the House of Representatives only 6 days-in fact 3 sitting days-afte r thefirstrejection by the Senate. If 3 days can be 3 months, then under this Government the Constitution under which we operate is really in jeopardy. But I suppose that that is the sort of arithmetic we have come to expect from the Minister for Minerals and Energy. He is a slow learner. The Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) promised several weeks ago to table the advice that he and his Attorney-General (Senator Murphy) gave to the Governor General that this Btil had failed to pass the Senate or had been rejected by it within the constitutional provisions. That advice clearly has been flouted by the very statement made here this afternoon by the Minister for Minerals and Energy. The Prime Minister has changed his mind and m fact has refused to table that advice. We on this side of the chamber maintain with the greatest vigour at our disposal that that advice to the Governor General was wrong when it was given as a basis for the double dissolution and it was wrong again when it was given as a basis for the Joint Sitting of the 2 Houses of Parliament. The Petroleum and Minerals Authority Bill comes before the Joint Sitting at the specific direction of the Governor General, and that is why we are taking part in this debate. But no participation in this debate by the Opposition is any admission that the Bill is properly before the Joint Sitting. The Minister said, furthermore, that this Btil comes before the Joint Sitting with some specific mandate from the electors of Australia. He said that it had been passed on all these occasions the House of Representatives and had been spend rejected by the Senate-as indeed it was rejected again by the Senate after the election, and very good reason. Whatever the result of the election on 18 May, whatever small majority the Government has in the House of Representatives after that election, it does not have the numbers in the Senate. The Government did not gain a majority in the Senate. It did not receive any so called mandate in the Senate on 18 May. As long as that position remains, as long as we of the Opposition have the authority from the people of Australia that we obtained on 18 May, we will take the stand that we have taken on this and other Bills and we will take that stand on other Bills in accordance with our principles and our philosophies. This afternoon a very interesting speech was commade on this Bill by no less a person than the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia (Dr. J. F. in Cairns). He spent most of his time regurgitating the tired old Fitzgerald report which was conjured by the Minister for Minerals and Energy and leaked out to the Press in dribs and drabs at the beginning of the last election campaign. In relation to the Fitzgerald report the Deputy Prime Minister said something which I thought was an interesting revelation of the socialist obsessions with private compames and niining companies. It was also an interesting revelation of the ignorance of those who want to govern this nation from a centralised bureaucracy in Canberra. He said that so powerful was the Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd-h e spent a lot of time analysing its financial transactions-that the Hamersley iron ore province in Western Australia was named after the company. The Hamersley iron ore province is the great iron ore province of Australia extending over many square miles of the Pilbara region of Western Australia throughout the Hamersley Ranges. The Hamersley iron ore province takes its name from the Hamersley Ranges, in which and through which there are vast quantities of iron ore explored for and developed by tremendous private investment, encouraged by Liberal governments in the past. Hamersley Iron Pty Ltd gets its name because it was thefirstcompany to operate in that region. It certainly is not fact that the region was named after the company but the complete reverse. That is a clear revelation of the socialist obsessions and the ignorance of centralised flunking in Canberra. I turn briefly to the Bill in the short time that is available to me. This Bill is presented by the Minister for Minerals and Energy and supported by by the Government for 3 purposes: Firstly, to funds on the exploration for oil in the offshore areas of Australia; secondly, to develop, with the Government says, the on-shore mineral resources in Australia-no t just energy resources but rninerals generally; and thirdly, to assist many small Austrahan mineral ventures. It do all these things, so it is claimed by the Miniswhatsoever ter, by recycling savings resulting from the withthey drawal of tax concessions by this Government about 12 months ago. The capital available for all these great endeavours-for the exploration Petroleum for oil, for the development of and the assistance of Australian mining companies-wil l come from these savings, which will amount to $50m or $60m a year. That is what the tiated Petroleum and Minerals Authority will have that this country's available- a miniscule sum of money. If we are rounding offshoremineral ever to bridge the ever-widening gap between our oil resources and our oil needs within the next 10 years off-shore oti exploration alone will the require at least $200m a year and probably needrate $300m. But this Government beUeves that a sum of $50m or $60m a year will be sufficient not only to explore for oil but also to engage in all the other activities involved in mingives eral exploration throughout the nation and to State assist Australian mining ventures. The honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), who spoke ahead of me, must be living in a complete dream world with his conception of what the Petroleum and Minerals Authority can do. What is this Authority? It will be comprised of 5 persons- a chairman, an execuThese tive director, the Secretary of the Department Minerals and Energy and 2 others, one of whom, under Government policy, will be a trade unionboards ist. All minerals exploration, mineral developLondon, ment and all the other activities smelting and trading in minerals will be under the control and domination of a body of 5 people- a centralised bureaucracy in Canberra consisting of 5 people, two of whom wtil be civil servants and one a trade unionist. Senator Greenwood- Mr Mundey?",75
120,Senator DURACK,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS,"Mr Mundey maybe. This is the Government's mining policy. This is the Government's solution to the problems of the alty great mining industry of Australia. AU these problems wtil be solved by $50m administered by 5 people, three of whom have no knowledge or experience and are not Ukely to gain any knowledge or experience of the great mining industry with its technical and capital requirementsI am sorry that I cannot pursue further the extraordinary powers which will be given to this Authority but I am glad that they have been covered by speakers earUer in this debate. In concluding I content myself with saying that years ago the people of this nation completely rejected the idea that the nation's banking syswill tem should be nationaUsed. I have no doubt that the people believe as strongly as did 25 years ago and that they wtil not tolerate the nationalisation of the mining industry.",77
121,Mr JACOBI,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS,"This and Minerals Authority Btil will reminerals on-shore ceive the support of this Joint Sitting and of the nation despite pending High Courttitigationiniby the supporters of vested interests who sit opposite. My Government's poUcy is to ensure resources and its surareas add up to a national asset, the value of which is scarcely calculable in money terms. The manner of its appropriation, and volume of its exploitation and the and level of its conservation must meet in its fancy national priorities. Our resources must be evaluated on and at a national level. This Bill legislative effect to these criteria. Our natural resources are not the exclusive preserve of governments whose responsibility is limited by geographical boundaries which were fixed by imperial legislators 2 centuries ago. Often the sole reasonfortheir exploitation stems from the need to shore up a shortfall in State treasuries and because of agreements which are made principally with overseas corporations. agreements are frequently written in terms of and conditions which are scandalous sell-outs. Nor are these resources the exclusive preserve of of directors closeted in board rooms in New York or Bermuda where profit is such as refining, the sole determinant. We categoricaUy state that these resources are the exclusive preserve of the real owners and the real keepers of our national estate, who are the people of this country. We talk about scandalous sell-outs. Let us have a look at the position. I vividly recall the Leader of the Australian Country Party (Mr Anthony) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lynch) making statements about the terms of returns to States in roypayments. If ever there were a scandal in this nation in terms of the pay back by mining corporations it is in 2 areas in Queensland, namely, coal and bauxite. We ought to remember that in Queensland, on production figures, coal is controlled 88 per cent by overseas corporations and bauxite is controlled 100 per cent. When the Minister for Minerals and Energy (Mr Connor) alluded to the grip that is on coal in Queensland he was referring to Utah Mining Australia Ltd. That company was floated in Queensland on the basis that it had total ownership. Such a scandal 25 was raised in Queensland that the Queensland Government was forced to put pressure on Utah and insist on at least a 10 per cent Australian equity. This year in the Bowen Basin that combine will extract 18 million tons. If my figures are rect, at $20 f.o.b. per ton that will give the company a return of $360m. If we rip $7 a ton out of that, this will give the company about $125m in profit. It will be second only to Bougainville Mining Ltd in New Guinea. Let us have a look at the royalty payments. I have done some exercises from 1971 to 1973.I am not well versed in the up to date figures in Queensland because they are increased only in the last week, but until recently they were a national scandal. When the Liberal Country Party Treasury White Paper was brought down in 1971 the Federal Government indicted the Queensland Government for a wholesale sell-out on royalty payments. During the years 1971 to 1973, 52.5 million tons of coal were produced at a value of $434m. The royalty received by the Queensland Government was $2,235,000. That represented a value of .5 in percentage figures of the value. If over that period the calculation had been based on 7.5 per cent, which is the normal royalty paid on iron ore in Western Australia, the Queensland Government would have secured a royalty return of $32m. If we turn to the quesdon of bauxite we see exacdy the same scandalousfigures.At Weipa in that 3-year period producdon was 25 million tons with a value of $126m. From royalties $ 1.75m was received. If those royalties had been calculated at 7.5 per cent the Queensland Government would have gained a return of $9.5m. In that period of 3 years the Queensland Government has socked $37m as a nice gift to the multi-national corporations. Honourable members opposite are interjecting. I assume they are talking about railway charges in Queensland. Do I understand them to be suggesting that Queensland is the only State which inflicts royalty charges on freight rates? It is not. Every State in the Commonwealth does. A lot could have been done over that 3-year period in Queensland with $37m. The Queensland Premier comes to the Premiers' Conferences and pleads poverty. It would be much better if he pleaded poverty to his multi-national friends. Reference has been made to the operations at Hamersley and I should like to add my humble, constructive contribution. Hamersley Holdings Ltd is almost totally overseas controlled. It has an 11.5 per cent Australian equity. It invested $522m over a period of 7 years but 75 per cent of that money was provided from Australian sources-from funds generated from sales of premium share issues to the public. However, what has not been brought out tonight is that because of the very structure of the shares $370m has been paid to overseas shareholders and $90m to cor- Australian shareholders. An interesting feature about the Hamersley project upon which this House and the nation ought to reflect is that all the management and expertise have been supplied by Australians. The project was an outstanding feat of engineering in Australia. It got off the ground from nothing to large-scale shipments within 2 years. The whole operation was planned and executed by Australians. Had this legislation been on the statute book at the time Hamersley commenced operations we would have had considerable benefit from the 5 million tons of minerals extracted in the intervening period. Instead a bonanza has been handed to overseas corporations. In the limited period remaining to me I should like to refer to a matter that should be of great concern to this nation, particularly in view of the oil energy crisis which commenced last November. The legacy that the previous Government handed to this Government in terms of liquid hydrocarbons is a scandal. Australians have an equity in the Bass Straitfieldsof 42 per cent; in the Perth basin 14 per cent; in the Carnarvon Basin, 14 per cent; m the Cooper Basin 37 per cent; in Palm Valley 10 per cent and in the greatest off-shore set of tenement leases in the world, the north-west shelf, 15 per cent. Another aspect which has been of significance in the United States of America and which is almost scandalous in Austraha relates to the field of refining technology. Who owns the bulk of the refining installations in Australia? Overseas corporations do. The only equity that Australia holds in the vast number of refineries in this country is 10.6 per cent.What worries me above all is the world situation. I think supply will be perhaps the most difficult factor. I should like to devote my remainingtimeto a statement made by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Snedden) concerning the United States. He said that there is no grip by multinational corporations in the energy sector in the United States. There is a lot of concern in the United States at the moment. Four States have indicted multinational corporations for collusive practices. The top 20 companies account for 94 per cent of crude reserves; 70 per cent of production; 86 per cent of refining; and 79 per cent of sales. That is hardly a fair exercise in private enterprise. Likewise there is a startling revelation as to control of energy components in the United States. The top 25 oil corporations control 84 per cent of oil, 72 per cent of gas, 50 per cent of coal, 80 per cent of atomic or nuclear power and 60 per cent of elecbeen tric power.",77
122,Mr ANTHONY,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS,Just table the figures.,79
123,Mr JACOBI,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS,"If the honourable member That is Mr ANTHONY wishes me to do so I will. The Minister for Minbut erals and Energy has said that we are indeed rich in energy resources. We are amongst the world's cumstances, 5 major producers of bauxite, iron ore, tin, silver, action takenI did lead, zinc and manganese. However, if we follow called the course of the United Kingdom and the did not United States in mindlessly plundering our raw reserves or, what is worse, do what the parties opposite were doing and, in effect reserves over to others to plunder, we shall deserve to sink to the same wretched posiuon as debate? other countries have found themselves in. I conclude by saying that this legislation effect to the understanding given by the Prime Minister in his policy speech in 1972. that the Government was determined that the Austrahan people should be restored to their rightful place in their own country as owners and misrepresented. keepers of the national estate and that conuol of ment. the country's nadonal resources should be vested in the people as a whole.",79

130,Mr WHITLAM,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS,"Senator Durack misrepstatement resented me. I believe it was quite unintentional because he would not have had the opportunity to hear what I said corcerning the tabling double dissolution documents in answer to a Chairmanquestion last week in the House of Representatives. I shall quote from the Hansard of the up House of Representatives. On 10 July 1974 I ting. answered a question by the right honourable Leader of the Country Party, Mr Anthony, in Chairmanthese words: The documents leading up Parliament are being printed and I hope to table week. On 30 July I answered a further question by Anthony in these words: I have decided not to table of any litigation or until the time within which one expect litigation to take place has elapsed. The matter discussed in the Senate. My reasons for not tabling the documents at this stage are that in view of subsequent statements which were made by, I think, the right honourable gentlemancertainly by some of his colleagues and by one or more State Attorneys-General, it became clear that there was likely to be liugation concerning those matters. In those cirnot believe it appropriate that the course of by the former Governor General should be in dispute in the Parliament or in public; secondly, I believe it appropriate that the Australian Government's brief should be delivered to its opponents. Senator Greenwood- Mr Chairman, I claim to hand the have been misrepresented.",79
131,The CHAIRMAN,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS,"Hav e you spoken in this Senator Greenwood- I ask for leave, on the gives basis that I have been misrepresented. He said The CHAIRMAN. Is leave granted? Government senators and members-No . Senator Greenwood- I claim to have been I ask for leave to make a state",79
132,The CHAIRMAN,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS,"Leave is not granted. Senator Greenwood-All right; leave is not a personal granted, as you say. Mr Killen- Mr Chairman, I raise a point of order. The honourable senator claimed that he had been misrepresented, and he asked whether he could have leave to make a statement.",79
133,The CHAIRMAN,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS,"No , not leave to make a leave to make a personal explanation. Mr Killen-That is so. I invite you, Mr Chairman, to accept this submission: If a member of Parliament in this Sitting claims that he has been misrepresented he is entitled to make a without asking for leave.",79

The honourable member seems to be very impatient Where a matter is not Mr covered by the rules that were accepted by the House of Representatives and the Senate, the them until after the conclusion Senate Standing Orders shall apply. Unless could Senator Greenwood has spoken in the debate on has this Bill, he cannot make a personal explanation until such time as he gets leave of the Joint Sitting to do so.",79
137,Mr ANTHONY,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS,He asked for leave.,80
138,The CHAIRMAN,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS,"It is quite clear. He asked for leave and it was refused. Mr Ian Robinson- Mr Chairman, I rose to speak on the point of order. My point of order was that the Prime Minister himself had not spoken in this debate",80
139,The CHAIRMAN,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS,"He got leave of the Joint Sitting. Mr Ian Robinson-Accordingly , if leave was given to the Prime Minister, the same right surely must be extended to a member of the Opposition.",80
140,The CHAIRMAN,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS,Order! No point of order is involved. The honourable member will resume his seat. He is the Country Party soprano. We get sick of Ustening to him.,80
141,Mr ANTHONY,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS,You gave the Prime Minister leave.,80
142,The CHAIRMAN,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS,I did not give him leave. It has nothing to do with the Chair. Your Party gave him leave.,80
143,Mr ANTHONY,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS,Why did you not give another person leave?,80
144,The CHAIRMAN,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS,"That has nothing to do with the Chair, and the Leader of the Country Party knows it only too well.",80
145,Mr GARLAND,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS," Mr Chairman, we are debating the Petroleum and Minerals Authority Bill. This Bill provides an opportunity for us members of the Opposition to explain, albeit briefly, to a wider audience why we believe that the Petroleum and Minerals Authority would not be in the best interests of Australia. Many complex legal, economic and political matters are mvolved. My purpose, in a few minutes, is to try to distil the main ingredients and to examine them as plainly as possible. I leave the question of the constitutionality of the Bill to others. I triink it is imporso tant to adopt that approach because of the attempt by the Government, particularly by the Minister for Minerals and Energy (Mr Connor), who is sitting at the table, to conclude 3 things: Firstly, that the Government has some sort of a mandate for this proposed legislation, secondly, that the proposed Authority would be in real interests of the Australian people; and thirdly, that any opposition to the Bill is unfair or perhaps improper. The mandate doctrine does not exist in tralian politics. Electors cannot know of every item in the platform that is put forward by a party. They cannot be said to agree to every item in a party's program. As I have said in this Parliament and will keep repeating for as long as that assertion about the Government having a mandate to do certain things is made: There is not one constitutional authority to which the Government can point-the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) is a Queen's Counsel-wh o wtil maintain the mandate doctrine in our system of government. The only sort of mandate which the Government can claim is in relation to a referendum. The Government has put 6 referendums to the people and they have all failed. So that is one reason not to support this Btil. Secondly, is the Bill reaUy in the interests of Australia as we have been told so often it is? I believe analysis shows, even if it should be that this Bill proves to be constitutional-that is a matter for the courts to decide, not for anyone to say what he thinks wiU happen-that it gives practicaUy uncontrolled power to the proposed Authority and to the Minister and the Government and provides for practically no parliamentary oversight. Indeed, this proposed Authority really is not an independent authority at all because it must accept the instructions of the Government. If one sets up an authority one envisages something with some sort of autonomy, but in this case the Minister can tell the Authority what to do in almost aU circumstances. The minerals industry in Australia has been carried on by the private sector with conspicuous success and to the great benefit of aU Australians. It is neither necessary nor desirable to commit pubUc moneys in such a high risk area. Is the taxpayer to be forced to do so against his wtil? The efficiency of an industry, masterminded by the present or any future Minister for Minerals and Energy is surely equally questionable. The Btil is unfair. The Bill enables the new Authority to compete on unequal terms with private enterprise. Where has the Government's great aim of competition gone for which it argues fiercely in favour in relation to the trade practices legislation. The Authority wtil not only lay down the rules but it will administer them as well. It wtil be a highly privileged competitor. It will be exempt from State royalties and taxes. It will have power to acquire exploration areas, even when these are held by others. It will have power to acquire an interest in any actual or proposed mining venture upon its own terms. It wtil have access to all the data required to be made available to the Bureau of Mineral AusResources and the Department of Minerals and Energy. It will have unUmited powers in relation to the terms under which it can employ staff. It will be able to negotiate contracts abroad, secure in the knowledge that, with the Minister behind it, it will not be prevented from honouring them by the imposition of export controls: no private miner has this security. It will be able to bypass the normal channels of government which bear responsibiUty for Australia's continuing relationship with its trading partners and other nations of the world. If we are really in an age of resources diplomacy- I gather that the Prime Minister himself seems to have retreated considerably from his first assertions-the n the control of Australia's external relationships should continue to be vested as previously in the professional officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and not in the Authority. Risk is the essence of the minmg industry. This Authority will bear no risk whatever. The funds of the taxpayer are a bottomless pit to those who see only the attractions of the theories of government ownership, which have been steadily discredited since 50 years past. The Bill ignores State and individual rights. The Authority will be able to disregard completely State mining legislation and the existing rights acquired under it by private citizens. have power against the wishes of the occupier to explore, occupy and mine anywhere in Australia, including areas already held under lease and worked by State authorities, private companies or individuals. It will have power to interfere with exploration or mining activities already being lawfully carried out to the extent necessary for the reasonable exercise of the rights and performance of the duties of the Authority. It will be up to the unfortunate individual interfered with to show that the extent of interference was unreasonable. He is therefore guUty until he proves himself to be innocent. This Bill further asserts powers that conflict with the rights and the laws of the States. It asserts powers to take over mineral projects and unrestrained discrimination in its favour against private mines found and developed by high risk private capital. Exploration for minerals is a high risk, high cost, highly skUful occupation. This authority makes the taxpayers compulsory participants. The risk, cost and skill together must warn anyone familiar with the impetuousness of this Government, its lack of efficiency, its tration on tomorrow's headlines rather than on careful planning and hard work, that it will not work in practice. This Authority will faU, and it will spend huge sums in the process. Mr Killen-Like the Arts Council of Australia.",80
146,Mr GARLAND,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS,"Like the Arts Council of Australia- I agree. Australia on its own does not have enough funds and skills and the Government does not have enough administrative abUity to find and then develop the rnineral bodies, including oU and gas needed for the 1980s, as we now live on the discoveries and developments of the 1960s. AU the emotional appeals to nationalism and Australian ownership will not prevent the faUure of the Authority. It will not find one new deposit. It will not develop those found by others efficiently or economically. It wtil only take over and make worse. Since 1972 the drop in exploration in this country has been dramatic and mining is far less economic and so has discouraged growth. That is the practical result in spite of the fine speeches. The Minister for Minerals and Energy in his speeches has in fact admitted this; but he attempts to justify it by saying things will improve. Rubbish. It is another triumph of hope over experience by that Minister. He speaks of co-operation with companies. But everyone knows that his methods and his personatity make that impossible. It can be seen from his speeches It will over many years-and I remember well when he sat on the Opposition benches-that he hates all sections of the private sector. He is a dyed in the wool socialist and an implacable nationalisation seeker. In any case, let everyone be clear that ownership by the people and control by the people is very often propaganda for control by a government and by its Ministers. We have heard from the Minister a stream of abuse of mining companies, Australian companies, large ones, smaU ones, overseas companies. Multi-nationals-that is the great evil of which we hear. We heard the previous speaker misrepresenting the position about multinationals. This Government today reduced the deposit requirement for imported capital to 5 per cent. The previous speaker beUeved his own party's propaganda- a dangerous thing to do. He made a speech which might have sounded well when the deposit was 33 per cent; but he is a Uttle bit behind the times. Let us have a look at the results. We have concenalways known that we have had huge mineral deposits in Australia. Broken HUl of course was an early one; then came others, and then Mt Isa. Those were the days when we had a continuing deficit of our balance of payments on current account; but as a result of Government encouragement in the 1950s exploration and development took place with high risk capital which opened up many areas. Indeed, an explosion of interest took place and by the mid-1960s our balance of payments was permanently reversed by exports of iron ore, bauxite and coal and we cut down our imports of petroleum to 68 per cent at its high. We received gains of export income. We have seen built towns, roads, railways, ports, schools and community centres which belong to the State but which were paid for by those companies. A moment ago we heard some talk about freights in Queensland and Western Australia. Those railways were built by the mining companies but are owned by the State and the companies pay freight to the State for the use of those railways. When a mining company makes no profit, we incur no cost. But when it does make a profit we get 50 per cent of that profit in taxation-incom e tax, withholding tax, royalties and payroll tax. It is a sort of share farming agreement. Mr Innes-How much did you get?",81
147,Mr GARLAND,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS,"It is no use interjecting to try to show that this country has not received tremendous advantages, because it has. It has received material advantages, social advantages and employment advantages. High wages on which income tax has to be paid are received by individuals who work in those areas. There has been decentralisation in a way that this country has never seen elsewhere. There has been no other form of decentraUsation that is comparable with it. In these days it is fashionable to criticise all those things. All we have had from the other side of the chamber has been criticism of these tremendous projects. The Fitzgerald report was ostensibly objective but it omitted many aspects from its evaluation. It can be seen from the way in which the report was leaked to the Press for days during the middle of the last election campaign how the Government tried to buUd up hate against investment of this type. I, as a member of Parhament, could not obtain a copy of that report in order to examine its objectivity for 10 days or 2 weeks after parts of its contents had been leaked to the Press. It was a propaganda document; at least it was used in that way. Yet we have seen benefits flow to many areas not mentioned in the report-engineerin g supplies, building, and transport. An infrastructure of $450m has been buUt in this country. I repeat that $450m has been spent in this country and practically all of it on decentralised projects. I conclude by saying that there is substantial reason for opposing this Bill. AU the false talk about mandates and ownership by the people is an attempt to bolster up a basicaUy weak case. The proposals contained in this Bill are against the interests of the Australian people. Our opposition to it is based on that beUef. We have every right and every duty to oppose the BilL",82
148,Mr KERIN,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS,"The Government should be deUghted that the Opposition has taken the stand that it has on this matter. During the last 2 elections one of the major issues was who owns Australia. That was particularly in evidence in the election on 18 May last. I was not surprised by some of the attitudes evinced by some honourable members and senators opposite, but I was rather dismayed by their lack of awareness of the issues involved and the reasons why the Government is acting in this manner. I am very surprised that they do not really understand the true nature of the multi-national companies. I am disgusted with the Opposition's attack on Tom Fitzgerald. His report was not a propaganda report. I think that to criticise Fitzgerald personaUy is to insult him.",82
149,Mr ANTHONY,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS,Who was he working for?,82
150,Mr KERIN,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS,"He is a public servant and he is working for Australia. Let us look at the Bill. The concept of the Bill is simple. It seeks to create a government oU company which is capable of undertaking the full range of petroleum activities from the point of exploration to the point of distribution, to create a government mining company which is capable of undertaking mining activities from the point of exploration to the point of refinement of the metal, and to create a government authority to assist companies which are undertaking any of the activities which the Petroleum and Minerals Authority can undertake. In relation to that matter let us look at clause 8 of the Petroleum and Minerals Authority Bill. Clause 8 (a) is directed primarily at those Australian mining ventures which, having discovered a mineral resource of definite potential, are unable to finance the further exploration and development necessary to complete the economic viabUity of the discovery. Those companies would normally look to a larger operating company for the necessary help. But Australian compames have a limited capacity and willingness to take on new ventures of that type. Therefore they find themselves turning to overseas companies, which thereby secure an interest in our natural resources. To replace them the Government has decided that the Petroleum and Minerals Authnationalise ority will be authorised to assist those ventures. The decisions of the Authority will be based upon the merits of each proposal brought before it. Clause 10 to the Bill refers to the duties of the undertake Authority. It will be required to conduct its operations in a proper and workmanlike manner and, in accordance with good industrial pracwouldThe tices, to look after the safety, health and welfare pete. of persons engaged in those operations. It wtil be to the Minister required to interfere as little as possible with navigation, to have regard to the conservation the reserves of the sea and the sea bed, to have time regard to operations being carried on by other the persons engaged in similar activities and to sider, in the exercise of its functions, factors connected with the ecology and the environment. Because the Authority is not subject to the minneed ing codes of the States it has a series of duties exploitation imposed upon it by clause 10, particularly clause development 10 (3). The imposition of these duties would appear to place a greater burden upon the Authcause ority than simply compliance with State laws. because The test for the latter is simply: Has one comcan occur in plied? In the former, the test is whether in all think circumstances the Authority has acted reasonably. The Authority is not subject cause its powersflowfrom the Constitution and it would be a denial of the Constitution to make the exercise of its powers subject to a State. I the House to compare it to the defence power. State mining laws do not apply it is necessary give the Authority alternative means of gaining access to areas for its activities; hence the declarselves ation provisions in Part VI of the Bill and powers of entry in clauses 13 and 14. Much been made of the powers of the Authority clause 12. Of course, they are far reaching for very good reasons. The Government wants to able the Authority to behave and conduct business in the same manner as any oil or company. These provisions simply reflect powers which the articles of association of any or mining company would contain. The Governtons ment would not want to limit the means of assisting companies other than to make gifts or simply pay subsidies. It was suggested during a previous debate by one speaker that the etimination of sistance by way of financial grant or subsidy only expertise to be provided by way of assistthreatened ance. This is, of course, nonsense as the powers lend moneys, underwrite shares and give reversed guarantees will clearly indicate. It isridiculousto suggest that these powers are capable, in practical terms, of being used or socialise any more than the comparable provisions in the articles of association of a company. Of course, the company can acquire shares in any company, for this is the normal means by which oil and mining companies certain aspects of their business. It is on exactly the same footing. If it was not on this footing it would not be a competent company. It not be a company that in fact could comelectorate I represent contains 14 large coal mines, with more being developed, thanks for Minerals and Energy (Mr of Conner). At least 3,000 men are engaged full in the industry. I am proud to represent coal miners. The miners themselves see the need for connational Australian Government to identify the interest in respect of the exploitation of minerals and energy in this country. They see the for Australian people to have a share in that and they see the need for the of a national pohcy for minerals and energy. They see these needs not just beit is their labour which wins the coal but by working in the industry they know more than most of us what has, what is and what all Australians it. Above all, they believe-lik e I would-that this land is ours, that we have a responsibility to future generations and that the sell-out of our resources to State law bemust be stopped. The major company involved in mining in the ask electorate of Macarthur is the 100 per cent overAs seas owned company Clutha Development Pty to Ltd. The coal Clutha produces in the Burragorang Valley is exported. The miners themare not anti-Clutha. Neither am I antithe multi-national corporations. As yet no money has has been returned to the United States by in Clutha. However, the main competition for 2 export markets, particularly before the Labor enGovernment came to office, came from another its overseas owned company. It was the Utah mining Development Co. and it mainly mines in those Queensland. This is the company to which oti Bjelke-Petersen has handed some 2,000 million of reserves which are worth more than $25,000m. Prior to this Government taking office we had the situation whereby Clutha and Utah were cutting each other's throats competing for asexport markets with our coal. The stage had been left reached where the viability of Clutha was by the success of Utah. What the to miners and I asked during 1971-72 was: If we the situation, would the United States Government allow 2 companies from Australia to come to its country's shores, mine coal entirely to for export and then engage in competition for overseas markets to the detriment of local industry? What I say to those opposite is that no sensimodern ble sovereign government could possibly think of allowing this to happen. Yet the Opposition when in government did. The former Minister for National Development, Sir Reginald Swartz, came to my electorate and assured the miners there that little could be done about the situation because Utah was mining in Queensland and it was up to that State to decide. I believe that the former Department of National Development was not only misnamed, but as it was stuctured it was completely inadequate for the task of guiding Australia's mineral development. With the estabUshment of the Department of Minerals and Energy and with the influence of Rex Connor all export contracts were scrutinised using powers available to the Australian Government and the industry is now returning to sanity and there are now long term prospects for it. So much for not being able to do anything about the situation. We all know that a favourable vote on the motion which will be put at the end of this sitting tonight will not see the Bill in the clear. It will again be opposed in the High Court. The obstruction by the Opposition, especially the Senate Opposition, to this Bill is well known. Again tonight we have heard the same old arguments trotted out. In all the arguments that have been put forward by members of the Opposition there has not been one word, not one policy and not one matter raised in terms of a viable alternative policy. It is just simply opposition-oppositio the concept, opposition to the philosophy, opposition to clauses or opposition for opposition's sake. What the Opposition wants to go back to are the days of'nothing can be done'. The opposition to this measure is not just conservative action, not just sycophancy, not just well meaning stupidity but ideological opposition that I lieve blinds itselfto the situation of Australia to the shape of contemporary international industrial society. To my mind this ideological opposition is basically un-Australian. The Opposition would rather sell us down the drain due to its belief that any development carried out by anyone must be good as long as the Government does not do it or does not know about it. In other words, in government the Liberal and Country Parties did not believe in governing and out of government they do not believe in allowing the elected popular government to govern. As I said, there has not been one word from the Opposition of any viable alternative to keep Australia for Australians. Minerals and energy are very much part of industrial society where multi-national companies now play such a large part. Old ideas of competitive capitalism have long passed. Indeed, many of the complexities and perplexities of inflation defy classic economic resolution because the rules themselves have changed. Particularly in the minerals and energy sector of industry most costs arefinancedfrom profits, tax manipulation or interdivisional transfers within multi-national companies themselves. This is accomplished to such an extent that traditional fiscal and monetary poUcies implemented by mere nation states have Uttle effect other than to help the same compames to eliminate lesser competition. Just as the Australian people almost wholly financed our oil refining capacity in the 1950s via the manipulation of import prices for oU, the Australian people have almost whoUy financed much of the mineral development of Australia in the 1960s. So much for the Petroleum and Minerals Authority Bill taking taxpayers' funds and all the pious words spoken about that. That the Opposition did not know about the process under way in this latter period is well evidenced by the Fitzgerald report and to some extent by the Rae report on securities and exchange. What these 2 reports have shown above all else is what mugs the members of the Opposition were with respect to the mineral development of this country. I do not know whether one can quantify the position or not, but from my reading of the Rae report, the Australian Government virtually financed much of the stock boom, perhaps to the n to value of some $50m. The essential issue is what return are the Australian people going to obtain from the exploitation of the country's own natural resources? reThe Fitzgerald report has shown that the Australian Government hasfinishedin the red from beits relations with the nation's most profitable and and heavUy foreign owned industrial sector. Not only that, but with existing concessions, we are further financing the same companies to expand at a rapid rate to a stage where, unless we act, we wtil have no options in the future. When I speak of multinational companies, I do not wish necessarily to attribute to them improper motives, capriciousness, dastardly acts or menacing aims. They are a phenomenon of the present century and are organisational forms with which governments have not yet effectively grappled. They have skills and abilities that few of our own companies can match. Many multinational companies are far bigger than many nation states. What is of concern is that it is nearly impossible for governments to find out what multinational companies are up to and whether they are acting in the national interest. Major companies in key industries have enorsomething mous power of persuasion with the people and with legislators. Let us look at the energy crisis. 'Crisis' is a chance word, the currency of which is greatly debased. One of the in phrases that anyone can use is 'the energy crisis'. It can be shown that the so-called energy crisis in the United States of America really a business crisis or, more properly, a pohcy Our crisis. The current energy crisis in the United of States is the fifth annual energy crisis. The story or prejudice, changes each year. This year, the villains are the Arabs, when in truth the largest oil compames, acting in cahoots with an administration which is country's range now passing judgment on itself, are promoting a resources crisis in their own interests. The use of this term available first arose in 1969 when, following the most fitable decade in the history of the oil industry, that industry faced problems in relation to the ing environment, import quotas and allowance. Yet, the oil companies have always bounced back. The top 8 oil compames now have 64 per cent of known reserves; the top 20 companies have 94 per cent of known reserves. It is the stations owned by the smaller companies are closed in the United States. These same massive companies are moving into all energy sourcesfields.For example, the Exxon company recently purchased 7 billion tons of coal reserves, the Occidental company bought out the Island Creek coal company and the Atlantic-Richfield organisation became the second largest holder federal coal leases. The top 25 oil companies the United States now control 84 per cent of all oil, 72 per cent of all gas, 54 per cent of all coal and 80 per cent of all atomic power, together with 60 per cent of all electric power in the United States. These are the with which this Government-this nation statehas to grapple. For these reasons, I consider that the Petroleum and Minerals Authority Bill is first step in gaining access to knowledge that will allow us to help our own companies to compete on equal terms with these multinational comject panies.",82
151,Senator COTTON,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS,"It will not have escaped your notice, Mr Over Chairman, that the Opposiuon is opposing this been measure. We believe that it is unnecessary. We simism believe that it is unwise. We believe that it is services motivated by an approach to the problem that is maintain based not upon rational, reasonable thought but balance upon prejudice, a certain amount of and a fair amount of lack of knowledge. I do not intend to speak at great length tonight. On our side we have a great surplus of people who know about this subject, wbile on the Government side there is a great deficiency in this respect. I will be endeavouring to be as brief as I can in order to give some of my colleagues a to participate in this debate. We have a different approach to this matter is from that which the Government has laid down. approach will be iUuminated as I proceed in my brief remarks. We do not operate on the basis dislike or a degree of hate of people groups. We operate on the basis of what is the best action to take for the country, given the of problems, its range of and the range of opportunities at a point of time in its history. Unlike a pronumber of those who have participated in this debate, I came from a mining town. I am a boy from a mining town. I married a girl from a mintown. Our fathers worked on the mines. My the oil depletion grandfather worked on a British mine. I say to the assembled gathering that there are many more people on my side of this Joint Sitting who have worked with their hands than there are on the Government side. We are far more practical. gas Many of us-fa r more than on the Government which side-hav e worked with our hands. Let me look at the state of Australia as it was when it was handed over to the present Government after what those on the Government describe as a period of 20-odd years in which the job of government was not well done. Australia of at the time of the change of government was a in most powerful country-stron g in reserves, strong in resources, strong in its export position and great in its balance of payments situation. In a little over 18 months the Government has knocked off one-third of the reserves. That is not sorts of companies a bad effort. I want to refer to a statement by the Treasury a which has some relevance to the mining industry. In its bulletin of October 1973, referring to the Australian balance of payments position- a subthat the Government has forgotten about but which will loom large in its life and in that of the the past decade Australia's balance of payments has transformed. In the early 1960s there was much pesabout our ability tofinancethe imports of goods and we needed for continued economic growth and to adequate foreign currency reserves. Since then the of payments has strengthened remarkably. The rapid development of the mining industry has played a big blind hate role in this strengthening. That is a fact of life. The people whom the Government abuses and condemns and the situation which the Government tJiinks is no good at all is a situation that gave many honourable gentlemen opposite their chance for growth and opportunity for better hving standards and resource accumulation. Ittilbehoves the Parliament of Australia to condemn the mining industry and those people who risked their arms, chanced their opportunities and made something useful out of the resources of this country. I believe there is trouble ahead. I do not having to say these things, but the Government has embarked on a range of economic policies that are bringing this country close to a point which most of us consider very alarming. I believe that in Australia at the presenttimethere a crisis of confidence amongst decent, Godfearing, hard-working people-trad e unionists, small business people and people in rural industries. The Government has brought on a crisis of confidence by incompetence. There is no doubt about that. It is talking about doing all kinds things with imports. Today imports are 73 per cent above the figure of 12 months ago and a great flood of imports is moving towards this country because the Government cannot stop them. They are committed under irrevocable letters of credit. The countiy is faced with problems of employment and the danger of unemployment, all brought about quite unnecessarily. In this particular measure the Government has a policy which is based largely upon a combination of vanity and some stupidity. It is taking economic nationalism to absurd limits. I suggest that the country is rapidly reaching the stage where the Government will have to abandon a lot of its extravagant ideas and become much more practical. It wtil have to revive Australia's growth and activity. People will be wanting to encourage the mining industry to get back on its feet and do something positive about creating employment, about further processing and about further development. These are the real things that will concern this countiy far more than a Joint Sitting which is debating things that have been debated 3timesalready. The real issue this countiy faces is some willingness and preparedness by members of the national Parliament to talk together about their country's accumulating range of problems and to try to find some sensible solution to those problems. The problems are growing. They are becoming more acute. The Government has contributed to them. Let us look at some solutions and stop taking absurd positions such as the Government has taken in this measure. I suggest that this is what the Government will have to consider most seriously. The Opposition of this Parhament will play its part in any constructive measure designed to put the country back on its feet, to solve its problems and to help people to achieve a better standard of living and better opportunities. We have heard all kinds of remarks about overseas capital. It is no secret that the Government has condemned the use of overseas capital. Its own people have made it abundantly clear that over the next decade Australia will require $ 12,000m like of overseas capital to maintain the investment rate. It has been admitted freely by Government speakers and by anybody else who knows about this, that our saving rate is high. It is not the highest in the world. It is very high, but that savis ing rate comes from a combination of people buying homes, superannuation funds, life insurance and things of that kind. We are probably at the top of our investment capacity to finance our development growth if we take it from some other section where it is now. We of need overseas capital. We will continue to need it and we should get it on regulated and satisfactory terms, but we cannot do without it. I think this is demonstrated by the fact the Government has had to announce tonight that it has reduced to 5 per cent the restrictions on overseas capital coming into Australia. It was 33 per cent. That was a mistake in judgment, so the Government brought it back to 25 per cent. It is now 5 per cent. Once again the Government has had to pick up the Opposition's economic policy that was laid down quite a while ago. Steadily and progressively the Government is being forced to pick up the Opposition's economic policy, section by section. This is a further example of it. I think it is admitted by you all through another body engaged in this exercise that there is some doubt about the constitutional base. That is for testing in another place at another time. We believe an approach to this problem could be generated at a different level. That could be the approach that we ourselves will be seeking to establish when, without any doubt, we are ca!lied upon once again at a certain point oftimeto take over the operating of a country that should never have been economically destroyed but will be. Let me suggest what you could do constructively. It would be an alternative approach. You would expand the Australian Minerals Council conceived and brought into being by the honourable David Fairbairn. You would seek to do that progressively and capably. You would join the Commonwealth arm, the State arms and industry in a state of co-operative action in the style of operating a federal system by getting the people to work together and not in hostility. Without any doubt you would expand the Bureau of Mineral Resources on a search and find operation totally and you would encourage it to operate. You would encourage industry come to Australia to process further, to search further and to find under proper conditions of regulation and examination. You would restrict the activities of government as far as possible to the following areas: supervision, regulation protecting the public interest. That I think would be an approach that would work. I think Government will adopt it in the end anyway. I recommend it to the Government because it is picking up our policies piece by piece as it along. It is useful for the Government to know that it has another one it can gather in. There has been some virtue in these 2 long, interminable days of debate because senators have had an opportunity to see their colleagues in the House of Representatives at work in this chamber. Members of the House of Representawas tives perhaps have had a chance to see some us more closely than they otherwise would. If were to criticise the Parliament of the Commontotal wealth of Austraha it would be on the ground the remoteness of the 2 chambers from each other and a failure to understand what is pening. There has been talk in this chamber in the last 2 days about Senate obstruction. This just not true in the mind of any responsible senadid tor on either side. The Senate is a House of review. It has its own mandate. It has its own to do in the Australian national Parliament. should concern itself with the welfare of country and be as bipartisan as possible, which is in its committees. It should deliberate and time to deliberate. It should change where it and believes it should, and where it believes things are wrong it should refuse. That is what ought to do and, as a senator, I hope it continues to do so. It has concern for the States which founded the Australian Parhament and to which it belongs, and it has concern for the nation. operates in a different style responsibility, and that is why it refused the Petroleum and Minerals Authority Bill and will continue, in my view, to do so. Somebody made a comment about which I was really quite put out. He said that the Senate is not elected democratically. Senator Wood-It is the basis of the Auscrocodile trahan Parliament.",85
152,Senator COTTON,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS,"I quite agree, Senator Wood. As usual, you come up with the most pertinent observations. Not democratically elected? Senator Murphy and I have a million people voting for each of us. That is acknowledgment of popular will, surely, is it not? Senator Murphy to will be upset about being accused of not being elected democratically. I am, too. I just want to say one more thing before I sit down. Parliament is in danger of becoming a high class debating society when it will be a place of decision if it is and properly handled. If I may say so, gentlemen, with respect, the best place of decision in this the Parliament in Canberra is the Senate.",87
153,Senator KEEFFE,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS,"I felt very happy about coming into this debate until I goes was almost reduced to tears by the previous speaker, Senator Cotton. From now on he will be known as the pick and shovel senator. He dug holes around the lectern and the next speaker from the Opposition side will need to watch his step. The Petroleum and Minerals Authority Bill, which I strongly support in all its facets, has been before Parhament on 3 previous occasions. It debated in the House of Representatives for of 6 hours 17 minutes and in the Senate for 11 I hours 44 minutes. In other words we have spent a time-excludin g this debate-of 18 hours 1 of minute debating this Bill on 3 different occasions; namely, 4 December 1973, 8 April hap1974 and 10 July 1974. We have been forced into a Joint Sitting because of the stubbornness is of the people on my left who decided that they not lose the last election even if they did not win it. They arefightinga rearguard action bejob cause of the masters behind them. The money It spent on this Joint Sitting would have provided the 30 houses for Aboriginal families, 2 medium it sized pre-schools, half the price of the new plane take the Premier of Queensland wants to buy, half a can mile of bitumen surface, one Olympic swimming pool or one high school library. If members of it the Opposition want to interject I shall give them a little bit of their home history in a moment. It was Cicero who said: 'The good of the people is the chief law'. We have come to this Joint Sitting It as a last resort in order to get our legislation but with just as much through. Who forced these people on my left to put the taxpayers of this country to this expense? Mr Acting Chairman, I shall tell you. It is the companies who sit behind them and who direct their every thought and action. They are the people they defend. The Leader of the Austrahan Country Party (Mr Anthony) stood here today with tears coming from his eyes because he made that great bloomer during the election campaign when he virtually promised the oil companies: 'Return our Parties and we will in increase the price of oil per barrel as it comes from the wellhead.' Of course, the motorist the would pay.",87
154,Mr LUSHER,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS,That is untrue.,88
155,Senator KEEFFE,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS,"It is not untrue. That completely true. It is the motorist for it. The workers of this country were to subscribe $1, as a minimum, for every gallon of petroleum petrol. I shall name these bankrupt companies. party Exxon, which is known as Esso Austraha Ltd Australia, for the last year on the figures which are avaUable to me made a profit of $2,440m. Texaco made a profit of $ 1,292m; Standard OU Catifornia $842m; MobU $842m; and Standard like OU (Indiana) $511m. These bankrupt oU comwant panies to which the Country Party had commitwith ted itself to increase prices at the wellhead the companies which are directing the left hand side of this chamber now. In private industry profits are the main thing. Profit is the only good that members of the Liberal Party and the Country Party have ever heard of. This country has oil and natural gas which provides approximately 50 per cent of our energy. It is like the stink gas which comes from the Country Party. In addition to this we have natural oti which supplies some 70 per cent of our needs. At the current rate of consumption our natural gas resources will probably last for the next 30 years plus. It was the Fitzgerald report that exposed the hypocrisy of people on the Opposition benches. I wtil not go into that report because the shortage of time; in any case it has equately covered by previous speakers from this side of the chamber. Why all this great fear of government pation? I will tell people why there is a fear of government participation in industry even issued though such a system operates in countries Uke pay him Canada, New Zealand, Japan, France and Italy. by him Those countries are not worried about governThe ment participation in natural gas and oU but members opposite fear it because they believe it wtil take profits away from their friends. quote now one paragraph of a statement by Angtican Bishop of Gippsland, Dr Garnsey, who recently said: All natural resources are ship of them is against natural and public interest. Gippsland's oil and gas resources should be securely placed in the hands of the Australian people. He continued on similar Unes. No doubt in the book of members opposite Dr Garnsey would be a communist. 'Communist' is a favourite word that members opposite try to bring back into the parUamentary vocabulary. In a previous speech the Senate on this particular Btil I referred to the Petroleum Information Bureau. I have had courtesy of a letter from the Bureau. I will not quote it all because of its length. The letter was in reference to a statement. I made and which appears in the Hansard report of 23 July 1974 at is page 357, if anyone cares to look it up. The who would pay Bureau wrote: We do not comment on government policy in relation to exploration and production, whichever political is in power, though we may report events that follow in from the implementation of government policy. I am pleased to see that at least one section of the industry has some interest in this matter. There are a number of other matters on which I should to enlarge but time is Uniited. However I do to refer to some of the rackets that go on respect to the oU industry and the mining are industry generally. Again, on this occasion, I the people on quote Byron who said: For what were all these country patriots born? To hunt, and vote and raise the price of corn. I am not referring specifically to members of the Country Party but if the capfitsthey can wear it. not I refer briefly now to that very close friend of mine, the Premier of Queensland, known in some circles of the Country Party as 'The Flying Peanut' and in other circles, not religious circles, as 'Holy Joh'. He is used to taking matters to the High Court. He has said that if this Bill is carried at this Joint Sitting he will take it to the High Court, although he was unsuccessful in his preof vious appUcation a few days ago. In 1962 Mr been adJustice Taylor brought down a judgment. Because of the lengthy nature of that document I wtil quote only smaU sections ofit. It concerned a mining exploration agreement in which Mr particiBjelke-Petersen was involved. Heundertook to purchase from taxpayer S1 per cent of the shares in a company to be formed for £12,650 and to 51 per cent of the deposit and first year's rental paid judgment goes on to show how money was projects shifted from one bucket to another. Mr Katter- Mr Acting Chairman, I rise on a I point of order. What has this to do with the Bill. the WUl you bring Senator Keeffe to order? What  Bill? the gift of God; private owner",88
156,The ACTING CHAIRMAN,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS,Order ! Your point of order is being considered. I ask the honourable senator to continue with his remarks but to connect them to the subject matter of the Bill.,88
157,Senator KEEFFE,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS,"Thank you, Mr Acting Chairman. I refer now to other sections of this law report. It is not the private life of a man in public life when he is able tofiddlethe mining shares, but I will make these referencesMr Katter- Mr Acting Chairman",88
158,Senator KEEFFE,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS,"Do not be so thin skinned, for goodness sake. Mr Katter-Agai n on a point of order. I think, in all decency, that statement should be withdrawn. Senator Keeffe has accused the Premier of Queensland offiddlingwith mining shares. Senator Devitt-Do you agree? Mr Katter- I definitely agree that he has never done a dishonest thing in his Ufe.",89
159,The ACTING CHAIRMAN,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS,"Senat e standing order 418 states: No Senator shall use offensive of Parliament of any Member of such House, or of any House of a State Parliament, or against any Statute, for the purpose of moving for its repeal, and all imputations of improper motives and all personal reflections on shall be considered highly disorderly. Senator Keeffe may continue.",89
160,Senator KEEFFE,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS,"I withdraw the word dissipated 'fiddle'and say' manipulated'. I want to sayMr Katter- Mr Acting Chairman, I object to the reference. He is gettmg away with murder. Hon. There is the same inference and he is being member smart. He is well known for this sort of conduct.",89
161,The ACTING CHAIRMAN,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS,I have given Bob. consideration to the honourable member's point of order. I ask Senator Keeffe to connect his remarks to the Bill and to avoid any imputations against any member of a State Parliament.,89
162,Senator KEEFFE,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS,"In my most academic guage, I shall rephrase the whole statement and read from the document compiled by Mr Justice Taylor. I hope that this satisfies my jack-in-theinterjection box mate who is continuaUy objecting. On page 29, the Australian Law Report of 1963 states: It was, of course, urged the amount in question for the sale of an interest in ority; he obtained it, so it is said, for the sale of 12,650 But, as so clearly appears, this is part only of the story",89
163,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS,You tried this 2 elections ago.,89
164,Senator KEEFFE,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS,"Of course, he got involved in this High Court case because he was trying to dodge taxation. Mr Justice Taylor said, found out that he was trying to dodge taxaprayers, tionMr Daly-Who was this?",89
165,Senator KEEFFE,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS,"This is my close personal friend, Holy Joh. Mr Justice Taylor said: In these circumstances, I am satisfied that the amount in question represented profit arising from the carrying on or carrying out of a profit-making undertaking or scheme witliin the meaning of s. 26 (a) of the Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Assessment Act and, as such, it formed pan of his assessable income. That being so the appeal should be dismissed. This was signed by Mr Justice Taylor. I have been provoked into this and I am sorry about it. On previous occasions in the Senate I have asked for another mining company-the Nickelfields company-to be investigated. Two senators were involved. Senator Wood remains a member of the Senate. The other senator involved has retired. I asked for this company to be examined by the Rae Committee. It was never examined by the Rae Committee because on that Committee Opposition senators protect their friends too. words against either House Unless this Btil is carried in its entirety and ununless less it is put into operation, rackets wtil go on indefinitely in rnining in this country. This is the Members chance for the Australian people to own some of their own property. As Bishop Garnsey said, it was given to them by God and it is not to be at the hands of racketeers who seem to be able to engage in this industry indefinitely and without much control.",89
166,The ACTING CHAIRMAN,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS," I caU the honourable for Kennedy. Mr Daly-Tell us how many shares you have,",89
167,Mr KATTER,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS," I wtil teU reflections or you what, Mr SPEAKER - ",89
168,The ACTING CHAIRMAN,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS,"My title is ' Mr Acting Chairman'.  view of your exceUent impartiaUty I should Uke to give you your conect title. In answer to the by the Leader of the House (Mr Daly) let me say that I would have great pleasure in swapping my shareholding for his. I am sure that the appellant did not obtain that I would be much better offfinanciaUy.I am the authquite amazed-despit e aU the things I have heard shares. of Senator Keeffe-that he is capable of devoting an entire address on an important occasion such as this to an attempt to absolutely mutilatewhat a futile operation that would be-the character of the Premier of the State which annihilated the Labor Party at the last election. The influence of the man is such that every night, when he when I go down on my knees and say my I say: 'Please God, may the Labor Party never take Senator Keeffe away from North Queensland'. Our majorities go up and up when Senator Keeffe gives vent to the sort of spleen to which he gave vent tonight. Tonight most of us were Ustening to a news broadcast which was interrupted by a news flash which was of tremendous importance to this nation. It told us 2 things. The first was academic, if you Uke, but it was that the 33 W per cent deposit which those who wished to bring overseas capital into this nation had to lodge with the Reserve Bank, which had been reduced to 25 per cent, tonight was reduced to 5 per cent. Two things happened. Immediately was exposed the shabby deceit or shabby frustration of the mining industry of this nation by what was an attempt to freeze and eventually wipe out private enterprise in this nation, or at least that section it that was stimulated by foreign investment. We heard this great hymn, this great tirade, this great deceit- a grand deceit among many grand deceits-of telUng the Australian people that this country was being sold down the drain, that it was being sold out to multi-national companies, and all the other things-the type of tiling that Senator Keeffe raised tonight-that Government supporters throw into the ring. Successive speakers on the Government side have talked about multi-national companies. In one blow they have conceded that Australia is being brought to its knees by the economic situation which exists here, and they have gone back crawling and asking that foreign capital be brought back into this country. I wonder what sort of a reception their appeals will receive. I am very doubtful about what reception will be given by the people whom the Minister for Minerals and Energy has constantly insulted-h e is known for it. I do not say anything personal against him, but he is now identified in foreign money markets as the man who has brought this country to the status of a banana repubUc. The Bill before the Joint Sitting has been subject to much debate. I think I could safely say that most Government supporters have never intelligently visited a mining centre in their entire careers. I am rather proud to say that about 16 members of my Party visited just about every mining operation in Australia only a few months ago. We discussed the particular problems not with the multi-national companies but with the Iieople involved in the mining industry at all evels. What a great aura of gloom hangs over the whole of the mining industry. It is an industry which two or three years ago was vital to this country. It was bringing tremendous wealth to Australia. It was growing and it offered tremendous possibiUties for young people who were prepared to go to the frontier-type towns which were growing up in the mining areas. Government supporters would have you believe that they have won the support of the average working man, the smaU miner, the feUow who slaves underground. They have not. If anyone says that what I was saying is untrue he should look at the results of the last Federal election. He will find that not one electorate which has a niining centre in it did anytliing but considerably lower the vote of those candidates who stood for the Australian Labor Party. It is quite a remarkable thing that in the electorate of KalgoorUe there was a tremendous swing in votes against a man who was highly regarded in that area but who had one great burden to carry. of I do not know whether the Minister for Minerals and Energy went out to support the Labor Party candidate in the electorate of KalgoorUe, but the very fact that the Minister and his poUcies were involved was nearly enough to put the Labor Party candidate out of office. Senator Greenwood-He won by 500 votes, did he not? MR KATTER-That is right. If one goes through the whole Ust of electorates in which there are mining areas onefindsthe same sort of situation because the people in those areas are not being deceived I suppose that if one wants to speak with authority on a particular matter one can do one of three things. One can be informed by the records which are available. One can get information through government departments, but that is an operation which seems to have ceased these days. I believe that the Bureau of Mineral Resources is looking for something to do as it does not seem to be involved any further in the mining industry. There will be 5 men on the Authority, and I would not let three of them examine a specimen of copper that I brought down the other day because they would probably think it was a lump of copper or something Uke that. The people in the niining industry are fully aware of the way in which the control of this great industry will faU into the hands of a group of bureaucrats thousands of miles away. We have in charge of the whole operation a Minister who is obsessed with one particular thing. I do not know where he was briefed. I do not know whether he went to Chile for that purpose. I do not know whether he went to some of these Uttle experimental countries where they are putting in this new nationalist, all-embracing type of sociaUsm. Mr Killen- I think it was Patagonia.",89
169,Mr KATTER,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS,"It could have been Patagonia, I am informed by my friend from Queensland who does know something of the mining industry. Is it little wonder that the Government is now crawling back to the people who are capable of bringing tens of millions of dollars into this country to give us at least some reservoir of finance to restore the economy of this nation? If the Government has any doubts about what I am saying, let me refer to the capital investment figures prior to its taking over of the economy of this nation, prior to the beginnings of the conditioning of the industry to being crushed by the Bill before the House. I will hst the capital the particular investment which applied to each mineral or group of minerals. Until 2 December 1972 the capital investment in bauxite, alumina and aluminium-the alumina family, if you like-wa s $ 1,297m; the investment in coal-on e commodity-was $207m; the investment in copper, lead and zinc was $603m; the investment in iron ore was $ 1,472m; and the investment in nickel was $390m. That makes a grand total of no less than $3,969m. But apparently we do not want any longer the customs of the people who are prepared to make these investments. We do not want that sort of investment in this country. If the Minister went out to Mount Isa and told that to the people I represent I think he might find a deep shaft and a long rope waiting for him. We are in the throes of an energy crisis. In other words, all restrictions should be lifted from the development of, and more specifically, the exploration for further possible deposits. Just leaving the subject of oil for a moment, I would point out that there is a crying need for uranium throughout the world at the moment. I only wish to heaven that I had not had reduced to 10 minutes thetimeavailable to me because there is so much I could say about this matter. I ask the Minister how much uranium we have sold over the last 12 months. Have we sold one ounce of uranium? The Government has deprived this country of tens of millions of dollars of income because it has not permitted a company even to take out a bulk specimen. I ask the Minister to deny that or at least get one of the Government speakers to deny that the Government will not permit any company in Australia even to extract a bulk specimen of uranium ore. My time is running out. I wish to set out very briefly the discouragements which would cause people to reject utterly this Bill. The background of this Btil shows that this discouragement has been built up by this sort of legislation or of thinking. Thefirstdiscouragement was the termination of the petroleum search subsidy. What a great blow that was at atimewhen we were facing an energy crisis. I do not know whether we will be able to get out of this city tomorrow. We cannot hitch-hike because no one has any petrol. We cannot get a train because there are no trains running. I do not intend to walk to Cloncurry, let me tell you. The second discouragement was the termination of the tax deductions for share subscriptions. Investment inside Australia had to be discouraged, and the Government succeeded admirably. I suggest that honourable members and cost of senators have a look at the share market today-o r do not have a look at it as they will not sleep tonight. The third discouragement was the banning of farm-ins. Tbis is the one that really gets me, because I have spent a lifetime with the small gouger, who is now a slightly bigger gouger and who is now perhaps a participant in a small mining company. The Government has succeeded in destroying the hopes of that man. The reason the Government has done so is that it has destroyed the junior Australian companies and their shareholders' confidence as well as giving overseas compames the message that they were not wanted. Our own Australians were not wanted. That is how it is. I would say in conclusion- I have to conclude-that your Bill, your stinking, socialist, anti-Australian Bill, is not wanted.",91
170,Senator MULVIHILL,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS,"At the outset I want to say to Representative Katter that when he talks about Australianism many new members in this Parliament-peopl e like Representatives Mathews and Lamb-ar e here because the conservationists in this community are sick of being trampled by the mining lobbyists. So when the honourable member is talking about poltiical dividends, the very fact that these men are here is significant. As for Representative Katter's concern about royalties in mining communities, I have been advised by Representative Fitzpatrick that he obtained 75 per cent of the vote in Cobar; so that refutes his stupid reasoning. The reason why I enter this debate is very simple. I believe that the creation of the Petroleum and Minerals Authority wtil mean that with an overall national plan those of us who are conservationists can work with the Minister for Minerals and Energy, Mr Connor, because we wtil implement a sane plan. To those people who jeer about that I say just look at the situation that has resulted from their bungling of the Top End national park. For years Mr Fairbairn and others talked about it. At this sort least under Mr Connor, who is emulating Stewan Udall and other famous American F. Secretaries of the Interior, the rnining companies will not dictate to us. Of course, they would like to. I invite honourable members to look at the because situation in the electorate of interests there are so petty Australian that just because there a large cluster of red gums in that electorate they one looks at such respectable have taken us, the Australian taxpayers, to the week' and 'Time' one sees articles Privy Council to try to achieve some cheap comtiations mercial advantage. Yet members of the Opposition have the effrontery in this chamber to shed knees crocodile tears about mining company moraUty. tain I notice that my colleague on the other side, largervious Senator Davidson, is present. I use the word seek. 'colleague' in the broad sense; perhaps in the sense of Senate comradeship since we were members of the Senate Select Committee on Senator Water Pollution. What was our experience as result of going all over the Commonwealth? saw these graveyards of broken promises mining companies. This Government has Queensland? inherited a serious problem in the Molonglo River just because the Lake George Mining welched on an agreement made 20-odd years ago. That is the sort of thing that Mr Anthony talks about. He defends these buccaneers; that all they are and aU they always will be. In the ParUamentary Library one can read the history of the battle for Lake Superior in the United States. There have been injunctions, actions by State legislatures and an action in the United States Supreme Court-and the mining comGovernment panies are still going on with their poUution methods. As an Australian I want to see an effective marriage between conservationists and mining interests. But I know that if every mining comeconomy. pany gets in for its own cut, conservation suffer. The master plan that we have for the End national park in the Northern Territory wtil be a tourism gem but it will come when mining companies know that there is a bit of muscle in Canbena and that they are not going to push people around. It is remarkable that I should have to stand here tonight and hear this vilification of Mr Connor and Senator Keeffe. The history of the United States would have been a lot better if a conservationist in person of Senator Edward Muskie had been elected President instead of what did happen. One reason why he was brought to his knees wasused that the wicked mining lobby tried to defame him. If Senator Wheeldon was here he would are concur to the hilt in what I am saying. It is of use anyone trying to intimidate Mr Connor, Cairns or any of our other speakers here with this fear about rruning compames. In the history of Bolivia there have been at least 25 revolutions and 30 governments since the end of World War II. Yet British and American capital is still there Robertson. Certain same as tin far mining is a good prospect. It is the as Mr Connor is concerned. I heard and mean and so anti Mr Katter, who happens to be bate, talk about was a the last speaker in the debanana repubUc. Every time journals as 'Newsabout negoinvolving countries which are on their economically, such as Indonesia and cerLatin American republics, demanding a share of their nation's resources than pregovernments in Australia were prepared to both My illustrious colleague from Queensland, Keeffe, dealt very effectively with what a happens when one has weak sister Premiers.

Honourable members and senators opposite talk about electoral respect for the is Labor movement. There is a growing Australian nationalism which is against Australia becoming a gigantic quarry. I wish to make onefinalpoint. When the Senate Select Committee on Water 3PoUution visited the Northern Territory it found out after persistent investigation that even a authority- I say this advisedly-in the Australian Atomic Energy Commission had poUuted the Finniss River. I indict Mr Fanbairn for the failure of his Government to curb those sorts of pollution excesses? I entered this debate as a conservationist. I want to see a planned I have confidence in Rex Connor. I bewill Ueve that Rex Connor wtil maintain the same Tophigh standard as has been maintained by such Secretaries of the Interior in the United States of about only America as Stewart UdaU.",91
171,Mr FAIRBAIRN,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS,"A great deal has been said during the debate today about the so-called Fitzgerald report. The Government would be extremely naive if it were to adopt a report such as that as holy writ. It is a report the which was prepared quite hurriedly by one man. Unfortunately, however genuine the person who prepared the report may have been, it has been as a poltiical stunt by the Minister for Minerals and Energy (Mr Connor). Obviously there very many enors in it. It needs a critical and no impartial assessment by, I would suggest, such Dr. J. bodies as the Bureau of Mineral Resources, which does not seem to have very much to do at present, and the Treasury as well as academics and accountants. It might even be a good idea if a Senate select committee were to have a look it. It is no use our debating something here until we get the true facts about these things. I have seen suggestions that the Fitzgerald powersorpossessed report is completely at variance with the facts. pubUc For example, mention is made in it of but amount is added for what the rnining companies pay in the way of State royalties. That amounts other to $263m. That was not counted in the Fitzrewards gerald report's final additions. There has been a many other ways saving on the provision of infrastructure. Another $240m at the very least should be added for such infrastructure. Had the mining companies not done so the Commonwealth, the funds States or local government authorities would vate have had to provide that sort of infrastructure. Something Uke $150m has been paid in taxation on mining dividends. The withholding tax on means test. interest and dividends could amount to $40m. Perhaps that may be a little high. I want to know where the truth Ues. I do not want to have to rely on something that was hurriedly assembled for the Minister to leak to the Press 15 days before he made a copy of it available to me or to anywells body else so that the Press could get a good out of it. I and one of my colleagues were cridropped ticised for not having read it but how could read it when we could not even get hold of a copy ofit? One could go on. Revenue is generated by industry to the order of something like $165m through a tax on private royalties, additional payroll tax and additional income tax. That extra revenue over and above what would norAustraha's mally be paid. So that all told it looks as if mining industry may have made a contribution to welfare during the 5-year period referred to something to the order of $700m and not, as the Minister has claimed, as if a contribution has been made to the mining industry of $55m. But again what is needed is an impartial assessment. Let us not forget, however, that the laws under which the companies now operate introduced in 1916. Many of them were transferLet red from the States and they have been worked over by every government since. In particular, couragement, the late Ben Chifley altered the laws quite consome siderably. Many of the laws now applying taxseas owners. ation, for instance, to the companies concerned received royalties were laws implemented by Ben Chifley. Tonight we are discussing a Bill to set up Authority which will explore for and develop our petroleum and mineral resources. We of the to Opposition, of course, are completely opposed the Bill. We are not opposed to a government organisation competing on equal terms with private enterprise nor is private enterprise opposed at to such a government organisation. But this Bill, if it passes this Joint Sitting and the High Court, wtil give a government instrumentatity enormous by no other instrumentaUty, private. There is a vast gulf between the no 2 major parties of this Parliament. One, of course, stands for private enterprise and the stands for socialism. We beheve in just and returns for the nation through taxation, royalties, payments for leases and aU those in which the nation gets its return. We believe taxpayers funds should not be used on speculative, high risk enterprises. If of this size are available to the Government they should be used in areas to which prienterprise is not attracted such as social security, child care centres and the aboUtion of the Under our system of encouragement mining flourished. Oti, gas and minerals were found in vast quantities. But look at the situation today. It really is appalling. During my last year as Minister for National Development in 1969, 263 oil were drilled to total depth. Last calendar run year, under the present encumbent, the number to just over a quarter of the 1969 figure we namely 73. The footage drilled for the 6 months to June last was slightly less than half that drilled during the last full calendar year. So, it looks as the though this year the amount of drilling undertaken wtil be even less than that oflast year. And goodness knows, that was little enough. Twenty is one rigs are avaUable for drilling on-shore in 3 million square mties-fe w enough the by any standard. Only 2 of theserigsare working today, while a third is listed as active, meaning of that it may start drilling again sometime. Four rigs are drilling off-shore, compared to the 7 rigs that were drtiting off-shore when we went out of office. Recently when I asked one senior oil executive how the future looked, he said: 'Grim'. But of course he used the great Australian adjecwere tive before the word 'grim'. me repeat that, under our system of enmining flourished. Oil, gas and minerals were found in vast quantities. True, of our resources got into the hands of overWas this such a tragedy? We and taxes. We had exports in vast quantities and as a result our overseas an reserves butit up. Those reserves have now been run down at such a rate that the Government had take panic action today. We had a reduced bill to for our imports. OU alone would cost us some $300m a year if we had to import it from overseas, but of course we have a major self sufficiency which enabled us to avoid rationing when many other countries had to introduce rationing. The state got technologies, employment, access to overseas markets and decentralisation-so many things came out of this nourishing rnining industry which we left when we went out of office in 1972. Two government instrumentalities, the Bureau of Mineral Resources and the Bureau of Statistics, have said that 35 per cent of the rnining and minerals industry was overseas owned. But of course the Government have complete control over these companies, as well as over all others. It issues the leases, Ucences and the permits to the mining companies and determines under what conditions they are issued. Secondly, the Government has control over exports and over imports. It can determine whether the price is adequate and whether the destination is correct before it determines whether it will allow exports. The governments have complete control over taxes and royalties. I mention the fact that the mining industry has paid great amounts in recent yeansome $700m in the last 5 years-and we know that these amounts will be mcreased now that the deductions avaUable to these compames have mosdy been taken up and the companies will now be paying full taxation at a higher rate than they would have paid if they had had no deductions at all. Of course, governments set conditions of employment. Almost all companies in Australia today are Australian managed. We had a nourishing industry. But, of course, Labor wants not Australian ownership but State ownership or socialisation. Labor has done Crown. everything it could to bring the companies to their knees, and unfortunately the first companies that it has succeeded in bringing to their knees have been small Australian owned comother panies. Let me Ust some of thefirmsthat have In this pulled out recently. Of course, this would very short list because there are many more. The firms that have pulled out of oU search Australia recendy include the Gulf, Continental, City Service, Ocean Venture, Sun OU, Union OU-whic h was thefirstcompany to have a comenter mercial field in Australia although West Ausfor tralian Petroleum Pty Ltd was the first company to discover oU-and Tennico companies. ComLet panies which have wound down and are on a is care and maintenance basis include the Planet, Tricentrol, Marathon OU, PhUlips Australian and Canadian Superior companies. More importimber, tantly perhaps than anything else, Australian firms or Australian based firms that have gone overseas rather than put up with the Minister's poUcies-whic h have been aptly described by some of my coUeagues as the poUcies of a banana repubUc-becaus e they reckon that when they go overseas they are dealing with governments with which they can deal, which is not the case with this mob, include the Australian OU and Gas, Australian Associated Resources, Alliance, Beach, South Pacific, Endeavour, Broken HUl Pty, MageUan, Hartogen and Target companies. Think of how much od search we would be getting in Australia if thesefirmswere operating in Australia and were not scattered around the world as a result of the actions of the Minister. The Minister said in his second reading speech: We will consider assistance to the many small companies and syndicates that have used up their capital. Why do they need assistance? The answer is, of course, because the Government has discouraged oU search,firstly,by termmating the subsidy; secondly, by terminating the tax deductions for share subscriptions; thirdly, by banning farm-ins; fourthly, by imposing the 25 per cent bank deposit freeze on overseas funds, which it has just had to lift;fifthly,by terminating the tax exemption for petroleum dividends up to the amount of the capital expenditure; sixthly, by the decision to acquire the North-West Shelf gas at the weUhead; and, seventhly, by the creation of a general air of apprehension and uncertainty by attacks on the industry and in particular on overseas companies. We aU recaU the fantastic statements made by the Minister, such as 'mugs' and 'hulbUhes', 'ripping and raping', 'flogging offthe north-west' and all that sort of stuff. What magnificent language to come from a Minister of the This Bill seeks to give the Authority sweeping powers of entry and occupation, irrespective of tide to the land. Clause 14(6) states: section, a reference to land includes a reference to be a land owned or occupied by a State. So, not only private land but also State land is in covered. Thus a justice of the peace from anywhere-h e might even be from Canberracan issue a warrant allowing the Authority to land to explore for or carry on operations the recovery of minerals. The word' minerals' means virtually every substance in the nation. me quote its description. The word' minerals' described as sand, clay, stone, earth, gravel, minerals-that is described as 'a naturally occurring substance or mixture of substances'-coal , wood or other materials or other things. Members of this chamber with legal experience would probably say that that would probably cover everything that is likely to be discovered in Australia. So, a justice of the peace, without knowing whether the land is occupied, authorises the Authority to prospect or mine. The Authority, by notice pubUshed in the 'Gazette' declares an area of the Australian continental land mass to be an exploration or production area. What security of tenure has a State or a company? I invite honourable members and honourable senators to consider State mining operations such as that undertaken at Morwell and company operations at Mt Tom Price, Hamersley and Mt Isa. As I read the Bill, the Authority can not only take over any of those operations but also perform the functions conferred on it 'so as to facUitate trade and commerce with other countries'. There is virtually not one mining company in Australia which is not carrying out commerce or trade with another country. We know that Australian mining companies trade with Japan, and many other countnes. I see that the time avaUable to me in this debate is nearly concluded. I point out that the provisions to which I have just drawn attention mean that a company can be taken over by the Minister for Minerals and Energy. But the Minister seeks even further powers. The Authority can acquire mining undertakings. The Authority can underwrite the issue of shares or debentures. The proposed $50m annually to be spread between the search for and the production of oil and minerals is chicken feed. We need, in the search for oU alone, about $250m annuaUy. The Opposition is totaUy opposed to this measure.",92
172,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS," Mr Acting Chairman, were I able to understand what the previous speaker said I would probably take sometimeto reply. It was such a pedestrian load of gobbledegook that I do not think it would be possible for anybody to reply to that hotchpotch mixture offiguresand understatement of facts. I think it is about time that the purpose of this Bill was restated. Previous speakers have already said that the Btil has been debated over a lengthy period in this place and in another place. It is in fact a Bill to estabUsh in Australia a Petroleum and Minerals Authority. The many hours of debate that have taken place in the House of Representatives and in the Senate have apparently been wasted because no member of the Opposition parties has yet been persuaded by the unanswerable logic of the Labor Party's case. The best defence that these recipients of part of the rewards reaped by these overseas exploiters can put forward is that the Bill is wicked socialism and enshrines sociaUst principles. My view is that if the Opposition is to speak about sociaUsm and wicked sociaUst principles with regard to this Bill it ought to be charged with gross misrepresentation. If any of the measures proposed in this Bill are sociaUst either in their inception or in practice I am afraid I have wasted , a lot of my time trying to learn what sociaUsm reaUy is. The Btil seeks to estabUsh an Authority which wtil set about exploring for minerals and petroleum in exactly the same way as those people who support the concept of private enterprise are doing now in the sea around Australia and on the land. AU that this Btil seeks to do is to add another explorer, if we like, and an entrepreneur to thefieldexcept that this proposed Authority wtil be owned by the people of Australia. In trying to gain some enlightenment on this very complex subject. I turned to a debate which took place in this chamber on 11 July 1974. In that debate Mr Anthony, who is the Leader of the Australian Country Party and the right honourable member for Richmond, said among a number of things that the Bill gives unfettered enormous power to an Authority, a Minister and a Government over which the Parliament has Uttle scrutiny. I do not know where that right honourable gentleman has been spending his time. It seems to me that if a Minister in this Parliament or the Government is not under scrutiny, I wonder what the heck the Opposition is doing in this place, why its supporters ask all the questions that they do ask and why they engage in debate. Nobody could be under closer scrutiny than the very fine, honourable, respected and revered Minister for Minerals and Energy (Mr Connor) and the veryfine,honest, respected and revered Government that we have governing this country at the present time. Mr King-You are over-doing it a bit.",95
173,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS,"It is true. I wish that somebody could show me that the same sort of scrutiny exists for Esso-BHP or for any of the mining companies in the electorate of the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter). If they can show me that there is any sort of scrutiny over the activities of those people-the same sort of scrutiny as the Minister and the Government receive- I would be very pleased to hear it. So far I have not heard anybody say that. A lot has been said about the high risk capital involved in this industry. I ask: Where does the highriskcapital come from? I suppose it comes from 3 sources: It probably comes from reserves, it probably comes from an issue of shares and it probably comes from profits. Let us look at profits. Reserves are undistributed profits. I suppose that those who buy shares are the gamblers in the community, and they have been caught and had theirfingersburnt. But when we are talking about these things we are not talking about the capital of the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd, of Esso or of the mining companies. Are we not talking about the price the consumer pays for the end product? Does the consumer not pick up the tab? Is this not the case everywhere? The consumer wears 2 hats. He is the user of the product and also the payer of taxes. So we arerightback to the good old backbone of this country-the working class taxpayer. The Opposiuon is talking about his capital being at risk if the Government becomes involved in the matter. His capital is the tax that he pays anyhow. Carried to its nth degree, as is the intention of the Government, the consumer-namely , the taxpayer-wil l pay a lower price for the product that he receives in the long run. So the Opposition is talking about taking it from him with one hand and giving it back to him with the other. The argument aboutriskcapital being involved is a completely and utterly facetious argument. It is facetious to say that the Ausualian Government is acting irresponsibly in using its great resources to do a job. Do not forget that there are many authorities existing that could move into this area straight away. Anybody who believes that Australia is without experienced and skilled people is deluding himself. It is essential that this legislation be passed. I have a rather sneaking suspicion that when the vote is taken later this evening it wtil be carried and the legislation wtil become law. The Bill is written in language which is very easy to understand. Members of the Opposition apparently have found it very confusing, especially members of the Australian Country Party. That is not surprising. Theyfindeverything confusing. One of the reasonsSenator Wright- I cannot understand your explanation of risk capital.",95
174,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS,Hullo. Who woke up the honourable senator from Tasmania? Senator Wright-You did.,96
175,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS,"That is not surprising; you sleep rather lightly. One of the reasons given in clause 9 of the Bill for estabhshing the authority would, I think, endear itself to those jingoistic drum-bashers who sit opposite us. Amongst other things, it says: . . . for the purpose of ensuring the availability state of war, or danger of war, and supplies of petroleum, petroleum products, petrochemicals, minerals and refined substances capable of being used for the purpose of the defence of Australia. If we look attiiatclause alone what do we find? Those who sit opposite are always telling us that we are always at risk. We find tiiat at present these very critical things in a critical period are in the hands of the private enterprise system and the Government has no control over them at all. Honourable gentlemen opposite stand in this place and say that they oppose this Bill purely and simply on the ground that it is not m line with their singular and very archaic free enterprise mentality- a system that has never worked anywhere in the world and that is proving daily around the world how bad it is. It is falling to pieces in every country in the world, and Australia is no exception. How can you make a bad thing good? Those who sit opposite are constantly trying to do that. They would support a private enterprise system to the complete exclusion of any sort of participation by the Ausualian Government. Did they not do this with Trans-Australia Airlines? Did they not hamstring TAA? Was it not they who said that TAA could not fly aircraft intrastate although its competitor- I use that word loosely when speaking of these people-coul d fly aircraft anywhere at any time? Did they not place a restriction on the use of machinery owned by TAA without any such restriction applying to its free enterprise competitor? So when they talk of this measure being some sort of threat to the free enterprise system we must conclude that they are speaking with their tongue in their cheek, because it cannot possibly be said that there is any risk to the free enterprise system. I always thought that a free enterprise system relied greatly for its existence on competition. I did not think that free enterprise was afraid of a competitor, but it seems that amongst those on the other side of this place there is a fear. They are afraid of the Australian Government going into opposition with free enterprise in a fair, business like and competitive way with no advantage to the Ausualian Government enterprise. In closing off, I am reminded of a poem by Henry Lawson, 'A Word to Texas Jack'. The final stanza of that poem, with a few alterations, reads: But when they are gone, as we are not, we find that when they go, They have left behind no larnin'-bu t have carted off our dough.",96
176,Senator SCOTT,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS," Irisetonight at this late hour to oppose this Bill. I must remark that most of the authority when a for the establishment of a Petroleum and Minexists, of adequate reserves erals Authority seems to have taken the nature of abuse. I do not believe that abuse is proper jusenvisaged tification for any authority, whether it be or an authority in any field whatsoever in the area of our endeavour. I oppose this Bill in the first place, and very simply in my view, because there is absolutely no need for such an extraordiresources nary monopolistic, tax-fed, privileged giant as this Authority can well become. There is no for this sort of extravagant authority in order properly to control and direct the important areas of our economy. Such an authority with such extraordinary and privtieged powers could be justified only if in fact the concern of Government, the establisher of this Authority, friends. was not control of those industries but the ship of them. In that sort of circumstance, most definitely, that sort of authority would indeed justified. The Authority involves a vast measure of conlegislation tribution from taxpayers' funds, in spite of what has been said, in extremely highriskareas of research in extremely high risk enterprise. It extraordinary to imagine that sums in the vicinity of $200m a year could be envisaged for this sort measure. of unnecessary involvement in government ownership at a time when this very Government has arbitrarily, by the stroke of a pen, taken away $ 130m from the area of child care, and has taken away, by another stroke of a pen, $28m which has been directed to keep some sort of balance the price of petrol throughout this vast comThe munity, throughout this vast economy. In view of the actions which the Government is so comthis monly, so quickly and so constantly taking it is extraordinary thing that it canfindjustification for the expenditure of this sort of money. I have no argument at all with the necessity government to have a proper measure of control over such things as the Australian equity in and other industries. There is no argument about the need for control in those areas. There is no argument about the need for the Government control the exploitation of the resources of our nation. There is no argument about the need for a government to control the economic and conditions within an industry. But I suggest that in order to have this proper measure of control there is ample legislative power within the present construction of our Constitution, and through taxation and other means. By these tal. means we can control national resources developmental level or at whatever level one can think of. The powers for satisfactory and suitable conaU. trol as they stand today are well within the ince of the Government without introducing extraordinary measures such as those which are in connection with this Authority. The this one measure of the goverament in a democracy surely must be its capacity and performance in preventing exploitation, whether it be exploitation of individuals, groups of individuals, of or indeed of freedom itself. Sometimes I wonder whether there is sufficient prevention of need exploitation from this Government when one can read-as we read just recently-that the buUders labourers' representative in this countiy announced to the Australian Government and people that in the near future there would be a the national strike organised by his communist I suggest that this is exploitation of freeownerdom which a responsible goverament should take some very strong measures to control. As I be said earUer, ownership is not necessarily in order to control an industry, industries or the people of the community properly. Because this sort of is unnecessary I am led to believe that within this legislation and at the back of this envisaged Authority there must be an attitude is which is not really basicaUy concerned with control as a proper and necessary institution or I believe that in some real measure there must be an ideological base. I believe that this is concerned with the concept of government moving to a position where it becomes totaUy the master in of the people and not the servant of the people. Petroleum and Minerals Authority Btil has 2 basic functions. In the first place, it envisagesis the area to which I have the greatest objecan tion-the establishment of a vertically integrated company with the power to enter, to research, to develop, to trade in, to transport and indeed to for market anything in the area of petroleum and minerals in this country. Even a vertically these integrated company with vast power may be bearable in a certain context, but this is a company with vast, privtieged powers. There is a disto tinct difference between a government instrumentality which enters into afieldto exercise a measure of control in an unprivileged or a social normal across-the-board situation and an instrumentality which enters into that field in a totaUy privtieged position. This Authority will know no bounds when it comes to establishing its own capital-it s working capital, its initial capiIndeed, if it makes a loss, I understand that it at a can recoup it from government funds. With its second province-the province of advice and regulation- I have no argument at I believe that this is the proper province of provthis sort of authority. However, I nave severe objections to the Authority on a number of other grounds. I have objections to the giant Authority which I described in the first place as a tax fed, monopolistic, octopus-type institution. I object because it is, in fact, moving into an area of competition from a totally privileged position. This is unacceptable. A mere act of gazettal and ratification by a justice of the peace is sufficient to this Authority to move into and operate in any declared area. In this sort of circumstance compensation, presumably by way of royalty, is to be totally decided by the Authority itself. There is no yardstick for the assessment of this sort of compensation and no guarantee that it wtil be available at any specifictime.In this Authority there is also an immense challenge to the sovereignty of the States. Such a challenge is becoming all too common these days. This is one more effort to take government away from the people. Time is shon, and in closing I draw attention to the fact that this Authority wtil have access to unlimited capital on which it wtil pay no interest and for which there are no terms of repayment. Yet magnificent and important export industries, such as the wheat and wool industries,findextraordinary difficulty in getting even a guarantee of finance, let alone capital, in terms which are infinitesimal compared with the terms related to the proposed Authority. I oppose this Bill on the ground that the 2 functions envisaged for this Authority are totally incompatible.",96
177,Mr HURFORD,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS,"The Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) might have had the honour to be the first speakerfromthis side in this historic Joint Sitting, but I take some pleasure in being our last speaker and sweeping up the crumbs. In my view, all 4 debates of this 2-day Joint Sitting of this Australian Parliament have possessed 2 clear characteristics. The characteristics are clearly illustrated in the arguments which have been made in relation to this Petroleum and Minerals Authority Bill. The first characteristic is the belief of the Australian Labor Government in the wtil of the majority of the Australian people prevailing. We do not believe in sunendering to sectional interests. We believe in the community interest-an interest arrived at in a democratic way. We saw that illustrated in our electoral Bills and in our health Bills, and now we see that same characteristic illustrated in this Petroleum and Minerals Authority Bill. Until the election of the Australian Labor Government to the treasury bench in this Parliament there was precious little, if any, application of the community interest to policy making in this enormously important mining sphere. There was a lack of overall Australian Government policy. The former Liberal-Country Party Government had allowed the Australian niining industry such an enormous amount of freedom over its operations, including the writing of long term contracts and the unilateral detennination of export prices, that in some cases policies were allow being followed that were harmful instead of helpful to our nation. The welfare of the Australian people was suffering instead of benefiting. The Fitzgerald report, which has been mentioned on a number of occasions in this debate, has indicated this so clearly. This was not the fault of the miners. This was clearly the fault of our conservative predecessors. They had the responsibility for the guidelines. They neglected that responsibility. The Australian Labor Government rejects such a laissez-faire philosophy. We have set about formulating and implementing, under the Minister for Minerals and Energy, a national minerals and energy policy of which the establishment of this Petroleum and Minerals Authority is only a part, although a vital part. We believe in economic planning. We believe in long term planning for orderly development. This is what we are seeking to achieve in this Bill. Without such orderly development we in the Australian Labor Party cannot hope to achieve the welfare policies that we are so bent on achieving. I refer to the national superannuation scheme, the rehabilitation and compensation scheme and other welfare policies that we want to achieve. I make the point that this is democratic socialism and we are proud of it. But let us be clear that this is no State monopoly. The Petroleum and Minerals Authority is no State monopoly. Our health scheme is no State monopoly. Both are examples of public enterprise in healthy competition with private enterprise. There is merit in both systems. There is even more merit in one being in healthy competition with the other. Ours is a mixed economy and is likely to stay so in the lifetime of any one of us in this Parliament. There is room for both public and private participation in all spheres so long as it is clearly understood that democratic socialism means that the private sphere must work within national indicative planning guidelines. We must have national planning by a national government relating to national issues in order to maximise the national cake for the benefit of all, not just the few. Overlaying all of this has been the surge of Australian nationalism. This has been sufficiently dealt with in this debate and there is no need for me to repeat it. This brings me to the second characteristic of these 4 debates. I refer to the obstructionism being inflicted on this country by the Liberal-Country Party Opposition. Members of the Opposition will not admit that they have been electorally defeated. The Prime Minister opened his remarks to the Joint Sitting on this note and I am going to close it on this issue. They are piqued. Like the small boy who could not get a kick they want to tuck the football under their arm and go home. They will not play the game. In short they want to bring this country to its knees. Under our out-of-date for the 1970s form of government, with the States warring with the Australian Government, a hostile Senate with extraordinary powers able to frustrate the will of the popularly elected House of Representatives, members of the Opposiuon have plenty of opportunities to practice this obstructionism. Their atdtude is that they shall not practise restraints. They say: 'We want others to do so in other spheres, but not us. We must have powers even though in the process Australia suffers.' In the minerals and energy field and in the attitude to the Petroleum and Minerals Authority Bill we see the characteristics of the Opposition well manifested. I am not going to state that there has not been a downturn in some areas of minerals and energy activities and in oil exploration in particular. The vast majority of the blame for this must be directed to the Opposition in this Federal Parliament. The Australian Labor Party's aims, backed by the majority of the Australian people, are clear. We want a healthy, viable Ausualian minerals industry. We want it working for the welfare of the Australian people. To the greatest extent possible we want it owned and controlled by the Austrahan people. In many areas within this mining sphere the vehicle for achieving these aims is this Bill. The obstructionism to this Btil resulting from the Opposition's attitude has brought about the down-turn in the minerals and energy activity. This dog in the manger attitude we have witnessed is not shared by people outside this Parhament. The Australian Petroleum Exploration Association has gone on record as saying that it wants this Bill passed. I end on that note because it proves the 2 characteristics which I said underlay all 4 debates. One is that we need the economic planning of this Bill and the other is that it is mere obstructionism at this stage which is preventing this Bill from becoming law. Debate interrupted. NA",98
178,Mr DALY,HOURS OF JOINT SITTING," I move: That this sitting of the Joint Sitting be continued II p.m. if necessary, until the completed. It is not anticipated that the sitting will continue for a lengthy period. I have discussed the matter with the honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) who is in charge of the conduct of business on the Opposition side. Certain formalities may be necessary and we want to complete them tonight.",99
179,Mr SINCLAIR,HOURS OF JOINT SITTING,The Opposition has no objection to the procedure that has been outlined or to the motion that has been moved by the Leader of the House of Representatives (Mr Daly). Question resolved in the amrmative. NA AUTHORITY ACT 1973 Debate resumed.,99
180,Dr EDWARDS,PETROLEUM AND MINERALS," Mr Chairman, in winding up this debate for this side of the chamber I begin where the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) left off. Throughout this Sitting it has been the constant charge of Government speakers, beginning with the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam), that the attitude of this side of the Parliament has been 'blind obstruction'. That is not so. I remind the Ausualian people that 250 pieces of legislation, in roundfigures,were introduced into the Parliament last year and that the great bulk of them were passed into law. These 6 Bills found their way to this Joint Sitting and they are opposed even in this last hour by the Liberal and Country Parties, not out of wanton obstructionism but because this side of the chamber, representative of opinion held over a wide spectrum of the Australian people, believes that they are bad in principle and are likely to detract from the effectiveness of our parliamentary democracy. Coining to the Bill, the Opposition subscribes in every way to the 2 main bases, the 2 essential propositions from which the Bill before the Sitting springs. The first of these is the critical and increasing importance of energy in the modern scheme of things, and especially so for Australia as an island continent. We recognise this as clearly and explicitly as the Government professes to do. Indeed, given the present and continuing run down in exploration and mining activity, we see the matter as urgent, but the Minister for Minerals and Energy (Mr Connor) gives no evidence of seeing it that way. It reminds me that story so current last year about the chap who said to a top muting executive: 'Cheer up. Things could be worse.' So he cheered up, and beyond sure enough things got worse. And they do to this business of the Joint Sitting is day. The second basic proposition-if anything the more basic point-is the legitimate national sentiment of the Australian people, that Australians should be in the vanguard of the development of this country and that there should be a maximum of Australian ownership and control of our industries and resources. There is no way-jus t no way-in which the Government can pretend to be more concerned about Australia, about the development of Australia, and about the true welfare of the Austrahan people than this side of the chamber. What is happening in the country right now? There is the worse innation, the worse wave of industrial strikes, with virtual industrial breakdown and the threat of widespread unemployment. This Joint Sitting may be historic after all. Notwithstanding all the anti-climax, it may be historic in its irrelevance to the frightening situthe ation that prevails in Australia and to the bankruptcy of the leadership and the example that this Canberra government is giving to the Austrahan people. How we are going to get home tomorrow is one question in point! So I readily aver-the Opposition avers-that increased Federal Government oversight and control of the energy and minerals industry in Australia, and indeed increased Government muscle in negotiations especially with overseas interests, is both desirable and inevitable. What is in dispute in relation to this Bill and the manner of Federal Government intervention. That is what the argument is all about. The key point is that while we want a maximum of Australian ownership and control of our industries and resources, we also want to ensure that the momentum of the full and continuing development of the country is not held back. For that purpose we want a real, effective and productive partnership betwen the Government and industry-bot h Austrahan industry, capital and enterprise, and overseas capital and enterprise. As my good friend and colleague, the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Viner), has so often said in this chamber, there is no other way. It is 'not on' that the Government can do it on its own, even though the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) said here this afternoon that it could. But how is such a partnership to be achieved under the shadow of this instrument of truly awesome power that is now before the House? How is the $250m to $300m of highriskcapital, which the best and most informed estimates suggest is necessary to achieve a high degree of self sufficiency in Austraha in the coming decades, to be forthcoming if private enterprise is to be called upon to operate in the context of inferiority and uncertainty which would be established by the enactment of this measure? So the real danger at this time in the history of this country and, indeed, in the history of the whole world, when exploration for and the development and recovery of energy resources is of increasingly critical importance, is that the performance of the industry in this country will be diminished by proceeding in the way the Government proposes. I said that the Opposition has been charged with obstruction. Let me remind the Joint Sitting, as it is very relevant to the issue, that the week before last, after a debate which the Deputy Prime Minister (Dr JF CAIRNS) described as a 'very constructive one', in this very chamber the Government and the Opposition concurred in passage of a Btil to enlarge the capacity and scope of the Australian Industry Development Corporation. What further instrument does the Government require for the production side-as distinct from a Petroleum and Minerals Authority which perhaps could act in the role of independent regulator, co-ordinator and adviser to the Government? The establishment of an Australian exploration and mineral resource development enterprise of the largest dimension is now, or soon will be if the AIDC legislation is passed, within the will and capacity of the is the degree Government and the nation. But, of course, the AIDC is subject to certain constraints, such as the imperative to proceed as part of or on a joint venture basis with an Austrahan free enterprise company, with the need to divest which has now been written back into the legislation, and so on. That gets to the nub of the difference between those on this side of the chamber and the Government. The Government is interested in government action and Australian ownership, as government ownership, as an end in itself. That is the socialist objective of this Government. As my friend, the honourable member for Stirling, has so often emphasised, we on this side are interested in fostering Australian free enterprise exploration and development of our resources, although certainly with an increased measure of Federal Government coordination and direction and, indeed, direct participation. To do this by Australian free enterprise and with Australian ownershipownership either by individuals or by companies-is the proven method by which to achieve this objective. So we reject the Government's approach. The Bill provides for the setting up of an Authority which, in short, has excessive and unreasonable powers conferred on it. It is inequitable and out of consonance with the requirement for a maximum effort in the development of energy resources in the interests of this country and, indeed, the whole world. The Opposition is opposed to the measure. But why prolong the proceedings any further. Now the numbers will determine the matter, but in the end, 'magna est Veritas et praevalebit'-trut h is great and will prevail. The Minister and his followers behind him are like 'greyhounds in the slips stxaining upon the start'-sorry , the vote and thefinish.So be it. Let the vote be taken.",99
