32,Mr WALKER,REPRESENTATIVES MAIN COMMITTEE,The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Yes. (a) The curtain wall on the ATO office building in Belconnen did require modification as its original design did not take into account two areas of the building which were designed with a deflection greater than the average. (b) The original tender price for the curtain wall was $4.439 million. (c) The curtain wall is an aluminium facade system which forms the. external 'skin' of the building. (d) The purpose of the curtain wall is to provide a thermally efficient weatherproof skin to the building structure. Foreign. Ownership (Question No. 1516),177
33,Mr CAMERON,REPRESENTATIVES MAIN COMMITTEE,"the Assistant Treasurer upon notice, on 19 September 1994: Will the Government restrict foreign ownership in companies given the oversubscription in some share floats?",177
34,Mr GEAR,REPRESENTATIVES MAIN COMMITTEE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: No, the Government has no intention of changing its basic stance on foreign investment in Australia as a reaction to the oversubscription of a few public share floats. A more restrictive foreign investment policy might prejudice a successful outcome to future floats. NA Foreign ownership is already restricted in some circumstances. The Government's foreign investment policy is framed and administered with a view to encouraging foreign investment in Australia, while ensuring that such investment is consistent with the needs of the community. Under the Government's foreign investment policy, there are restrictions on foreign investment in sensitive sectors, namely the media, civil aviation, banking and real estate sectors. For the non-sensitive sectors (including manufacturing, mining and services sectors), takeovers of existing Australian businesses with total assets less than $5 million and the establishment of new businesses involving total investment of less than $10 million are exempt from notification. Purchases of rural businesses valued at less than $3 million are also exempt. The Government registers, but normally raises no objections to proposals above these thresholds where the relevant total assets/total investment fall below $50 million. Examinable proposals to acquire existing businesses or to establish new businesses are assessed against a ""contrary to the national interest"" test. Investors can expect that approval will not be withheld on national interest grounds other than in unusual circumstances affecting Australia's vital interests and development. Portfolio investments normally are not covered by Australia's foreign investment policy. Financial Institutions Duty (Question No. 1538) Mr Langmore asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 22 September 1994: (1) Which agency collects the financial institutions duty (FlD). (2) How is the FlD collected. (3) To what type of transactions does the FlD relate. (4) At what rate is the FlD set. (5) What revenue was collected from the FlD in each year since it was introduced.",177
35,Mr WILLIS,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's questions is as follows: Financial institutions duties (FIDs) are imposed and administered by all States and Territories except Queensland. Whilst the Commonwealth has, through various reports available to it, some information on the operation and rates of FID this .information is not sufficiently comprehensive to enable a full and accurate response to the questions asked. The honourable member should therefore direct his questions to the relevant State and Territory governments.

Senator Short sought information on grants, or other forms of payments, to trade union or community groups in the 1993-94 and 1994-95 financial years. The answer to Senator Short's question provides some information towards answering Mr Cameron's question.

Excimer Laser Surgery (Question No. 1637)",178
40,Mr CAMERON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"the Minister for Human Services and Health, upon notice, on 12 October 1994: (1) Is excimer laser surgery to correct myopia deemed to be cosmetic surgery and not a medical procedure; if so, why. (2) Is it a fact that many persons are inhibited various activities by spectacles and contact lenses and find excimer laser surgery necessary. (3) Will the Government reconsider the classification of excimer laser surgery with a view to assisting patients for it.",179
41,Dr LAWRENCE,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1), (2) & (3) I assume that the honourable member's question relates to the non-inclusion of an item relating to the treatment of myopia using excimer laser surgery in the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) for the purpose of the payment of Medicare benefits. New services are generally included in the MBS only after their clinical efficacy, and cost benefit, have been established. In this regard, the Government obtains expert advice, including advice from the relevant professional College, which in relation to eye pathology is the Royal Australian College of Ophthalmology. It should be noted that in June 1993 the National Health and Medical Research Council reported that follow-up studies of laser corneal sculpting, such as that performed using the excimer laser, were ongoing and that long-term questions must be answered before the treatment could be recommendyd as a routine procedure. The Australian Health Technology Advisory Committee has also stated that spectacles and contact lenses provide the safest, most effective and affordable treatment for myopia. While it is understood that almost all who have undergone excimer laser surgery have had reduced myopia, side effects such as regression, overcorrection, erosion and scarring of the cornea, sensitivity to glare and corneal haze have been reported. It would be inappropriate to include this procedure in the MBS until its clinical efficacy and cost benefit have been established.

Universities: Income (Question No. 1729) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training; upon notice, on 14 November 1994: Table 1: Investment Income, Current Investment Universities, 1991 Statellnstitution NEW SOUTH WALESCharles Sturt University Macquarie University University of New England University of New South Wales University of Newcastle University of Sydney University of Technology, Sydney University of Western Sydney University of Wollongong (1) Is he able to say, for each university in Australia in (a) 1991, (b) 1992 and (c) 1993, what was the (i) value of income earning assets in the form of (A) property holdings, (B) share portfolios and (C) other investments held by the university and (ii) income generated from the assets. (2) Has the Government adjusted funding in recognition of the availability of the resources of funding identified in part (1); if so, what adjustments were made in each case. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Data collections undertaken by the Department of Employment, Education and Training do not gather information from universities at the level of detail which would be required to provide answers to all the questions asked by the honourable member. Data are available for total investment income for each university for the years 1991, 1992 and 1993. No data are available about the value or type of assets from which the investment income was generated. . Limited information is available about investment assets from some universities for 1991, 1992 and 1993. No distinction can be made between property assets, share assets and other types of investment assets. The reason that investment assets data are not available for all universities is that a new collection methodology is being implemented progressively. Investment assets data will be reported from all universities from 1994. The data which are available are provided at Tables 1, 2 and 3 below.
