2,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,POPE PAUL VI," I move: That the House notes the death on 6 August 1978 Holiness Pope Paul VI, and expresses its profound regret his passing. With the death of Pope Paul-the spiritual leader of the world's 700 million Roman Catholics the last 15 years-the world lost a great religious leader and a messenger of peace. In many ways his papacy came in an unique age. It coincided with an upsurge of the ecumenical movement and far-reaching and fundamental changes in world affairs. society throughout the world. It was an age, too, of challenge to the traditional spiritual authority of the Church. Pope Paul sought to maintain the essential body of doctrine ofhis Church, and to uphold its institutional character. He saw his duty as being to steer a middle course within the Church, tween those elements calling for change and those who defended continuity. Pope Paul NA Hansard 1978 OF THE THIRTY-FIRST PARLIAMENT (SECOND PERIOD) to IS August 1978, unless Mr Speaker fixed an passed on 8 June 1978, the House of 15 August 1978, at 2.15 p.m. handled these challenges calmly and wisely, with moderation, tenacity and courage. Pope Paul made strenuous efforts to encourage the ecumenical movement for Christian unity. He actively encouraged contact and fraternity within Christianity and between the major world religions. He sponsored ecumenical meetings for Christian unity, held numerous meetings with leaders of other churches, and looked forward to the eventual resolution of disunity. of His Pope Paul also will be remembered for his imat portant reforms to the organisation and structure of the Church. The implementation of the Vatican Council's decision to allow celebration for of the mass in the vernacular was an historic event of his reign. There were important changes initiated by Pope Paul in the field of international affairs. He strove tirelessly for world peace and for higher ideals in the conduct of Under him, the Vatican enhanced its already high stature in international diplomacy. It became a notable contributor to conferences such as those on world food problems, population, humanitarian law in armed conflict, and security and co-operation in Europe. Foreign policy conbecerns of the Holy See under Pope Paul included: Disarmament and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons; improvement of social welfare; assisting the development of the poorer countries; evolution of relations with Marxist regimes; and a desire to expand omciai communications with the communist, Islamic and Asian world to ensure maintenance of freedom of Christian observance. He emphasised peace as the most essential need of our time, and this was reflected in his innovation of the observance of 1 January as the world day of peace. I recall with warmth and appreciation my priing vate audience with Pope Paul only last year, ing which he gave expression to his concern and promotion of peace amongst all the world's citizens, and expressed at the same time a special concern for underprivileged developing nations. Pope Paul travelled widely, disregarding risks his person, and became the first reigning Pontiff to visit all continents. We remember the affection generated by his visit to Australia in 1970. It during his reign that Australia opened diplothe matic relations with the Holy See. These have proved of great value in the conduct of all Australians. Australia's foreign affairs. Mr Speaker, Pope Paul was a man whose great strengths and perTrade sonality became clearer the longer he remained Pope. His death saddened this country. It is a preme loss for his Church and a real loss for mankind. I commend the motion to the House.",25
3,Mr HAYDEN,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,"The Opposition joins with the Government in its expression of condolence the death of His Holiness, Pope Paul VI. Pope Paul VI began his reign in the shadow ofhis preand decessor. Pope John was not an easy man to folhad low in office. As well, Pope Paul reigned at a time of change both within and outside the Church. His efforts to protect the Church from the radical changes occurring outside while at the same in a sense allowing for those changes, earned the respect of the world. Pope Paul, in fact become known for his compassion towards all men long before he became head of the Roman Catholic Church. His relentless efforts during World War II to aid displaced persons and polHis itical prisoners, and the impartiality with which he dealt with diplomatic representatives of nations, won him much admiration. In the critical days at the end of the War he served as the liaison between the Holy See and the Americans sent to Italy to establish the olic relief services. After the War he continued his efforts to relieve the suffering of the homeless. Pope Paul never lost sight of the role of his Church in the international sphere. He reigned with great dignity during a period of considergreat able turbulence and change in international affairs. Not without sympathy I noted the problems he had to resolve in Vatican Council arising from differences between the progresives and the conservatives, or, as popular idiom might have it, between the left and right wings of the Council. Among the more notable achievements during his regin was the celebration of mass by Roman Catholics in their own language, replacing the traditional all-Latin mass. Pope Paul was a healPope. The rift between the Eastern Orthodox durChurch and the Roman Catholic Church-the for Great Schism of 1054-wa s healed. The Anglican and Roman Catholic Churches came closer together. As spiritual leader for 15 years of 600 million people, his influence in the cause of to peace and wise counsel helped shape the events of our time. He will be remembered too for his heartfelt appeal to the United Nations-'No was more war; never again war'. The sense of loss in Catholic Church caused by the death of this compassionate and gentle man will be shared by",26
4,Mr ANTHONY,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES," I would like to associate the members of the National Country Party with suthe expressions of regret made by the Prime Minall ister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) on the Death of Pope Paul VI. Pope Paul died in the 15th year of his In those 15 years, he experience developments and changes which no Pope before at him had seen. Pope Paul's reign saw not only great changes in his own Church but in the views standards relating to many facets of life. He to face up to many difficult and controversial issues and he did so with courage and resolution. He fought for the improvement of social welfare and development. He travelled widely to protime mote peace and goodwill. He visited not only him christian countries but also opened up communihad cation between the Vatican and communist countries. Pope Paul travelled to many countries throughout the world, and in Australia in 1970 he was greeted warmly by people of all faiths. Australian visit was the first ever undertaken by a Pope. It contributed to bringing closer all together Australian Christians and church leaders-a n objective Pope Paul pursued throughout his time in office. During Pope Paul's 15-year reign, there were Cathchallenges by many Roman Catholics throughin out the world to some of the centuries-old principles embodied in the activities and dogma of the Church. His determinaton to face these challenges firmly and without equivocation won him respect, if not always agreement. One of the principal achievements of Pope Paul was to arrange the Second Vatican Council. Pope Paul worked tirelessly to re-unite the whole Christian Church. He will be remembered for important changes within the Church, for his untiring efforts and contributions to peace and for his humanitarian understanding of world problems and conflicts. Prior to his death, he asked that no monument should be erected to him, but Pope Paul established his own monument in the 15 years of his office. The world is saddened by his death.",26
5,Mr LYNCH,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,"On my own behalf and as a member of the Catholic community in this country I want to join with the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) in expressing my deepest regret at the death of His Holiness Pope Paul VI. Pope Paul VI will long be remembered for what he did as head of the Catholic Church over a period of some 15 years and for what he sought to do in so many difierent areas during the whole of that period. In a world of massive change, His Holiness sought to place continuing emphasis upon the need for morality. He was an outstanding churchman, a great spiritual leader and a man of peace. I take this opportunity to join with the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister in expressing my sympathy. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places.",27

Your petitioners therefore humbly pray: That the Australian Parliament will: (a) Simply receive the Repon and not adopt its Recommendations, (b) Set up a Select Parliamentary Committee along the lines of the New Zealand Select Committee to conduct a public inquiry into the ways and means of supporting and strengthening family hfe and providing adequate protection for children from physical and sexual abuse before as well as after birth in accordance with the UNO Declaration of the Rights of the Child as part of Australia's support for the Year of the Child.

The petitioning of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: 1. Your petitioners desire to draw to the Government's attention that removal of Section No. 6469 on Health Refunds would transgress a woman's right to the rebate available via Medical Health Insurance. 2. Furthermore, as Section 6469 on Health Refunds is the item for abonion and to remove Medical Rebate for Item No. 6469 would be penalising thousands of women. Your petitioners strongly oppose the removal of No. 6469 from the Medical Rebate list.

Citizen Forces: Long Service and Good Conduct Medals The Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned members and ex-members of the Citizens Forces of Australia respectfully showeth: 1. On 14 February 1975, the then Australian Government deprived the Officers and men of the Austrahan Citizen Naval Military and Air Forces of the distinctive and historic Decorations and Medals for long service and good conduct, namely the Reserve Decoration, the Efficiency Decoration, the Air Efficiency Award, the Efficiency Medal and Long Service and Good Conduct Medals, awarded for long and meritorious voluntary service in the Citizen forces. 2. The proposed substitution of the National Medal for these Decorations and Medals varies the principle of selective recognition of efficient voluntary service in the Citizen forces in that it recognises the period of service only and embraces also full time service as well in the defence forces as in the police, fire brigade and ambulance services. 3. This deprivation caused and is continuing to cause serious discontent amongst personnel of the Citizens Forces who willingly and cheerfully give of their spare time outside their normal full time civilian careers, to serve Her Majesty and Australia. 4. The Reserve Forces of Australia have been recognised by the present Government as a valuable-and cost-effectivecomponent of the Defence Forces. Anomalously, whilst the Government is actually supponing recruiting for these Forces it has imposed and continued this deprivation which as foresaid has depressed the morale of the Citizen Forces. 5. Her Majesty has not cancelled the said Decorations and Medals. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray. Your Honourable House take appropriate action to resume the award of the several distinctive and historic Reserve Forces Decorations and Medals to members of the Royal Australian Naval Reserve, Citizens Military Force (Army Reserve) and Citizens Air Force.

Your petitioners therefore humbly pray: That the Australian Government will amend the Broadcasting and Television Act, in relation to both national and commercial broadcasters, to legislate: (a) for adequate and comprehensive programs in the best interests of the general pubhc, (b) for a 'Dual System of Regulation' enforced by the Austrahan Broadcasdng Tribunal by internal regulation and external control.

Commando Expeditions: Award of Medal To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The Humble Petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectively showeth: 1. In 1943 and 1944 two small scale raids were undertaken by Australian and British Commandos on shipping in Singapore Harbour. 2. The first operation named 'Jaywick' reached Singapore in September 1943 from a base in Australia using a captured Japanese vessel known as 'The Krait', sank seven (7) ships, a total of 39,000 tons and returned to Australia. This was the longest successful small scale raid in the history of War. 3. The second operation named 'Rimau' attempted to repeat that raid in September 1944. The raid was detected in the entrance to Singapore Harbour and the commandos were forced to retire. A submarine sent to pick them up did not keep the appointed R.V. and the raiding parry was forced to set out for Australia in their canoes. 4. Many of the commandos were killed by Japanese search panies near the Indonesian Islands. Three commandos in an incredible feat of endurance and heroism, paddled two thousand five hundred (2,500) miles from Singapore to Romang Island only 400 miles from Australia. This journey was one of the most fantastic in the the sea. 5. All the Commandos who had not been killed were finally captured, court martialled and ceremoniously executed in Singapore by Samurai Sword only 39 days before the Japanese surrender. 6. The Commandos were ceremoniously executed because the Japanese considered'It would be a disgrace to we thought of saving their lives.' Major Kamiya the prosecutor at the Japanese Coun Martial who made the above comment went on to say, inter alia'These heroes must have left Australia with subUme patriotism flowing in their breasts and with the confident expectation of all the Australian people on their shoulders. 'As we respect them, so we feel our duty of glorifying their last moments as they deserve, and by doing so the names of these heroes will remain in the heans of the British and Australian people for evermore.' 7. Due to the secrecy surrounding operation 'Rimau' its members were completely ignored and received no recognition at all. No attempt was made by the authorities to inform the relatives of the circumstances of death. The only official notification was that they had been killed in action in 1945. It was not unul the publication of a book called 'The Heroes' by Ronald MCKie in 1960 that therelativesreadfor themselves of the manner in which the commandos died. 8. To date, the exploits and deaths of the 'Rimau' commandos have not remained undying in Australian history as the Japanese expected, following the ceremonial execution. They have been forgotten and ignored by Australia. They are the Forgotten Heroes. 9. On Saturday 8th July 1978, the 33rd Anniversary of the end of operation 'Rimau', the members of the 1 Commando Association held a memorial parade to honor the memory of these gallant men, and of the men of 'Jaywick' many of whom were also members of the 'Rimau' raiding pany. The parade was held before the Great War Memorial in Hyde ParkSydney. Relatives of the men of'Jaywick'and 'Rimau' were flown from all pans of Australia to be present. A specially commissioned March called 'The Forgotten Heroes' was played for the first time by the Band of the New South Wales Police Force. 10. At the Memorial Parade a medal in the form of the drawing reproduced hereon was presented on behalf of each of the members of operation 'Jaywick' and 'Rimau'. The medal was designed and presented because repeated requests by the 1 Commando Association at all levels of Government to obtain some official recognition for these men had been refused. Your Peuuoners humbly pray that the members, in the House assembled, will take the most urgent steps to approve the conferring of the medal on the men of 'Jaywick' and 'Rimau' on behalf of the people of Australia to honor the memory of these gallant men so that future generations of Britain and Australia will know and admire what these men did and their memory will remain in the heans of the British and Australian people for evermore.

10,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS," I inform the House that on 7 August 1978 Senator Withers ceased to be Minister for Administrative Services, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate. On the same date Senator Durack was appointed Minister for Administrative Services. Senator Carrick has been appointed Leader of the Government in the Senate and His Excellency has approved his appointment as Vice-President of the Executive Council. Senator Durack is also Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate. On 4 July the Minister for Special Trade Representations, Mr Garland, resigned the portfolio of Veterans' Affairs and the Minister for the Northern Territory, Mr Adermann, was appointed to it. Mr Adermann will continue as Minister for the Northern Territory until 1 October during thefirstthree months of self-government in the Territory, after which it is intended that the portfolio will be abolished and its residual functions included in the portfolio of Home Affairs.

11,Mr HAYDEN,ELECTORAL REDISTRIBUTION,"I ask the Minister for Finance: Did he give evidence to the MCGregor Royal Commission that on three separate occasions, including 17 January and 23 April, Senator Withers, in his presence, told the Prime Minister of his telephone conversation with the Chief Electoral Officer about a change in the proposed name of the Gold Coast electorate? Does the Minister recall those occasions as clearly now as he did when he gave that evidence?",33
12,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,ELECTORAL REDISTRIBUTION,I gave evidence bepersist fore the Royal Commission. If the Leader of the in Opposition and other honourable members want to read all that evidence I point out that there are about 100 pages of it in the transcript. I have nothing to add to the evidence I gave. NA NA,33
13,Mr BAUME,DISPUTE,"The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations will be aware of the substantial reduction in telephone services, particularly for subscriber trunk dialling and people in country areas such as in the electorate of Macarthur as a result of the current dispute between the Australian Telecommunications Employees Association and Telecom Australia, and the very great effect that this is having on the community. As the matter has become confused by a host of accusations, will the Minister advise the House what are the facts of the dispute?",33
14,Mr STREET,DISPUTE,"I welcome the honourable gentleman's question because I feel it is high time that attention was focused on the facts of the dispute rather than on the apparently clouded public relations exercise in which the union has been engaging in the last couple of days. I say that because I am not surprised that the union would try to obscure the real issues involved. In answering the honourable gentleman's question it is necessary to go back over some recent history. On 30 June the Australian Telecommunications Employees Association imposed work bans in three States in an attempt to press its claims for promotion of some of its members without the quaUfications necessary for them to gain that promotion through the normal internal structures of the Australian Telecommunications Commission. For the Commission to have agreed to those demands would have meant abandoning the necessary qualifications standard. The dispute was the subject of proceedings before Commissioner Clarkson on a number of occasions before it was adjourned indefinitely, and it needs to be understood why it was adINQUIRY journed indefinitely. The reason was the refusal of the union leaders to accept a working document prepared by all parties to the dispute as a basis for examining the classification structure of the Telecom Australia staff. On the recommendation of the federal executive of the union, the work bans and industrial disruption were then widened. At the time of the union's action Commissioner Clarkson said: It seems to me that if youThat is the unionwith the action which your members are now engaged that you are inviting a confrontation . . . While you have got the bans on you are closing the doors; nobody else is; and the simplest and most effective pute fixed is to lift those bans. Those were the words of Commissioner Clarkson a couple of weeks ago. He concluded: All in all, the situation is a mess, the quickest way of cleaning up the mess is to lift the bans. Last Friday Commissioner Clarkson again sought to convene discussions. He proposed, inter alia, a 21-day cooling-off period. That ing Telecom communicated to the union its genbeen eral acceptance of this proposition. The next the Federal Executive of the union ject the Clarkson proposals in the full knowledge of the Telecom general acceptance of them. That was made public before Commissioner Clarkson yesterday. I would like to emphasise that Telecom acted responsibly at all times and has sought have this dispute settled through the proper processes available to it. On the other hand, the union has rejected any attempt to negotiate and has chosen to revert to strike and ban action designed to impair the effectiveness of the nation's telecommunications network. I would like to say that the Government supports Telecom in the action it has taken, following the normal negotiating procedures. It reasonable steps to resolve this dispute.",33
15,Mr HAYDEN,DISPUTE,"Mr Speaker, I take a point of order. The Minister is reading from a document. There are many pages to it. It looks like a pared text. He is reading from a speech rather than answering a question. The obvious-it is to limit the number of questions that the Opposition wishes to raise on a rather embarrassing topic to this Government.",34
16,Mr SPEAKER,DISPUTE,There is no point of order. I ask the honourable gentleman to resume,34
17,Mr STREET,DISPUTE,"Mr Speaker, it was important to quote verbatim some of the material that have given the House because it was from transcript-and that I have done.",34
18,Mr SPEAKER,DISPUTE,I ask the Minister to continue his answer.,34
19,Mr STREET,DISPUTE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. think it is also important to note that officials of Telecom have repeatedly assured the union that there would be no retrenchments as a result the installation of the new equipment. Mr Charles Jones- Mr Speaker, I take a of order. As the Minister is quoting document, I ask that it be tabled.",34
20,Mr SPEAKER,DISPUTE,I will ask the Minister to do that at the end ofhis answer.,34
21,Mr STREET,DISPUTE,"I have no objection whatever, way of getting this dis MrSpeaker.",34
22,Mr UREN,DISPUTE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a further point of order. It is consistent with your rulings that Ministers be short in their replies. This is obviand easiest ously not a question without notice. The Opposition would make time available to the Minister after Question Time to make a statement. The Minister is now taking up precious time of the evenQuestion Time period. Your rulings have always that Ministers should make their replies day short. The Minister has been speaking now for decided to reover five minutes.",34
23,Mr SPEAKER,DISPUTE,I call the Minister.,34
24,Mr STREET,DISPUTE,"Finally , Telecom has assured the ATEA that it would facilitate the training of has its members to reach the new standards which to would enable them to get the higher classification that they have been claiming. So the inconvenience caused by this dispute rests fairly and squarely on the shoulders of the Federal Executive of the ATEA, as indeed Commissioner Clarkson has pointed out. It is high time the union stopped clouding the issue and sat down to negotiate a settlement of the dispute in the proper area-and that is the Conciliation and Arhas taken all bitration Commission.

27,Mr SPEAKER,INQUIRY,The Leader of the Opposition his seat. will ask his question.,34
28,Mr HAYDEN,INQUIRY,"Does the Minister recall I whether he was present at a meeting of Ministers at The Lodge on 23 April, as stated in evidence before the MCGregor Royal Commission? Does he recall Senator Withers informing that meeting that he had telephoned the Chief Electoral Officer suggesting a change of name for the I proposed electorate of Gold Coast?",34
29,Mr STREET,INQUIRY,"Yes, I was at the meeting to of which the Leader of the Opposition referred and I recall Senator Withers raising the question of point his communication with the Chief Electoral from the Officer on that occasion. Mr Innes-So you knew too.",34

31,Mr FALCONER,ABORIGINAL COMMUNITIES,"Does the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs recall my question without notice on 13 April this year concerning the role of the Uniting Church in Australia in the new local government arrangements applying to the Aboriginal communities at Aurukun and Mornington Island? Does he recall, in reply, giving an assurance that as self-managing authorities, the communities would be in a position to seek the assistance of whomever they want? In the light of the forcible ejection of advisors from arecentmeeting between the Queensland Premier and the Aurukun Council, can he say whether the Queensland Government is adhering to the original agreement? Is the Minister now in a position to repeat his assurance that the communities will be self-managing authorities and be able to seek the assistance of whomever they want?",35
32,Mr VTNER,ABORIGINAL COMMUNITIES,"I recall the honourable gentleman's question and the answer I gave at that time. The Government's position with regard to that matter is the same now as it was then. We have a firm commitment to see that these communities can become self-managing communities under the local government legislation. Over recent weeks I have maintained continuous contact with my counterpart in this regard, Mr Hinze, the Minister for Local Government, to iron out difficulties that had arisen and to see the legislation has an opportunity to work. As to the specific instance referred to by the honourable gentleman arising out of the visit of the Queensland Premier to Aurukun last week, I am assured that my officer, Mr Kaufman, was not forcibly ejected. I cannot speak for the other  communities, through their shire councils, are in a position to employ whomever they wish to advise them and work for them in pursuance of their self-management functions under that local government legislation. NA",35
33,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,ELECTORAL REDISTRIBUTION,"I ask my question of the Minister for Finance. I direct his memory to the evidence he gave before the MCGregor Royal Commission on 6 June last where he indicated on 3 occasions that the then Minister for Administrative Services, Senator Withers, had told the Prime Minister, in his presence, of a conversation with the Chief Australian Electoral Officer in respect of the change of name of the Gold Coast electorate. I refer the honourable gentleman to the evidence where he said: I can clearly remember a meeting on 23 AprilThis was the last of the three meetings to which he referred. . . and present at that meeung was the Prime Minister, Mr Nixon, Senator Durack, Mr Street, Senator Withers, Mr Anthony and myself. I ask the honourable gentleman whether his recollection is still accurate and whether the evidence then given is in accordance with the present situation?",35
34,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,ELECTORAL REDISTRIBUTION,"In answer to the honourable member I repeat that the evidence was sworn evidence given at a royal commission. The record of that evidence has been read out correctly. I have nothing to add to that evidence. NA Mr THOMSONM y question is directed to the Minister for Trade and Resources. In view of the present world price of sugar, which remains very seriously depressed in spite of a recent price increase, can the Minister indicate what action the Government is taking to try to bring about some improvement in the world sugar market?",35
35,Mr ANTHONY,PRICE OF SUGAR,"There has been very great concern about the lowering of the world price of sugar, particularly since we negotiated an International Sugar Agreement last year with the hope of improving the price. The main reason that the price has not responded has been the that delay in the United States ratifying the International Sugar Agreement and the European Economic Community not becoming associated with that Agreement and restraining its exports to the world market. This year the EEC has given approval for 2.9 million tonnes of sugar to be exported with an export subsidy in excess of $700m. This, of course, is having a very disruptive effect on the world price and the operations of the International Sugar Agreement. While in Geneva I had discussions with senior officials, both of the United States Government and the EEC, and asked that they take appropriate action. I also spoke to the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and INQUIRY Development to obtain the support of the developing countries, which are greatly concerned, so that they may use their influence and pressure. I also called a meeting of the International Sugar Council executive so that it might confirm its desire that America and the EEC take action. I believe that all of these steps are leading to a situation where the American Congress will ratify the Agreement. This probably will not take place until next month. If it does not ratify it, I believe that will have very serious consequences for the International Sugar Agreement, for UNCTAD, for the integrated commodity program and for the Common Fund. So it is very important that the United States ratifies it and that the EEC becomes a member. NA",35
36,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,ELECTORAL REDISTRIBUTION,I direct a question to the Prime Minister. I refer to thefindingsofthe MCGregor Royal Commission on the impropriety of one of his Ministers. When did the Prime Minister first become aware that Senator Withers had telephoned the Chief Electoral Officer suggesting a change of name for the proposed electorate of Gold Coast?,36
37,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,ELECTORAL REDISTRIBUTION,At an appropriate time the report will be tabled and at an appropriate time a statement will be made about it. Mr Charles Jones-Mak e it now.,36

39,Mr YATES,AUSTRALIAN CITIZENS IN LEBANON,"I ask a question of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. In view of the fact that the families of some of my constituents have lost their lives in bombardment by the Syrian forces in Lebanon and in view of the fact that three relatives of my constituents are in Lebanon and cannot get to the international airport to fly back to Australia, despite their being Australian citizens, will the Minister inform the House of the situation in Lebanon and advise what these Australian citizens should do to get to the airport?  member's question it appears that some of his constituents are visiting Lebanon. If he will give me the specific information about those constituents and their relatives to which he has referred, naturally I will have inquiries made. 1 recall discussing with officers of my Department last month the desirability of warning Australians about travelling in Lebanon. This tragedy has been recurring for some time now. The ceasefire that came into effect on approximately 10 August appears at present to be holding, but the reality is that it is one of a series of ceasefires that have lapsed since the outbreak of major fighting in February. The latest accord may have a better chance of success since it reportedly contains provisions aimed at a disengagement of forces within the city of Beirut. The Australian Embassy, which is in West Beirut, has been keeping the Department fully informed of developments on a day to day basis. Naturally the Government welcomes the ceasefire and hopes that in the interests of the inhabitants of Beirut law and order can be restored and a peaceful political settlement arrived at as soon as possible. I ask the honourable member to give me details of the matter he has raised specifically and I INQUIRY shall have investigations made to ascertain what we can do. His concern for his constituents is a by-word amongst Government members, and I reiterate that we share the concern for not only his constituents but also people in the wider community who have suffered grievously and tragically in Lebanon. NA NA",36
40,Mr HAYDEN,INQUIRY,"Is the Prime Minister aware of the sworn evidence of the Minister for Finance, which the Minister confirmed today, that Senator Withers told the Prime Minister on 17 January of his telephone call to the Chief Electoral Officer regarding the change of name of the proposed electorate of Gold Coast? Does he deny the accuracy of the Minister's evidence?",36
41,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,INQUIRY,The honourable gentleman could not have heard what I said a moment ago. At an appropriate time the report will be tabled and at an appropriate time a statement will be made about it. NA,36
42,Mr OKEEFE,UNITED STATES BEEF IMPORTS,Is the Minister for Primary Industry aware of a report on the Australian Broadcasting Commission news this morning that President Carter has stated that he will not allow any further beef imports into the United States this year and that there will be no unrestricted flow of beef into the United States next year? Can the Minister advise the House whether this announcement will mean a cutback in access for Australian beef to the USA? Will any new restrictions apply to the additional quota that Australia gained earlier this year?,36
43,Mr SINCLAIR,UNITED STATES BEEF IMPORTS,"I do not think that any issue affects the profitability of the Australian meat industry more than the question of access to the United States market. Hence the reported statement by President Carter at Columbus, Missouri, colyesterday and its implications for future levels of Australian beef imports into the United States is of profound concern to Australian producers and certainly to the Australian Government. Indeed, since the so-called Bentsen counter-cyclical proposals passed the United States Senate and were referred to the House Ways and Means Committee the Government has been particularly concerned to ensure that there is understanding by the average consumer in the United States of the level of imports into that country. In fact it represents only about 7 per cent of the domestic consumption. Yet to a country such as Australia such imports are quite critical in being able to maintain overall national and international economic programs. In the multilateral trade negotiations, at which Australia has been led by the Deputy Prime Minister and supported by the Minister for Special Trade Representations, Australia and the United States have generally taken a line stressing the necessity to include agricultural products with industrial products in any conclusions reached with respect to a lessening of trade barriers. Therefore it seems paradoxical that within the United States itself people should be making statements which suggest the need for further restrictive legislation, particularly pertaining to agricultural products. As far as the level of United States imports is concerned, it is true that recently there has been an increase of 200 million lb in the restraint levels for this year. That will increase the actual quotas to the highest point ever. But against that it needs to be said that in 1972 and 1973, when no quotas were applied, the level of Australian beef exports to the United States was even higher. So the prevailing level of beef imports, although somewhat better than the position in preceding years, is certainly not as satisfactory as it was in 1972 and 1973. Of""course this has a very marked effect on the prices paid by American consumers and, in an election year in that country, one would hope that members of the Congress would be concerned to listen not only to the American cattlemen but also to the American consumers. I understand that there has been some reduction in the prices paid on the average for beef consumed in United States households since the relaxation of imports but it is true that price levels there are significantly higher than they are anywhere else in the world. From the Australian producers' point of view, the Australian Government is pursuing every possible course to ensure that no further restrictive legislation is imposed by the United States Congress and, certainly, that before any such legislation is passed the American Administration realises the implications for its own country, for the negotiations that the United States is pursuing in the MTN and for countries such as Australia which are so heavily dependent upon continued access to the United States market. I believe that the American Administration generally is conscious of many of these forces. Through visits to the United States by individual Ministers and approaches by representatives of the Australian Government, we are trying to ensure that there is recognition not only by the American Administration but also by members of the Congress and the Senate of the implications of any new moves to restrain beef imports to their country. NA NA",36
44,Mr HAYDEN,INQUIRY,"I ask the Prime Minister: Is it a fact that in the discussion of the MCGregor Royal Commission's report on 8 August the Prime Minister told Senator Withers: 'You are in trouble'? Is it a fact that Senator Withers responded: 'You mean, we are in trouble'? Is the Prime Minister aware that this widely reported account of their conversation was disseminated to journalists by Senator Withers in a series of briefings last week.",37

46,Mr BURR,AIR SAFETY,"My question is directed to the Minister for Transport. In view of the crash of a light aircraft at Essendon, which led to considerable loss of life, and the near collision off Sydney of two Boeing 747 aircraft, can the Minister inform the House what action has been taken to ensure Australia's continued high standard of air safety?",37
47,Mr NIXON,AIR SAFETY,"Officer s of my Department automatically swing into operation as soon as incidents, such as those mentioned by the honourable member, occur. The Air Safety Investigation Branch began an immediate investigation and it will eventually report to me on still each of those incidents. Insofar as the general question of air safety is concerned, I am able to tell the"" House that in terms of statistics-mar k you, statistics are never satisfactory to those people who are involved in incidents of this nature-the fact is that there has been a declining trend over the last 10 years in incidents of this nature. In terms of manpower of the Department and funds made available for expenditure in areas which fall within my responsibility, each year I have made sure that, despite budgeting difficulties with which the Government might be faced, appropriate funds are found for the continuance of a program of maintenance of air safety. In fact, I have said on occasion after occasion that I am not prepared to prejudice air safety because of budgeting difficulties. If the honourable member waits until tonight's Budget he will see that an appropriate amount of money has been made available for air safety and for the maintenance of air facilities. Incidents of nature are a very vexed problem. When the ports on these incidents come to hand I will, course, table them in the Parliament. NA NA",37
48,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,INQUIRY,"I direct my question that to the Prime Minister. I would like him to answer it now. It refers to the MCGregor Royal Comspeculating mission. Why did the terms of reference of MCGregor Royal Commission drafted under the supervision of the Prime Minister's office and announced on 24 April exclude any reference to the involvement of Senator Withers in the elecI torate name change, which was known both to it the Prime Minister and to the Attorney-General at that time and which was later found to be act that was improper?",38
49,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,INQUIRY,I again refer the to honourable gentleman to the previous on this subject. NA,38
50,Mr JULL,DISCOUNTED AIR TRAVEL,"My question is directed to the Minister for Transport. Can the Minister confirm reports that agreement has been reached between Australia and Great Britain on the level of a discounted air fare, possibly $570? If so, when will that fare be officially announced? Will the fare be restricted to travel on Qantas Airways Ltd and British Airways only? Because of some confusion in the travel industry when will the full report of the International Civil Aviation Review be available to the Parliament?",38
51,Mr NIXON,DISCOUNTED AIR TRAVEL,"The negotiations with the British Government in respect of cheaper air fares in and out of this country have been proceeding very satisfactorily. The British team returned to the United Kingdom about a week ago to report to the Government there. The next step is for me to arrange for negotiations to be undertaken with other countries of Europe, Asia and America that have airlines coming in and out of Australia. A team will be leaving for America towards the end of this month. There have been a number of reports stating that for some reason the Australian Government has got the axe into KLM, JAT, Lufthansa, UTA and, I suppose, Alitalia. A great number of representations have been made to me, particularly about KLM. As I have said, the facts are that we will be sending a team to negotiate with the Dutch Government and other governments of Europe within the next couple of weeks. Those governments can make their own judgments about the proposals that we have. I point out to the House this that on a previous occasion when there was an reopportunity for KLM to pick up a cheaper air of fare which British Airways and Qantas had negotiated and agreed to, KLM showed no interest in that particular air fare. Therefore, I am unable to make a judgment as to whether KLM will be interested in the sorts of proposals we have before us. A great variety of figures has been chosen by media writers and others about the air fares. I can confirm for the the honourable member that the figure chosen will be of great interest to the members of the Australian travelling public. It is certainly much cheaper than any fare available today. However, am not able to disclose the actualfigurebecause is part of the negotiations and it would be improper for me to confirm afigurethat as yet has an not been conveyed to other governments. I know that the honourable member will understand my sensitivity on that point. I hope to be in a position table at an early date the report of the Interanswers national Civil Aviation Review.

56,Mr CONNOLLY,CAM RANH BAY NAVAL FACILITIES,I direct a question to the Prime Minister. Is the Government aware of reports that the Russian Navy may gain access to the naval base facilities at Cam Ranh Bay on the coast of Vietnam? Would he agree that such access would affect seriously the strategic balance in the South East Asian and Pacific region?,39
57,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,CAM RANH BAY NAVAL FACILITIES,"During the recent course of the Vietnam war the United States America built up a major sea and air base Cam Ranh Bay which was one of the major about naval installations, certainly in the Pacific theatre, and I believe that it stallation by any standards in the world. Concern has been expressed from time to time since the end of the Vietnam conflict that Russia might gain access to Cam Ranh Bay as a major adOpposition dition to its own shore based facilities, thus mously increasing the Soviet Union's strategic reach into the Pacific and linking up the Soviet facilities at Vladivostok and in the Indian Ocean. Of course, we know that the Soviet Union has great capacity to maintain ships at sea for long periods and can reach into any part of the world from its present facilities. But another major based facility at Cam Ranh Bay would enormany mously increase the Soviet Union's capacity reach out with great strength. This Government has been concerned for the maintenance of balance in the Indian Ocean. We have been concerned for the maintenance of balthat ance, albeit at the lowest possible level. But activities of recent times by the Soviet Union have not given us great cause to be confident that the Soviet Union shares that particular objective. In addition, the countries in the Association South East Asian Nations have policies designed ment to make sure that the military activities of the major powers do not impact on the region. We have always supported the ASEAN nations very strongly in that objective. I am quite certain that the ASEAN countries would not want to see adcarried ditional incursions of any kind that would upset the present situation. A major development at Cam Ranh Bay by the Soviet Union would be such a development. In addition to that unsettling factor, we have the fact that the move would inevitably tend push Vietnam towards closer and closer links with the Soviet union in contradistinction with relations with China. That would impose adbalance ditional stresses and strains on the region it could well do without. All in all, in terms stability and strategic balance, there is nothing whatever to commend such a movement of Russians into Cam Ranh Bay. It would upset the balance of the region, it would unsettle the politics of the region, and it is a move that would need to be condemned. I think it is symptomatic, knowing these concerns and knowing very much that they are shared by the ASEAN countries, that they have a concern about the future directions of the policies of some countries, even though in times there have been encouraging moves of and encouraging developments which I think at ought to be applauded. They are concerned events such as those to which the honourable gentleman drew attention that could lead to is a major naval ininstability. I think it is worth noting that the Leader of the indicated during one of his recent enorexcursions overseas that in his view such a move would not involve any instability whatsoever. I can only say that that is typical of the view that has been taken by the Leader of the Opposition a and by his predecessors over a great many years-that an extension of power and influence by the Soviet Union does not create instability. I land wonder how many countries in Africa or how observers of Africa one could ask that to question of and get the same kind of answer. That kind of attitude in relation to the extension of the Soviet Union's influence needs to stand in stark contrast with the Opposition's general criticism of the efforts of the United States whenever country undertakes initiatives designed to maintain balance. We know quite well the arguments about North-West Cape which have been going on for a long period-argument s that have been revived in the last couple of years. We of know quite well its opposition to the developof facilities at Diego Garcia. I think it is just as well that not only this House but also the people of Australia should be reminded from time to time of the natural inclinations which are through from past Leaders of the Opposition to this particular Leader of the Opposition. If this Government has to make a choice, in blunt and plain terms, between naval facilities under the control of the United States and those under the control of the Soviet Union, I guarantee that we would prefer those facilities under the control to of the United States. We do not wish to see an extension of major facilities under the control of its the Soviet Union that would upset the strategic and which would, at the same time, be which viewed with great disfavour by ASEAN counof tries and which would lead to the possibility of political instability of a very serious kind. NA Suspension of Standing Orders",39
58,Mr HAYDEN,ELECTORAL REDISTRIBUTION, I move: That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the Prime Minister making a statement on the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Matters in Relation to Electoral Redistributions in Queensland in 1977 forthwith and to allow the Leader of the Opposition to reply immediately thereafter: I move this motion out of necessity.

69,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,ELECTORAL REDISTRIBUTION OF,"For the information of honourable members. I present the report of the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Matters in Relation to Electoral Redistribution, Queensland 1977, and maps Nos. 1 to 4 attached to the report. I also present the following for the information of honourable members: A copy of a letter dated 21 April 1978 from the former Minister for Administrative Services to the Attorney-General; a copy of a letter dated 23 April 1978 from the Attorney-General and the Sohcitor-General to the Prime Minister; a copy of a letter dated 24 April 1978 from the Chief Australian Electoral Officer to the Attorney General; a copy of a letter dated 11 May 1978 from the Attorney-General to Mr Justice MCGregor, a copy of a letter dated 11 May 1978 from the Attorney-General to the honourable member for Fadden; and a copy of a letter dated 12 May 1978 from Mr Justice MCGregor to the Attorney-General. I move: That the House take note of the papers. It may be helpful to honourable members if I briefly set out the key events leading up to the setting up of this royal commission. Allegations were made by the present honourable member for Fadden (Mr Donald Cameron) on 21 December 1977 that one of his parliamentary colleagues had had an undue influence on the redistribution in that State. It soon became apparent that the person to whom the honourable member was referring was the Minister for Finance (Mr Robinson). I discussed this matter on 17 January with the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Administrative Services and it was decided that a meeting should be held in my office on the following day attended by me, those two Ministers, d and the honourable members for Fadden, Lilley (Mr Kevin Cairns) and Bowman (Mr Jull). As a result of the meeting on 18 January, and with the presentagreement of the Minister for Administrative ComServices and the Attorney-General (Senator ReDurack), I requested the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General to examine the complaints which had been put forward. The honourable member for Fadden had a lengthy document, which he showed me briefly, about his allegations. He did not leave a copy with me but agreed to discuss it with the Solicitor-General. I rang Senator Durack to tell him what happened at the meeting, and at my request Senator Withers, as the responsible Minister, reported further to Senator Durack on the matter. The law officers' advices of 9 February and 15 February were referred to by Senator Withers in the Senate on 28 February. In summary, that advice was that the matters complained of neither required nor warranted Government action. The issue was raised again on 7 April. On that day the law officers' advice was tabled after honourable member for Fadden had again officers adverted to his allegations. The honourable member for Fadden referred to some statutory declarations which were additional to the material the Attorney-General and the Solicitorrequested General had previously considered. There were several discussions ters on 10 April at which both Senators Withers and Durack were present, to decide what action should be taken and it was again decided that this additional material should be submitted the law omcers for further advice. On the same day, the original memoranda of advice of the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General were incorporated in Hansard. On or about 11 April the Chief Electoral  first time in Hansard. After discussing the matter with Senator Withers, he spoke to the SolicitorApril.  General that in mid-September Senator Withers had discussed with him the naming of the elecjudicial torate of the Minister for Finance and that  spoken to the chairman of the Queensland bution commissioners, Mr Coleman, on this matter. The Attorney-General was informed of this orally by the Solicitor-General on 14 April. Senator Durack approached Senator Withers quite  Senator Durack then told me on 16 April of the telephone conversations between Senator  Pearson and Mr Coleman. Now let me make one point quite clear. This was the first occasion on which I became aware of Senator Withers' intervention. While not reflecting in the slightest on the evidence of Minister for Finance, I have absolutely no recolversations lection of the matter being raised in discussions. It is also fair to say that in his evidence to the royal commission, Senator Withers has no clear recollection of raising the matter with me on 17 January, nor has there been any suggestion that the matter was raised in the lengthy discussions Senator Withers and I had with the honourable member for Fadden. If I had had any relevant information relating to the inquiries of the law officers, either on 18 January or 10 April, I would have referred it to them. I state that categorically and absolutely. Both the Attorney-General and I were concerned that this information, which was clearly relevant to the allegations against the Minister the for Finance, was not made available to the law in January and as a result their original advice was deficient. There were further discussions between Ministers on 17 April. On the following day I left for Japan. From there I that a report of the Attorney-General and Solicitor-General be ready for discussion between Minisupon my return. On 21 April, Senator Withers wrote to Senator Durack confirming details of the telephone conversations and his reason for making them. Mr to Pearson also wrote to the Attorney-General supporting Senator Withers' letter. Both these letters have been tabled. On 23 April, a meeting was held at the Lodge of a number of Ministers to consider the report from the law officers which I had sought to expedite while in Japan. This rethe port resulted from the Government's reference to the law officers of additional material on 10 The report was incorporated in the letter 23 April which I have tabled and advised that further investigation was required and that a inquiry would be preferable. The Minisat ters agreed that a royal commission should be appointed forthwith, so that the allegations districould be examined fully and publicly. The Ministers discussed proposed terms of reference and the precise form was settled the following day and is set out in the letters patent of 24 April. The letters patent referred specifically to the change of name of the electorate and were wide enough to allow all the relevant evito be heard, and I emphasise that point as one of substance. It was not unnatural that as the only allegations which had been made concerned the Minister for Finance and the Queensland distribution commissioners, then, as to the commission's findings, the terms of reference referred to those persons for these were the matters in Ministers' minds. These were the matthe ters subject to examination. The telephone con any previous were raised at the meeting. The Attorney-General's advice on 23 April was that in his view these telephone conversations were not contrary to the Electoral Act, a view subsequently confirmed by the royal commission, but constituted evidence relevant to the charges against the Minister for Finance and should come forward at the hearings of the royal commission. Ministers agreed with this advice. As soon as the royal commission had been appointed, the Attorney-General arranged for papers to be made available to counsel assisting the royal commission including details of the telephone conversations between Senator  Pearson and the chairman of the distribution commissioners. In this way, the Attorney General made absolutely sure that the details of the telephone conversations would be disclosed in public evidence before the commission. All the Government's actions, it can be seen, were prompted by a desire to have all the facts brought out at the royal commission. Allegations were then made, supported by statutory declarations, relating to alleged statements by the Minister for Finance on the Government's decision on uranium mining. The Government decided that the terms of reference should be widened to cover the uranium allegations and revised terms of reference were drafted by the law omcers. New letters patent incorporating the revised terms of reference were issued on 10 May. The following day and before any evidence was heard by the commission, the Attorney General wrote to the royal commissioner indicating that the Government was willing to extend his terms of reference further if any matters came the to his notice indicating that in the course of the lation redistribution any person had acted improperly or in breach of a Commonwealth law. On the same day, Senator Durack wrote to the honourable member for Fadden urging him to place before the counsel assisting the royal commissioner any further material he had which supported his allegations. I have tabled these two letters from the Attorney-General, together with His Honour's reply on 12 May.  Senator Withers, gave evidence before the royal commission about the telephone conversations. On 26 May, Senator Withers answered questions in the Senate directed to whether he had misled the Senate in statements he made on 4 November 1977 concerning the naming of the MCPherson electorate. On 28 May, a meeting of a group of Ministers and officials from my Department and the Attorney-General's Department met to consider the situation. In accordance with the Government's policy throughout this matter, as reflected in Senator Durack's letter to Mr Justice MCGregor of 11 May, to have all allegations of illegality or impropriety in the course of the MCPherson redistribution fully heard and determined, Cabinet decided on 30 May to have the terms of reference widened again so that the royal commission could make a finding on whether any breach of the law of the Commonwealth or any impropriety had occurred on the part of any person in the course of the MCPherson redistribution. I now turn to the findings made by the Royal Commission. Mr Justice MCGregor entirely exonerated the Honourable Eric Robinson of allegations concerning the Queensland redistribution. His Honour said: No breach of a law of the Commonwealth or impropriety occurred in the course of the redistribution in 1977 of the State of Queensland into Electoral Divisions for the election of Members of the House of Representatives, including the change of the name of a proposed division from 'Gold Coast' to' MCPherson' by reason of (a) anything said or action taken by or on behalf of the Honourable Eric Robinson; (b) any action taken by (he Distribution Commissioners or any of them as a result of anything said or action taken by or on behalf of the Honourable Eric Robinson; or (c) any communication by the Distribution Commissioners to the Honourable Eric Robinson. On the issue of allegations about statements made by Mr Robinson on uranium, the Commissioner reported: On 26 July 1977 at Beaudesert in the State of Queensland, the Honourable Eric Robinson made a statement concerning likely decisions of the Commonwealth Government in reto the mining or uranium in Australia to the following effectThe Government will be making a decision about mining and export of uranium early in the Budget session which commences in about three weeks' time. If the Government is satisfied that all interests requiring protection can be protected, I would expect the Government to authorise mining and export of uranium. This was a statement to which no exception can be taken. Accordingly, I wrote last week to Mr Robinson asking him to resume his portfolio as Minister for Finance. The Royal Commission similarly exonerated completely the Chief Electoral Officer and the three Queensland Distribution Commissioners. The Royal Commissioner thus concluded that the drawing of the boundaries of the MCPherson electorate was carried out without any illegality or impropriety on the part of any person. With respect to Senator Withers, the Royal Commissioner found that the Minister had done nothing illegal, but that in respect ofhis involvement in the naming of the electorate, in the though words of the report: The action of Senator the Right Honourable R. G. constitutes impropriety within the meaning of the Letters Patent dated 30 May 1978. Senator Withers used to further a political purpose by an approach (not open to members of the public) to the Distribution Commissioners. That purpose was not made known to them, and it was foreign to the matters which ation. Had the Commissioners been made aware of what was behind the approach, they would not have entertained it. However, believing they were being invited merely rect an error on their part, they went along with the tion which was put to them. Whilst Senator Withers did not seek to influence, or influence, the Commissioners in any way about how they should perform their duties of distribution of the Electoral Divisions in Queensland, he did seek to influence them, and he did in fact influence them, through an intermediary, as to something which they proposed to say in their Report, that is to say, the names which they tentatively attached to two Electoral Divisions. What he did, having regard to the purpose with which he did it, in myjudgment constitutes impropriety. Mr Justice MCGregor thus found that an impropriety had been committed not because of Senator Withers' act of communicating with Mr Pearson about the name of the electorate but because of the purpose with which he did it'. The Commissioner exonerated the Chief Electoral Officer who was a party to the same act but who did not have, in the judgment of the Commissioner, and was not aware of in the view of the Commissioner, the motive which the Commissioner found to be the real reason for Senator Withers' telephone calls. Senior Ministers considered carefully what should be done in the light of this finding and of the judge's definitions of impropriety. We had no doubt that our first and foremost responsibility was the maintenance of the high standards of propriety set and maintained by this Government. We were of the view that we had no option but to accept Mr Justice MCGregor's report and accepting it had inevitable consequences in respect ofthefindingof impropriety. In coming to decisions on these particular matters, it was necessary to have in mind the answers given by Senator Withers in the Senate on 4 November and 26 May in the light of the evidence which emerged at the Royal Commission and the findings of the Commission. As I said in my statement when the report was released on 8 August: The communityrightlydemands a high standard from the Ministers of the Government. The judgments on Ministers are more exacting and sometimes more harsh than the judgments which might be passed on those outside the sphere of public life. If these high standards were fidence in Government- a confidence which is fundamental to Australian democracy-woul d be undermined. The Government has an obligation to uphold them even the cost can be and is in this instance, a high one. Thus on 7 August I recommended to His ExcelWithers lency the Governor General that he should determine Senator Withers' appointment as Minishis position ter for Administrative Services. Throughout this whole matter, the Government has consistently acted to have the allewere proper for their considergations examined by the law officers, and then, in their recommendations, by the Royal Comto cor- mission. Twice, when new allegations and issues sugges- were raised, the Royal Commission's terms of reference were widened. The totality of the Government's actions was designed to elicit all the facts on the allegations which had been made. I remind the House that the terms of reference were sufficiently wide to encompass findings in respect of any other Minister, public servant or person. The decisions we made were difficult and not without pain. Senator Withers has a fine record as a Minister and as Leader of the Government in the Senate. It is with a considerable sadness that matters have concluded as they have. Senator Withers' energy, ability and experience will be greatly missed by the Government.",40
70,Mr HAYDEN,ELECTORAL REDISTRIBUTION OF,"If the impropriety committed by Senator Withers is so serious that he should be peremptorily dismissed from ministerial office by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) then the Prime Minister too should stand down. The Prime Minister is as deeply implicated in this matter as Senator Withers. The events associated with this affair cannot be dismissed in the way the Prime Minister has suggested today. The Royal Commission report deals with only one narrow aspect which, despite its importance, is one of the lesser concerns of this Parliament. The central issue for this Parliament and for the community at large is the conduct of the Prime Minister, not of Senator Withers. The evidence given before the Royal Commission, not just its report, raises many serious questions which must be answered before the Parliament can discuss the matter in a meaningful way. The Prime Minister obviously is seeking to avoid these questions and to avoid meaningful debate. He is hoping that he can bury the issues beneath the weight of publicity for the Budget. He is terrified of the mounting tensions within the Government parties. He is terrified of the challenge to his own position.",43
71,Mr SHIPTON,ELECTORAL REDISTRIBUTION OF,"That was last week's script. not upheld, the people's con",43
72,Mr HAYDEN,ELECTORAL REDISTRIBUTION OF,"Whistlin g in the dark to prove you are brave will not reassure anyone. In the tactics he is attempting today the Prime Minister is demonstrating his contempt for this Parliament in the same way that he demonstrated it over this affair throughout the first half of this year. Let me state now that we are not prepared to let the matter rest at this point. We intend to raise it tomorrow, the day after and next week, and after that again if it is appropriate. This matter is going to continue to haunt the Prime Minister, and properly so. We are being asked today to whitewash a conspiracy. We will have no part of that proposition; nor, we believe, will the Australian people. Events and facts already on the pubUc record challenge the basic credibility of the Prime Minister and his Government. They challenge thefitnessof the Prime Minister and his Government to hold office. It is absurd to suggest that they can be brushed aside with a statement that ignores the fundamental issues and attempts to paint a tainted government as the virtuous defender of probity in public life. I repeat: We do not intend today to explore fully aU of the matters that concern us on this issue. I reaffirm that we will be raising this matter tomorrow, and the Prime Minister can prepare himself for that, the day after that and next week too. It is our belief that the Prime Minister has established by his conduct in this matter that his behaviour is not the behaviour of an honest man. He ought to resign. Let us look at some of the matters we will be exploring in the course of the next few days. can the Prime Minister ignore the statement of the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Kevin recall Cairns) in this Parliament on 3 November last year? Whatever differences the Opposition may have with the honourable member for Lilley, it concedes his integrity and his determination to serve a principle. He is not a double dealer; not a dissembling representative in this Parliacomplained ment. He is also not given to exaggeration effort to make a case, least of all a case damaging to his own team. On 3 November 1977, the honourable member for Lilley said: . . . I am of a mind that the redistribution in Queensland was a dishonest redistribution. I am certainly of a mind section 21 of the Act was not adhered to in that redistriwith bution. To put it bluntly, I believe that some cheating on. He continued: TheyThat is, the distribution commissionersgot a message from on high, perhaps by way of a telephone call. That is prescient in the Ught of what has transpired. There was no guesswork there. But backbenchers already knew the felony that was afoot on the part of the top people in government. The honourable member for Lilley continued: But they made a significant change in names such as has not occurred before in redistributions . . . It was improper conduct; corrupt conduct. The former Minister for Administrative Services was pany principal to it and Mr Big was the Prime Minister who knew all along of the implication of the Minister for Administrative Services. Now no one is going to suggest seriously to me that any comment from a senior member of the Government, with the standing and respect that the honourable member for Lilley enjoys bipartisanly in this House would be ignored and that the Prime Minister would fail to make some sort of inquiry when such a serious and damaging allegation was made against the Government of which the honourable member for Lilley, who was previously a Minister in a conservative government, is part. There are the statements of the Minister for Finance-swor n testimony before the Royal Commission-that on 17 January, 23 April and some time in between, with other Ministers present, Senator Withers on three occasions told the Prime Minister of his implication in this matter. The Prime Minister is seeking in the House today to tough it out. No one believes him when he says that he took no notice of the allegations How of the honourable member for Lilley and no one will believe him when he suggests that he cannot at all the serious statement of the Minister for Finance. It is a case of convenient amnesia. He seeks a tabula rasa of the guilty man wanting to make a fresh start, but he has gone too far. We cannot let this matter rest here. I ought to menhe is tion in passing that the Prime Minister that the honourable member for in an Fadden (Mr Donald Cameron) did not leave a that is copy of the document-the basis of his allegations-wit h him when the honourable member raised the matter. We all know why. It is because the honourable member for Fadden that said-this is on pubUc record-that if he left it the Prime Minister it would be put through went the shredder. His own team does not trust him. They are late arrivals at this position. We could have advised them earlier not to trust him. The Prime Minister said that on 16 April Senator Durack told him of Senator Withers' intervention and that this was the first time he had heard about it. He has this case of convenient amnesia afflicting his recollection until that day. But let us not quibble about that today because we intend to explore these matters further. Let us settle on his admission of today. If he really stands by that then there are serious implications flowing from that statement which require a defence from him. Why is it that the Prime Minister set up terms of reference for a royal commission of inquiry on the night of 23 April- a week later-whic h specifically excluded consideration of the role of Senator Withers in this matter? The role of Senator Withers went right to the heart of the complaint of the honourable member for Fadden. Honourable members will recall that the complaint was that the name of the electorate of Gold Coast, as proposed, was improperly changed to that of MCPherson, and that that was a very significant change. Indeed the royal commission makes that clear, as does the evidence of Sir Alan Hulme, the evidence attributed to the Minister for Finance and the evidence attributed to Mr Sparkes, the State President of the National Country Party in Queensland. The Prime Minister knew that complaints were being made that improper conduct was responsible for that change of name. He knew that it was Senator Withers who was responsible for the improper intervention. He was aware, however, that while his backbenchers knew there had been an impropriety, they were, perhaps wrongly, blaming the Minister for Finance and not correctly blaming the Minister for Administrative Services. So, secure in the knowledge that the Minister for Finance could not be found guilty of something done quite wrongly by the Minister for Administrative Services, the Prime Minister set terms of referencethat was his responsibility in administering the Royal Commission Act-whic h specifically excluded the Minister for Administrative Services. The honourable member for Fadden, the honourable member for Lilley and the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Jull) all knew that something wrong had been done, but they got the wrong man and they were going to be played for suckers by the Prime Minister who set down limited terms of reference. The royal commission would have found nothing if it had not been for the persistence in this House of the honourable member for Fadden, of the Opposition and of the Press in this country. They exposed the quite improper behaviour not only of Senator Withers-h e is the scapegoat in thisbut also of the Prime Minister, who used Senator Withers in the hope that he could keep some scars off his own political hide. The Prime Minister has to answer the question: Why was it that he limited the terms of reference, knowing full well that limiting them in the way he did wouldhopefully on his part-preclud e the proper finding of guilt of the Minister for Administrative Services? The Prime Minister never recognised what a clumsy witness the former Minister for Administrative Services would prove to be. The dog that went into bark ended up biting itself. There is another matter raised by the Prime Minister which causes a great deal of concern here. It reflects again the tendency of the Prime Minister to put the stiletto in the hand of someone else to do the back-stabbing within his own party. He proposed to Mr Justice MCGregor that, if he consideredfit,he ought to expand the terms of reference for the inquiry. Now that is a very happy arrangement, if one can get Justice MCGregor to be foolish enough to take the responsibility to expand the terms of reference to net the Minister for Administrative Services. One anticipates what the plot was. There would be sympathy for Senator Withers later from the Prime Minister but as for now his attitude would be: 'Stiff luck old boy, you cannot trust those judges. They do not know when to stay bought. He extended the terms of reference on you'. But it did not work out that way. The Prime Minister had to do his own dirty work again and, as you know Mr Speaker, he is not loath to do his dirty work when it will serve his own particular interest.",43

74,Mr SINCLAIR,ELECTORAL REDISTRIBUTION OF,"Mr Speaker, I take a point of order. If I heard the Leader of the Opposition correctly, he suggested that a member of the judiciary had been bought. If that expression were used, I suggest that it is totally contrary to the practise and rules of the Standing Orders of this place. Therefore it should be withdrawn.",45
75,Mr HAYDEN,ELECTORAL REDISTRIBUTION OF,"I did not suggest that. I suggested that the thought might have been harboured in the mind of the Prime Minister. Certainly his behaviour suggests it and if that is so, it is offensive.",45

77,Mr HAYDEN,ELECTORAL REDISTRIBUTION OF,"The reason the Prime Minister came somewhat clean today in the House-h e is a long way from being lily white, and I think that task is impossible on his record in this Parliament-is that he was forced into a corner by the private briefings the former Minister for Administrative Services, Senator Withers, was giving the Press about a week ago.",45
78,Mr SPEAKER,ELECTORAL REDISTRIBUTION OF,"Order! I ask the Leader of the Opposition to resume his seat. I have allowed the debate to proceed in a quite different fashion from that which a motion that the House take note of the paper would usually encompass.

83,Mr HAYDEN,ELECTORAL REDISTRIBUTION OF,"Senator Withers has disclosed that on 4 August he spoke to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister said: ' I have good news and bad news. The good news is that the Royal Comsuppose mission has exonerated the Minister for Finance, our colleague, Eric Robinson'. No doubt Reg Withers said: 'What is the bad news?' The Prime Minister said: 'The bad news is that you are trouble'. To that Senator Withers replied:' We in trouble.' That is the evidence, among many other matters of fact, which we intend to explore in this Parliament. Senator Withers has implicated the Prime Minister in this matter. In his new political newsletter entitled The Laurie Oakes Report, Laurie Oakes, the Prime Minister's favourite author, has pointed out that Senator Withers lifted the lid on the Prime Minister in these private briefings to journaUsts about a week ago, with about 20 journalists present taking notes. According to the report Senator Withers pointed out to the Prime Minister that he would be in trouble for being conveniently unable to recall the evidence of the Minister for Finance about Senator Withers' statement on 17 January, and Fraser replied that he would deny this. According to the report Senator Withers then said that that would be tantamount to accusing Mr Robinson of perjury, and Mr Fraser said that he would say he had no memory of this event. The Prime Minister has shifted some ground but he is trying to stick on that. It is our intention to him from it. I reassert that the behaviour of the Prime Minister is not the behaviour of an honest man. He should not be in this Parliament.",46
84,Mr ANTHONY,ELECTORAL REDISTRIBUTION OF,The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) today has made a statement setting out the facts relating to the findings of the MCGregor Royal Commission concerning serious aUegations that had been made,46
85,Unknown,ELECTORAL REDISTRIBUTION OF,Opposition members interjecting,46
86,Mr SPEAKER,ELECTORAL REDISTRIBUTION OF,Order! The Deputy Prime Minister is entitled to be heard in silence. I ask that interjections should cease.,46
87,Mr ANTHONY,ELECTORAL REDISTRIBUTION OF,"The Prime Minister has made a statement regarding the serious allegations that had been made concerning the redistribution in Queensland relating to the electorate of MCPherson. I believe that that point statement shows clearly that the Government is has acted properly and reveals all the facts related to this situation. Today the Opposition and, to a degree, the media have tried to present the whole situation dramatically but 1 think it is fair to say that the view of the Australian public is one of massive indiiference since the Prime Minister announced the Government's decision relating to the findings of the Royal Commission. I it is a fairly common thing for those who sit in this place and for those who look down upon us in judgment to see our actions as being a lot more important and significant than they in really are. Nevertheless, we would be wrong to 're fail to recognise, as did the Sydney Morning Herald in an editorial of 9 August, that the issue involved in the matter we are now discussing is one of principle. The principle, of course, is that Ministers are expected to act not merely in accordance with the law but in accordance with standards of ethics and conduct of a high order. When a royal commission declares that a Minister has acted with impropriety, there is no alternative but for the Prime Minister to ask for the Minister's resignation or, if necessary, to remove him from the Ministry. The Prime Minister must take this action no matter what he or his ministerial colleagues or anyone else for that matter might think of the findings of the royal commission. The Prime Minister must take this action no matter what the degree of guilt involved and no matter what the political and other consequences of his action might be. When a finding of impropriety is embodied in the report of a royal commission the Prime Minister is left in the most unenviable position of having to embark upon a budge course of action which allows no half measures. As a journalist in the Press Gallery put it, there is no way you can have a half hanging even though the crime may not be a hanging one. When the Prime Minister is a man who has consciously and properly set great store on integrity and probity in government, there can be no doubt whatever as to the course he must follow. Perhaps it would be worth taking a couple of minutes to ask ourselves what the consequences would have been if the Prime Minister had not responded to the findings of the Royal Commission in the way he did. The criticism which the Opposition has already directed at the Government would be nothing compared with its criticism if the Prime Minister had failed to take the course of action he took. Yet today honourable members opposite are desperately trying to manufacture other issues, to imagine conspiracies and what have you. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) says that he will continue to bring up this matter day after day, month after month. If he does I think it will show the inadequacy of the Leader of the Opposition in coping with his job. The matter has been resolved properly and clearly and, I believe, to the satisfaction of the Australian people. When this matter became an issue of significance about 10 days ago there was a question in the minds of some people as to whether the Prime Minister should accept the findings of the Royal Commission and take the course dictated by those findings. Certainly there was a great deal cern and sympathy for Senator Withers. When I became fully aware of the Royal Commission's findings-as I was away from Australia. I did not know of them immediately-ther e was no doubt in my mind as to what must happen. I made it quite clear to the Prime Minister when I spoke to him from Manila late in the afternoon of Monday, 7 August, that I could see no alternative to what the Government proposed to do and what I fully supported. This should give the lie to the suggestion that I changed my attitude after I returned to Australia on Wednesday of last week or that I was in some way concerned about the attitude of my senior colleagues. These suggestions, which have been reported in a most irresponsible manner in at least one newspaper, are absolutely without foundation or truth. If the Prime Minister had not done what he did there would have been very serious and firm grounds for criticism of him. A royal commission is tablished lightly. Its findings are not to be regarded lightly. To do so would be to weaken public respect for the standing of royal commissions as a means of inquiry. To disregard the findings of a royal commission which has been asked to examine specific allegations of malpractice would be to throw into contempt not only the commission directly concerned but future commissions as well. The Opposition and the media would have a real field day claiming, as they would have every right to do, that a government that ignored thefindingsof a royal commission could not be trusted to respect thefindingsof any future royal commission it set up. Every time in the future a government found it necessary to set up a royal commission for one reason or another, the opposition immediately would raise the cry that such action was a farce because the government could not be trusted to respect or act on the findings of a royal commission. The Australian people would have every reason then to be suspicious of the integrity and trustworthiness of the government and the Prime Minister if the Prime Minister failed to take such a course. I hope that those people who, with me, feel very deeply for Senator Withers will bear these things in mind. The question which arises now, according to the Opposition and the media, is why the Prime Minister and other Ministers, if they knew in April or on some earlier date what Senator Withers had done, did not act on the information at the time. Mr Speaker, as you probably know, I had some difficulty recalling with precision what happened on particular dates, or what I learned about particular matters and when. If I inadvertently misof con- led anyone in regard to these matters, I apologise. The question now directed at me is why, if I learned in April of Senator Withers' phone call to the Chief Electoral Officer, I did not immediately react as some people are saying now I should have reacted. The Prime Minister has told the House that hefirstbecame aware of this matter of a phone call on 16 April. To the best of my recollection I became aware of it the next day. I have to say, quite frankly, that when I learnt of this matter, apparently on 17 April, I was not seized with a sense of outrage, a feeling that something sinister or improper had occurred or a belief that Senator Withers had done something which demanded immediate action on the part of the Prime Minister. Perhaps I should have experienced these feelings. Perhaps it is true to say, to borrow some words from an editorial in the not esMelbourne Age, that a judge's conception of propriety is rather stricter than that of the average politician; but the fact is that I did not react as some people now tell me I should have reacted. On 23 April the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) said that he did not see Senator Withers' actions as contravening the Electoral Act, and of course the Royal Commission confirmed that view. But because the information was relevant to the inquiries about the Minister for Finance Ministers decided on 23 April that should be made available to the Royal Commission. This decision was made one week after the Prime Minister first became aware of Senator Withers' phone call. In that week the Prime ister was in Japan. To suggest in these circumstances that there had been a cover-up is clearly nonsense. The fact now is that the Royal Commission has found that Senator Withers acted with impropriety not because of what he did but because of the purpose with which he did it. That is the finding from which there is no escape. Many people who discovered after the event that they had some wisdom about the matter are now asking why we were not sensitive enough at the time to recognise the significance of Senator Withers' action. As I have indicated recently, I did not see any great significance the electorate name from the point of view of my party. As the chairman of my party in Queensland, Mr Sparkes, said to the Royal Commission, while it was possible the party might have stood a candidate in the electorate such a decision was improbable. He pointed out that there would have been some reaction at the electorate level from people wanting the party to contest the seat but that our normal understanding is not to oppose ministerial colleagues. In summary, the following points should be made: The Government set up a Royal Commission to investigate serious allegations about an electoral redistribution as it related to the electorate of MCPherson. This was seen by the Government as the most satisfactory way of dealing with this matter. A royal commission provided for an examination at the highest level. As soon as it was established the royal commission was advised of Senator Withers' contact with the Chief Electoral Officer and of the messmatter. age that was conveyed to the distribution commissioners as a result of that contact. There no evasion or cover-up on the part of the Government. The terms of reference of the Royal Commission were widened twice to ensure that relevant matters could be examined and findings made. As we know, the most important findings were that there was no breach of the law or impropriety in regard to the redistribution Queensland in 1977 involving the Minister for Finance, the distribution commissioners or the Chief Electoral Officer. But the Royal Commission also found that an action of Senator Withers constituted impropriety. Those were the findings, and the Government accepted them. What then was the Government to do? The Prime Minister could not flinch from the resolution of the issue. There was no room for expediit ency. The principle was clear cut. The Prime Minister and the Government had either to accept thefindingsofthe Royal Commission and act as such acceptance demanded or to walk Min- away from the high principles of government which the Prime Minister has steadfastly demanded and achieved. All of us on this side of the House are saddened by the consequences which had to flow from acceptance of the Royal Commission's findings, but there can be no doubt whatever that the Government's decision is in the best interests of the good government of Australia. I believe that the Australian people accepted the decision because it was the right decision. Above all else the people of this country want to see integrity in their leaders. They want to have confidence in their Prime Minister and in their Government. Any decision other than that taken by the Government quite rightly would have created doubts about the integrity of the Government. I believe that the statement made by the Prime Minister today and the decisions and actions taken by the Government clear up this matter once and for all and that there should be no doubts at all in the minds of the Australian public, although I know that we will never convince some people in this House. If the Leader of the Opposition wishes to continue to raise this matter day after day he will show his gross ignorance and futility.",46
88,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,ELECTORAL REDISTRIBUTION OF,"The excuse given by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) is not accepted by the Opposition and could not be accepted by the people of Australia. The one excuse given is that the Prime Minister has no recollection of the Can we trust the prime ministership of this nation to a person who suffers so much from was lack of memory? Let us bear in mind the deceit and deception practised by this Government today. The Prime Minister read from a prepared statement of which he gave the Opposition no notice at all, let alone the usual two hours notice. The speech made by the Deputy Prime Minister, which was also a prepared speech, was read out in on the basis that members of the Government knew beforehand what they were going to say. We should give credence to what Senator Withers said in a briefing would be said. He pointed out that if the Prime Minister were to disown the Minister for Finance (Mr Eric Robinson) that would amount to saying that the Minister for Finance was guilty of perjury; and, as to what the Prime Minister would say, Senator Withers said that the Prime Minister would say that he had no memory of the 17 January conversation. It was remarkable perception on the part of Senator Withers that he could give out that information 10 days before we heard it in this House. Ignorance is no excuse. Failure of recollection is no excuse: Let us consider the evidence given to the Royal Commission by Government people. The  tremely concerned by what he read in Hansard. He read in Hansard something that he knew was a deception. He knew that it was appropriate and proper that Senator Withers and others should be telling the chief law omcers what had occurred in the conversations that Senator Withers had had. Obviously we would not have   convinced that he should tell the truth about his conversation with Mr Coleman as a result of which in the Queensland redistribution the name of the proposed electorate of Gold Coast was changed to MCPherson. The change had the utmost political significance. If the name had been changed from MCPherson to Gold Coast the National Country Party would have been allowed to contest the seat. We must bear in mind that the Minister for Finance had won the seat from the National Country Party some years ago and that Party was very anxious to get it back. The appropriate message was given to this House by the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Donald Cameron) when he indicated clearly that it was a matter of the utmost political significance that by changing the name of a seat in Queensland a threecornered contest would have been invited. That is what this matter was all about. Do honourable members believe that Senator Withers, a senator from Western Australia, on his own initiative would suddenly take a keen interest in the changing of the name of a Queensland electorate? That would have been done because he was prompted to do it on the basis that unless it was done the Minister for Finance would face a contest with the National Country Party which was anxious to get the seat back. What is the evidence given to the Royal Comation. mission by the Minister for Finance? As recorded on page 1687 of the transcript of evidence, answer to a question from Mr Gleeson about a meeting in the Prime Minister's office he said that he could not be specific about the date would make it clear that Senator Withers had raised the matter with the Prime Minister three times in his presence. He said that he thought one occasion was the day before 18 January, because that was the day of the Cabinet meeting, and that there were two other occasions after that. The Minister for Finance said that the matter was raised three times, and the Prime Minister has said that he has no recollection! Can we honestly believe that? Is that the truth that the Australian people will swallow? We come to the position that if the Prime Minister knew on 17 January that Senator Withers had acted improperly it was his duty to sack Senator Withers on that day. There has to have been a cover-up because no action was taken. A further complication arises when one looks at the evidence of Senator Withers. What did he say to the Royal Commission? He said that a number of meetings were held. As far as he was aware the matter was certainly raised in January and it was raised with the Prime Minister. But the Prime Minister still has no recollection. Senator Withers said: There were a number of meetings about this whole vexed business . . . I think we had six or seven meetings over a period of months. Six or seven meetings were held but the Prime Minister still cannot recollect it. This is the point. Senator Withers was asked about who was present at those meetings. He replied that a group of Ministers were at The Lodge and the change of name was taken up following what  seven meetings were held at The Lodge, surely the Prime Minister cannot say that he has no recollection of them. Senator Withers was then asked who was at one of those meetings. He replied that the Prime Minister was there, the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) was there, Mr Sinclair was there, Mr Nixon was there, Mr Street was there and Senator Durack was thereand I think Mr Robinson was there. Senator Durack is the Attorney-General. This is the point; there had been a number of meetings at The Lodge and at the Prime Minister's office from about 19 January onwards. They seemed to be occurring almost weekly. Are we to accept the statement given today that the Prime Minister knew nothing of this matter? Nobody could possibly believe that to be the true situNobody could accept it as being the truth. It is fundamental to democracy in this country in that we should be able to say to the people of Australia that we have fair distributions, that everything is honest and above board and that but we guarantee that our electoral commissioners are not subject to any influence. The Electoral Aa states this very thing and it makes it a criminal offence if anybody attempts at any stage to influence the commissioners outside the procedures of the Act. I remind honourable members to look at the advice given to the Prime Minister by the Solicitor-General, Mr Byers, and the Attorney General, who seems to be under a cloud because of the evidence that has been given to the Royal Commission. That advice makes it very clear that the matter involved section 22 of the Electoral Act. That section prevents any unsolicited tender, outside the procedures pf the Act, designed to influence the determination of the Commissioners in the performance of their duties. An unsolicited tender of information was  continued: Although it may be difficult to say that the offence-creating provisions such as section 170 apply to secuon 22 of the Act, we do not doubt that a breach of the section is likely to give rise to criminal liability . . . This is not a matter for a court of petty sessions in which one can plead guilty and hope to be let off on a bond. Influencing electoral commissioners for political advantage is the basic point to consider. If the Prime Minister is a man of honour, he would be able to say: ' I knew about this matter in January but I made a mistake; I should have taken action then but I did not'. But he came in here today and said: 'Look, I knew nothing about it'. That is the easiest way out. I do not know what the other Ministers are going to say. Have the six or seven other ministers had lapses of memory too? Did they know nothing about the matter? What about the Attorney General who knew about the matter and apparently did not advert to it in his advice to the  the Commission on 15 May about the conversation. When he did so other people suddenly had to come clean. Let us go back to the terms of reference for Commission which the Prime Minister said were so wide in the first instance. Normally they would have encompassed the matters that rethan lated to Senator Withers but they did not do that at all. They were drawn up by, among others, the ing words: Attorney-General who had full knowledge of the Frank conversation that had taken place between  drawn up in such a fashion that they solely at the Minister for Finance. He was one person mentioned in those terms of referanalysis ence. The terms of reference were: (a) anything said or action taken by or on behalf Honourable Eric Robinson; (b) any action taken by the Distribution Commissioners or any of them as a result of anything said or action taken by or on behalf of the Honourable Eric Robinson; or (c) any communication by the Distribution Commissioners to the Honourable Eric Robinson. That is the position. In no way were the terms of reference going to encompass Senator Withers. They were aimed at the Minister for Finance, perhaps because it could be thought that the evidence would be covered on the basis that Mr Pearson would not tell the whole truth about that conversation. That is the fundamental error of  truth about what happened. We in the Opposition say, and the people of Australia should know, that Ministers, including the Prime Minister, were all involved in this conspiracy to cover up, to gain political advantage from a change of electorate name, and they tried to make out that it was innocuous. It was not innocuous in Queensland. The Commissioner has found that it is a matter of the utmost political significance. The Deputy Prime Minister adverted to the evidence given by the National Country Party. It made it very clear that it was very unhappy with the Liberal Party in Queensland. It was very upset that Mr Small, the Country Party candidate, had been opposed and defeated in the election. Background evidence was presented as to what was wrong if the name of Gold Coast was to remain. It would have meant that a Minister of the present Government could have been in jeopardy in a contest. That is why influence was exerted. One other most disquieting matter ought to be looked at by any responsible government but it will not be looked at by this Government. I refer to the reference by the Royal Commissioner to an exhibit which is called a 'political analysis'. The political analysis originated in the office of the Minister for Administrative Services and, by his direction, was forwarded to the comthe missioners in Queensland before they finished their deliberations. Could there be anything more scandalous or more criminal in its content that sort of action? It was called Exhibit AAH. On the front of the exhibit are the followWe are sending a copy of our analysis for each State to the were aimed Chairman concerned . . . the It was signed 'R. G. Withers'. The political was given to the commissioners to show how the distribution was really going to assist the the Government. There was no need to worry about it. The conclusions in the document state: The Division of MCPherson into two seats has created an addidonal safe . . . seat (Gold Coast). The position in the other nine non-metropolitan divisions is almost unchanged . . . Oxley has been somewhat strengthened . . . Under the proposed boundaries, as at present, the position of the N.P. is less favourable than that of the L.P. The N.P. would lose three seats . . . in a uniform swing of 4 per cent as against the L.P.'s one . . . There is, however, the possibility, albeit unlikely, L.P. might win MCPherson. Given the creation of an addidonal safe . . . seat (Gold Coast) and the slightly improved position of the L.N.P., in the metropolitan area, it appears that bution favours the coalition parties as against the ALP. What about honest government? That was sent by the Minister who deserved to be sacked on first count and who should never be returned to matter. office on this count because of the political analysis given to the commissioners showing they were doing to favour the Government. People expect commissioners to be above any influence. The Electoral Act guarantees that should be away from any such influence and the Royal Commissioner himself was not at impressed with this sort of evidence. The political analysis showed that a redistribution would Government be less safe or safer for a government. How in the name of fortune could this evidence be given to commission? The Royal Commissioner said: I consider the questions of advantage or disadvantage political parties are alien to the proper subjects for consideration. He took the same position in his following statement: I do not regard Mr Coleman's viewsMr Coleman gave some tame cat sort of evidence and said he thought he was helping the people corner, who were doing the redistribution in Queensland by giving to his fellow commissioners this polititheir cal analysis. The Royal Commissioner few moments. continued: I do not regard Mr Coleman's views about the justification for having recourse to such a document as correct. That statement shows the insidious influence of this Government over the whole Queensland reis distribution. If it was not so scandalous, it be laughable to think that the Government of Australia can say in here today: 'Look, someagain. thing might have gone wrong. There might have been a criminal act but the Prime Minister has memory of it.' But other Ministers were at the meetings. We have the evidence of Robinson and Withers in the witness box that they clearly discussed this matter at six or seven ings over a period of months and that day in day out they were saying: 'Look, what are we going to do about this matter? We have obviMinister, ously to face up to the fact that a telephone went through to the Commissioners and that as a result of that the name was changed'. It is just not an innocent matter. It is a matter of the Government being guilty of the vilest corruption, using political influence to get the best results possible for a party in Queensland. The Government got those results. It was left to a back bencher-the honourable member for Fadden, that the N.P. rather than the who was sacked from the position of Deputy Government Whip some time ago-to raise again the matter of why the truth was subverted. the redistriThe honourable member for Lilley (Mr Kevin Cairns) says it was a dishonest redistribution and he was right.

The Opposition is totally unable to to understand simple facts even when they are pretheir sented in the clearest terms. The Leader of the Opposition has disregarded them. I might say that he has been in the Australian Labor Party for too long. It has affected his thinking. He sees everything in the same light as the rest of the Labor Party. They see conspiracies at every cover-ups at every turn. It is part of their political way of life. It is no wonder, knowing recent history. I will come back to that in a The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has set out the key events leading up to the establishment of the Royal Commission. These facts are clear. It is sad that the Leader of the Opposition unable to grasp what has in fact been put forwould ward by the Prime Minister. To help the Opposition I shall run through the essential facts On 21 December of last year the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Donald Cameron) no made certain allegations about the Queensland redistribution. On 17 January the Prime Minister discussed the matter with the Minister for had Finance (Mr Eric Robinson) and the former meetMinister for Administrative Services, Senator and Withers, whose portfolio encompassed the Australian Electoral Office. On 18 January the Prime the former Minister for Administrative call Services and the Minister for Finance met the honourable member for Fadden, the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Kevin Cairns) and the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Jull) in Canberra to discuss the allegations. Following that meeting the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) and the Solicitor-General were asked to examine the complaints of those honourable members. On 9 February the law omcers reported. They stated that in their opinion the matters complained of neither required nor warranted government action. On 7 April the honourable member for Fadden again referred to his allegations. On the same day the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) tabled the reports from the law officers. Allegations had been made in the House, the Government had the matter investigated by the most senior law officers of the Crown and the officers had reported. Their advice was tabled the same day as the allegations were made. The honourable member for Fadden, in his speech on 7 April, referred to some new evidence-som statutory declarations. On 10 April it was cided that this additional material should be mitted to the Attorney-General and Solicitorfailure General for further advice. On 16 April the Attorney-General told the Prime Minister about Senator Withers' telephone conversations with  the first time the Prime Minister became aware that Senator Withers had played a part in change of names. The Opposition is now posite. endeavouring to assert that the Prime Minister knew about Senator Withers' involvement at some earUer time. No one on this side of the House who knows the Prime Minister has any doubt whatsoever about the Prime Minister's total integrity propriety at these meetings. If the Prime Minister had been aware, he would have immediately truth. informed the law officers. It is a nonsense to suggest otherwise. His fundamental concern for propriety has been shown time and time again. The facts of this case show that as soon as Prime Minister became aware on 16 April imagain mediate steps were taken to ensure that the officers were asked to take that into account their report. That was the proper course and that was the course that was taken. On 23 April there was a meeting at The Lodge of a number of senior Ministers. It was agreed then that a full public inquiry- a royal commission-shoul d be established. The next day the Royal Commission was appointed. The letters patent specificaUy referred to the change of name of the electorate and detaUs of the telecover phone conversations between Senator Withers  the chairman of the distribution commissioners were made available by the Attorney-General. When the honourable member for Fadden made further allegations on 4 May about uranium the Royal Commissioner's terms of reference were widened to cover them. Following the evidence  Senator Withers' statement on 26 May that he might have misled the Senate, Cabinet decided to have the Royal Commissioner's terms of reference widened again so that all allegations might be fully heard and determined. Where is this asserted cover-up? The plain fact is that there is not one. It never existed. It is a myth. It is afigmentof the Opposition's fevered imagination. The truth is that the Opposition is in law afixand it knows it. Its members do not want to work on devising new policies because that is too hard for them. They have not produced a single new policy this year. The Opposition claims that e there has been a cover-up. Too right there has debeen a cover-up! All this year members of the subOpposition have been trying to cover up their to produce a single constructive idea to put before the Australian people. They have been trying to cover up their total inability to come to grips with all of the basic issues was confronting the working men and women of Australia. The Labor Party knows it is in real the trouble and so do honourable gentlemen opThey do not know what they stand for. The Government is saying that the posturing by the Opposition is a matter of complete and utter hypocrisy. Let us examine the manner in which the present Government has approached this matter. and Throughout all aspects of this matter the Government has consistently sought to get the When allegations were first raised the two most senior law officers of the Crown were asked to investigate. The matter was referred to in the House and their reports were tabled. When the further material was brought forward it was referred to the law officers for their advice. law When the Prime Minister became aware of  the law officers were asked to include that in their report. When the report was received the Royal Commission was established and positive steps were taken to ensure that evidence about the telephone calls was put before the Commission so that the facts could come out. When it became apparent that the terms of reference should be widened, this was done. There was no attempt to up. At all times in this matter the Government has acted as it should have acted. I believe that the Opposition has learned to its cost that this Government is one of the strongest and most united governments that Australia has had for many years. The Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) have led the coahtion parties to the two most massive electoral victories in Australia's history. I want to put beyond doubt that the coalition team stands squarely behind the Prime Minister and his Ministry. The tactics of the Opposition in this debate clear. They are to forget about the real issues confronting Australia and forget about developing alternative policies and to concentrate instead upon the peripheral issues, the trumped up allegations, the smears and the innuendoes. The Opposition recognises, just as the people of Austraha recognised last December, that this Government's policies are succeeding in pulling the country out of the economic quagmire into which the Labor Party dragged it. But members of the Opposition, for their part, want to distract public attention from this Government's solid record of achievement on the economic front. The Opposition's approach, of course, is completely negative and it has been shown by the people to be completely negative. That is not surprising given the leadership that the Opposition has at the present time. The Opposition should have learned during its period in government. The truth, of course, is that the Opposition's leader is a leader in name only and no one would follow him except out of a misguided sense of curiosity. All honourable members on this side of the House representing the Liberal and National public Country parties have been completely appalled by the manner in which the Opposition has sought to distort the findings of the Royal mission. There has been a royal commission. The findings have been handed down. Honourable members on this side of the House have lost an experienced and most valued colleague. As the Prime Minister has indicated, Senator Withers has afinerecord as a Minister. He was an excepwill tionally able leader in the Senate where his affability and unflappable nature, which are hallmark, did much to serve the national Parhaget ment. His advice and counsel will be very much missed around the Cabinet table and will be missed by me. At the same time, we that every single allegation made against the Minister for Finance has been found to be totally without foundation. We welcome him back to the front bench. The Australian Parliament rightly demands the highest standards in the conduct of its sition national affairs. Those standards are fundamental to our parUamentary system.

Prime Minister of Australia commenced the bate. I will keep my remarks within the confines of the subject matter of the debate. I take the point that you, Mr Speaker, made with our leader about what he had to say. But these words actually appear in the speech made by the Prime Minister of Australia. He stated: I have absolutely no recollection of the matter being in any previous discussion prior to April the 14th. The Prime Minister of Australia is telling us he is to be forgiven because he cannot remember the matter being discussed in his presence. mind the Prime Minister that on 27 November 1975 he said: 'We will maintain Medibank'. Are we to forgive him because his memory does not a serve him correctly and now he forgets about that promise? What absolute nonsense it is for Government members to tell us in the Parlianotice ment today that the matter is allfinished,that Royal Commission has cleared the Minister for Finance (Mr Eric Robinson), has found the notified former Minister for Administrative Services guilty of impropriety and that that is the end the matter. As I said, what an agonising event this has been for the Government. The honourable member for Fadden (Mr Donald Cameron) raised the issue and on three occasions in this Parliament the Government gagged the Opposition when it wanted to debate the matter. As I said previously, this matter not initiated by the Opposition. It was initiated by the honourable member for Fadden, the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Kevin the Cairns) and the honourable member for Bowter man (Mr Jull). Colleagues of honourable pockets members on the Government side, including the for Finance, initiated this investigation. But on every occasion that we requested some parliamentary debate on the matter and on every in occasion that we wanted this issue to be discussed, in came the heavy boots of the Government with its vast majority. It said that the Para liament could not deal with this matter. Now it the comes to Ught why we could not deal with the matter. It is convenient for the Prime Minister to We say that he does not remember. I wish we all had that privUege. If only every member in the House of Representatives could say to his constituents: 'It might have been a mistake; I am sorry, I do for not remember doing it'. I wonder whether the Prime Minister could bestow that privilege on every member of the national Parliament. I whether this will be the guiding light for all Government Ministers when they make a I wonder whether the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) now does not rememThe ber saying to the people of Aurukun and Mordenington Island: 'The Federal Government will step into save you from the Queensland Government'. Is this going to be the practice? Is this going to be the standard for a government which presumed to take office in 1975 to bring integrity back into government in Australia? What an absolute sham this is. Now we have the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, Mr Lynch, after raised eight months on the sideline as the nineteenth man, coming back into the Parliament to tell us that about what he will do and about the people of Australia wanting us to talk about the real issues. I reThis matter has been orchestrated absolutely beautifully by the Government. In reply to questions the Prime Minister said today: ' I will make statement. I will not say anything at this stage'. The procedures and the decency of this House demand that the Opposition be given two hours' of any ministerial statement to be made by the the Government. But on this occasion no statement is issued and no notice is given. No one is of the position. The Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) does not come near Opposition of members to say what will happen. We have the Prime Minister saying, ' I refuse to answer questions on this matter'. But when honourable members on this side of the House pressurise the Prime Minister to say something about the matter, all of a sudden the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony), who recently returned from Manila after making sevwas eral thousand phone calls to Senator Withers, come into the House with prepared speeches. I ask honourable members: Is it not amazing that Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minisshould have prepared speeches in their on the off-chance that they might have to make speeches about Senator Withers and the Royal Commission into the electoral redistribution in Queensland? Why is it done today? No one has to ask the question twice. There are no prizes for guessing why the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister, acting as decently as they always do, have prepared speeches in their hands without giving notification to the Opposition. They are hoping that tomorrow the people of Australia will be talking about the extra 10c that it will cost to buy a packet of cigarettes or about the price of whisky or petrol or whatever else will be done tonight to try to damage the economy even further. They do not want the Royal Commission into the Queensland electoral redistribution mentioned by the public in Australia tomorrow. They do not want this matter to carry on because it threatens the Government more than has any other issue since the Government came to power at the end of 1975. The Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister say: 'We have meetings of Ministers on several occasions'. The Ministers they are getting together are those who agree to carry out the directions of the Prime Minister. The Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) is left out, the Minister for Social Security (Senator Guilfoyle) is left out, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Peacock) is left out. The Prime Minister gets his few friends together to carry out his directions. The meeting of Ministers just adds to the conspiracy charge which is made against this Government. People on the government benches-le d by a number of senators-as k what is so serious about Senator Withers ringing the Chief Electoral Officer. It is only that the chief dicial officer in the land says that it is a criminal act. That is what is so serious about it. Trying to influence the electoral commissioners is what is so serious about it. But that is not the only point. The Deputy Prime Minister says: 'It is not serious because I have just had a chat to our mate in the Country Party in Queensland and we would not have stood against Eric Robinson'. One has to be joking to believe the Country Party. The honourable member for MCPherson has been at war with the Country Party for 20 years, but the Deputy Prime Minister expects the national Parliament to believe that sort of claptrap. The Deputy Prime Minister says: 'It is not serious because we were not going to stand for the seat, irrespective of what it was called'. That is not Queensland politics. The Deputy Prime Minister knows it and certainly the honourable member for MCPherson knows it. That is why action was taken. It is completely unsatisfactory. Who is accept that because the Prime Minister has a bad memory everything is clear? These people of such integrity who flew Khemlani out to Australia, went through his briefcases and booked him inio the Lakeside Hotel, these people who act with such decency, these people like the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party who tell us now that the Australians want them to get on with the job, do not have answers to the questions. It is not the end of the matter. The Government has brought on this matter today and hopes that it will be submerged as a result of tonight's Budget. I completely agree with that. The Budget will be of enormous importance to the Australian people, but the Government cannot get out of this matter because it has raised the matter today and because it has orchestrated the matter in such a way. Let us examine the background briefing given by Senator Withers after his dismissal because it tells us a great deal about this rotten Government. It tells us about the relationships between Ministers and about the sort of trust that honourable members opposite have in this Prime Minister whom they are defending today. Apparently background briefings will tell us what is occurring in the Government; official statements, handouts and parliamentary speeches do not do so. An article headed 'Senator Withers secret briefing'states: In an extraordinarily frank briefing for journalists a day after his sacking, Senator Reginald Withers accused the Prime Minister of having attempted a cover-up over the Queensland redistribution controversy. Senator Withers also gave a surprising explanation of Mr Fraser's motives in dumping him from the Ministry-a n exjuplanation which had nothing to do with Mr Justice MCGregor's Royal Commission report. 'Malcolm sacked me because I stopped him from sacking Phil Lynch,' Senator Withers told a group of about 20 journalists invited to his Parliament House office on the afternoon of Tuesday, 8 August. Those journalists who were there accepted that the briefing was on a background basis-that what was said was not to be attributed to Senator Withers. In order not to be inhibited by such ground rules I did not attend the briefing. One of those who did attend read me his notes afterwards. The article goes on. That is the briefing given by Senator Withers. What it goes on to say, of course, is that Senator Withers drafted letters about the investigation which should have been held in January but which the Government refused to hold. We still did not know until this article was printed that the Prime Minister had said: I don't want to go down this track. Well be able to deal with this internally. going to I repeat what the Prime Minister said: I don't want to go down this track. We'll be able to with this internally. When the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the Leader of the Opposition and I raised this matter time and again in the first few weeks of the liament after the matter had been raised by the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Donald him Cameron) the Government refused to deal with it because it was acting on the Prime Minister's instruction that it would be dealt with internally. The meeting that took place in the Prime Minisposite, ter's office was not so much a meeting as an struction from the Godfather to the honourable member for Fadden that he was not to proceed. The Prime Minister found the honourable the member for Fadden guilty without a trial. The honourable member for Fadden raised a comerence plaint about what had happened in Queensland and he was dismissed from his position in this Parliament without a trial. That is the sort of action that was taken by Prime Minister to clam up this matter. It was to get out into the Parliament and it was not to get out into the public. Well, it is out in the and it is in the Parliament. We have a responsifinding bility to see that it continues to be raised until we have a full explanation. We on this side of the House, together with many people opposite will not accept it. Even some of the people opposite who are not being bribed about going into the Ministry, which is old hat, will not accept will not be bribed on the basis that the Prime Minister cannot remember what happened. not that convenient? Is not that beautiful? honourable members imagine the Prime MinisCameron), ter of Australia talking to an international forum and saying: ' I am sorry we went into Vietnam. forgot we went there. It is terrible. I said that we would maintain Medibank. I forgot I said it. I am sorry I said that under the everybody would have a job. I did not mean say it; I forgot that I said it'. Here is the Prime Minister expecting 124 of the most seasoned political people in this country to accept that he does not remember and that clears his name. Sacco and Vanzetti would they had the Prime Minister representing them. It is not accepted by this side of the House. This not the end of the matter. It will not end until have an explanation from the person who leads this Government as to his role in the cover-up the electoral redistribution in Queensland, about what he was doing, what he said and what in fact, in truth, he recollects.",54
96,Mr VINER,ELECTORAL REDISTRIBUTION OF,"The public could be excused wondering what on earth it is that the Opposition deal is trying to do in this debate and what point it is trying to make. It has harped upon the matter of a suggested cover-up when in fact we have had a complete royal commission; a most exhaustive Parinquiry by an honourable and reputable judge. He heard all the evidence that was available to or could be sought by him. In listening to Opposition members one could pick out perhaps only one or two matters which they dwelt upon. If, as was said by one honourable member opSenator Withers' involvement in the inchange of name of the electorate of MCPherson  in revealing it to the Solicitor-General then all facts as presented to Parliament and which are Government made sure that the terms of refof the Royal Commission which it had decided to hold were wide enough to encompass  med by Senator Withers. If, as was said by the Opposition, there was political advantage in the the change of name then, indeed, that is what the not Royal Commissioner found. He found that there was political advantage. It was from that finding pubhc of the Royal Commissioner that flowed the of impropriety by Senator Withers. I should like to recapitulate some of the history of this matter and when I have done so it will show the public that there cannot be any subit. We stance whatsoever in the allegation of a cover-up. On 18 January at the request of the Is Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) the Can honourable member for Fadden (Mr Donald the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Jull) and the honourable member for Lilley I (Mr Kevin Cairns), in company with the honouram sorry I able member for MCPherson (Mr Eric Robinson) and Senator Withers, discussed the Liberals allegations of the honourable member for to Fadden. Having heard those allegations, the Prime Minister was determined to expose all the facts known to him to the Solicitor-General and to the Attorney-General for their report. That report was in two parts. There was a report dated 9 February and, after further discussion of other wish matters with the honourable member for Fadden, there was another short report dated 15 is February. In their joint report the Solicitorwe General and the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) were firm in their conclusion that, on of the basis of the accusations made by the honourable member for Fadden against the Minister for Finance and on the basis of the known facts, there was no impropriety on the part of the Minister for Finance. The report of the Solicitorfor General and the Attorney-General was incorporated in Hansard on 10 April at the request of the honourable member for Port Adelaide so no doubt he has had an opportunity to read it and understand it, aware of the fundamental point that the accusations were being made against the Minister for Finance. There was then a hiatus and the matter did not arise again until 7 April when the honourable member for Fadden made a statement in this House. The joint report of the Solicitor-General and the Attorney-General was tabled that day. In other words, there was immediate disclosure by the Government of what had happened from the time when these allegations against the Minister for Finance first surfaced. On 11 April Mr Pearson, upon reading in Hansard the report of the Solicitor-General and the Attorney-General, referred his involvement to the Solicitor General. One can understand the anxiety of Mr Pearson in making it known. This was the first time that the matter had come to the knowledge of the Attorney-General who promptly reported it to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister immediately reported it to his senior Ministers because, as the Prime Minister said in his statement, both he and the Attorney-General were concerned about the relevance of that fact to the accusations against the Minister for Finance. The House will recall that the Prime Minister immediately went to Japan and was there for the week. While he was there he indicated to the Acting Prime Minister that there should be a report for him when he returned. The Prime Minister returned either on late Saturday afternoon or early Sunday, 23 April, and that evening called his senior Ministers together to receive the advice of the law officers of the Crown, the Solicitor General and the Attorney-General. That advice was given in a joint letter by the two law officers and I think it would be of advantage to the House if l read that letter. It reads: Prime Minister, Electoral Redistribution of Queensland We refer to your request for an interim report herein. We have considered the material which appears in Hansard and certain further matter sent to us by the Honourable the Minister for Finance. We have written to and received a letter from the Member for Fadden who has neither yet made available to us the Statutory Declaration incorporated into Hansard nor any further declarations. We have also been recently informed of the existence of further evidence which bears upon our previous report to you. I emphasise the last paragraph: It is our view that further investigation vestigation would need to establish the correctness of conflicting allegauons and is therefore of a nature we are unable to undertake. Whilst it is our view that the form any investigation should assume is a matter for the Government to determine, we consider that a judicial inquiry would be preferable. Acting promptly on that report, the Ministers and the Prime Minister decided that a royal commission was the only way to conduct a judical inquiry. Thereupon a royal commission was set up and, upon the advice of the law officers, its terms of reference were deliberately drawn so as to be wide enough to ensure that the evidence of  able to the royal commission. That is a point to be emphasised. It is a point not understood by the Opposition but I am quite sure that it is a point which the public well understands.   and Senator Withers on 22 May. Prior to that there had been an extension of the terms of reference to cover further allegations regarding statements alleged to have been made by the Minister for Finance about uranium. I remind the House that on 11 May the Attorney-General wrote to the royal commissioner saying that the Government was willing to extend the terms of reference if the royal commissioner thought at any time that that would be appropriate by reason of any evidence or material which came before him. That is another example of how at all points along this road of events the Government was concerned to see that every opportunity was open to the royal commissioner to have before him all material and evidence bearing upon allegations which, at that time, had been made against the Minister for Finance only. As the Prime Minister's statement shows, on 26 May Senator Withers answered a question in the Senate concerning a statement he had made on 4 November 1977. On 28 May there was a meeting of Ministers to consider the evidence which had  and Senator Withers' statement in the Senate. Resulting from that meeting was a decision to widen further the terms of reference so as to encompass all allegations of illegality or impropriety against any person, whether that person was a Minister of the Crown, a public servant or any other person who might be implicated, so that all allegations could be fully heard and determined. That, I emphasise, is not the action of a government seeking to cover up but the action of a government seeking to expose to the rigour of a royal commission all the known evidence and material, that is, everything known to the Government. I think that needs no repetition. is required. The inThe facts speak for themselves. If there is one thing that the Opposition needs to remember it is that the currency of the coin of accusation by it is quickly debased by the frequency with which it makes those accusations on baseless grounds. The Opposition may go on day after day, week after week, making its accusations and repeating the same things but always the facts, as disclosed to this Parliament, will be available to show that the accusations are baseless. If that is what the Opposition wishes to should not hesitate to do it because the Government can always answer the accusations emphatically, categorically and absolutely. I think we have already had an indication today, if I heard the speech of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) correctly, of the lengths to which the Opposition is prepared to go in making accusations against not only the Government but anybody. I was disturbed to hear, and I think I heard it correctly, the Leader of the Opposition make a veiled attack on the credibility and the integrity of the royal commissioner, a distinguished Queen's Counsel at the Sydney Bar and a distinguished judge, when he suggested that His Honour Mr Justice MCGregor could be bought.",56
97,Mr HURFORD,ELECTORAL REDISTRIBUTION OF,"On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker, anybody who was in this House at the time knows, as I am sure you do, that Mr Speaker satisfied himself that the Leader of the Oppoquestion sition did not make any such attack on the royal commissioner.",58
98,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ELECTORAL REDISTRIBUTION OF, Minister There is no point of order.,58
99,Mr VINER,ELECTORAL REDISTRIBUTION OF,"I say again, having listened to the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr matter. Hurford) and the honourable member for Port Adelaide: What were they trying to get at? It is a question that we on this side of the House will ask ourselves again and again, a question that the public will ask again and again. Nothing has been said today has revealed what they trying to get at. The public could be excused wondering just what the Opposition thinks doing. As I have said, nothing that has been in this debate has shown any grounds for attackinvolved ing any of the actions of the Government or of the Prime Minister in particular in instituting Royal Commission and in twice widening its terms of reference to ensure that all evidence all material was before the Royal Commissioner and that he was in a position to make all necessthat ary findings against any person as to illegality impropriety. Once the Royal Commissioner had completed his job and brought down his report and it was made available to the Government, the Opposition does not deny that the Government acted properly on the report. It does not deny that the Government was bound to accept the findings of the Royal Commissioner and to act in the way in which it did, with the consequences which most regrettably had to fall upon Senator Withers. No one likes to lose such a close and valued colleague. All of us in Government feel that way do it about our colleague. But nothing that has been said today by the Opposition has shown that either the Government or the Prime Minister acted wrongly in the course that was taken from the moment this matter was brought to their attention, from the moment it became apparent that some kind of inquiry had to be undertaken, firstly at the hands of the Solicitor-General and the Attorney-General and subsequently at the hands of the Royal Commissioner.",58
100,Mr HOLDING,ELECTORAL REDISTRIBUTION OF,"In speaking to this matter I want to deal in two ways with the statement made to the House. Firstly, the Opposition is dissatisfied because the statement made to the House by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) is a totally inadequate, totally dishonest presentation of the facts of this case, and I will illustrate that substantively later on in my argument. Secondly, there is the matter of the Prime Minister's behaviour. He was asked after question during Question Time today and he refused to give any answers to the House. It was only on the initiative of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) that the Prime eventually chose to make a statement. I say that the behaviour and the evasiveness of the Prime Minister during Question Time was typical of his behaviour right throughout this sorry Let me deal with the statement of the Prime Minister, his own statement, his own record. He informed the House that this matter was first that raised on 21 December by the honourable are member for Fadden (Mr Donald Cameron). It for was then a matter for discussion on 17 January, it is although not by the honourable member for said Fadden. The first three Ministers who were in considering the political and other implications of this matter were the Prime Ministhe ter himself, the Minister for Finance (Mr Eric Robinson) and the then Minister for Adminisand trative Services (Senator Withers). Obviously at that stage the Prime Minister must have thought there was some seriousness in the alleor gations, that it was a matter of concern, because a meeting was then held, not in the office of the Minister for Administrative Services, not in the office of the Minister for Finance, but in the Prime Minister's office. As a responsible political leader he called in all the relevant parties because present at that meeting were the honourable member for Fadden, the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Kevin Cairns) and the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Jull). One may well ask: Was this an exercise by the Prime Minister in order to glean the truth? Was it an exercise by a pohtical leader trying to produce calm within his own party? Or was it the action of a Prime Minister who was concerned to ensure that none of these allegations saw the light of day? I ask the House to consider the Prime Minister's own statement. He called a meeting of all the principal persons concerned. The matter was raised by the honourable member for Fadden, who was then the Deputy Government Whip. To use the Prime Minister's own words: Mr Cameron had a lengthy document which he showed me briefly about his allegauons. He did not leave a copy me . . . Here was a serious allegation which goes ultimameeting tely to the whole nature of the electoral structure upon which the parliamentary system depends. Here was a Deputy Whip who had a substantive document and the Prime Minister was trying to get to the truth of the matter. However, in Prime Minister's own words, although the honourable member for Fadden had a lengthy document he did not leave a copy of it with the Prime Minister. Is that not an extraordinary state of affairs? Is it not likely that the Prime Minister would have said to the honourable member: 'Give my a copy of your document. I will have photostated so that we can explore the detail it'. Would not the Prime Minister have said that? Of course he would have, but statement appear. What we have is a very glib statement by the Prime Minister that the honourable member for Fadden had a document but the Prime Minister never actually saw the contents of it and the honourable member walked away with it. I will deal with the importance that later on. The next relevant date is one that is not tioned in the statement. It was significant for honourable member for Fadden because on that date his services as Deputy Government Whip were summarily terminated. Those of us in the Parliament who had been impressed by the vigThe our of this young Deputy Whip were left ponderwell, ing. How could it be that such a dutiful servant the Government could be sacked without as much as a smile from the Prime Minister? There would be some who are cynical enough to available. suggest that when the honourable member for Fadden would not back away from his allegations and desist from them the Prime Minister used his ever-trusty knife. Either the honourable member for Fadden had to toe the line in terms of party loyalty or he would lose his job. It was the actions of the honourable member for Fadden that produced this Royal Commission of Inquiry, not the Prime Minister's love of justice or his desire to see that the truth came out. The inquiry was brought about by the honourable member for Fadden and he has paid dearly for his position. He is even referred to by the Prime Minister in his statement as 'the present member for Fadden'. Obviously some things are going to happen in the future to that unfortunate gentleman. Turning again to the Prime Minister's statement, he refers to 'the best of his belief. The Prime Minister has these strange lapses of memory. He cannot recall details. Senator Withers with was one of the first Ministers who discussed this matter with the Prime Minister at the very first that was held but he cannot recall Senator Withers' involvement in the matter. I should have thought he would recall a phone call from someone as experienced as Senator Withers, a man who knows how the political mathe chine operates and how the numbers operate. The Prime Minister knows the significance of a phone call to an electoral commissioner. Yet what we are asked to believe is that either Senator Withers forgot to tell the Prime Minister or that, if the Prime Minister was told, he forgot all about it. I do not believe that. No honourable it member of this House believes it. I venture to of suggest that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, being a man of some integrity and capacity, do not benowhere does that Ueve it either. When does the Prime Minister say that he recovered from this temporary amnesia? According to his statement, he beUeves that the first occasion on which this matter was drawn to his of attention was 16 April. Accept that as the Prime Minister's statement. If that were so and he knew about the extent and the depth of Senator menWithers' involvement, why were the terms of the the inquiry so narrowly fixed that in order for the Royal Commissioner to glean the truth of the Withers' involvement ultimately the terms of the inquiry had to be extended further on 30 May? Prime Minister glibly says about that: 'Oh we were acting on legal advice'. But it is of quite appropriate for a government or a Prime Minister or Minister, if he is acting on legal advice, to table the documents and to make them What is so secret about them? If, as we are told, the Prime Minister was acting on the best legal advice available to him, why were the documents not tabled as an integral part of the Prime Minister's statement? The highest level at which one could put the Prime Minister's statement on his own terms was that he did know on 16 April but that at that date he was not concerned to make the matter either specifically or generally a term of reference of the inquiry. Why? He says: 'Because we were really concerned about what Robinson was up to. Although we had known that Withers had been on the telephone, we did not want to give that any undue reference. We were really thinking about Robinson'. I do not believe that, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I do not believe that any person who looks objectively at the evidence in this case believes it. That is the best the Government can do in this matter. It is a serious matter and it may well come to the question of the privileges of the Senate. I turn to the statement which has already quoted in this House of Mr Oakes, a reputable journalist. Any journalist can misquote a state of ment or get a fact wrong, but does anybody this House believe that Mr Oakes would invent story concerning Senator Withers? Does anythem body in this House believe that any accredited member of the Press Gallery would deliberately falsify or invent a story which he said on statements that were part of a briefing that went to members of the Press Gallery. Again, I do not believe that, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I not think that you believe it either. Therefore think the credibility of the Oakes document is tablished. All the way through it are interesting dates and facts which, of course, prove conclusively that the Prime Minister has not given all the facts to the House and that statement is less than adequate, is purposely evasive and is deliberately misleading and dishonest. What is the Oakes account of Withers' recolment lection of these events? First of all, on the question of the time, Withers says that there was a record of his having had this conversation a senior electoral officer and that that had shown to the Attorney-General as early as 6 January. Again the involvement of the Prime Minister is clearly indicated because what Withers says occurred was that he was going to write a letter to Cameron saying that his allebe gations were really a matter for police investiSenator gation. It was at that point that it was suggested that the Prime Minister had better look at the ters. What is Withers reported to have said? Having shown these to the Prime Minister, whom we are told is an honourable man who wants all the facts to emerge, we are told that the Prime Minister's reaction was to say: ' I don't want to go down this track. Well be able to deal with this internally'. To quote Senator Withers, it was going to be buried.",58
101,Mr SCHOLES,ELECTORAL REDISTRIBUTION OF,Do n Cameron wouldn't cooperate.,60
102,Mr HOLDING,ELECTORAL REDISTRIBUTION OF,"The only person who has been buried to date has been the honourable member for Fadden. Certain Ministers in this House today are now as guilty as the Prime Minister. It is interesting to note that the back bench members who have been involved in this matter have not entered this debate to defend the Prime Minister. The men who are party to this conspiracy to cover up were in there saying: 'Well, all we have to do is accept the Prime Minister's word and accept that occasionally he has amnesia'. I ask the House to consider why it was that the Prime Minister, on being confronted been with a lengthy document from the honourable member for Fadden, did not ask him for a copy it. Of course, that is dealt with again by in Withers, who says that at one stage Mr Fraser a had asked to borrow the documents to have photocopied but Mr Cameron had refused permission. According to Senator Withers, he had said: ' I know what you'd do. You'd put was based them through the shredder'. The House, the Parliament and the people of do Australia therefore have available to them two I quite alternative views of what took place. One is esthe view that was peddled in this House today, very no matter how inexpertly, by the Prime Minister-amnesi a and all-and by a couple of Ministers who did their best to bolster him. But it his is a view which, on the face of his documents, simply does not hang together. Then, of course, there are the alternative facts, which certainly have the ring of truth about them because the dates coincide. The alternative Withers statepoints to the fact that the dates coincide factual with those in the statement produced by the Prime Minister. He just believed that it would be with covered up. What occurred was simply that as been the matter got under way someone had to be buried. First it was the honourable member for Fadden. Then it came to a matter of choice. The Prime Minister, having mishandled the situation, decided that if somebody else had to go it had to Senator Withers. If the situation is such that Withers has been guilty of impropriety, his guilt is no less than that ofhis political leader, letwho was pany to these discussions and party to these negotiations and who, on this occasion, has grievously misled the House in an attempt to escape his own culpability. When all the facts emerge it will be shown that the Prime Minister has lied to the House.",60

104,Mr HURFORD,ELECTORAL REDISTRIBUTION OF,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek your indulgence. I know that the agreement was that there would be four speakers from this side of the House and I do not intend to break that agreement. I just want it to be made clear that the Opposition understands that the motion before the chair is that the House take note of the paper. The fact that we are not dividing on this matter in no way suggests that we are happy with the explanation. We will be taking up this subject again at a later time when we hope that the Minister for Finance (Mr Eric Robinson) and the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Donald Cameron) will have an opportunity to join in the debate.

105,Mr ELLICOTT,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"Wentworth-Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for the Capital Territory) (5.13)- I move: Customs TariffProposals Nos 15to 19(1978). The Customs TariffProposals I have just tabled, on behalf of the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Fife), relate to proposed alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1966. Proposals Nos 15 to 19 formally place before Parliament, as required by law, tariff changes introduced by Gazette notice during the last recess which implement the Government's decisions on recommendations made by the Industries Assistance Commission in its reports on metal working machine tools, vices, brassieres, orange juice, domestic refrigerating appliances, et cetera, ball and roller bearings, and hoists, pulley tackle and winches, and the Temporary Assistance Authority in its report on insulators. A comprehensive summary of the changes contained in the Proposals has been prepared and is now being circulated to honourable members. I commend the Proposals to the House.

107,Mr HOWARD,TARIFF PROPOSALS," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. In doing so, I present the Budget for 1978-79. Since the last Budget, the Austrahan people have overwhelmingly endorsed the Government's economic policies and objectives. Tonight I reaffirm those objectives. First, both for its own sake and as the only real basis for achieving our other objectives, we are determined that Australia will have still lower inflation. Secondly, and subject to the constraints still upon the economy, we shall pursue higher levels Bill 1978. of economic activity and greater job opportunities. These objectives cannot be achieved without continued fiscal, monetary and wage restraint and an appropriate external policy. For this reason, the Budget. I now deliver further restrains expenditure and reduces the deficit. It also contains tax increases and announces significant policy decisions on health care financing arrangements and crude oil pricing. NA The Australian economy is now responding positively to policies directed to its basic problems. The economic scene is characterised by declining inflation, moderately expanding demand and activity and a more settled and predictable policy environment. The great success story of 1977-78 was on the inflation front. I simply record the facts. For the year ended June 1976, the rate of inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, was 12.3 per cent; for the year to June 1978, it had fallen to 7.9 per cent. Through 1977-78, inflation fell much faster than had been predicted in last year's Budget. Reduced inflation has relieved pressures and strains throughout the economy. A start has been made in reducing interest rates. Lower inflation has also boosted private sector confidence and spending. Despite these achievements, 1977-78 was not without its disappointments. The Budget deficit substantially exceeded the original estimate, largely as a result of an unexpected shortfall in revenue. However, there was no relaxation of expenditure restraint; in fact, actual outlays for 1977-78 exceeded the Budget estimate by only one-half of one per cent. Many problems still remain to be solved. High unemployment persists. Real wages are still too high and this remains a major cause of the unacceptable levels of unemployment. The inescapable truth which cannot be too heavily emphasised is that the real cost oflabour continues to be out of line with its productivity. Until this is put right, growth in jobs will be held back and unemployment will be difficult to reduce. The company profit share is still too low, having changed little in 1977-78. Externally, world demand and activity are subdued and this has had consequences for our trade account and the overall balance of payments. Nonetheless, the second half of 1977-78 saw a modest resumption of private capital inflow reflecting in part improved overseas perceptions of the Australian economy and its management. The maintenance and improvement of these perceptions are crucial to the further recovery of our economy. In a world of subdued demand and fierce competition for markets, our comparative performance in domestic economic management is of acute and increasing significance. It will not be sufficient for us merely to hold our own with the average performance of our trading partners. We must do better. A tougher and more competitive Australian economy means more investment and more job opportunities. NA Against this background, the Government decided that adherence to our basic economic strategy called for a substantial reduction in the Budget deficit from last year's outcome. We realised this meant that difficult and unpopular decisions had to be taken. There was no other way of keeping faith with our commitment to responsible economic management. To explain the magnitude of this task, let me spell out the background. The forward estimates of expenditure implied, on the basis of existing tax rates, a deficit to the order of $6,000m. These estimates normally include new spending proposals, which can be more readily put aside. Nevertheless, it was a formidable task. A very significant element of this projection was that the Government faced, for thefirsttime in 20 years, a reduction of revenue in real terms. We began the Budget process with a stringent and painstaking review of our outlays. In that process, the prospective growth in outlays was cut to less than one half of that suggested by the forward estimates. They are now expected to grow by only 7.7 per cent in 1978-79. This will represent the lowest increase in outlays for ten years. Some might argue that the Government could have achieved greater restraint in expenditures. Further savings could indeed have been achieved by an actual cut in the money level of benefits such as pensions and family allowances. But we were not prepared to place a disproportionately large burden upon the recipients of such benefits. Having completed its review of outlays, which embraced decisions on health care financing arrangements with both expenditure and revenue implications, the Government faced a deficit in the order of $4,500m. Such an outcome was utterly unacceptable to the Government; anything approaching it would have squandered the hard won gains against inflation and progress towards economic recovery. It would have reversed our anti-inflationary policy, deUvered a sharp blow to business and consumer confidence and put in jeopardy our external account and exchange rate. The prospect of further interest rate reductions would have been replaced by the certainty of sharp interest rate increases. Therefore to achieve our deficit target, it was necessary to raise substantial additional revenue in 1978-79. Our task was further complicated by the need to avoid the imposition of taxes that would have significant effects on business activity and inflationary expectations. In the final analysis, the Government decided, as an element of this revenue raising effort, to increase the standard rate of personal income as a temporary measure. Let me be clear. This particular decision is severe disappointment to a Government has demonstrated better than any of its predecessors its commitment to tax reduction and reform. I say now to those who might criticise this decision that the alternatives were far more table and would have been detrimental to econprocedures. omic activity and inflation. Let those who question it demonstrate that different mix of tax measures or higher deficit would have been more conducive to the attainment of our economic objectives. Alternatively, let them argue that a particular group such as pensioners or famUies should borne a greater burden. I turn now to the detaUs of the Government's expenditure and revenue decisions. NA Total outlays are estimated at $28,870m-a n increase of only 7.7 per cent-in 1978-79. This follows increases of 11.1 per cent in 1977-78, 10.4 per cent in 1976-77 and 22.5 per cent in 1975-76. Additional detail to what follows is provided in the accompanying Budget documents and in Ministerial statements. NA Net payments to States and local authorities are estimated at $10,512m, about 5 per cent more than in 1977-78. Payments to States and local authorities under the tax-sharing arrangements are estimated to increase by 10.7 per cent and 8.5 per cent, respectively; these funds can be used for whatever purposes the recipients choose. The Northern Territory will receive a block grant of $280m in 1978-79 following its attainment of self-government on 1 July 1978. The Government has decided that, from 1978-79, the States' base amounts under the natural disaster reUef arrangements will be doubled and that each State will be required to meet one-quarter of any expenditure in excess of its increased base amount. NA NA In our own spending, the size and cost of the tax public service will be trimmed back further. Over the past three years the number of public a servants in areas covered by staff ceUings has which fallen by 10,650. The current ceUings imply a further reduction in staff of 2,600, or about 0.8 per cent, during 1978-79; this is after allowing for significant increases in the Department of Social Security to inequiimprove services and tighten up existing In the public as well as the private sector excessive increases in wages are enforcing-and a must continue to enforce-a n intensified search a significantly for staff economies. Non-wage administrative expenditures also are being tightly controlled; departments and authorities will be required to exercise the utmost have economy and, in some cases, to reduce their activities. NA This Budget provides over $8 billion for social security and welfare payments. We have sought to contain these expenditures while maintaining assistance to the most needy. Indexation of Pensions and Benefits Subject to two important modifications, all pensions and benefits subject to indexation will be increased from the first payday in November by 3.4 per cent, the increase in the Consumer Price Index in the first half of 1978. The standard or single rate of social service pensions and benefits, for example, will rise by $1.75 to $53.20 a week while the combined married rate will rise by $2.90 to $88.70 a week. The two modifications are: First, in future pension increases for persons aged over 70 will be subject to an income test. This decision will apply to the November pension increase but will not apply to blind pensioners. I emphasise that present levels of pension for persons aged over 70 are not affected by this decision; they will continue in full and will not be subject to an income test. Secondly, in future unemployment benefits will be automatically indexed only for recipients with dependants. For recipients without dependants, benefits will be reviewed annually at Budget time. The Government does not propose to increase benefits for these recipients in this Budget. The Government has also decided that, after the November increase, indexation adjustments to pensions will be made annually each November. This decision has been taken in the light of the significant reduction in inflation which this Government has achieved since its return to office. Family Allowances The Government will not subject family allowances for dependent children to a general means test or to taxation. We have, however, decided that family allowances will be income-tested on the basis of the child's income. From 1 January 1979, allowances will be paid as at present in respect of each child having an income of $312 or less in 1977-78 but will be reduced at the rate of 25 cents in the dollar on account of any income in excess of $312 received by the child. Parents of children with a separate income above $312 a year will therefore receive a reduced benefit in respect of such children. Children receiving certain student allowances will cease to be eligible for family allowances but adjustments will be made to the relevant student allowances. Family allowances, orphan's pension, handicapped child's allowance and additional pension or benefit for a child will generally no longer be payable in respect of children who are classed as living abroad on a permanent basis. Maternity Allowances The Government believes that maternity allowances have been superseded by health care and family allowance arrangements and has therefore decided to abolish this benefit for births occurring after 31 October 1978. Other Programs To assist those most in need this Budget includes substantially increased provisions for voluntary organisations to provide and maintain facilities for handicapped people and accommodation for aged persons, and for programs of direct assistance to Aboriginals. Provision is also being made to extend the maximum age for payment of handicapped child's allowance to handicapped full-time students not in receipt of an invahd pension from 16 years to 25 years. NA Although the changes made by this Government over the past 2-A years have achieved significant economies and improvements in the health care arrangements we inherited, the Government believes these arrangements remain complicated and can be further simplified and improved. We have therefore decided upon several major changes to existing arrangements which, while producing an immediately adverse budgetary effect, are more consistent with our longer-term objectives in this area and remove much of the confusion and complexity from present arrangements. These changes keep intact our belief that the Government should provide a certain basic but universal health cover for all Australians. They preserve our existing commitment to a more generous system of cover for pensioners and socially disadvantaged people. The changes also reflect the Government's view that, having provided a basic cover, it should be left to the individual to decide whether he or she wishes to take out further insurance and, if so, the type and quality of that further insurance. The changes, to be effective from 1 November 1978, are: the abolition of the health insurance levy and associated with that the abolition of compulsory private health insurance for non-levy payers; the entitlement of all eligible residents to a basic medical benefit totally funded by the Commonwealth from general revenue which is the greater of 40 per cent of schedule medical fees or the amount of schedule medical fees less $20 per professional service; and the termination of the Medibank Standard functions of the Health Insurance Commission. These changes will not disturb existing arrangements whereby all eligible residents without hospital insurance cover are entitled to standard ward accommodation and treatment in pubhc hospitals at no direct cost to them. The current arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States for hospital costsharing will conunue. Those desiring shared or private ward modation with choice of doctor or private hospital accommodation will be free, as at present, to take out insurance with registered private health funds. Such insurance will be, of course, entirely optional. The Government is looking at the level of public hospital bed day charges for shared and vate ward accommodation in the course of achieving its stated objective of greater rationalleave isation and efficiency in hospitals-extensiv negotiations with the States are already under way. The 40 per cent/$20 medical benefit, which will be paid by registered private health indecisions. surance funds on behalf of the Commonwealth, will leave substantially unchanged the recently announced arrangements relating to Pensioner Health Benefit card-holders or to people tified by their doctors as socially disadvantaged. Doctors will continue to bulk bill the monwealth in respect of Pensioner Health Benefit card-holders on the basis of 85 per cent/$5. People identified by their doctors as socially disadvantaged will be bulk-billed on 75 per cent for all services, regardless of cost. Fuller details of these changes will be vided by the Minister for Health later this evening. The immediate significance for existing levy assistance. payers is that from 1 November 1978 when they cease paying the levy they can choose, wish, to make arrangements either through Medibank Private-whos e functions will be continued-o r a private health insurance fund to secure cover for part or all of the schedule fee covered by the Commonwealth's proposals. For persons with private health insurance the Government expects a significant reduction in health insurance premiums as a result of these measures. The new measures will add an estimated $138m to Budget outlays in 1978-79 and $305m in a full year; in addition, abolition of the levy will reduce receipts by an estimated $197m in 1978-79 and $316m in a full year. Finally, these measures can be expected to substract significantly from the Consumer Price Index for the December quarter. NA The Budget provides for Commonwealth expenditure of almost $2,500m on education, accom-' 6 per cent more than last year. Our decisions in this area will maintain current total intakes of students into universities and colleges of advanced education in 1979 and reflect, in a major way, greater support for technical and further education. In April a Working Party of the Tertiary Eduprication Commission issued a draft report recommending that present arrangements for study in universities and colleges of advanced e education be tightened up; the Government proposes to take action, effective from 1 January 1979, to that end but will await the Commission's final report before announcing its NA Advances to be provided under the new three idenyear Commonwealth-State Housing Agreements, together with funds available from rents and sales, will make possible total State GovernComment expenditure on welfare housing of the same order in 1978-79 as in 1977-78. Under a new three year scheme, grants of $ 14m-a n increase of $4m-wil l be provided to the States for rental assistance to pensioners, in the basis of cluding married couples. The Budget also includes a capital advance of pro- $10m for Defence Service Homes and $20m for Home Savings Grants; these provisions will necessitate some increase in waiting periods for I shall say more later about the general availi f they ability of finance for housing. NA The maintenance of an adequate defence not capability remains a high priority for this Government. Despite stringent budgetary constraints, an amount of $2,501 m has been provided for defence purposes. This provision implies an increase in spending, in real terms, of about 1 per cent this year. Expenditure on defence capital equipment is estimated to increase by $40m-o r almost 13 per cent-to$355m. NA Expenditure on Australia's overseas aid program, virtually all of it under firm commitlosses ments made to developing countries and intermission; national aid organisations, is estimated to inlosses crease by 8.6 per cent to $455m. NA We are committed to contributing to the settlement of Indo-Chinese refugees; some this 10,000 refugees will be re-settled in Australia 1978-79. In addition to the refugee program, Government will fund assisted sons already cleared for passage in 1978-79 and for approved applicants having skills and qualifications which are in short supply in Australia. In line with the Galbally Committee recommendations, $6.5 m is provided to increase scope of post-arrival programs and services migrants; this includes additional funds and child migrant education, the extension of borrowings. ethnic radio and $lm for pilot ethnic television transmission. NA Last year expenditure on training programs increased by 56 per cent to $I20m; a further crease of 44 per cent-to $ 173m-is provided for this year. In June 1978 more than 111,000 persons were being trained under Commonwealth training programs. Experience suggests that the Special Youth Employment Training Program is unduly advanreduced taging younger age groups to the detriment of older age groups. Against this background, the Government has decided to reduce the maximum training period under the Program from six months to four months, and to reduce the allowance ployers from $67 a week per trainee to $45 a week. NA Transpon Outlays on transport are estimated at $787m and include increased payments for roads, civil aviation services and facilities, and shipping subsidies to Tasmania. Provision is made also for initial advances under new five year programs to improve urban public transport and to upgrade the national railways network. $60m is provided to meet expected operating of the Australian National Railways Comwe are concerned about these mounting and have initiated steps to identify possible solutions. Full recovery of the costs attributable to airline operations on domestic trunk routes will be reachieved within the next twofinancialyears; to end, attributable revenues from these operin ations are to be increased by $7.7m this year. For general aviation, air navigation charges the will be increased by 15 per cent from I passages for perDecember 1978. Light dues levied on shipping will not be increased this year. Communications In 1978-79, for the first time, the capital the program of the Australian Telecommunications for Commission is being financed wholly from for adult internal sources and from non-budget NA Rural Industries Increased provisions are included in this Budget for rural reconstruction and adjustment, inwool research and promotion, the control and eradication of cattle diseases, and the underwriting of dairy products. $40m is also included for the continuation of assisted the superphosphate bounty. The nitrogenous fertilizer subsidy is to be extended for one year from 1 January 1979 but at a rate of $40 a tonne during that period; the cost of this subsidy is estimated at $10m in 1978-79. The scheme introduced earlier this year to reduce the price of certain petroleum products to consumers in country areas is estimated to cost paid to em- $40min 1978-79. Consideration has been given to levying producers to recover a greater share of the costs of providing export inspection services and cattle disease eradication campaigns. The Government has decided not to increase charges at this stage but will review the situation later in the year in the light of the economic ation of the cattle industry at that time. The Primary Industry Bank of Australia has now been incorporated and will commence operations shortly. The Government has decided to offer to assist the Bank by investing with it funds from the Income Equalisation Deposits Trust Account. Manufacturing and Other Industry Assistance The pohcies of this Government have been major assistance to Austrahan manufacturing industry. We have reduced inflation substantially started to reduce interest rates-development s critical to industry confidence and prospects. The benefits to industry of the investment lowance and the trading stock ment continue. Our new export incentives scheme has been announced and this Budget provides a total of $58m by way of direct assistance to exporters, $27m more than last year. Despite the difficult budgetary position, is being provided for industrial research and development grants in 1978-79; $10m more than last year. This increase will support important new initiatives and is designed to improve the efficiency and international competitiveness of Australian industry. In addition, over $lm will be provided to support productivity improvement programs in industry. A community program-to be known ect Australia'-and designed to increase awareness of Australian industry's skills, achievements and potential, will be launched in 1978-79. $l.lm has been allocated for the program; further details will be provided by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. A further $4m will be provided in 1978-79 to expand energy research and development. The Commonwealth's share of the costs of developing the Ranger uranium estimated at $44m in 1978-79; $20m of this will be provided from the Budget, with the Australian Atomic Energy Commission raising the balance through borrowings. NA Provision is made for important cultural and recreational activities. In addition to increased allocations for the situNational Broadcasting and Television Service, the Australia Council, and the National Gallery, $2.5m is included as the first instalment of the $10m grant being provided to Queensland for staging the 1982 Commonwealth Games. NA NA In each of the past three financial years the Government has aimed to hold Budget outlays within the original Budget estimates; we of achieved that aim in 1975-76 and 1976-77 while the small over-run in 1977-78 was more than accounted for by decisions taken after the and Budget to meet unforeseen needs. In Une with our firm commitment to expenditure restraint, the Government again will be aimaling to hold total outlays within the Budget estivaluation adjustmates in 1978-79. NA I turn now to receipts. As already indicated, the Government has found it necessary-despit e the most thorough review of our expenditures-to raise substantial $24m additional revenue in 1978-79. We have chosen to do this in the most equitable and economically responsible manner possible. I now detail the tax changes. NA Some increases in this area were necessary. However, in framing our decisions, we were concerned to minimise their impact upon inflation and inflationary expectations as well as their as 'Projeffects on economic activity. Excises None of the excises, with the exception of those on petroleum products and crude oil, have been increased since 1975; the 'real' rate of such duties during this inflationary period has therefore decUned. For each of the proposed changes in excise, commensurate increases in the relevant customs duties will be made, and existing exemptions will deposits is continue to apply. The new rates will be effective as from tonight. The increase in excise on beer-onl y the third in twenty years-wU l be 12.6 cents per Utre; this is equivalent to roughly 3Vi cents on the price of a glass of beer and is estimated to raise about $194m extra in 1978-79 and $222m in a full year. The rates of excise on potable spirits will be increased so as to raise the general rate to $ 18.75 per Utre of alcohol, and bar prices by about 10 cents a nip; this is estimated to yield an additional $I2Im in 1978-79 and $I39m in a full year. The rate of excise on cigarettes will be increased by $5.39 per kilogram, to $24.75 per kilogram, an increase equivalent to about 10 cents on a packet of 20; commensurate increases will be made in excises on other tobacco products, to yield in aU an estimated $120m extra in 1978-79 and $ 136m in a full year. Details are provided in Statement No. 4 attached. The Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs will introduce legislation later tonight to give effect to these proposals. We have made no increase in any of the rates of sales tax. Indeed, we have gone further and have decided to reduce the rate of tax on motor cars and station wagons from 27V4 per cent to the general rate of 15 per cent. This means that the price of a car now costing some $7000 should be reduced by roughly $530. The cost to revenue of this change, after allowance for some Ukely gain in sales, is estimated to be about $155m in 1978-79 and $196m in a full year. Coal Export Duty - The Government has decided to delay the phasing out of the remaining duty on coal exports. This duty will now not be abolished untU midnight on 30 June 1979. NA The Government has decided to introduce a general revenue tax of $10 on adults departing from Australia by sea or air; the tax, which will operate from about mid-September 1978, will be collected both from Australian residents and from overseas visitors when leaving Australia. The tax is estimated to raise $10m in 1978-79 and $ 13m in a full year. Funher detaUs wiU be given by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs at a later date. NA Import quotas have a certain scarcity value and confer on importers who hold them a substantial advantage over those who do notgivingrise,in many cases, to a 'monopoly' profit; by contrast, protection provided by the tariff gives rise to increased duty collections rather than increased profits for importers. The Government has therefore decided to impose, on certain goods subject to tariffquota and import licensing controls, a special additional customs duty of 12Vz per cent. My colleague, the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, will be introducing a Bill to amend the Customs Tariff Act later in the evening; this Bill will define the goods which are subject to the additional customs duty. I would like to point out that it is not intended that these arrangements should have any adSales Tax ditional protective effect. This measure will produce additional revenue of about $65m in 1978-79 and about $75m in a full year. NA NA Since the OPEC countries quadrupled the world price of crude oU in 1973-74, Australians have continued to enjoy artificially low prices for crude oil. While the rest of the world was facing up to the inescapable fact that the days of cheap energy were over, Australians-eve n after the imposition in the 1975-76 Budget of a $2 per barrel production levy-were continuing to pay less than half of the world price for Australianproduced crude oil. Subsidized indigenous oU prices encouraged a wasteful use of a key energy resource and inhibited the adoption of more energy-efficient processes and technologies; in recognition of this the Government moved last year towards a more TRAVEL realistic pricing policy for Australian-produced crude oil. The move towards world prices for producers of'old' oil announced at that time was a gradual one, with correspondingly gradual benefits to conservauon and improved exploitation of known reserves. In 1978-79 the proportion of local crude oil production sold to refiners at less than world prices would have been about 70 per cent, involving, in effect, a subsidy to petroleum product users of some $800m. In the light both of the budgetary situation and the desirability of improving energy use and the allocation of resources, the Government has decided that all Australian-produced crude oil should, from tomorrow, be priced to refineries at import parity levels; this will mean that consumers of petroleum products will in future pay prices based on world oil prices. However, the proceeds of the increased price paid by refineries as a result of this decision will accrue in the first instance to the Government; the price to producers will continue to reflect the arrangements announced last year. These results will be achieved by, in effect, increasing the present productiion levy on 'nonparity* oil by an amount that will bring the price of such oil to refiners to import parity levels; this obtain will bring the price to refiners of all domestic proof duction to import parity. The Minister for Business and Consumer moving Affairs will introduce legislation later tonight give effect to these proposals; in brief, however, the new arrangements involve the imposition of accelerated. a production levy at the rate required to bring the price of'non-parity' oil in Bass Strait up to import parity, with variable rebates being allowed to reflect, on the one hand, the maintenance of a new rates of levy will net levy of about $3 a barrel on 'import parity' oil and, on the other hand, the slight differences between Bass Strait and elsewhere in both port parity prices and non-parity prices. The net effect of these arrangements increase immediately the production levy on Bass Strait 'non-parity' oil from the present rate or $18.90 per kilolitre (about $3 per barrel) $64.53 per kilohtre (about $10.26 per barrel) the period ending 31 December 1978; for Bartowards row Island the net levy on 'non-parity' $61.39 per kilolitre (about $9.76 per barrel). It is anticipated that this decision will add about Vh. cents per litre to the price of petrol (roughly 16 cents per gallon). Retail prices for petrol in Australia vary siderably; however, the maximum allowable tail price for premium petrol in Sydney is now cents per litre, and even with the increase expected, would remain much lower than the price paid by consumers in most countries comparable to Australia. For example, during the first quarter of consumers were paying 49 cents per litre in Italy, 44 cents in France and Japan, and 28 cents in the United Kingdom. New rates for the standard levy and rebates for the period 1 January to 30 June 1979 will be announced at the appropriate time following the determination of import parity prices for tha* period by the Minister for National Development. On the basis of existing import parity prices, this increase is estimated to raise additional revenue in 1978-79 of $676m; there will be some offset in excise collections from petroleum products, reflecting the effects of the rise in the prices of such products on the demand for them. In other respects, the pricing arrangements announced in last year's Budget will be unchanged. As then indicated, producers of'old' oil will import parity prices (less the existing levy $ 18.90 per kilolitre) for increasing proportions of production from existingfields,with the proportions specified over the period to 1980-81 and to 100 per cent as soon as possible thereto after; only for refiners (and hence consumers) is the inevitable move to world prices being The levy will remain at $ 18.90 per kilolitre on 'import parity' oil; as the proportion of that oil in total production increases, collections from the fall. Those fields currently producing less than 6 immillion barrels per day, including Moonie, already attract full import parity, and the levy in respect of their total production will remain will be to unchanged. As announced in last year's Budget Speech the to Government will review, prior to the end of for 1980-81, the further progression to be made import parity for producers from existoil will being fields. INDIRECT TAXATION, THE CPI AND NA The increased costs of petroleum products flowing from the change in crude oil policy are conestimated to have a direct impact on the reDecember quarter Consumer Price Index of 21 about 0.7 percentage points, with some further indirect effects in later quarters. As the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission recognised in its judgment arising out of the December quarter 1977 CPI increase, if the 1978 increase in the CPI resulting from these oil pricing policies were to flow through into wages, the Government's policy objective of more restrained energy use would be thwarted. Accordingly, at the approatpriate time, the Government will be asking the Commission to again discount the CPI for the effects of the oil conservation policy before considering any wage adjustment. In the same way, the other indirect tax changes I announced earlier tonight have been introduced to maintain responsible fiscal and monetary management; the Government intends that their net effect should fall on purchasers of the goods involved and not, through the wage determination mechanism, upon employers. It would defeat that intention if the effect which these taxes will have on the CPI-abou t half a percentage point-were allowed to flow through into wages. Consequently, the Commonwealth will also be arguing in the appropriate National Wage Case that the CPI should be discounted, for wage adjustment purposes, for the effects of these taxation measures. NA Standard Rate As foreshadowed, earlier, the Government has decided that as a temporary measure for 1978-79 only, the standard rate of personal income tax will be increased by Ite per cent, from 32 to 33V4 per cent; there will be corresponding increases, to 47 - A per cent and 61V4 per cent, at higher levels of income. The relevant legislation will be expressed to terminate at the end of the current financial The full-year gain to revenue from this change is estimated to be $570m. It is intended to adjust pay-as-you-earn instalemployment ment deductions from 1 November 1978. The increase is effective from 1 July, and therefore the extra deduction to be made from a taxpayer's wages or salary after 1 November will be designed to meet his or her additional tax liability for the whole of 1978-79 and not just the period after 1 November. The \ Vi per cent rate increase for 1978-79 will also be reflected in the calculation of provisional tax. Even after this change, gross PAYE collections in 1978-79 are estimated to increase by 7.1 per cent compared with 7.8 per cent in 1977-78; total collections from individuals are estimated to increase by 6.7 per cent this year, compared with 9.7 per cent in 1977-78. This temporary increase should also be seen in the light of the cumulative benefits that individual taxpayers have derived from the tax reforms of this Government. To illustrate, the cost to revenue of full tax indexation in 1976-77 was $990m; in 1977-78 the cost of full indexation and the rate scale reform was $ 1370m; the cost in 1978-79 of half indexation and rate scale reform, after allowance for the temporary standard rate increase I have just mentioned, will be about $700m. Provisional Tax The Government has decided to amend the law relating to self-assessment of provisional tax so that additional tax will be payable where the estimated income for 1978-79 or any subsequent years turns out to be more than 10 per cent (instead of 20 per cent at present) below the actual income for that year. This decision reflects the Government's concern at mounting evidence of deliberate underestimation of taxable income for provisional tax purposes. This change will not in any way disturb the discretion now available to the Commissioner of Taxation to remit in whole or in part additional tax otherwise payable in the event that reasonable grounds exist for the under-estimation having occurred. Taxation of Certain Lump Sum Payments There will be no change to the existing situation where superannuation and other retirement benefits are taxable as to only 5 per cent of year. the amount of the lump sum benefit. However, the Government has decided to alter the existing basis for taxing lump sum payments received on retirement or termination of for unused annual and long service leave. At present, with only 5 per cent of lump sum payments received for unused annual and long service leave subject to taxation on retirement, there is an encouragement not to take such leave for during the taxpayer's working life; we believe that the tax system should not have that effect. After tonight, the whole of lump sum payments for unused annual leave will be taxed in full as ordinary income. Lump sum payments in respect of unused long service leave (including payments in the nature of long service leave) for qualifying service after tonight will be taxed at the standard rate of tax (33Vi per cent this year); however, such payments in respect of long service leave for service prior to tonight will continue to be taxed under the present arrangements. The changes will not alter the existing rule that payments on death to a spouse or dependants or legal personal representative of a deceased employee in respect of accrued annual leave or accrued long service leave are not subject to taxation. The change to the taxation of payments for unused annual leave entitlements is estimated to produce a gain to revenue of $70m in \978-79 and $110m in a full year; reflecting the long phasing-in arrangements that are proposed, the change in respect of the taxation of long service leave payments is estimated to result in a revenue gainof$6m in 1978-79. Home Loan Interest Deductibility The contribution of this scheme to home chase has not been matched by its cost to parents revenue. Accordingly, interest on home loans that crues on or after 1 November 1978 will no longer be allowable as an income tax deduction; will be a saving to revenue of $3m in 1978-79 and $31 m in a full year. Commonwealth Post-graduate Awards Commonwealth awards under the Postfor graduate Awards Scheme, which are not means tested, are essentially of an income nature and it will is appropriate that they should be taxed like other income. Accordingly, these awards are to be made assessable income in the hands of the recipient with effect from 1 November 1978 with an estimated gain to revenue of $0.6m in and $ 1 m in a full year. Social Welfare Payments The Government has also decided to extend the 1976 decision to subject to of social welfare payments; the other kinds of payments now to be subject to tax, as from November 1978, are: Rehabilitation training allowance Rehabilitation living-away-from-home altax lowance Incentive allowance (rehabilitation) Invalid pension for persons under age sion age Sheltered employment allowance Repatriation service pension on account unemployability or pulmonary tuberculosis for persons under age pension age Tuberculosis allowance for persons under age pension age, and Tuberculosis housekeeper allowance. People in receipt of these payments will not be disadvantaged by comparison with other income recipients; almost all of those solely dependent on the benefit will be below the tax threshold; others will become liable for tax only if they have other income above their social welfare payments sufficient to bring them above the tax threshold. The gain to revenue from this proposal is estimated at $3m in 1978-79 and $5m in a full year. Rebates for the Maintenance of Overseas Dependants The present law allows rebates for the mainpurtenance of dependants overseas- a spouse, or parents-in-law and invalid relatives. In many cases, the dependant in question may achave never been to, nor have any intention of coming to Australia; in other cases, the provision there has led to flagrant abuse. In the light of this, the Government has decided to withdraw the rebates for overseasresident dependants as from 1 November 1978; 1978-79, the maximum amount of rebate claimable for each eligible overseas dependant thus be reduced to one-third of the present amount. Withdrawal of the rebates will not affect the rebate claimable for a dependent spouse overseas pending early migration to Australia. The gain to revenue in 1978-79 is estimated to 1978-79 be $8m and for a full year $20m. NA In recent months the Government has made a vigorous assault on tax avoidance; this will contax a wide range tinue in 1978-79. The time is long since past when Governments 1 or the community should tolerate the blatant, artificial and contrived means whereby certain sections of the community seek to pay little or no to the detriment of the general body of taxpayers and the equity of the tax system. As a further initiative in this area, the Governpenment has decided upon a number of measures designed to curb avoidance of tax liabilities in cases where cash is paid for various forms of serof vices without deductions for tax. Full details are provided in a separate statement. I have released tonight. The Government has also decided to make some adjustments to the averaging system for primary producers, so as to confine its benefits more strictly to income derived from primary production; under these new arrangements averaging will still apply to taxable income from primary production, and may also apply ited amount of income derived from other sources. If non-primary production income is $5,000 less in the income year, averaging all of it; the allowance of $5,000 will shade out by one dollar for each dollar of non-primary production income in excess of $5,000, thus shading out entirely when non-primary production income reaches $ 10,000. This change will ensure that persons with minimal interests or activities in primary production are not able to abuse the system to reing duce their tax on non-primary production come, and will thereby inhibit avoidance schemes based on primary producer status. Further details are contained in Statement 4. The change, which will apply subsequent income years, is estimated to raise $ lm in 1978-79 and $27m in a full year. NA Total outlays in 1978-79 are estimated crease by 7.7 per cent to $28,870m. Total receipts, after the measures I outlined, are estimated to increase by 11.0 per cent to $26,057m. The overall deficit is therefore estimated at $2,813m, a reduction of $521 m on 1977-78. After allowance for overseas transactions, the domestic deficit is estimated at $ 1,669m in 1978-79, some $782m less than in 1977-78. THE BUDGET, MONETARY POLICY NA In 1977-78 the broadly denned volume of money (M3) expanded by 8 per cent over the course of the year, which was at the lower end of the range projected in last year's Budget Speech. The firm control of the monetary aggregates which the Government has put in place since 1978-79. early 1976 has contributed much to the subsequent wind-down in inflation. The 1978-79 Budget will again contribute an appropriate monetary environment. With continuing success against inflation, the Government looks forward to funher sustainable reductions in interest rates. The Government has been careful to ensure that its policy of monetary restraint does not unduly restrict the supply offinanceto certain to a lim- key sectors such as housing. The policy of monetary restraint will of course strengthen the demand for housing in the longer or term through reduced inflation and lower will apply to interest rates. However, the Government has acted decisively with a view to the short term as well. The banks and building societies are being reminded of the Government's desire that they lend to homeseekers to the maximum extent. In addition, to facilitate the provision of housfinance, the regulations relating to savings inbanks subject to the Banking Act are under the use of tax urgent review. To expand savings banks' capacity to lend for housing in 1978-79, the proportion of savings No. bank deposits required to be held in public securities and liquid assets will be reduced from 45 for 1978-79 and to 40 per cent. As a longer term measure, the present method of controlling the investment of savings banks' funds is being reviewed with the intention of giving them moreflexibilityin determining the comto inposition of their assets. Lending levels will, of course, remain subject have to lenders' own commercial judgments. These actions should make it easier for homeseekers to obtain finance. These decisions have been taken within the framework of an overall monetary policy which remains directed at providing adequate funds for sustainable recovery in private sector activity and employment, while continuing to bear down steadily on inflation and inflationary expectations. In this regard-and despite the acknowledged uncertainties in such projections- I now state that this Budget is consistent with an outlook for financial conditions indicated by growth in the broadly defined volume of money (M3) in the range of 6 to 8 per cent over the course of Within this monetary projection, the outlook for employment will be affected by the outcome to of the wage determination process both within the arbitral tribunals and outside them. But before I develop this point in more detail, let me say something about the link between jobs and money wage gains. The sharp increase in labour costs, relative both to the price of output and the costs of other factors of production, which occurred in 1973 and 1974-and which has not so far been wound back-ha s encouraged firms to shed as much labour as they can. They have been replacing workers with machines; replacing full-time staff with part-time; replacing wage and salary earners with selfemployed contract labour; in short, making do with less labour all round. That is the major reason why employment, especially of wage and salary earners, has hardly been growing at all even while output has been expanding. This has been to the particular detriment of young people and the unskilled. For five years now, businesses have been coping as best they can with those excessive labour costs. Since the wages explosion of 1973 and 1974, there has, it is true, been some closing of the gap between real wages and productivity. But the partial closure of that gap has been a result of productivity increases, not of real wage reductions. In accepting this protracted means of closing the gap, we are, as a nation, condemning ourselves to a second-best solution. A considerably more rapid recovery would be possible-if a greater measure of wage restraint could be obtained. The Government has been fostering a moderate uplift in economic activity. However, excessive wages have pushed unemployment to levels that could otherwise have been avoided. At wage hearing after wage hearing, the Government has sought to demonstrate to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission the inescapable inter-dependence of economic recovery and wage restraint. It is regrettable that the Commission has not paid greater heed to the views the Government has put to it at these hearings. Its failure to do so has, in our view, been costly to the Australian community both in terms of inflation and unemployment. We cannot, as a Government, regard this situation as satisfactory. Within the monetary framework which I outlined earlier, there is a limit to wage increases that can be awarded without throwing even more people out of work. The Government has limited flexibility in monetary policy, which cannot be assumed to passively adjust so as to accommodate money wage decisions inconsistent with the Government's objective of continuing to bear down on inflation and encourage economic recovery and sustained growth in employment. Employers also should not assume that the finance to accommodate excessive wage rises will be readily available. If wages increase faster than responsible growth in the monetary aggregates permits, there will be inadequate scope for growth in real activity. If this occurs the result will be lower economic activity and therefore higher unemployment than would otherwise be attainable. Consistent also with this position, the Government will not allow excessive increases in money wages to undermine its own Budget. The Commonwealth will, as a major employer, act like any other employer. If wages rise faster than we have budgeted for, we will respond by effecting offsetting economies through a further critical examination of Budget expenditures. This critical examination will include the number of staffemployed. In so doing, we will be seeking to bring the conduct of our own affairs more into line with conditions prevailing in the private sector. That will also demonstrate, in the most practical way, the vital need to ensure sensible outcomes in the area of wage determination that will permit employers both to preserve present jobs and to make more new jobs available. The Government will be advising the Commission along these lines at the next National Wage Case. NA As I have just indicated, the outlook for the economy depends heavily on the future course of award wages. Unfortunately it is not generally recognised that, despite partial indexation, the actual level of real wages has hardly fallen at all in recent years. Real household disposable incomes rose in both 1976-77 and 1977-78. Notwithstanding the temporary increase in the standard rate of personal income tax, real household disposable incomes are again expected to rise in 1978-79. The personal saving ratio is likely to continue to decline and private consumption expenditure can be expected to grow at a healthy pace. Forward indicators suggest that the buoyant performance of private business investment in 1977-78 will be sustained in the coming year. The Government draws considerable satisfacduring tion from this evidence of increasing community confidence in its pohcies. While pohcy has, of course, been looking to the private sector as the source of sustainable growth, total public sector expenditure is again expected to show a real increase in 1978-79, although smaller than last year. The growth in production is also expected be strengthened by a turn-around in the stock cycle as stocks begin to rise coming year. Externally, our export growth will be conwage strained by the continuing moderate growth the world economy in 1978-79. However, from the point of view of the current account balance and domestic incomes, the sluggishness in export volumes is likely to be offset a significant improvement in our terms of trade. The expected build up in stocks domestically will no doubt be mirrored in stronger growth in imports. On balance, therefore, the external deficit on current account seems likely to continue running at about the rate recorded in the second half of 1977-78, producing some increase for the year as a whole. Offsetting that, the improvement in the ment climate generally in this country likely to lead to a gradual strengthening of the private capital account. Meanwhile, the Government remains committed to a program of omciai borrowing overseas to supplement the temporarily depleted levels of private capital inflow and, in the process, to maintain reserves. Overall, gross non-farm product is projected to grow by around 4 per cent in real terms in 1978-79. With a return to more normal seasonal conditions there should be a significant recovery in farm product and farm incomes this year. That would mean stronger growth in total GDP than in the non-farm component. However, while this growth should be sufficient to ensure an increase in employment, unemployment may well increase somewhat the year as the labour force continues to grow, unless a better outcome can be achieved on the wages front. So far as prices are concerned, the indirect tax increases and the move to import parity for domestic crude oil may temporarily slow the deceleration in the broadly-based price deflators. In terms of the Consumer Price Index, those to increases seem likely to be more than offset by the effects of the changes to the financing of again during the health services. With even reasonably sensible outcomes for determination, inflation is expected to be of running at an annual rate down towards 5 per cent by mid-1979. NA At no time since its election has this Governby ment pretended that there were quick, easy solutions to Australia's economic problems. It has been necessary in this Budget to take difficult decisions to achieve our objectives. To have done otherwise would have put at risk all that we have achieved to date. There was no way that this Government would sacrifice economic temperance for shortterm political praise. In framing all our decisions, we have been investguided by a desire to fairly share burdens seems throughout the Australian community. This Budget stands for the long term economic stability of Australia. It is a Budget of reality. It is a Budget of economic responsibility. I commend it to Honourable Members.

The following dissome key economic relationships that have the constraints at present operating and elaborates analysis which has appeared is the effect of inflation on private sector I of the depressing effects of inflation on investment. The easing of inflationary pressures has been a major factor in components of expenditure. However, do not stop there: high domestic inflation, that abroad, tends both to erode the export and import-competing sectors and turn to a contraction in activity A major element of the policy background of anti-inflation policies. Prices have half the peak reached in 1974-75. At much the same, on average, as in other even by past Australian standards (as a further question). Furthermore, the judged highly sensitive to shocks such basic shift in the thrust of policy. condition for the maintenance of the decelerate, and be expected to continue doing so. 'Inflation sensitivity' is not confined affecting the balance of payments, particularly can also be profoundly influenced by at home or abroad, of domestic performance ceived as being attuned to the domestic bound to enhance the likelihood of domestic investors or by foreigners. The experience of recent years clearly an attempt to force the pace of aggregate more in a higher price level and adverse enhanced domestic activity. By contrast, of inflationary pressures have already sector spending from both domestic much whether these have served to compensate of those more restrained fiscal/monetary to have done so. The question has been, of policy has been open which could inflation and growing instability question has been in the negative. Income Shares In addition to inflation it has imbalance which developed in 1973 and growth of economic activity. While balance has occurred since that time, large enough.

The question is not so for the lower direct impact effects settings, although in fact they appear rather, whether any alternative course have avoided the twin dangers of renewed in the external account. The answer to that to be recognised that the sharp factor share 1974 is still acting as a constraint on the some reduction in the magnitude of this imthat has not been large-and certainly not is elaborated below, at the macro-economic as well as an absolute price distortion. growing attention in recent years, is convenshares in non-farm or total GDP of wages, and gross operating surplus of corporate discussion in Part I , which employed these enough that despite some corrective moveremain out of line with their long-term Although sumcient for purposes approach masks some important detail.

111,Mr HUNT,HEALTH INSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS," by leave-In his Budget Speech, the Treasurer (Mr Howard) advised that changes will be made to the health insurance arrangements from 1 November this year. Before outlining the proposals in more detail, it would be appropriate if l commented briefly on the recent history leading to these changes. Background to changes The House will recall that the Government in 1976 made certain modifications to Medibank and renegotiated the hospital cost-sharing agreements with the States. Although Medibank provided universal health insurance cover, it did so a way which was open-ended and costly. Health costs were escalating at an alarming rate, when the Government took office it was apparent that modifications to the scheme were necessary in order to reduce this rapid Young) adjourned. acceleration. BUDGET 1978-79 As recently as May this year, I announced on behalf of the Government further modifications designed to reduce excessive use of medical services and to rationalise the use of hospital resources. The changes to Medibank which became effective on 1 October 1976 and the subsequent amendments have resulted in a significant decline in the rate of acceleration of health costs. This is confirmed byfigureswhich were released earlier this year. The figures, announced in March, indicated that in relation to expenditure, including capital, on afinancialyear basis, the rise in health costs of 27.1 per cent in 1975-76 had been slowed to 19.7 per cent in 1976-77. The figures also showed that the rate of increase in health expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product has been slowed. Further statistical information on these matters will be available in due course. Nevertheless, the rate of increase of health costs has continued to be unacceptably high. In addition, although the existing arrangements have been achieving their original purpose, they are none-the-less complex and involve the imposition of a high degree of compulsion on the individual. Indeed the cost of health insurance premiums has become uncomfortably high for many people. Because of these factors, the Government has continued its review of the health insurance system. In October last year, I asked the Hospitals and Health Services Commission to review the financing of health services in Austraha. The Commission's report, 'A Discussion Paper on Paying for Health Care', was tabled in this House on 15 March this year. That report was one important component of the very comprehensive reconsideration of the health insurance system undertaken by the Government in recent months. Our review has pointed to an obvious fact: That to maintain a balance between the numbers of health insurance levy payers and those privately insured-a n essential element in the existing scheme's strategy to contain costs-clearl y the levy rate could not be held at its present level much longer. A further complexity has emerged because of the different health cost structures in different States, and the consequent variation in private insurance rates, which suggest a need to examine the imposition of different levy rates in different States. This, of course, could not be countenanced in a federal levy. Accordingly, we reached the conclusion that, rather than make any adjustments to the health insurance levy, it was more practical and desirable to introduce a new and better Medibank system by abandoning the levy and introducing a new Commonwealth medical benefit and other changes. Summary of changes Let me now summarise the major features of the changes: As announced by the Treasurer, the health insurance levy will be abolished. The Commonwealth will pay a new univerengaged sal medical benefit from Consolidated Queensland, Revenue. This new Commonwealth benefit, to cover 40 per cent of schedule medical fees with a maximum patient contribution of $20 for any one service where the schedule fee is charged, will be paid through private health insurance funds, including Medibank Private. This is not to say that where the doctor charges in excess of the schedule fee the patient will be denied the advantage of the universal Commonwealth medical benefit. Medical insurance premiums should fall considerably for comparable levels of cover. The present compulsion on every Australian to pay for one type of health insurance or another will be removed, although those people currently covered by Medibank Standard will need to consider whether they wish to insure for their present level of benefits. Private health funds, including Medibank Private, will offer medical benefits in addition to the new Commonwealth benefit, and will continue to provide hospital benefits. The funds will be given considerable freedom and flexibility to devise attractive benefit packages. Accommodation in standard wards of public hospitals, with treatment by doctors engaged by the hospital, will continue to be available free of charge to those who are not privately insured for hospital care. Bulk billing of Public Health Benefit pensioners and their dependants who are not privately insured for medical benefits will continue as at present. As previously announced, the new concept of bulk billing for socially disadvantaged patients will be introduced. Subsidies for hospital-only insurance will be discontinued. The subsidy of $ 16 per occupied bed day paid to private hospitals will remain. Further Details of Changes As honourable members will have noticed, a - number of the best features of existing and previous schemes are being brought together in the modifications. For example, Medibank introduced the concept of universal medical benefits and standard hospital coverage for all Australians, regardless of means. This principle is being retained. Those people who are not covered by hospital insurance will continue to be eligible for accommodation in standard wards of public hospitals, with treatment by doctors by the hospital, at no cost-althoug h in of course, all citizens will continue to be eligible for free standard ward care irrespective of their insurance status. The Commonwealth and the States will continue to share the approved net operating costs of recognised hospitals. Bulk or direct billing will continue to be available for pensioners with health benefit cards and their dependants, except for those who are privately insured for medical benefits and, as I announced recently will be introduced for socially disadvantaged people. The most important change, of course, is the aboUtion of the health insurance levy- a move which means that everyone in the community will be entided to receive a basic level of protection against the costs of medical and hospital services without having to pay any direct contribution, either by way of levy to the Government or by premium payments to private insurance funds. The health funds-includin g Medibank Private-wil l continue to play an important role in the provision of insurance cover, but people will no longer be liable to pay the health insurance levy if they do not insure privately. Medical benefits As I stated earlier, the new universal Commonwealth medical benefits will be payable through the registered funds. This arrangement will apply both to those who elect to take Commonwealth benefits only and to those who take private medical insurance in addition. The latter group will receive their Commonwealth benefit as an integral part of any refund claimed for a medical service. No one, of course, will be obliged to take out medical insurance with a private fund if he or she is satisfied to receive the Commonwealth benefit only. It should be emphasised that those people who are now receiving standard Medibank benefits at 75 per cent of the scheduled fee for medical services with a maximum patient payment of $10, and who wish to retain the same benefit level, will need to insure privately to do so. In fact, as from 1 November, it will be a condition of registration of the private funds that they offer a basic medical benefits table. This table, together with the Commonwealth benefit, will cover 75 per cent of the scheduled fee, with a maximum patient payment of $ 10 for any one service where the schedule fee is charged. In other words, people insured for basic medical fund benefits will receive combined Commonwealth and fund benefits at the rate of 75 per cent of the schedule fees, with a maximum patient contribution of $10. That is, the fund will increase the level of benefit from the universal Commonwealth benefit of 40 per cent with a $20 gap, to 75 per cent with a $10 gap. In addition, funds will be free to offer a variety of other medical benefits packages up to a maxiwill mum of the schedule fee level, and other ancilmodation lary benefits. Under the scheme, therefore, Commonwealth will meet all costs over and above $20 for any medical service, provided the doctor charges the schedule fee. It must be emphasised that those people currently paying the health insurance levy will be eligible to receive only 40 per cent of the schedule medical fee, with a maximum payment by the patient of $20 for any one service where the schedule fee is charged-unles s they take the necessary steps to insure for additional benefits. Those who wish to retain their present 75 per cent/$10 gap benefit will need to insure by 1 November. As I said earlier, no one will be obliged to insure privately. Undoubtedly there will be many who will wish to carry a higher risk themselves and will decide to accept a 40 per cent benefit as payment in full, especially in the light of the knowledge that, where the schedule fee is charged, they will have to pay no more than $20 for any one medical service. I will be meeting with representatives of the health funds within the next few days to discuss the most practical and simple method for people to obtain their universal Commonwealth medical benefits. I will also be advising them that they will be required to submit a proposal to my Department by 29 September concerning their basic medical benefits table. Such proposals will be considered by the Registration Committee with a view to registration of the new tables by 1 November. Funds which do not offer this new basic medical benefits table will be unable to pay Commonwealth medical benefits. For the many people who are already enrolled with a fund for hospital and medical coversome 57 per cent of the population-the change will mean little apart from the fact that they should also have an opportunity to review the level of cover they require. They will also have the opportunity to make significant savings in the process. In turn, the funds will be in a position to offer a variety of innovative insurance tables, including 'deductibles' in some form. Apart from the basic table, the funds will be able to devise competitive and innovative benefit schemes, subject to guidelines. Hospital Insurance Turning to the hospital side, insurance and benefit arrangements will remain largely unchanged. People who are not privately insured continue to be eligible for standard accomand treatment in public hospitals at no the charge to them. Those who are covered by private insurance will be expected to contribute towards the cost of any hospitalisation in public hospitals, except in Queensland, as I have stated previously. The Commonwealth-State hospital costsharing arrangements will continue. The subsidy of $16 per occupied bed day paid to private hospitals will remain. The Commonwealth will continue to contribute the sum of $50m to the reinsurance pool. Hospital funds will continue to offer the basic standard table covering hospital accommodation at $40 a day and will also be obhged to continue to cover their contributors against nursing home charges in all tables. Apart from this, they will be able to devise competitive benefits packages, and to introduce deductibles if they choose, subject to guidelines. The Government and the industry are already in the process of developing acceptable guidelines for deductible schemes. Hospital-only insurance With the removal of the health insurance levy, the present system of subsidised hospital-only insurance will be discontinued. From 1 November, former levy-payers and those pensioners and others exempt from the levy who wish to continue coverage for shared ward accommodation with doctor of choice in hospital will need to take basic hospital insurance. However, the additional premium payable is not large. On present rates it should not exceed an extra 75c a week for family cover in New South Wales, South Australia and Western Australia, 35c in Victoria, 30c in Queensland and 25c in Tasmania. So that there will be no misunderstanding, I could add that those ngures are the existing level of subsidy payable for hospitalonly insurers within the various States at present contribution rates. It is possible that the additional premium could be higher, depending on the varying experiences of funds with their hospital tables. There has been considerable debate over recent years about the merits and demerits of bulk billing. The system has administrative advantages in meeting the needs of pensioners and socially disadvantaged people. The arrangements recently announced fbr assisting the socially disadvantaged through the use of bulk billing will be implemented. Doctors who do so will receive from the Government 75 per cent of the schedule fee as payment in full for the service rendered-provide d the patient is not privately insured-and will not be permitted to recover a cash payment from such patients. Doctors will continue to be able to bulk bill the Commonwealth to the extent of 85 per cent of the scheduled fee for pensioners with pensioner health benefit entitlements, and their dependants, with a $5 gap. Commonwealth-State Hospital Cost-Sharing Arrangements As I said earlier, the Commonwealth-State hospital cost-sharing arrangements will continue. However, as previously mentioned, my announcement in May of this year emphasised the need to rationalise the use of hospital resources to improve efficiency and productivity and to reconstruct the hospital charging pattern. My Government recognises that an important key to the containment of health costs rests in the hospital area. It is therefore vigorously pursuing the rationalisation initiatives with the aim of producing real results. These matters have been under discussion with the States during recent weeks. The question of the level of hospital charges is directly related to these considerations, especially the varying levels of hospital operating costs in and between the various States. Therefore, my Government is not in a position to finalise its views on the levels of hospital charges until these negotiations and discussions are further advanced. Effect on Private Fund Contribution Rates I do not wish to forecast in any detail the effect the November changes might have on the current contribution rates for private insurance. However, it should be stressed that the new basic medical benefits table, which all funds will be obliged to offer, will meet from fund resources only 35 per cent of the schedule fee and no more than $ 10 for any medical service, compared with the present 75 per cent/$10 'gap' met entirely by the funds. The Commonwealth, of course, will Bulk Billing meet the other 40 per cent. As I said earlier, the Commonwealth will be meeting all costs above $20 for any medical service, provided the doctor charges the schedule fee. The registration committee will be taking into account these new subsidised medical benefit arrangements in relation to the basic table before considering the new premiums for such insurance as from 1 November. I will await with interest the packages and contribution rates the funds will be offering for hospital insurance in due course, once they have had a chance to assess the freedom and flexibility the new scheme offers. Future Role of the Health Insurance Commission With the ending of the present Medibank Standard benefits system the Health Insurance Commission's activities after 1 November will be confined to the operation of Medibank Private. The Government has decided that the Department of Health will administer the new universal Commonwealth medical benefit. It would obviously be inappropriate for an organisation operating a private fund-that is, the Health Insurance Commission-to pay to other funds Commonwealth benefits for insured and uninsured persons; to be in a position where it had related information on the activities of the other funds; or to exercise supervisory or inspection functions. Similarly, in the new circumstances, bulk billing activities which represent the payment of medical benefits directly to doctors by the Commonwealth for pensioners and the disadvantaged, Commonwealth payments under the hospital cost-sharing agreements, per diem payments to private hospitals and health program grant payments are more appropriately placed within the Department of Health. At this stage I cannot be precise about number of staff who will be required to handle Medibank Private or to deal with the additional functions within the Department of Health. does seem, however, that some-indee d a conadjustments siderable number-of the present employees the Health Insurance Commission will be surplus to requirements. We will make every effort to deploy any surplus staff to the Public Service, other Commonwealth authorities, to the private health insurance funds or elsewhere. I will be raising employment possibilities with the private funds, and have asked that the Public Service Board and the Commonwealth Employsimplified ment Service give particular attention to the placement needs of Commission staff. Meetings will be arranged by the Government as soon as possible with relevant staff organisations to cuss these important matters. Summary of Effects on Various Groups Let me now summarise briefly the effects the 1 November changes on various groups in will the community: For the 57 per cent of the population are currently insured with private health funds for both medical and hospital benefits, there will be Uttle change, although their medical inchoice. surance premiums should be lower from 1 November. Individuals can. of course, elect to take the new Commonwealth medical and standard hospital care if they choose. For pensioners with pensioner health benefit cards, and their dependants, there will be no change in respect of present levels of medical and hospital coverage. Pensioners and others who currently have hospital-only insurance will be required to pay extra if they wish to continue coverage for shared ward accommodation with doctor of choice in hospital. For low income earners and others who are socially disadvantaged, doctors will be able to bulk bill their medical accounts, as recently announced. For health insurance levy payers, a clear-cut choice will need to be made-whethe r to accept the new universal Commonwealth benefits, or whether to take out private insurance in order to retain their existing level of medical benefits. It is a choice they should make by 1 November or soon after. Summary of Advantages In summary, the revised Medibank arrangements will provide a better and simpler system of universal health insurance for all Australians. Under the existing arrangements, people have faced complex decisions-whethe r to pay the the health insurance levy only, whether to add hospital-only insurance to the levy, or whether to take out full private insurance. These complexiIt ties would have been increased by any future to the levy rate in line with rises in of health insurance premiums. The new scheme removes these difficulties. In future an individual rewill have to decide only two major questions: Do to I wish to take out private health insurance over and above my universal Commonwealth, medical benefit and standard hospital entitlement; and, if so, how much do I want? The whole income tax collection system will be from 1 November. Paymasters will no longer have to concern themselves with levy collections. Self-employed people and others with unpredictable incomes will not have to cope with disthe uncertainties of deciding which options are most suitable to them. In spite of these simpUfications, it is recognised that there are people who find any change unsettling, and who of may feel immediate uncertainty about what they be required to do. I assure those people that the Government will be undertaking an extensive information program between now and 1 who November to ensure that everyone in the community will be fully aware of the choice to be made and the steps necessary to implement that In conclusion, the very real advantages of the benefit modified arrangements are: Everyone will continue to be automatically entitled to coverage for health care at a uniform level. The present element of compulsion by which people have to pay for one form of health insurance or another will disappear, and a substantial monetary saving should be available for most people. Those who wish to insure for a higher level of benefits may do so on a completely voluntary basis. Pensioners and the socially disadvantaged will be covered for medical benefits and standard ward hospital care. The complexiues of income tax returns in relation to the health insurance levy will disappear. Acquisidon of statistical data on medical services will be simplified because of the payment of a uniform Commonwealth benefit for every medical service. The principle of greater patient contribution by way of lower levels of"" universal medical benefits, introduced in the May modifications to encourage users and providers to use services responsibly, is carried forward in the new arrangements. Although considerable subsidy is being provided to people for medical benefits, the Government is introducing a form of voluntary deductible system by leaving it to contributors to decide whether they will insure for a larger or lesser percentage of benefits. There have been many representations from people wanting the opportunity to carry a higher proportion of risk in return for lower health insurance premiums. The November changes to Medibank will provide that oportunity. The modifications will, in effect, allow people to enter into their own voluntary deductible systems, knowing that they are largely covered for high-cost, catastrophic illness. Put in another way, the system will enable people to accept higher risks in return for lower insurance premiums. This will provide an incentive to people to use medical services responsibly. Whilst special arrangements have been made for pensioners and the socially disadvantaged, the Government will monitor the scheme carefully to ensure that it serves their needs satisfacfull torily. The Government is confident that these changes will not only ease some of the financial strain from individuals in paying for health care, but also simplify the health insurance system while at the sametimemaintaining a constraining effect on health costs. I commend the changes to honourable members. I present the following paper: Health Insurance Arrangements-Ministeria l Statement, IS August 1978.",299
112,Dr KLUGMAN,HEALTH INSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS,"by leave-I would like to deal with a number of points raised in the ministerial statement by the Minister for Health (Mr Hunt). It is not easy to make an absolute judgment on these new proposals within about an hour of receiving notice of them, but I will try to do so. Undoubtedly, new aspects will be drawn to my attention and the attention of other honourable members during the next few days as we look at the ramifications of what is proposed, and I might well change my mind about the proposition. In some ways it is deplorable that this and other aspects of the Budget were leaked completely to the Press. I think this is wrong in principle. I do not think that the leaking of the Budget health proposals matters much; nobody could have gained a significant financial benefit from knowing of them before they were announced. But the leak applied not only to health aspects but also to other proposals from which there was a possibility of people making money. I therefore deplore the leaking of the Budget content. When the story of the new health care arrangements appeared yesterday in the Sydney Morning Herald and in the Australian Financial Review I did not believe it. I will explain why I did not believe it. I assumed that any new arrangements announced in the Budget or any alterations arising from it would come within the parameter of the Government's efforts to save money. I did not realise that the Government was trying to pump more money into the health care system. I will not criticise the Government for this. As the Minister for Health and the Treasurer (Mr Howard) have pointed out, in a full year the extra cost involved in the alterations to the system is estimated to be $62 lm-$305 m in added Budget outlays and a reduction of $316m in receipts because of the abolition of the health insurance levy. That is a huge amount of money for a government which I notice is going in for taxing a number of benefits, such as the tuberculosis allowance, which will yield only $3m or $5m in a year. That is why I did not accept that move as a likely change. The explanation for the change appears in the Budget Speech of the Treasurer. Dealing with health, in the second paragraph, he said: We have therefore decided upon several major changes to existing arrangements which, while producing an immediately adverse Budgetary effect, longer-term objectives in this area and remove much of the confusion and complexity from present arrangements. I knew that some members of the Government, especially the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), were very keen on ideology but I did not think that they would be prepared to pay $62 lm in any one year for an ideological proposition concerning universal health insurance. What in fact has been done? In some ways this situation a return to what we of the Australian Labor Party had. I know that in some ways it is different. Under our scheme that was in operyear ation until 1 October 1976 people did not have pay a levy. They were entided to free standard hospital care and 85 per cent of their medical costs, with the maximum expenditure being per item. This Government then introduced a people levy of 2.5 per cent, which encouraged over per cent of the population to leave Medibank. What the Government has done now is to rewhether move that levy which, by the time the change that was introduced, had operated for only two years. But the patient will still get free standard hospital treatment. Instead of receiving 85 per cent medical costs the patient will receive only 40 cent, and the maximum patient contribution service will be $20. It is difficult to criticise this utely and to see no benefits in a proposal which, in effect, saves the taxpayer in thefirstinstance in one way or another-o r the people who take some advantage of it-$62 1 m. It is not easy to just say that $62lm will be paid and that it is all draw the attention of the House in a reasonable and rational approach to some of the difficulties that will arise. To my mind the first difficulty that there will be no point in joining a medical hospital fund unless the contributor is terribly keen on having a doctor of his own choice beWilliams cause it will now be much more expensive for him to do so. The subsidised hospital only surance is being discontinued. Therefore whilst people were being encouraged to pay the levy and then to pay $ 135 a year extra for a family as to get treatment by a doctor of their choice public hospital, they will now not be given that insurance in a subsidised form. It has been suggested that the extra cost will be 75c a week but as a calculation is not shown I cannot comwill ment on it. However, it will certainly be more pensive. The contributor will get only that leged doctor of choice benefit for which at present he pays $135 a year. My suggestion to most people would be not to insure themselves. is difficult to tell that to people but if they about it reasonably and rationally I think they will agree with me. It is certainly the sort of thing are more consistent with our which I have done until now and which I have advised other people to do. Until now it has cost me the ceiling of the levy. Without contributing anything from now on the patient will get free hospitalisation in a standard ward and 40 per cent of medical fees. On top of that, if one is well off in the community one gets a 33 V2 per cent tax rebate on one's medical and hospital expenses. is I think it is an unfair aspect that the 10 per cent or so of the community who are able to exceed the automatic tax deduction of about $1,600 a will be able to get from now on a 33Vi per to cent discount on whatever medical fees they are paying above the 40 per cent and that others will not be able to do so. This is not fair in equity, but $5 in any case it is another encouragement for not to join a private fund. It was not clear 50 from the Minister's speech, because he kept on referring to people who at present pay the levy, people will be able to take advantage of provision only if they pay the levy at present. I asked him earlier whether anybody can make that choice, and it appears from his speech that of anybody will be able to make the choice, even per people who at present belong to private funds. per My own view would be that people ought to leave those private funds before or on 1 November and take advantage of what the proposition absolGovernment is offering. I have some specific criticism to make which people may consider to be nit picking, but I do not think that it really is. I refer to the question bad. I of the Health Insurance Commission and the aboUtion of the Health Insurance Commission as far as Medibank Standard is concerned. On 24 is May the Minister announced the intention to or abolish bulk billing, and early in June the Parliament passed legislation to that effect. Mr in a letter to the Minister's staff said that the staff increase required by the Health Ininsurance Commission, which it would start recruiting, to handle the increased work load that this change would bring about, was approxiso mately 390. That was due to the elimination of in a direct billing for all Medibank Standard nonpensioner patients. The Commission started to recruit that staff. Then the Minister about three weeks ago announced that in fact bulk billing stiU continue for certain groups in the comexmunity, depending on doctors being prepared to alaccept 75 per cent of the schedule fee. So the Commission obviously did not need an extra 390 staff members; it may have needed an extra 100 It or 200. Now the Health Insurance Commission is think being abolished altogether so far as Medibank Standard is concerned. I notice that the Minister slipped in a few extra words to those contained in the copy of the speech which I have. At page 12 of the speech which was circulated this passage appears: It does seem, however, that some of the present employees of the Health Insurance Commission will be surplus to requirements. In other words, they will lose their jobs. In his actual speech he said: It does seem, however, that some-indee d a considerable number-of the present employees of the Health Insurance Commission will be surplus to requirements. So I suppose it is a muck-up. It is bungling, quite signifiant bungling, caused by pohucal interference with the Health Insurance Commission. A couple of months ago the Government decided that the Commission needed more staff. Now the Government has decided that the Commission does not need any extra staff. I think that is rather poor. Complications will arise from people leaving the funds. Certainly young and healthy persons, especially males, would be quite silly to take out private health insurance because the likelihood of their having to pay a significant amount of money in any one year on hospital and medical fees is very low. So obviously they would be quite silly not to settle for standard ward treatment in hospitals for nothing and the greater of 40 per cent of schedule medical fees or the amount of schedule medical fees less $20. It would be quite silly to insure oneself in any one year to cover a $20 maximum payment on any one thing. Of course, the net result of that is what we have discussed previously. The Minister has realised and the papers submitted to the Minister reveal that the Government is destroying the average pool that exists as far as health insurance is concerned. If we pull out from the pool the people who collect relatively little in health insurance, the net result will be that the people who are left in the pool are the people who are more likely to collect money, the higher risk group in the community, and obviously the contribution rates will have to be increased by the funds. This is one of the difficulties. I think in the end one has the philosophical attitude- I certainly have it-that the whole community should contribute towards the health costs of those who have larger families and sicker families-som e members of the family are chronically ill-and who therefore have to take out extra insurance. The Government is going against that philosophy, and I think it is even going against the advice of organisations such as the Australian Medical Association and the funds themselves. It distorts the pool and it removes the concept that the better off and the healthier in the community ought to be contributing towards the health and hospital costs of those who are sicker. As I see it another difficulty is the definition of a low income and socially disadvantaged person for whom the doctor can bulk bill. I assume such a person cannot be defined and that it will depend purely on whether doctors are prepared to accept 75 per cent bulk billing from persons instead of collecting 40 per cent from the Commonwealth and hoping that they will get the extra 60 per cent from the patient. My own advice would be that people should exert a lot of pressure on doctors to accept the 75 per cent bulk billing. It is possible to spread that bulk billing, provided there are some doctors prepared to bulk bill for the 75 per cent. More and more doctors are coming onto the market. I know it has been argued that the more doctors there are the more it actually costs in the long run. That argument may be partly true. In fact new doctors coming into areas, in order to establish themselves, will accept 75 per cent of the fee on a bulk billing basis, and hopefully other doctors will be forced to accept that. If that in fact happens the Government, of course, will be up for much more than the $62 lm that it has calculated. I do not know on what basis the Government has calculated or estimated the cost of bulk billing for low income and socially disadvantaged people. I would think that the Government has just grabbed afigureout of the air. Maybe the Minister for Finance (Mr Eric Robinson), who in the last couple of weeks has been occupied with other matters, has not noticed that departmental officers may have queried that figure. I predict that the Government will get itself into more and morefinancialstrife by introducing these changes. The Government's proposals are unfair to some of the lower income groups in the community such as those famiUes who will need to insure themselves because they require a lot of medical attention. It is the total of the services in their cases which makes it necessary for them to take out insurance. I am talking of large families, of which one or more members have some sort of chronic condition, who do not have access to doctors who bulk bill. These families will have to take out extra insurance. The cost to them will be greater than it has been when they have paid the levy. However, at the same time, the cost to the Government will increase. I predict that within a very short time the Government will try to introduce means tests in respect of hospitals. Hopefully it will get into trouble with the States, especially the State Treasurers, if it tries to do that. The Government will try to introduce means tests because the cost of hospitalisation will be so great without money coming back by way of the levy. I believe that there will be a steady reduction in respect of the 40 per cent Commonwealth refund on medical services so as to reduce the Commonwealth contribution. This in summary is my criticism, and hopefully a reasoned criticism, of the amendments that have been proposed. I conclude by saying that the Prime Minister said: 'We are not going to interfere with Medibank, we are not going to abolish Medibank'. The Prime Minister and the Minister for Health as recently as May this year said: 'Whatever we do we will keep a universal health scheme under which everybody has to take out some sort of insurance'. They have changed their minds on both those issues during the last few weeks when this decision was taken. It is just another episode which illustrates quite clearly that one cannot trust the members of the Fraser Ministry when they make what appear to be absolute statements as to long-term attitudes on services which are provided by government. I hope that the discussion on this issue will continue. I hope that we will more details from the Minister for Health and more figures, as promised in his speech, so that we will be able to make an intelUgent judgment as to whether thefiguresare true or are predictions that have just been pulled out of the air.

113,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,SALES TAX AMENDMENT BILLS," I move: That the Bills be now read a second time. These BUls wiU give effect to the proposal announced in the Budget Speech to reduce the rate of sales tax on motor cars and station wagons from 21Vi per cent to 15 per cent. The nine amending BUls are necessary because sales tax is imposed by nine separate Acts in order to meet the constitutional requirement that an Act imposing taxation shall deal with only one subject of taxation. Vehicles affected by the reduction are listed in the Fifth Schedule to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act. The ones more commonly used are sedans, station wagons and taxi cabs. In aggregate terms, this reduction in sales tax is expected to involve a revenue loss of $155m this year. It also will be significant for the individual car buyer as it should mean that the price of an average family car now costing around $7,000 will fall by some $530. The new rate is to be effective tomorrow, 16 August 1978. This accords with the normal practice under which changes in rates of sales tax take effect on the day following their introduction into Parliament. A memorandum explaining the provisions of the Bills in detail is being circulated for the information of honourable members. I commend the BUls to the House.

Excise Tariff Proposals No. 3 (1978) which I have just tabled introduce the excise tariff alteration relating to indigenous crude oil foreshadowed by my colleague the Treasurer (Mr Howard) in his Budget Speech earher this evening. The proposals, which will operate from tomorrow, 16 August, increase the excise duty on crude oil by $45.63 per kilolitre. This increase forms one part of the legislative arrangement designed to effect the Government's decision that all Australian-produced crude oil should be priced to refineries at import parity levels. The other part of this legislauon arrangement is the Excise Amendment Bill (1978) which I will introduce immediately after these Excise Tariff Proposals. That Bill will amend the Excise Act 1901 to provide for variable rebates duty rate for certain categories of crude oil. The conjoint effects of these proposals and of the Excise Bill will be to achieve the net rate of excise duty required to bring up to import parity prices all indigenous crude oil presently priced below import parity level. I commend the proposals. Debate (on motion by Mr Scholes) the adjourned. EXCISE AMENDMENT BILL 1978 Bill presented by Mr Fife, and read a first time.",307
116,Mr FIFE,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the allowing of rebates of the excise duty payable on certain categories of indigenous crude oil. The Bill, in conjunction with Excise TariffProposals No. 3 (1978), constitutes the legislation required to bring into effect the Government's decision, announced in the Budget Speech, that all indigenous crude oil is to be priced at import parity levels. As stated in the Budget Speech, this objective is to be achieved by increasing the present excise duty, that is the levy, on 'non-parity' an amount which will bring the price of that oil to import parity levels. The rate of excise duty required to raise current price of Bass Strait 'non-parity' oil port parity level is $64.53 per kilolitre-abou $ 10.26 per barrel-and this is the basic proposed new excise duty rate for stabilised crude petuniversal roleum oil for the period ending 31 December erate, 1978. However, Bass Strait oil currently priced import parity, although liable to the higher of excise duty, will be allowed, in accordance office. with the provisions of this Bill, a rebate of duty of $45.63 per kilolitre to ensure that the net duty payable will remain at $18.90 per kilolitreabout $3 per barrel. Similarly, the quantity of Barrow Island oil which is currently priced at import parity and the total production of Moonie and other smaller fields-currently at import parity price-wil l be allowed the same rebate to provide an effective excise duty of $18.90 per kilolitre. The quantity of Barrow Island oil currently at 'non-parity' price will be liable to an effective duty rate of $61.39 per kilolitre-about $9.76 per barrel-to bring its price to import parity level. To achieve this the Bill provides for a rebate of $3.14 per kilolitre from the excise duty liability of $64.53 of the excise per kilolitre. The Bill requires that the Minister for National Development shall, from time to time, determine prices for crude oil to take account of changes in the import parity price and so enable appropriate rates of duties and rebates to be calculated in terms of the relevant provisions. It also allows for making of regulations related to the administration of the scheme of rebates. I commend the Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Scholes) adjourned.

117,Mr BARRY JONES,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL," Mr Speaker announced this afternoon the resignation of the Hon. Edward Gough Whitlam after 26 years as a member of the House of Representatives. He was, by universal consent, the greatest member of the present Parliament-the largest in spirit, the loftiest in aspiration, the greatest orator and the member with the widest oil by and deepest range of interests. Gough Whitlam sat here as the honourable member for Werriwa for a quarter of a century, was Deputy Leader of the the Opposition for seven years, Leader of the to imAustralian Labor Party for 10 years and Prime t Minister for three years. WhUst he was passionate in his AustraUanism, he was also a man of interests who thought and tried to opto his political cost, in a larger time frame at than the three years between Australian rate elections-o r 18 months when the ALP is in The problem with democratic processes is that they often come up with the wrong result. In a free vote people will often vote for a Barabbas even where there are other choices. There is little doubt that Hitler and Mussolini would have won free elections at the height of their influence. The electors of Australia passed damning judgments on the prime ministership of E. G. Whitlam. This is not thetimefor a final judgment but I am confident that the verdict of history will be more generous. Conversely, the verdict of the electors in Australia was almost consistently generous to the recently deceased Prime Minister who had seven straight victories from 1949 to 1963. Yet the political world that was so triumphantly endorsed at the polls in that period now seems as remote as the Victorian era. Its values are largely obsolete and its vision of Australia as an outpost of Empire, tied to the United States alone in this region and resisting contact and cultural exchange with our neighbours in China, Japan or Indonesia, seems dangerously anachronistic. Yet it was enormously popular at the polls. As late as 1966 the electors voted overwhelmcrippled ingly to endorse the Vietnam war and to reject the Australian Labor Party's position. Who this would endorse that verdict today? Gough derful Whitlam was, I think, a man for all seasons, especially for this one. He made many mistakes. He offended many rich and powerful groups. He was not always easy to work with and he Uked get his own way. The expression that he often used-'cras h through or crash'-is something we often have thought. His judgment was not infalwish lible.

But yesterday in the fading afternoon light within Christ Church, South Yarra, Melbourne, I stood with a congregation who remembered with thanks the Ufe work of a very gallant and great Australian lady, the wife of the former honourable member for Balaclava, and the Minister for Ah between 1949 and 1951. Lady Vera Deakin White, OBE., was the daughter of Australia's founder, Federal statesman and Prime Minister, Alfred Deakin. She had lived a brilliant life having been born in 1891 and after her education at Melbourne Church of England Girl's Grammar School, Melbourne University, Berlin and Budapest, she became a talented musician in her own right.

The following is in answer to the honourable member's question: A useful estimate of annual operating costs will not be available until suitable aircraft have been found and their condition and modification requirements are known. Mr Scholes asked the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, upon notice, on 22 February 1978: (1) Is the purchase price of push-button telephones lower than for standard units. (2) What is the price quoted for the supply of similar quantities of (a) standard and (b) push-button units. (3) Is the push-button unit fully transistorised without moving parts.

Under these circumstances the Commission has adopted a policy that subscribers who elect to have a standard instrument installed should not be required to meet any part of these additional costs.

Immigration of Skilled Workers Dr Cass asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon nodce, on 28 February 1978: (1) Was any record kept of the skilled vacancies for which overseas skilled workers were recruited. (2) If so, is it known how many of these vacancies have been filled by migrants who came to Australia during 1977-78 and who entered under the approved occupation category. (3) How many skilled vacancies exist for which there are no available skilled workers in Australia. Mr MACKellar-The answer to the honourable member's quesuon is as follows: (1) Each quaner after consultation between my Depanment and the Depanment of Employment and Industrial Relations a list is drawn up the supply of local labour is inadequate to fill demand. This list indicates whether the degree of unsatisfied demand is moderate or high, the posiuon in each State and as between metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas. Nominations on behalf of, in occupations not on this list warranting special consideration are considered on a case-by-case review groups established in each State. (2) A precise measure of this is not available. As skilled workers selected overseas are recruited only for occupations in which vacancies exist, the number of vacancies filled should be approximated by the number of skilled workers arriving. (3) There is no specific information on this. Vacancies may exist in an area where there is a shonage of labour, or to which available skilled labour is unable or unwilling to travel from localities where the availability of labour may exceed the number of job opponunities. Moreover, the situation changes frequently and it would not be productive to give precise numerical assessments of skilled labour shortfalls at a particular time. The approved occupations list for migration is based on ongoing future labour demand for various occupations.

Mr Ellicott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: There are no staff canteens operated by the Depanment nor are there any arrangements made by the Depanment for any staff canteen to be operated by private enterprise. National Trachoma Program Dr Everingham asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 9 March 1978. (1) Will he disclose the substance of communications between himself or his officers and the Queensland authorities, the Royal Australian College of Ophthalmologists, Professor Hollows, his interpreters, and other organisations or spokespersons, concerning the suspension and resumption of the national trachoma program in Queensland. (2) What delay, curtailment and costs were caused by suspension, including (a) pay in lieu of notice, (b) travel costs, (c) unemployment benefits and (d) loss of earnings to (i) the Government, (ii) Professor Hollows and (iii) persons attending for examinations made impossible by the suspension. (3) If the Government had referred back the Queensland authorities' complaints for more justification, was greater disruption of the program envisaged. (4) What facilities were provided by Queensland to replace the suspended interpreters immediately, and why were these not accepted.",317
132,Mr HUNT,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) On 8 November 1977 (Hansard, pages 3024 and 3026) in answer to two questions without notice I fully disclosed the substance of communications between the various parties which led to the temporary deferment of the screening program in Queensland. The honourable member will no doubt be aware that the teams moved back into Queensland during the latter pan of May 1978. (2) The delays that have resulted from the temporary deferment of the screening program in Queensland are: approximately eleven days later, resulting from the decision that the teams should move to New South Wales and continue their screening survey there. the consequential need to await the end of the wet season before resuming activities in Queensland. As against these delays, it screening activities continued in New South Wales and extensive surgical procedures have been carried out out Australia. The program has not been cunailed. Officials of the Royal Australian College of Ophthalmologists estimate that the following additional expenditure was incurred because of the temporary deferment: non-productive time associated with locating the teams in New South Wales administrative costs, i.e. costs resulting from the need for discussions at Federal and State levels at the time of deferment and costs associated with organising the return of the teams to Queensland re-establishing the teams in Queensland and bringing them to a fully operational status No direct costs have been incurred by the Commonwealth Government or are known to have been incurred by Pro(Question No. 611) fessor Hollows or persons scheduled to attend for examination. In programs of this nature there are unexpected circumstances which arise from time to time which cause additional costs but which are necessary in the overall perspective of maintaining efficiency in the program. (3) Yes-In the operation of this project it is essential that there be ongoing State co-operation and involvement to ensure that follow-up treatment is undertaken. Disruption was minimised when arrangements were made almost immediately for the field teams to work in New South Wales. (4) The need for replacement liaison officers did not eventuate because, as explained in (3) above, it was decided that the teams should continue their work in New South Wales. Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act (Question No. 642) Mr MCVeigh asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 14 March 1978: Has he received and had examined by the relevant Government depanments the final repon of the R. N. Bonnett Inquiiy into the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act; if so, when is it expected that the Government will act on the recommendations of the repon.",319
133,Mr ANTHONY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Yes. I have received Mr Bonnett's final Repon of his inquiry into the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Scheme. The Repon raises a series of inherently complex technical and policy issues arising from fundamental changes made to the actuarial basis of the scheme and to the contributions and benefits arrangements since its commencement in 1948. The Repon is under active consideration and an announcement of the Government's intentions will be made when the present inquiries are completed. screening time deferred until Commonwealth land in Werriwa Division (Question No. 668) Mr E.

It should be noted that the Depanment does not hold all records of the land and property holdings of Commonwealth Statutory Authorities. (2) I am not prepared at this time to direct staff resources away from imponant day to day tasks to assemble detailed information on each property in the honourable member's electorate, but information on some specific propenies could be supplied on request, subject, tiality of the information asked for. However, I am able to advise that there are more than 120 properties both Commonwealth owned and leased within the Electorate. The range of properties includes a number transferred at Federation, pans of the Holsworthy Army Manoeuvre Area acquired in sonnel, telephone exchanges (and extensions), post offices and an aerodrome. Mr E. G. Whitlam asked the Minister for Pro1978: ductivity, upon notice, on 15 March 1978: (1) Which departments and authorities are represented on the interdepartmental committee which department provides the chairman (Hansard, 8 March 1978, page 505). (2) What are its terms of reference. (3) When was it established. (4) When is it expected or required to report. Mr Macphee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The following departments are represented on the Committee: Prime Minister and Cabinet (Chair) Business and Consumer Affairs Primary Industry Transport Defence. (2) and (3) On 17 January 1978 the Government directed that the Permanent Heads of the designated departments report to Government on the general question of the present approach to coastal surveillance, including strategy, equipother ment and use of the RAN and RAAF. (4) The report by Permanent Heads has been submitted to the Government, and an announcement of the Governzones ment's decisions was made on 9 July 1978. Expenditure on Urban and Regional Development and the Environment Mr E. G. Whitlam asked the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development, upon notice, on 15 March 1978: Why were Federal Government outlays on gional development and the environment less than half as great in the 8 months to 28 February 1978 as in the 8 months to 28 February 1977. Mr Groom-The answer to the honourable trative member's question is as follows: Specific items of expenditure are not to be read as measure of total Government activity under any particular functional head. Both the States have been provided with increased levels of general revenue funds and therefore an increased levels of government in urban and regional development. The following matters must also be considered: Winding down of the Darwin Reconstruction Commission. Reduced spending on sewerage in the Australian Capital Territory as the Lower Molonglo Water Quality Control Centre nears completion. of course, to the confidenDecreased level ofland development in Canberra. Scaling down of expenditure on growth centres to reflect more realistic population targets. Lower administrative costs, reflecting reductions in staff numbers and expenses. 1913, housing for Defence perTelephone Services, Cranbourne (Question No. 707) Coastal Surveillance (Question No. 675) Mr Yates asked the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, upon notice, on 16 March (1) Why is the Cranbourne area (STD Zone 059) outside the Melbourne metropolitan zone. on coastal surveillance and (2) When does he intend to take steps to see that machinery and equipment are installed to include the Cranbourne area in the Melbourne metropolitan telephone zone.",319
134,Mr STALEY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The costs of providing facilities for the interconnection of telephone exchanges increase with distance. There is therefore a limit to the distance over which Telecom Australia can economically provide local call access. In the case of the Melbourne metropolitan zone, local calls have not been provided to exchanges more than about 40 km radially from the GPO. This limit is already in excess of that which normally applies and is made possible by the greater concentration of subscribers in the metropolitan area. It has not been possible, however, to extend the zone to include the Cranbourne exchange which is approximately 43.5 km from the GPO. (2) Telecom Australia does not at this stage intend to expand the Melbourne extended local service area to include exchanges. Late last year, however, my predecessor, the Hon. E. L. Robinson, requested the Commission to review the whole question of local call access so as to correct any anomalies. The question of extending metropolitan to include the larger developments adjacent to the existing defined areas is part of this review. Tribunals associated with the Department of Environment, Housing and Community (Question No. 678) Development (Question No. 7*8) Mr N. A. Brown asked the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Develurban and reopment, upon notice, on 4 April 1978: (1) Was his Department requested by the Administrative Review Council to provide information of the type described in Appendix III of the First Annual Report of the AdminisReview Council relating to the operation of tribunals created under legislation administered by his Department a and tribunals administered or serviced by his Department during 1976-77: if so, did his Department respond to that and Local Government request. (2) Will he now provide the information referred to in capacity to involve these pan(l). Mr Groom-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes, the Depanment was so requested and responded by letter dated 17 March 1977. (2) No. As the Council's request has already been answered, it is not proposed to duplicate that reply now. 'Croatian Embassy' Mr E. G. Whitlam asked the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, upon notice, on 4 April 1978: (1) What arrangements have been sought and/or made for the (a) delivery of mail and telegrams addressed to the self-styled 'Croatian Embassy' in Canberra, (b) registration of its publications for transmission as Category B newspapers and (c) rental of telephones in its name. (2) When was the attention of the Australian Postal Commission and the Australian Telecommunications Commission drawn to the expressions of concern on 23 December 1977 by the Minister for Foreign of a self-styled 'Croatian Embassy'. (3) What steps have been or are being taken to avoid the recurrence of the situation which arose concerning the so called ' Rhodesia Information Centre' in 1973.",320
135,Mr STALEY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) All mail and telegrams addressed to the self-styled Croatian Embassy in Canberra are delivered in accordance with the physical address details shown. No arrangements have been sought specifically for the delivery of postal articles addressed to the 'Embassy'. (b) No publication of the Canberra is registered in either Category B or Category A, nor has an application for registration of any publication been received. (c) Acting on advice from the Department of Foreign Affairs, an applicant for telephone service in the name of the New South Wales Land Commission Croatian Embassy was advised by Telecom that the application was not acceptable because it was understood that he was not a member of a diplomatic mission of a sovereign government with which Australia has established diplomatic relations. A service was subsequently applied for and provided in the personal name of the applicant. (2) The attention of the two Commissions was not specifically drawn to the statement Foreign Affairs. There is no doubt, however, that both Commissions are well aware of government policy in these matters and strictly adhere to it. (3) There is no intention on the part of the Government or either Commission to precipitate a situation similar to the one to which the honourable member refers. Postal and telecommunications services will continue to be provided on the basis outlined in 1 (a)-(c ) above. Land Commissions Mr Hodges asked the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development, upon notice, on 5 April 1978: (1) With reference to his predecessor's answer to question No. 1221 (Hansard, 18 November 1976, page 2930) on the matter of land commissions, has the Commonwealth Government encouraged any additional land commissions or have there been any approaches by other States to establish them since 1973. (2) Has his Depanment or any other Commonwealth Government or State Government body conducted any surveys on the effectiveness ofland commissions in reducing the land price spiral for serviced building blocks since 1976. (3) Has there been any additional expenditure on land acquisition by land councils for 1976-77. (Question No. 775) (4) What is the estimated expenditure for 1977-78. (5) What proportion ofland acquisition expenditures has been borne by the Commonwealth. Mr Groom-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Federal Government has not encouraged any additional Land Commissions. However, a proposal has been received from Queensland concerning the establishing of a scheme to fund urban land development. (2) My Depanment is carrying out continuous monitoring of prices for serviced housing blocks in major metropolitan Affairs at the establishment areas. The Committee of Inquiry into Housing Costs has been established to examine land and housing issues in Australia. That Committee is expected to evaluate public policies relating to land development and to provide a framework against which an appropriate Commonwealth role can be developed. The States themselves of course are responsible for conducting ongoing evaluation as pan of their own management procedures. (3) Expenditure on land acquisition in 1976-77 by Land Commissions/Councils has been: (S million) self-styled Croatian Embassy in Urban Non Land Urban land South Australian Land Commission 6.954 0.395 0.798 0.159 Victorian Urban Land Council . . 0.906 Western Australian Urban Lands 3.446 1.087 (4) Land Acquisition programs have been approved in each State for 1977-78 on the following basis: ($m) made by the Minister for South Australian Land Commission . . 4.800 New South Wales Land Commission . . 18.404 Victorian Urban Land Council . . . . 1.000 Western Australian Urban Lands Council 6.900 These amounts are for urban land purchase, No Commonwealth funds have been provided for land acquisition in 1977-78.

(4) How effective have Government initiatives been to 20.341 74.29 date. 93.700 Mr Street-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) to (4) The future structure of industry and any related shortages of skilled labour depend upon a large number of inter-related variables. Some of the main factors include the rate of growth of the economy, investment, labour market Refugees participation rates, consumer demand and overseas trade; (Question No. 847) the development and application of technology; the level and kind of assistance provided to particular industries; and increases in labour costs and labour-related costs. Both the Inquiry into Education and Training, chaired by Professor Williams, and the Study Group on Structural Adjustment, chaired by Sir John Crawford, are giving attention to future supply and demand for manpower. Their reports are expected later this year. The Department of Employment and Industrial Relations produces twice a year short-term forecasts for up to 3 years, of the demand for a range of occupational groups. These forecasts assist immigration selection officers and officers of 170,700 my Department dealing with applications for vocational 235 training assistance. 718 It is hoped that the development of the IMPACT project 9,142 will enable us to acquire a better understanding of the kinds 5,329 of changes in industry and manpower requirements that are 1,975 likely to emerge in the medium term. 11,919 23,543 Regarding training for the skilled trades, the following 19,421 measures have been taken: 9,906 The Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice Full-time 63,394 Training (CRAFT) was introduced in January 1977. 1,639 CRAFT provides rebates for employers who release ap3,256 prentices during paid time for technical education and ap4,450 proved off-the-job training, and allowances to apprentices 14,464 compelled to live away from home to follow their appren1,309 ticeship. In the year 1976-77, the national apprentice in14,060 take increased significantly over the previous year. In 5,662 1977-78, a further small increase over the 1976-77 figure 53,182 has been recorded. However, it is apparent that this 163 national improvement embraces wide variations between 18,859 States and the Territories and my Departure will be study256 ing this aspect further in the near future. 1,050 The Group One-Year Scheme provides for apprentices 7,483 taken on by private employers to receive their first year of 271,415 training in a Commonwealth establishment before returning to their employers to complete the term of apprentice10,000 ship. The Commonwealth pays the wages and all related 12,200 training costs during the year, the employers remaining responsible only for Workers Compensation premiums. The 1,539 Scheme was introduced in 1975 on a pilot basis and has 853 since been expanded. Currently, some 220 apprentices are being trained in this way. Additionally, in 1978, the scheme has been extended Government establishments in South Australia and Queensland, the Commonwealth refunding costs on the same basis. This extension is still under development, but currently some 54 apprentices have been placed for training. The Special Assistance Program for Apprentices under NEAT provides assistance to employers in order to sustain apprentices in training whose employment is jeopardised by work shortage or temporary nnancial problems encountered by their employers. At the end of June 1978, employers of 871 apprentices were being assisted in this way. At my request, the National Training Council has for some months been studying ing the output to the skilled labour force from apprenticeship. The operative word here is ""supplementing'. It is not the intention that any such proposal should replace apprenticeship. I expect to receive proposals from'the Council in the very near future for consideration and discussion with all parties concerned. Community Youth Support Schemes Mr Jacobi asked the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, upon notice, on 2 May 1978: (1) Is it a fact that Community Youth Support Schemes (CYSS) groups in South Australia are purchasing material and equipment for their programs through local government bodies to avoid paying sales tax, hence ensuring that their nnancial resources are used to maximum efficiency. (2) Is it also a fact that in doing so the material ment purchased by these groups must remain the property of the respective local government body. (3) If so, is the effectiveness of CYSS being negated. (4) Can he give an assurance that the situation will be investigated at the earliest opportunity. (5) If so, will he consider vision for the purchasing activities of the CYSS groups and to allow them to retain ownership of material and equipment purchased. (6) Alternatively, will he altering the appropriate legislation to allow CYSS groups to undertake their own purchasing of materials and equipment free of sales tax. Mr Street-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Investigation of all projects in South Australia revealed that only those projects government bodies have purchased materials and equipment free of sales tax. To date, only 4 projects have been involved. (2) No. Grants made under CYSS are made upon the condition that items of equipment valued to be given to the Commonwealth at the completion of the project. (3) Not applicable. (4) , (5) and (6) My Department is currently investigating the desirability and feasibility the material and equipment purchases of all CYSS projects. As a part of this investigation the advice of the Cominvolving missioner for Taxation is being sought.

(4) Can the Attorney-General also say whether Mr Vrisakis was a prominent opponent of the Corporations and Securiues Industry Bill 1975 introduced by the Whitlam Government, but not passed by the Senate. (Question No. 865) Mr VINER - The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) I am informed that the name Alexander Emil Vrisakis is not on the Roll of Barristers and Solicitors of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory. I understand that he is enrolled as a solicitor in New South Wales. (2) I am aware of a Press report in the Australian Financial Review of 20 March 1978 of statements, of the kind referred to, attributed to Mr Justice Holland in the Suand equip- preme Court of New South Wales on 17 March 1978.

Some of these incidents would stand out vividly in the minds of all honourable members. The reference was included to demonstrate that quite apart from the tragic event which occurred outside the Sydney Hilton Hotel earlier this been free of violent acts. As indicated in the lecture terrorism is unfortunately a fact of life both here in Australia and overseas and it may come to pose open society, our values and way of life. Mr E. G. Whitlam asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 10 April 1978: (1) Has Cabinet decided that questions on notice should, except in special cases, be answered within a month (Hansard, 7 September 1977, page 801). (2) Why has he not answered my question which first appeared on the notice paper on 7 September 1977 as No. 1390 and since on 22 February 1978 as No. 78.",323
137,Mr ANTHONY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's quesuon is as follows: (1) As the honourable member would know, it is not the Government's practice to comment on what has, or has not, been the subject of Cabinet discussions.

138,Mr ANTHONY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) Yes. (3) I have had no discussions with Queensland State Ministers on these matters, but my department contacted the Queensland Mines Department on 29 March 1977 seeking information about reports published that day concerning the granting of exploration rights over the Oakey Creek area in the Bowen Basin in Queensland. Apparently due to a misunderstanding, the then Treasurer indicated in Parliament on 31 March 1977 that he understood I had discussed the matter with the Queensland Government. Potato Industry: Use of Machinery (Question No. 950) year, our recent history has not Mr Yates asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce, upon notice, on 4 May, 1978: ever more serious threats to our (1) How many (a) potato harvesting machines and (b) planting and lifting machines made in Australia are sold in Questions on Notice any one year.

(2) The Director of the Australian Heritage Commission did receive a letter from the Director of the Australian Littoral Society in February on a research project, after the Society had learned that the Co-ordinator General's Department had proposed that the project be carried out by the Queensland Fisheries Service. The letter requested that the funds be allocated to the Society for the project, rather than to the Fisheries Service. Mr Barry Jones asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 3 May 1978: (1) Is it a fact that total absences from Australia for periods in excess of 3 months in the 12 months period immediately preceding the grant of an Australian Citizenship Certificate, are regarded as breaking continuity of residence unless the applicant can establish that special circumstances were associated with the case. (2) If so, how many applications grounds of absences which exceeded 3 months in each year since 1969. (3) What special circumstances would be regarded as relevant to set aside the general rule and how are these special circumstances evaluated.

(2) What was the percentage distribution of time purchased by parties and candidates on those broadcasting and television stations. (3) What were the costs charged for this time and what was the percentage distribution of these costs between parties and candidates. (4) How much ume and money were spent on broadcasting the television programs sponsored by Sir Henry Bolte.",328
143,Mr STALEY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The information which has been collated for the honourable member is too lengthy and complex to be published in Copies are available at the Table Office of the House ofRepresentatives. Alcohol and Drug Abuse, Northern Territory: Aborigines (QuestionNo. 1126) Dr Everingham asked the Minister for Health, upon notice, on 9 May 1978: (1) Is it a fact that Northern Territory hospitals have more than 1 bed in 5 occupied by victims of accidents, poisonings, violence or mental disorders. (2) If so, are most of these, and some other diseases requiring hospitalisation,relatedto alcohol or drug misuse. (3) Is the average intake of alcohol by adult male drinkers in the Northern Territory beyond the safe limit. (4) Do some Aboriginal communities (a) spend most of their income on liquor, (b) have an incidence of alcoholism equal to half their adult populations and (c) suffer from a wide range of social and other problems directly contributed Telecomto by drinking problems. (5) Do most Aboriginal communities have no legal or de facto control over the commercial use of alcohol in their respective regions. (6) Has the setting up of mining and other whitecontrolled settlements with liquor sales outlets aggravated these problems. (7) Will he negotiate with other Ministers concerned with mineral development and Aboriginal affairs and spokesmen communities, the acquisition of liquor distribution and sale by local public authorities on terms which would prevent leasing of these functions to anyone who would stand to increase profits with any increase of liquor sales in planned new townships which would make liquor more accessible to Aboriginal communities.",333
144,Mr HUNT,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Hospital admissions statistically categorised in a way that could confirm the honourable member's statement. However, staustics from the Nonhern Territory hospitals per cent of total hospital separations related to the conditions mentioned by the honourable member. (2) It is believed that many of the admissions to hospital are associated with alcohol mation is not available. (3) The safe limit of alcohol 40 grams per day with 80 grams per day seen as a hazardous level. Adult male average consumption in the Northern Territory is 48.9 grams per day which would indicate that many may be drinking at a dangerous level. (4) (a) The percentage of Aboriginal income spent on alcohol varies from community to community. The fewfiguresavailable from 5 per cent on Maningrida outstations to 27 per cent at Bamyili and 50 per cent at Oenpelli. (b) While statistics are not available it is considered that the level of clinical alcoholism would be well below this rate. Problem be likely to reach the level stated in many communities. Unless this group can modify its drinking behaviour there is a danger of a higher level of clinical alcoholism developing. (c) Yes. However it would appear that alcohol abuse is mainly a means of escape from a depressed physical, social and economic environment. It is obvious that this form of escape the problem being faced. (5) No. Some element of control over the provision of alcohol in Aboriginal communities exists in the permit system where permits are only issued with the approval of local Aboriginal council. Other have decided either that they to be placed on the type and quantity of alcohol on sale. Some communities, using legal means, have caused storekeepers to lose liquor licences. communities have made arrangements with local liquor sales outlets for restrictions on the type and quantity of alcohol sales. Following a number of lems faced by Aboriginals, the Nonhern Territory LegislatMinister for Science the ive Council has sought Aboriginal viewpoints opment of new liquor legislation. (6) The development of liquor outlets in the wake of both mining development and the expansion meant that many Aboriginals have easier access to alcohol supplies; this has led in some instances abuse. While this is unfonunate, legal measures or by the restriction of sales outlets is not a long-term solution to the problem. People must develop tudes and behavioural patterns that such social dangers as the availability essential for all Australians not merely Aboriginals. (7) I am willing to negotiate on health of Aboriginals. Arrangements have been made for me to discuss with other Ministers the final repon on alcohol problems of Aboriginals prepared by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs. My Depanment has also been involved in discussions on the control of alcohol and the protection in the new liquor legislation now being prepared in the Northern Territory.

(2) Which members and senators are included on these committees. Mr Ellicott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I am informed by my Department as follows: (1) The National Memorials Ordinance 1928 establishes the Canberra National Memorials Committee. This Committee is continuing. (2) Membership of the Committee includes: The Prime Minister, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, the Minister for the Capital Territory, sition in the Senate, and the House of Representatives. Mr Scholes asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 11 May 1978: (1) What conditions apply to the use of aircraft from No. 34 Squadron. (2) What are the nnancial arrangements for charging the cost of travel under these arrangements. (3) Under what circumstances are members or shadow ministers entitled to travel on VIP aircraft. (4) Are arrangements for the use of No. 34 Squadron aircraft during election periods solely at his discretion. (5) Can senators be transported within their State. Mr Killen-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The rules for the use of the special aircraft of No. Squadron are those which were tabled in the House of Representatives on 6 March 1973 by the then Minister for Defence, the Honourable Lance Barnard, M.P. In all cases where a request for travel does not meet the general criteria laid down in the rules, the matter is for decision by the Prime Minister. (2) The Department of Defence raises quarterly accounts on the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet in respect of hours flown and other costs incurred by No. 34 Squadron aircraft in transporting entitled persons. Costs which are additional to normal RAAF operations are recovered, and for this purpose hourly rates, which comprise fuel, civil contractor servicing and spares costs are established for each of the three types of aircraft operated by the Squadron. Other charges recovered include the actual costs of rations consumed, aircraft handling and landing fees, cleaning costs, and any other marginal or extra costs associated with the carriage of entitled persons which are not normally the responsibility of the Department of Defence. (3) The rules provide that 'where a Minister or the Leader of the Opposition is using an aircraft of No. 34 Squadron to visit a particular area it is in order for him to be accompanied by the Local Federal Member for that area'. Shadow ministers are not specifically provided for in the rules. (4) No special provision is made in the rules for the use of aircraft of No. 34 Squadron during election periods. (QuestionNo. 1158) It has been the practice for the Prime Minister to make available an aircraft to the Leader of the Opposition for the elecuon period. An aircraft has also been made available where possible to another nominated senior representative of the Opposition. Apart from the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and (when in Government) the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, Ministers are normally only granted the use of an aircraft where there is a clear requirement directly related to their portfolio responsibilities. (5) There is no provision in the rules for the use of No. 34 Squadron aircraft by individual senators, other than Ministers. It should be noted that in the broad context of the rules, senators and members, other than Ministers, are on occasions permitted to travel under emergency or special circumstances where the approving authority considers that this mode of travel is justified and the Prime Minister has agreed. the Leader of the OppoLeader of the Opposition in the Grants to Authors (QuestionNo. 1173) VIP Aircraft Mr Baume asked the Minister for Home (QuestionNo. 1168) Affairs, upon notice, on 11 May 1978: Who were the 10 major recipients of Commonwealth Government grants for literature through the Commonwealth Literary Fund and its successor, the Literature Board of the Australia Council, and what were the total grants made to each of these authors. Mr Ellicott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Australia Council has advised me that its Literature Board holds a list of authors who were assisted by the former Commonwealth Literary Fund between 1939 and 1973. It does not hold records of payments made in relation to these grants. I am further advised that a ful) list of payments made by the Commonwealth Literary Fund would require an extensive search of archival records of several departments. In the circumstances I am not prepared to release scarce staff 34 resources for this task. Records are readily available of payments made from the Literature Board from 1 July 1973, when it was established. The 10 major recipients of grants from the Board are set out below: $ David Ireland 48,250 Frank Moorhouse 48,250 Rodney Hall 43,917 Geoffrey Pike 40,750 David Foster 40,500 Morris Lurie 39,500 Ken Cook 37,750 Leslie Murray 37,434 Robert Adamson Murray Bail Conservation of Art Collections Mr Barry Jones asked the Minister for Home Affairs, upon notice, on 23 May 1978: (1) Has his attention been drawn to a statement by Professor Peter Karmel, the retiring Chairman of the Australia Council, in the last annual repon of the Australia Council that many of the nation's artistic treasures are definitely deteriorating and that if the facades of many Government buildings were allowed to deteriorate to the degree that many of the nation's works of an have deteriorated, there would be a national outcry. (2) If so, what is the extent of the problem and will he provide examples of works in urgent need for restoration. (3) What action has the Government taken to provide training for expen conservators. (4) What action will the Government take to secure the appointment of expen conservators as a matter of urgency. Mr Ellicott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) The Repon of the Committee of Inquiry on Museums and National Collections spelled out in detail the extent of deterioration of an collections in Australia. Storage and the lack of qualified conservators are the major problems and action is being taken by the Government to overcome them. I am informed that the Visual Arts Board of the Australia Council has in the past, assisted several regional galleries in Victoria in conserving their collections. The Board has also provided salary assistance for conservators at the Tasmanian Museum and An Gallery and the Queen Victoria Museum and An Gallery, Launceston. In the latter instance, no appointment has yet been made. (3) The Canberra College of Advanced Education introduced courses in materials conservation in 1978. These courses which are at post graduate and undergraduate level are funded by the Commonwealth under normal Advanced Education arrangements. (4) I am informed that the Public Service Board has undertaken a review of the structure and pay rates of conservator staff. After comparison with overseas organisations and State instrumentalities, as well as extensive consultations with interested agencies, the Board has near completion a proposal to revise structures and pay rates for conservators. A decision is expected shonly. With the availability of this structure, it is anticipated that prospects for recruiting conservator staff will be enhanced.

Mr Jacobi asked the Minister for Trade and Resources, upon notice, on 24 May 1977: (1) Has Englehard Minerals and Chemicals Corporauon of the United States of America obtained an interest in a large West Australian kaolin deposit. (2) Is kaolin regarded as a potential source of aluminium; if so, how much aluminium is contained in the deposit. (3) Does the United States have access to technology for extracting aluminium from kaolin. (4) Is it a fact that the process by which aluminium is extracted from kaolin also produces titanium as a valuable by-product. (5) Will he (a) urgently investigate whether the interest in the kaolin deposits referred to in pan (1) is to utilise these deposits ultimately as a substitute for bauxite and (b) take all steps to protect Australia's interest in these valuable deposits. Mr Nixon-the answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I have seen reports in the media to the effect that Englehard Minerals and Chemicals Corp. of the United States has negotiated an agreement with West Australian Kaolin Pty Ltd to undenake the development of a Kaolin deposit at Gabbin in Western Australia. (2) to (4) I have been advised by the Bureau of Mineral Resources as follows: Clays are a potential source of aluminium although their use in aluminium production is currently uneconomic and not competitive with the Bayer process for the extraction of alumina from bauxite. From an average of chemical analyses carried out by CSIRO, the alumina content of the Gabbin coating clay is 38 percent, aluminium. Gross reserves reponed by West Australian Kaolin Pty Ltd (in terms of clay content) areCoating clay 10,700,000 tonnes Filler clay 6,150,000 tonnes No analysis of the filler clay is available, but it is pure variety than the coating clay, and the alumina content is probably lower. It would seem from reports its economic importance mainly coating clay because of its very high grade. There are several large deposits of clays in Western Australia better situated in respect of transpon equally as suitable as sources of alumina should there ever be a demand for clay for this purpose. The United States Bureau of Mines has been involved for more than 50 years in research on methods of extracting alumina from its vast domestic resources of nonbauxitic materials. Studies of a variety nologies developed within the outside USBM have shown that to date none of the alternative processes is competitive with the Bayer process using bauxite. The USB Mreponedin 1976 that it was not possible predict which alternative process might eventually prove to be commercially feasible. A pilot plant based on the most promising mini-plant technology would need to built and operated to provide data for scaling up the selected process to commercial size and enable cost estiused, mates to be made. The main advantage of the research date is that it has demonstrated that the US could, Kaolin Deposits national emergency and if necessary, satisfy its need for alumina from its ownresources.However, because of the (QuestionNo. 1216) uneconomic nature of the alternative processes any such project to produce alumina would need to be a government venture and could not be undenaken economically by a private company. The importance oftitaniumas a by-product of any process for the extraction of alumina from clay would depend on the concentration of titania in the clay, the form in which it occurs, and the feasibility of extracting it from the residueresultingfrom the alumina production process. It is imponant to realise in this context that Australian bauxites contain titanium (usually in higher proportion than that in the Gabbin kaolin yet the titanium is not in a usable form in the red mud residues, and so far extraction has not been feasible. An average of analyses carried out by CSIRO on the Gabbin clay showed it to have a ti0 content of 0.41 2 percent. (5) (a) In view of the above technical advice, it would seem highly unlikely that development of a kaolin deposit in Western Australia would be based on its potential as an alternative to bauxite in aluminium production, (b) Any proposal by Englehard to jointly develop these Kaolin deposits would need to be submitted to the Foreign Investment Review Board for examination under the Foreign Investment Guidelines and would be considered by the Government in the light of the Board's report. It has not been, however, the practice of this Government, nor that of its predecessor, to provide information on whether or not a proposal has been submitted to the Foreign Investment Review Board.

(3) Will the Government indicate in detail the method of safe long term disposal of nuclear waste upon which it purports to rely.",337
149,Mr ANTHONY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable of process techmember's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) The Government was persuaded by the weight of scientific evidence placed before it, that the technology exists to for the safe management and ultimate disposal of highly radioactive waste. This view is also held by the International Atomic Energy Agency which states that 'the technology for be handling them (i.e. high level wastes) is developed, the difficulty is in deciding which of several methods should be on a commercial basis'. I suggest that if the honourable to member wishes to discuss scientific evidence in detail he in communicate directly with the Atomic Energy Commission.

EEC Within the framework of the Common Agricultural Policy, the EEC operates a variable levy system on imports of cheese. The levy is calculated as the difference between the prevailing world market for each of the various cheese types and the threshold price established by the Community. The level of the threshold price and the magnitude of the levies on cheese imports are such that imports of cheese on a regular basis from efficient producers such as Australia are for all practical purposes excluded. The threshold price is currently approximately $2,850 per tonne and the levy $2,150 per tonne for bulk cheddar cheese. In addition, the EEC operates a system of export restitutions whereby prices for EEC cheese exports are heavily subsidised in order to compete in world export markets.

Re-enactment of Captain Cook's Voyage Mr Morris asked the Minister for Home Affairs, upon notice, on 25 May 1978: (1) Has his attention been drawn to activities being organised in eastern Australia, in association with the 250th anniversary of the binh of Captain James Cook, and the reenactment ofhis voyage along Australia's east coast. (2) What nnancial contribution is the Government making towards these activities. (3) Is he able to say what international activities are being arranged in association with the 250th anniversary of Captain James Cook's binh. (4) Has practical assistance been sought from the Australian Government by the organisers of the 250th anniversary celebration; if so, what has been the Government's response. (5) Will he arrange for a statement to be prepared and distributed about the celebrations. (6) Has his attention also being played by members of Redhead Surf Life Saving Club in the re-enactment of the voyage of Captain James Cook in 1770, northward along Australia's east coast. Mr ElHcott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) My attention was drawn to the re-enactment of Captain Cook's voyage along the east coast of Australia. I am not aware of any other activities being organized in eastern Australia to mark this anniversary. (2) The Government did not make a nnancial contribution to the re-enactment voyage. (3) The only activity I am aware of, which might be described as international, is the formation of a Captain Cook Trust in Britain which has launched an international appeal to set up a Captain Cook Birthplace Museum. (4) In regard to the activities in Britain 1 understand that the Australian Government has been asked to provide some practical assistance to the Captain Cook Trust. The organisers of the re-enactment ern Australian coast sought some practical assistance from the Government. This request was not agreed to. I have asked my Depanment to consult with other interested Depanments and Authorities with a view to submitting recommendations on proposals for celebrating these anniversaries in Australia and Britain. It should be noted, however, that this anniversary falls soon after the 1970 Bicentenary when a major contribution was made by the Commonwealth to the celebrations which then took place. (5) I will give consideration to making a statement at a time closer to the anniversary. (6) Yes.

(2) Did the Specialist Staff Association write to the Medical Superintendent at the hospital that the specialist staff had voted unanimously to protest strongly against restrictive policies which place the lives of their patients at risk. (3) If so, will he take immediate action to alleviate the problems existing at the hospital. Mr Adermann-The answer to the honourable member's quesuon is as follows: (1) and (3) No. The Repatriation General Hospital, Greenslopes, as a part of the Department of Veterans' Affairs, is subject to staff ceiling restrictions as are all other Commonwealth Departments. The Repatriation Commission has directed that no patient is to be admitted unless an adequate standard of medical care can be provided.

(2) Does the higher percentage of fixed capital costs to total capital required and the different cash flow problems farmers, compared with other types of small business, result in forced sales of farms rather than bankruptcies. (3) Are there any ngures reflect the number of failed farmers.",347
156,Mr SINCLAIR,SUMS APPROPRIATED,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The figures supplied by the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs in answer to question No. 412 relate only to bankruptcy. They do not directly measure the financial situation of primary producers as a whole. (2) Data are not available that would enable a comparison to be made along the lines suggested between the financial situation facing farmers and the non-rural small business sector. In times of low farm income, producers may have difficulty in servicing their current financial commitments despite their considerable residual net worth. (3) There are no statistics available that directly measure the number of failed farmers. Some indication of the number of farmers facing some degree of financial difficulty can be obtained from the following tables.

Mr Ellicott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: No decision has been taken at this time to sponsor activities to mark this anniversary. I have however, asked my Depanment to consult with interested Departments and Authorities with a view to submitting recommendations on proposals for celebrating these anniversaries in Australia and Britain.

159,Mr HUNT,SUMS APPROPRIATED,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I am aware of the recent press repon concerning alleged views of the GROW organisation on drug education. The claim that the Federal Government's National Drug Education Program is doing more harm than good is not in accordance with the true situation. Demands from all sectors of the community are increasing for the programs, which are conducted by Federal and State Health authorities. The Commonwealth Government, in 1977-78, provided $825,000 for the National Program which is developed, coordinated and evaluated by the Drug Education Sub-Committee of the National Standing Control Committee on Drugs of Dependence. The Sub-Committee comprises Federal and State Health education administrators as well as members with special expertise in the education, management and law enforcement fields and has developed a national approach to drug education. This approach stresses the fact that all drugs can cause harm depending upon the dose taken, the frequency of use, the kind of individual and the setting in which the drug is taken. The Drug Education Sub-Committee considers that the provision of information on drugs is only one aspect of an education program. It recommends that drug education be conducted in the broad context phasis on personal relationships, lifestyles, decision-making and 'alternatives' to drugs. The National Program follows the principles advocated by the World Health Organization and UNESCO for effective drug education. Developments, both local and overseas, associated with all aspects of drugs of dependence Department and up-to-date information from authoritative sources is provided in various publications for use by people working in related areas as well as the public.

Mr MACKellar-The answer to the honour(Question No. 1436) able member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) No metal or glass waste is generated by my Department. I understand that my colleague, the Minister for Administrative Services in his answer to question No. 1437 will deal with the recycling of waste paper by Commonwealth Government bodies. Recycling of Waste Materials (Question No. 1449) Mr Uren asked the Minister for the Northern Territory, upon notice, on 2 June 1978: (1) What arrangements are made in his Department and statutory authorities under his control for the recycling of waste materials such as paper, metals and glass. In other cases, removal of waste (2) If no arrangements for recycling presently exist, will he implement, or investigate the implications of, procedures for the recycling of waste materials. Mr Adermann-The answer to the honourable quantities of metal or glass member's question is as follows: (1) None. (2) The major functions of the Depanment of the Northern Territory were transferred to the Nonhern Territory Government on I July 1978 and the residual functions are to be incorporated in the Department of Home Affairs as from 1 October 1978. In these circumstances I do not propose to pursue the suggestion of the honourable member. Recycling of Waste Materials Mr Uren asked the Minister for Construction, upon notice, on 2 June 1978: (1) What anangements are made in his Depanment and statutory authorities under his control for the recycling of waste materials such as paper, metals and glass. (2) If no anangements for implement, or investigate the implementation of, procedures for the recycling of waste materials. Mr MCLeay-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The following anangements apply within the Depanment of Construction and the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation for recycling of waste materials such as paper, metals and glass. Paper-Where the Depanment shares premises with other Departments a contract for the collection and disposal of waste paper is arranged by the Depanment of Administrative Services. In other cases it is usual for the Depanment to arrange with its cleaning contractor for the disposal of waste paper. It is known that some contractors arrange for recycling of waste paper. The Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation has no facilities to permit the reuse of waste paper but arrangements are made for bulk collection of papers for later recycling. Waste Building Materials-Reusabl e building material (other than that which is specified as the property of a contractor) is either reused or sold by the Department. At the Department's works depots scrap ferrous and non-ferrous metals are collected and sold in quantity lots for recycling. The Department's glass scrap is minimal and is generally dumped with other unusable building waste. Occasionally reusable glass windows or glass sheets are salvaged and it is either reused by the Department or sold. The Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation has very little waste metal, glass or other materials salvaged. Scrap metal is retained and sold on the open market from time to time but the amount involved is very small. (2) See(l)above. Recycling of Waste Materials Mr Uren asked the Minister for the Capital Territory, upon notice, on 2 June 1978: (1) What arrangements are made in his Department and statutory authorities under his control for the recycling of waste materials such as paper, metals and glass. (2) If no arrangements for implement, or investigate the implementation of, procedures for the recycling of waste materials. Mr Ellicott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) My Department closely co-operates with established companies in the field of recycling in Canberra. Industiy groups recycle paper and cardboard from commercial and residential areas on a programmed basis. The Depanment has established recycling centres for glass, paper, cardboard and cans in nonh Canberra. Funher centres will be developed in south Canberra at Phillip and at the new landfill tip within the next few months. Materials recycled are forwarded to Sydney or Melbourne by industry groups. (QuestionNo. 1450) The Depanment has a contract for the disposal of car bodies in the Australian Capital Territory. Approximately 3,000 to 4,000 derelict cars are handled each year. The National Capital Development Commission has an arrangement with an industry recycler for removal of waste paper from buildings occupied by the Commission. recycling presently exist, will he Recycling of Waste Materials (QuestionNo. 1461) Mr Uren asked the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development, upon notice, on 2 June 1978: (1) What arrangements are made in his Department and statutory authorities under his control for the recycling of waste materials such as paper, metals and glass. (2) If no anangements for recycling presently exist, will he implement, or investigate the implementation of, procedures for the recycling of waste materials. Mr Groom-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Receptacles for the collection of waste paper have been placed on each floor of the buildings occupied by my Department. When the receptacles are full the paper is transferred by Depanmental officers to the basement of the buildings for collection by a paper recycling company. (2) There is currently no requirement to recycle metals and glass as the generation of these materials as waste does not occur. Should the need become evident in future the implementation of procedures for recycling will be investigated. Ministerial Travel Overseas (QuestionNo. 1467) Mr Morris asked the Minister for Special Trade Representations, upon notice, on 6 June 1978: When and where did he travel outside Australia by (a) (Question No. 1460) aircraft and (b) yacht in the period since 11 November 1975. Mr Garland-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: As a private member I travelled to Europe by aircraft in December 1976 and returned to Australia in February 1977. recycling presently exist, will he As a private member I travelled by yacht to Indonesia for a week's leave in August 1977 and returned by aircraft. As Minister for Special Trade Representations and Minister Assisting the Minister for Trade and Resources, I made three visits overseas in 1978. The first commenced in February, the second in April and the third in June. Full details of these visits were announced at those times. Prime Minister's overseas visit-accompanyin g party on 27 and 28 June 1977 Mr Morris asked the Prime Minister, upon SocialStaff notice, on 7 June 1978: (1) Did he state in answer to question No. 202 (Hansard, 14 March 1978, page 728) that seven lst class seats were Aboriginal Affairs purchased on flight QF 4 Honolulu/Sydney on 27 and 28 June 1977. (2) Did he also state in answer to question No. 811 (HanImmigration and Ethnic Affairs . . sard, 23 May 1978, page 2365) that he was accompanied by eight persons when he travelled on flight QF 4 Honolulu/Sydney on 27 and 28 June 1977. (3) Were two additional passengers carried free of charge Construction by Qantas; if not, who was responsible for the payment of the fares.",357

Ethnic Liaison Officers Qld NSW (Question No. 1495) Dr Cass asked the Minister for Immigration $ S and Ethnic Affairs in the House of Representa1,486 9,905 tives, upon notice, on 7 June 1978: 2,327 11,892 8,458 6,142 (1) Which Departments have appointed ethnic liaison 246 1,178 officers? 661 2,112 (2) At what level are each of these officers classified; 2 2,369 (3) What are the precise duties required of these officers 855 15,304 and approximately how many hours per week are involved 7 6,056 in fulfilling these functions; 518 1,241 15 77 (4) Are they paid any additional loading for undertaking 150 1,598 these functions; if so, what are the details. 284 820 Mr MACKellar-The answer to the honour631 696 able member's question is as follows: 239 513 7,928 (1) The Departments and Authorities currently participat200 1,194 ing in this scheme are: 632 10,433 Departments 21 1,834 Aboriginal Affairs Administrative Services Attorney-General's Department Business and Consumer Affairs Capital Territory Construction Defence Education Employment and Industrial Relations Environment, Housing and Community Development Finance Foreign Affairs Health Home Affairs Industry and Commerce National Development The Northern Territory Post and Telecommunications Primary Industry Prime Minister and Cabinet Productivity Science Social Security Trade and Resources Transport Department of the Treasury Department of Veterans' Affairs Other Organisations Australian Bureau of Statistics Australian Electoral Office Australian Taxation Office National Capital Development Commission Public Service Board (2) All ethnic liaison officers appointed are senior officers and at least one from each Depanment or Authority is a second division officer. (3) The duties of an ethnic liaison officer are to give effect to the purposes set out in the Prime Minister's statement of 1 March 1978 when he announced the Government's intention to implement the ethnic liaison officer scheme. The statistics sought are not available. (4) No. Migrants: Capital inflow and outflow Dr Cass asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 7 June 1978: (1) How much capital was brought into Australia by immigrants in (a) monetary terms and (b) per capita terms in 1976-77. (2) How much capital was remitted overseas by former immigrants to Australia in 1976-77. Mr MACKellar-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I ) and (2) Accurate and detailed statistics on the flow of funds attributable to migrants and former migrants are not available. Estimates by the Australian Bureau of Statistics indicate that in 1976-77 at least $276 million was brought into Australia by migrants. This represents an average of $3,892 for each settler, including children, arriving that year. It should be noted, however, that the above ngures include only those funds identified by the Australian banking system as being directly attributable to migrants. I understand that, for example, these figures exclude real estate previously owned overseas in cases where the sale takes place after the owner's arrival in Australia. Also excluded from these figures is the considerable value of tangible assets which migrants bring with them. Figures for outward movement of capital are not available in the form requested by the honourable member. Figures for outward transfers include funds transferred not only by former immigrants but also by Australians emigrating or intending to reside overseas for 12 months or longer. Control of Insects in Grain and Seed Storages (QuestionNo. 1498) Mr MCVeigh asked the Minister representing the Minister for Science, upon notice, on 7 June 1978: (1) Are insect pests in grain and seeds showing an increased resistance to insecticides such as malathion. (2) If so. has the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization reached any conclusions on the control of insects in grain and seeds through fumigation in sealed grain silos and storages. Mr Adermann-The Minister for Science has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes. Insect pests in stored grain and seeds are showing increased resistance to a range of insecticides, including malathion. (2) Of the insect-control methods now in use, CSIRO considers fumigation with toxic gases to be the preferred method. It has particular application in controlling insecticide-resistant strains of pests. However, fumigation cannot readily be adopted in most Australian bulk grain storages because they are not gas-tight. The most commonly used method of insect control is still with contact insecticides such as malathion. Recent CSIRO research on a variant of fumigation-usin g controlled atmospheres-ha s established the value of the atmospheric gases nitrogen and, more particularly, carbon dioxide, in place of highly toxic gaseous chemicals. Associated with this work have been efforts to develop ways of sealing existing grain silos to make them sufficiently gas-tight for fumigation control. Widespread adoption of the controlled atmosphere method (or any fumigation method) depends largely on (QuestionNo. 1496) whether Australia's existing and future bulk grain storage and handling systems can be sealed to the required degree of gas-tightness. This is a long-term proposition.'In the meantime, other solutions to the insecticide-resistance problem are needed, and CSIRO is experimenting with new chemicals and improved methods of insecticidal control. Both this and the controlled atmosphere research are carried out in cooperation with the Australian Wheat Board, State grain elevator boards, and State Departments of Agriculture. There is similar co-operation with two other CSIRO research programs on the control of stored grain pests, namely, control by cooled/refrigerated air, and control by hot air. Beef Exports to the United States of America (Question No. 1500) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Trade and Resources, upon notice, on 7 June 1978: Is it a fact that MCDonalds, the largest hamburger chain in the United States of America and a large and expanding fast food retailer in Australia, has in the United States opposed the importation of Australian beef. the proceeds of the sale of If so, what action can be taken, either legally or by adverse publicity, to remind that company that it cannot have its hamburger and eat it too by rejecting Australian beef in the United States and by profiting by it in Australia.",359
165,Mr ANTHONY,SUMS APPROPRIATED,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: It appears that your question may have been prompted by a rumour that MCDonalds had indicated their support for the countercyclical bill proposed by Senator Bentsen, which would reduce imports at times of high production in the United States. The origin of this rumour appears to be a brochure recently published by MCDonalds which states that they have always maintained a policy of using only domestic beef in their oudets. At no said for or against imports. River Murray: Effect of Dartmouth Dam Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for National Development, upon notice, on 7 June 1978: (1) What progress is being made with proposals to improve the capacity of the Murray River, in the area known as the Barmah Choke, to accommodate the increased summer flow following the completion of the Dartmouth Dam. (2) What safeguards will there be for the red gum forest and the ibis and other bird life areas. Mr Newman-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Investigations by the River Murray Commission, in conjunction with the respective State water authorities, are still continuing into means whereby increased demands in the River Murray below the Barmah can be met following the completion of Dartmouth Dam without exceeding, for any extended length of time, the existing channel capacity in the area known as the Barmah Choke. (2) These have not yet been determined, but they will be considered in the light of the outcome of the investigations referred to in (1) above. An essential element of these investigations is to identify the effects of suitable management proposals on the environment, including the red gum forests, ibis and other bird life. Beef Industry: Rural Adjustment Scheme Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice, on 8 June 1978: (1) What progress is being made with the implementation of the fifth point in his seven-point program for the beef dustry announced in September 1977. (2) Does this point concern the ary, revision of the rural adjustment equacy of that scheme for beef producers.",361
166,Mr SINCLAIR,SUMS APPROPRIATED,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) As foreshadowed in my statement of 22 September 1977, urgent discussions were held with State governments. As a result, two forms of assistance under the Rural Adjustment Scheme have been modified. (a) Carry on loans to beef producers have been extended to 30 June 1979 and the total amount per producer increased. The revised terms and conditions for such loans were published in the Commonwealth Gazette of 30 May 1978. (b) The conditions governing the provision of household support to all eligible producers have been relaxed by: Extending from six months to one year the period in respect of which assistance is normally converted to a grant; Extending from one year to two years the additional period for which household support may be continued at the discretion of the administering authority; Increasing the maximum lump sum payment which may be made in lieu of household support from $3,000 to $5,000. point in the brochure is anything Tuberculosis and Brucellosis eradication programs in the United States of America (QuestionNo. 1502) (QuestionNo. 1516) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice, on 8 June 1978: (1) Is he able to say whether agriculture is the only sector to be cut in the United States budget proposed by President Carter, and that the allocation for tuberculosis and brucellosis eradication has been reduced to $5.2m for 1979. (2) If so, is he also able to say whether (a) such a cut means that the United States is no longer giving the same priority to the eradication of tuberculosis and brucellosis, (b) the States finance most of the United States eradication program and (c) the 1984 deadline for eradication of the diseases will still be met.",361
167,Mr SINCLAIR,SUMS APPROPRIATED,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Although full details of the United States budget proposed by President Carter are not yet available, preliminary ngures indicate that agriculture is not the only sector to be affected by President Carter's proposed stringency measures. However, the tuberculosis and brucellosis eradication programs will not be affected by these proposed reductions in expenditure. The proposed allocation to the USDA for brucellosis eradication in 1978-79 is $64m, an increase of $8.1 m on the allocation for 1977-78. A slight reduction in funds allocated to the USDA for tuberculosis eradication is proposed but this is due largely to the success of the program, with the disease now being virtually (QuestionNo. 1515) eradicated from the USA. (2) (a) The USDA has directed substantial funds and resources to the brucellosis problem over the last few years, with USDA expenditure on brucellosis eradication being $36.8m in 1975-76, $41.5m in 1976-77 and $53.9m in the in- currentfiscalyear. The proposed USDA allocation of $64m for the next Financial year indicates that the priority given to the complete eradication of this disease has not been evaluation and, if necess- reduced. scheme to ensure the ad(b) With regard to the States' contribution to the funding of the brucellosis eradication program in the USA it is understood that in the past the States together have at least matched the USDA expenditure. For the next fiscal year it is reported that most States plan to increase their contribution to cover at least increased costs due to inflation. (c) Significant progress has been made in brucellosis eradication over the last three years and although there are some problems in a number of the southern States the goal of complete eradication is now in sight. For example, the number of infected herds has been reduced from 16,000 in December 1975 to only 8,000 in September 1977. With only 8,000 infected herds, 99.6 per cent of the 1.8 million herds in the USA are now free of the disease. The increased funds and resources that have been made available for brucellosis eradication and the recent progress indicate that the 1983 deadline for complete eradication should be met.

171,Mr HUNT,SUMS APPROPRIATED,"The answer to the honourable member's quesuon is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) 28 February 1978. (3) At its 85th Session, June 1978, the National Health and Medical Research Council stated: Lead content of petrol Council noted available information, including the report 'Motor Spirit-Octan e Ratings and Lead Additives' prepared by the National Energy Advisory Committee, February 1978 and a paper issued recently by the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries, Council saw no reason to modify its previous recommendations on the lead content of petrol. The previous recommendations, made at the Council's 77th Session in November 1973 related to quantitative limits to the concentration of lead in petrol. Council considered available data on the effect of human health of the emissions of lead from motor vehicles. Council recommended, pending the results of further studies on the biological effects of lead that measures be adopted to ensure that emissions of lead from motor vehicles are not increased. To satisfy this requirement, Council recommended that the concentration of lead in petrol be limited to: other industries are shown below. The ABS does not separately define a tertiary industry. In the following table all (Question No. 1523) other industries notionally would include a tertiary industry but also include such industries as electricity, gas and water and construction which generally would not be considered to be tertiary industries. Data used in the calculations for he last three years specified below are classified according to the Australian Standard Industrial Classification, while the data for earlier periods are classified according to the 1966 Population Census 'Classified List of Industries'. The change in classifications has not had a significant effect on the reported shares of the primary and mining industries but it has resulted in a net reduction of about two percentage points in the share attributed to manufacturing industry during the last three periods shown.

Council recognised the possible need for further progressive reductions in the concentrations of lead in petrol in order to ensure that lead emissions from motor vehicles are contained at existing levels; however, Council agreed that a valid projection of this need could not be made until developments in the uses of alternative energy sources and the viability of the lead filter are made known. The emissions of lead from motor vehicles means the total mass emission of lead emitted into the atmosphere by the total population of motor vehicles in Australia.

Mr Adermann-The Minister for Science has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: CSIRO has provided an analysis of research expenditures on the basis of expenditure by each of its research Divisions over the period requested. There have been organizational changes over the quarter century under consideration. Also, individual research programs may be of significance for more than one sector; for instance, studies on land resources may be relevant to the primary, For these reasons, the ngures should be regarded only as indicating broad trends. For the purposes of the analysis, the following definitions have been used: Primary Industry-Agricultura l and pastoral production, forestry and fisheries Mining-Primar y extraction, benefication and processing Manufacturing Industry-Manufactur e of goods and equipment Tertiary-Broadly , the service area including vices as building, environmental management and conservation, health, transport and water.

The former Division of Nutritional Biochemistry has become the Division of Human Nutrition. Several Divisions formerly concerned with agricultural land use have been regrouped as the Land Resources Laboratories and are now concerned with a broader range of land use options, bringing part of their interests into the tertiary area. mining and tertiary sectors.
