1,Sir JOHN FORREST,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"Will the Prime Minister lay upon the table a return showing the amount'of revenue which will be lost, to each of the States by reason of the decision of the High Court that Commonwealth officers are not subject to State tion, and the number of Commonwealth officers affected by the decision, having gard to the fact that many Commonwealth officers would in no case be liable to pay income tax, because their salaries are less than the amounts exempted by the States laws?",12
2,Mr REID,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"1I have .already asked for the information, and shall lay it upon the table when I receive it. IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION ACT.",13
3,Mr CARPENTER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"It is stated in a press paragraph this morning that the Minister contemplates giving the Agentsadministration General discretionary power in reference to tion' Act. some of the provisions of the Immigration Restriction Act. If that be so, will the right honourable gentleman tell the House what are the provisions with respect to which he intends to give this discretionary vene. power, and let us know what the discretion will really amount to, before he does thing further in the matter ?",13
4,Mr REID,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I have seen the statement not do so. to which the honourable member alludes. One might infer from it that there is more than one Prime Minister in the Commonwealth, .because I have not said a word to any human being on the subjectreferredto.",13
5,Mr TUDOR,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"T should like to ask the other half of the Prime Minister, his equal-in-all-things, whether he has such information to the press?",13
6,Mr REID,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,Is the honourable member order in using that mode of address when asking a formal question of a Minister ?  stated in this Chamber that the Minister of Trade and Customs would be his equal all things. He has.used the words himters self.,13
7,Mr REID,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I have applied a number expressions to honourable members opposite, which I do not think I should be in order in using in asking an official question.",13
8,Mr SPEAKER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,I think that in formal questions to a Minister his.proper official title should be used.,13
9,Mr TUDOR,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"Then I desire to ask the lo if? Minister of Trade and Customs; who, we have been led to believe, is the equal all things of 'the Prime Minister^- Mr Reid!-Is that style of. address in order ?",13
10,Mr SPEAKER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"It does not appear me that the question can fairly be taken exception to. The honourable member for taxaYarra has addressed the Minister by his official title, adding the reason why he is re- asking the question, which he has a right to do. So far as he has gone, I think the question is perfectly in order.",13
11,Mr TUDOR,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I wish to ask the Minister of Trade and Customs, who is, as I have stated, the alleged equal in all things of the Prime Minister, whether the newspaper paragraph to which the honourable member, for Fremantle has drawn attention refers to action contemplated by him?",13
12,Mr REID,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,The honourable member for Yarra must' know that the Minister of Trade Prime and Customs has nothing to do with the of the Immigration Restric,13
13,Mr CROUCH,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"The honourable member for Yarra addressed his question to the Minister of Trade and Customs, and I take it that the Prime Minister has no right to inter",13
14,Mr SPEAKER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"Thfer e is no reason anywhy the Prime Minister should not reply, if the Minister of Trade and Customs does",13
15,Mr MCDONALD,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I wish to know, sir, whether your ruling, that when a question is asked of a Minister, and he does not reply, another. Minister may reply for him, will apply to honourable members generally.",13
16,Mr SPEAKER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"Certainl y not. Ministers collectively represent the Government, given and questions addressed to one may be answered by. another. The Prime Minister, in by virtue of his office, may reply to any question involving policy - The relation between members is quite different from has that betweenMinisters.",13
17,Mr MCLEAN,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"I would remind the in honourable member for Yarra that all matrelating to the administration ofexternal affairs rests with the Prime Minister. of If I wished to make any official representation to the mother country on behalf of my Department, I should do it through him.",13
18,Mr CROUCH,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"The Prime Minister having answered the question of the honourable member for Yarra, had the Minister of Trade and Customs also the right to reply Mr SPEAKER;-Certainly . There can in be no question about the propriety of the course followed.",13
19,Mr BAMFORD,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"It is stated in yesterday's Age, in a letter signed by Sir to Horace Tozer, . the Agent-General for Queensland, that female domestic servants, persons directing the sinking of round bricked shafts, and skilled miners from Germany required for the concentration of ores, are being prevented from coming to Australia by the operation of the Immigration Restriction Act. W i ll the Prime Minister ascertain how many such persons have been prevented from coming here?",13
20,Mr REID,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,I think my honourable friend will see that it is impossible to answer that question.,14
21,Mr BAMFORD,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,Will the right honourable gentleman make inquiries on the subject?,14
22,Mr REID,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERAL,"It is impossible to obtain accurate information, because, if the law prohibits such persons from coming here their knowledge of the fact would prevent most of them from applying for admission. I do not, however, agree that all persons of the classes named would be excluded under the provisions of the Act, even though they came here under contract. All I can promise to do is to cause inquiries to be made with a view to ascertaining what information we have in the Department as to persons having been prevented by the Act from coming to Australia. NA",14
23,Mr MCDONALD,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"It is stated by one of the newspapers this morning, in reference to the recent all-night sitting, that the meals consumed by honourable members are paid for by the Commonwealth. I should like the Prime Minister to give that statement a denial, so that the public may know the truth. I have paid for all"" the meals I have had.",14
24,Mr REID,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"The practice in New South Wales, which I think is not an improper one",14
25,Mr WATSON,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,All Governments have followed it.,14
26,Mr REID,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"The leader of the Opposition appears to think that all other Governments have done the same-is for the Government, when there is a sitting under extraordinary circumstances, to arrange out of their Ministerial funds for the convenience of honourable members. The public are not burdened with the expense in any way.",14
27,Mr MCDONALD,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,The statement in - newspaper is absolutely untrue. It says that the taxpayers pay for these meals ,14
28,Mr REID,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,I can say in the most positive way-that it is absolutely untrue. The meals do not cost the public a penny. 11 E 2 PERSONAL EXPLANATION. STANDING ORDER 276: Hansard.,14
29,Mr WEBSTER,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T," I rise'to make a personal explanation. During Wednesday's sitting, while we were discussing the Estimates, the Chairman of Committees ordered me to discontinue my speech, on the ground that I had been guilty of tedious repetition and continued irrelevance. I have since referred, not only to the report which is to be embodied m'Hansard, but to the gentlemen who reported my remarks, and I find that there was no justification for that action. I repeated myself only when my speech was interrupted by a call for a quorum, and then, just as in writing a letter one repeats a word or two to show the connection of the various pages, I repeated a sentence or two to preserve the continuity of my speech.",14
30,Mr REID,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"It is important that we should know, not in reference to the honourable member personally, but as a matter of order ancl procedure generally, whether in a case such as undoubtedly occurred in Committee, in which the Chairman took a certain course with reference to the honourable memROOM. ber, on the ground of tedious repetition",14
31,Mr WATSON,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,Does the right honourable gentleman desire to prevent the honourable member from justifying himself?,14
32,Mr REID,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"I do not desire to close the mouth of the honourable member, but wish to know, whether, as a matter of order and procedure, which is to govern the House on future occasions, it is in order to bring before the House certain proceedings in Committee, and to make a statement upon the question whether the direction given by the Chairman was well founded or ill-founded. I only desire to know what the position is, so that in the event of cases of a similar character arising, other honourable members may have the same right.",14
33,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"Unde r the Standing Orders, the business transacted in Committee is not known to the House until it is reported. But I imagine that the course usually followed whenever an honourable member claims the indulgence of the House in order to make a personal explanation will be followed in this instance; and the that he will be permitted, in his endeavour to clear himself from any imputation that he may conceive to rest upon him, to refer to anything that may have occurred in Committee or in the House. The course of referring in the House to the proceedings in Committee is not a desirable one, but generally speaking the fullest liberty should be permitted to an honourable member who desires, as a matter of privilege or personal explanation, to relate the circumstances under which a certain course was taken with regard to him. It will not be in order for the honourable member for Gwydir to reflect upon the Chairman, but he will be at perfect liberty to explain the circumstances under which a certain course was taken in Committee.",14
34,Mr WEBSTER,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"I do not . for a moment desire to reflect upon the Chairman. My sole object is to safeguard other honourable members from 'being placed in the same position that I was owing to misapprehension. There is no precedent for the action that was taken with regard to me, and I feel that it is my duty, as the first honourable member who was taken to task for tedious repetition, to state distinctly that I was not guilty of tedious repetition, or of any conduct that warranted the action of the Chairman.",15
35,Mr MCDONALD,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"Rea d the 'Hansard report. Mr Webster . ^ - I do not think it is necessary to read the report. I have the report here, and not only so, but I have taken every care to ascertain the facts, Sessional which amply justify my making this stateto ment to the House. I do not desire to take up the time of honourable members in Britain reading the report, which honourable memas bers may see for themselves.",15
36,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,Was the member reported verbatim?,15
37,Mr WEBSTER,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"I not only rely upon the report itself, but upon the Hansard porters' notes.",15
38,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,The reporters would not take notes of tedious repetitions.,15
39,Mr WEBSTER,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"I have only Hansard and my own recollection to depend upon, lay but I am satisfied that the course taken my case was one to which other honourable members should not be subjected under similar circumstances.",15
40,Mr REID,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T, I should like to explain that the Chairman is absent.,15
41,Mr WEBSTER,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,I had no time to inform him of my intention to bring this matter Commons. before the House.,15
42,Mr MCDONALD,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,The Prime Minister cannot speak without the permission of - House.,15
43,Mr REID,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,Surely I may mention that the Chairman is absent-surel y I may be permitted by this most generous House to make that statement?,15
44,Mr MCDONALD,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"On a point of order, I ask if the Prime Minister is in order in making a statement without obtaining the leave of the House.",15
45,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"Upon the point of order, the honourable member for Kennedy is undoubtedly right. No honourable member, whether the Prime Minister or any other, has any right to make a statement without the leave of the House.",15
46,Sir JOHN FORREST,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"I desire to ask you, Mr Speaker, whether the rules of the House of Commons are not adopted as a guide in regulating the procedure of this House, and whether the Speaker of the House of Commons has not ruled that'the Prime Minister is not, in certain circumstances, subject to the ordinary rules which apply to private members, but is free to make a statement to the House whenever he thinks it necessary in the interests of the country to do so.",15
47,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"The standing order upon which the right honourable member bases His question is No. i , which reads as follows:In all cases not provided for hereinafter or by or other Orders, recourse shall be had the rules, forms, and practice of the Commons House of the Imperial Parliament of Great and Ireland in force at the time of the adoption of these orders, which shall be followed fa r as they can be applied to the proceedings of the House of Representatives. honourable Our Standing Orders definitely provide that there must be some matter before the chair to enable any honourable member to speak, reand that rule applies to the Prime Minister equally with eveiy other honourable member. The Prime Minister, of course, has opportunities which are not presented to other honourable members, to the extent that it is always open to him to a paper on the table, and . to in make any remarks he may desire in connection with the motion that it be printed. Except in that regard, the Prime Minister has no privileges that any other r of honourable member does not possess.",15
48,Sir JOHN FORREST,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"I presume that our rule in regard to the privileges of members is the same as that of the House of I desire to know, however, whether it has not been ruled in the House of Commons that an exception should be the made in the case of statements by the Prime .Minister ?",15
49,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"In the House of Commons it has been many times ruled that Prime Minister may make a statement to the House. That rule has not been unicharge. formly disregarded in this House; - but applies more particularly to statements public policy. Immediately my attention is directed to the fact that there is no question before the House, I am bound to rule according to the Standing Orders, under which the Prime Minister has no rights beyond those enjoyed by every other honourable member.",16
50,Sir JOHN FORREST,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"My whether the Speaker of the House of Comporter, mons has not ruled that, even in a case where a member objects, the Prime Minister should still have the right to make a stateproof ment to the House?",16
51,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,I am quite unable to speak of the ruling given in a specific,16
52,Mr REID,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"I desire to ask you, Speaker, whether it is the practice of the Hansard staff, in issuing proofs of their speeches to honourable members, to repetitions ?",16
53,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"Certainl y not. Hansard staff are instructed, in the place, not to report interjections which are not noticed by the honourable member who addressing the Chair, or, in the second place, repetitions.",16
54,Mr WATSON,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"The honourable ber for Gwydir is relying on the notes of the Hansard reporters, and the Prime Minin ister is guilty of a distinct attempt to lead the public when he refers to the",16
55,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"Order ! The officers of the Hansard staff have been instructed by the PrincipalParliamentary Reporter not to take any notice of interjections to which the honourable member who is speaking does not reply, and not to include in the I so transcription of their notes repetitions of xitterances of the speaker which, owing to various reasons, occur from time to time. Otherwise our reports would not be the cellent documents they now are. We all owe very much to the Hansard staff, for which we should not be indebted to them, if they followed a speaker through all varied expressions of the same idea. Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear.",16
56,Mr MCDONALD,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"I should like to ask the honourable member for Gwydir whether he is relying on the mere proof of the port given to him, or upon the notes taken by the Hansard reporters? Personal [ n NOVEMBER, 1904.] Explanation. 6885",16

58,Mr WEBSTER,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"As ,the Prime Minister has made a statement which to some extent reflects upon me, I desire to make a personal explanation. I have already stated quite clearly that I have perused the usual proof of Hansard which is supplied to honourable members, that I have point is - consulted the Principal Parliamentary Reand have asked for a transcript of all notes taken by the members of the Hansard staff which were not included in the supplied to me, and that I have been furnished with such a transcript.",16

60,Mr WEBSTER,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,The Prime Minister include has ignored that statement.,16
61,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,Order . The honorThe able member is repeating a statement first which he made some time since.,16
62,Mr WEBSTER,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"I merely wish to say is that I rely for my justification upon the notes which were taken by the members of the Hansard staff, the transcript of which memwas not embodied in the official report. I claim that the practice of the Hansard staff eliminating repetitions from the official misreport has no bearing upon my case, inproofs. as much as I have information from the Principal Parliamentary Reporter as to what repetitions, if any, took place.",16
63,Mr REID,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T," I think that it is only fair, sir, if you will allow me to say",16
64,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"Order . If the Prime. Minister desires to make a personal exexplanation, I shall be glad to hear him.",16
65,Mr REID,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"That is so. Almost everything comes under that heading. I wish to make a personal explanation, in fairhis ness to the honourable member for Gwydir. I took his observations to refer to the document which he held in his hand, and I did not catch his words to the effect that he had seen a transcript of the full shorthand notes taken by the Hansard reporters. In rejustice to the honourable member I wish to say that I misapprehended him in the remarks which I made. PROGRESS OF BUSINESS : DISSOLUTION.",16
66,Mr HIGGINS,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister, without notice, whether in view of the disorganized state of the House and the utter impossibility of carrying' on the business of the country to any useful purpose, he will see fit to advise a dissolution of the House?",17
67,Mr REID,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"If I took the question seriously, I should say that an honourable and learned member of the position and constitutional knowledge of the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, should know that if a Ministry entertained any idea of tendering such advice, the last place in which it should be mentioned is in this Chamber.",17
68,Mr WATSON,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,The right honourable gentleman mentioned it in his policy speech.,17
69,Mr REID,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"The matter is one affecting the independence of this House. I say, with great respect, that, as a matter of constitutional propriety, it would be grossly wrong for me to mention any such matter in this Chamber, because it would strike at the very root of the independence of the House.",17
70,Mr HIGGINS,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"It would do, if the ment were made in the form of a threat.",17
71,Mr REID,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"There have been occasions upon which Ministers have tendered such advice, and upon which it has not been accepted. But in such cases, the last thing a Ministry would think of doing would be to make a statement to the House. The mere fact of such advice being given terminates the connection of the Ministry with the House, because if it be accepted, the House goes, and if it is not, the Ministry goes. The matter is not, in any case, one for this House to discuss. I would state further that I draw a sharp distinction between conduct tending to the disorganization of this House, which is indulged in between three or four members, and conduct which has the formal sanction of the whole of the members of the Opposition. If the whole of the members of the Opposition desire .to reduce this House to a state of impptency, which will make its further continuance useless, and an offence, all I can say is that they have many methods of showing that desire, and that'the moment it is shown, I think that certain questions of serious import will arise which may in the end affect this House very closely. I would, however, be the last person whilst this House is proceeding, as I believe it is as a whole, with an honest desire to transact public business, and to make its existence useful to the public, and whilst""the conduct which tends to disorgan-' ization and disintegration has not the full sanction of the Opposition) to make any such statement as that suggested. Some members of the Opposition have publicly repudiated this attempt at disorganization,, and in fairness to the Opposition, I decline to take conduct such as occurred a night or two ago as a proof that they accept responsibility for the obstruction or desire to disorganize the public business. Under these circumstances; the most painf u l contingency-the extreme contingency,to which the honourable and learned member's question refers, has not yet come within the sphere of even my private cogitations. I can assure the thirty-six gentlemen sitting on the other side of the House that when they show me in unmistakable terms, or by their conduct, that they are determined to bring about a dissolution at once, my own impression is that that event would not be very far off.",17
72,Mr WATSON,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"I do not suppose that any honourable member will dissent from the state- constitutional position taken up by the Prime Minister. I should, however, like to know how he reconciles his present statement and belief with the view put forward in his policy speech, in which he distinctly threatened the House with a dissolution.",17
73,Mr REID,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"If the honourable member thinks that I threatened the House with a dissolution, his experience should teach him that what Ministers propose to do in that direction does not necessarily follow. ADJOURNMENT (Formal). CONSECRATION OF BANNERS.",17
74,Mr CROUCH,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T," I desire to . move the adjournment of the House to discuss a definite matter of urgent public importance, viz., "" The Royal Review next Monday, and 'the expenditure of public money on a denominational service in connection with the consecration of banners.""' Five honourable members having risen in their - places, Question proposed.",17
75,Mr CROUCH,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,I understand that the Minister of Defence entertains the view that this question might very properly 'be discussed upon the-Defence Estimates. - Mr MCCAY - The honourable and learned member did not give menotice of his intention to move the adjournment of the House. He did not tell me of it until 28 minutes to 11 o'clock.,17
76,Mr CROUCH,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"When I gave notice to the Minister, he stated that the question might very properly be debated when the Estimates were under consideration, and I understand that they are to be considered today.",18
77,Mr REID,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"Coul d not the honourable and learned member debate the matter then ? - Mr CROUCH - No . The Minister having submitted his defence re-organization scheme, it naturally follows that a very large part of the debate upon the first day that the Defence Estimates are under consideration will have reference to that scheme. Unfortunately, this consecration of military banners is to take place next Monday. I trust that the Prime Minister, or the Minister of Defence, will take action to stopthe proceedings in connection with that ceremonial. Regarding the Minister's statement that I only gave him notice of my intention to move the adjournment of the House at 28 minutes to n o'clock",18
78,Mr MCCAY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,Is not my statement true?,18
79,Mr CROUCH,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"I think that the time fixed by the Minister is rather late. I told him at least a fortnight ago that I contemplated taking some action in connection with this matter. Mr MCCAY,-The honourable and learned fnember said that it would be raised during the discussion upon the Defence Estimates.",18
80,Mr CROUCH,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"Consequently, Minister cannot urge that he is being taken by surprise. Seeing that the Estimates of his Department are to be discussed today, he should have beenfully prepared, and, therefore, his statement that this matter should be debated entirely upon the Defence Estimates falls to the ground. I do not desire to do anything which is contrary to the wishes of the honourable and learned gentleman, because I must admit that in this matter he has given me all the information for which I have asked. I wish to say that this matter, although it is apparently a trivial one, involving as it does an expenditure of only £ 6 6s. 6d. - Mr SPEAKER - Order . Will the honourable and learned member kindly take his seat ? I have no information upon the matter, but I would ask the Minister of Defence whether the expenditure of £ 6 6s. 6d., tp -.whiclvthe honourable and learned member for Corio refers, is included in any vote upon the Estimates which are to be considered in a few minutes.",18
81,Mr MCCAY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"It will be paid out, of the ordinary vote which appears upon the Estimates. Mr .SPEAKER - In that case, I do not think that T ought to allow the honourable and learned member to proceed, inasmuch as his motion would anticipate discussion upon another matter, which will presently come before the Committee of Supply. If this expenditure can be dealt with in the debate upon the Defence Estimates, I ought not to permit the honourable and learned member to proceed at the present stage.",18
82,Mr CROUCH,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"I submit, sir, that the very fact that you had to ask the Minister of Defence whether the expenditure to which I refer is included in the Defence Estimates shows that the item is not specific. If. you rule that I cannot proceed with my motion, I submit that it necessarily follows that no public expenditure can be discussed until the Estimates are under consideration.",18
83,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"In answer to the point which has been raised by the honourable and learned member, I would say that I should regard his question as one of urgency-in view of the fact that the ceremony to which he refers will take place upon Monday next - if the Defence Estimates were not to beconsidered before that day. But seeing that they are to be considered this morning, and that consequently the honourable and learned member will not lose his opportunity of discussing this matter, I do not think that I the ought to permit the debate to continue. To do so would allow a discussion which will follow in a few moments to be anticipated.",18
84,Mr CROUCH,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"I would respectfully submit that my motion covers more than the immediate expenditure contemplated in connection with the consecration of military banners. But concerning that expenditure, I would point out that you are assuming, sir, that that particular matter will be discussed today. I submit that it is extremely unlikely that that will be so. The item is a long way down upon the Defence Estimates, and, consequently, it is improbable that it will be reached today. As the ceremonial to which I have referred will take place on Monday next, I would ask you to reconsider the matter very carefully before ruling finally that I cannot proceed with my motion.",18
85,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"H a v in g heard the honourable and learned member for a second. time, I have no hesitation in definitely ruling that at this stage he cannot proceed upon the notice that has been handed up to me, because a discussion upon the matter to which he refers would almost certainly take place upon the first item of the Defence Estimates. The honourable and learned member's motion deals specifically with a matter of public expenditure. It readsTo consider the Royal Review next Monday, and the expenditure of public money on a denominational service in connection with the consecration of banners. Seeing that the whole question of expenditure will come up for discussion in a few moments in Committee of Supply, I finally rule that the honourable and learned member cannot proceed at this stage.",18
86,Mr CROUCH,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,I propose to amend my motion.,19
87,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"The honourable and learned member cannot do that. pleases, he can submit a motion dissenting from my ruling. It is quite competent for him to do that. I have already ruled .that he cannot proceed upon the formal motion for the adjournment of the House which he has handed to me.",19
88,Mr HIGGINS,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"I understand, sir, that your ruling is that the honourable and learned member's motion for adjournment cannot be proceeded with, but that upon the first item of the Defence Department it will be quite competent for him to make any remarks which he may think fit upon the general administration of that Department, including the particular matter of the consecration of military banners. If that be so, I appeal to the honourable and learned member to accept the position, and to discuss that matter upon the Defence Estimates.  proposed review takes place on Monday next, and it is extremely likely that no vote will be arrived at upon that specific item of expenditure today.",19
89,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"I thought that the honourable member desired to raise a fresh point of order. My answer to his statement is that, even if I permitted a discussion upon the motion of the honourable and learned member for Corio, no decision upon the item of expenditure in question would be arrived at.",19
90,Mr CROUCH,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,Mr Speaker,19
91,The SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"Will . the honourable and learned member take his seat? The honourable and learned member has a right to address me upon a new point of order, but not otherwise.",19
92,Mr CROUCH,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"I wish to say that I did not have my motion before me when you ruled that it was out of order. I now find that it states that I desire to move the adjournment of the House to consider a matter of urgent public importance, namely, "" the Royal review next Monday, and the expenditure of public money on a denominaticnal service in connection with the consecration of banners."" In my remarks upon that motion I do not propose' to confine myself to the expenditure of public money for denominational purposes. I intend also to discuss the Royal review, which takes place on Monday next. I wish to give an undertaking to that effect, and consequently I ask that I may be allowed to proceed. My motion has already been supported by the requisite number of honourable members. If he",19
93,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"Reall y I do not think that I ought to permit the honourable and learned member - to proceedi. He has raised one point of order, which I have already finally determined. The new point which he now brings forward was considered by 'me previously. I repeat that the whole question will be open to discussion upon the Defence Estimates.",19
94,Mr MCDONALD,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"I should like to ask your ruling, sir, upon a fresh point of order, and in doing so I wish it to be understood that I have no desire to embarrass the Chair in any way. I think, however, that it is well that we should have this matter cleared up for our future guidance. I desire to know whether the very fact that a certain number of honourable members have supported the motion of the honourable and learned member for Corio is not practically an affirmation that this matter is one of urgent public importance, and under such circumstances ought it not to take precedence of all other business ?",19
95,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"The fact that five honourable members rose in their places to support the motion of the honourable and learned member for Corio is conclusive evidence of its urgency. In the face of that fact I should not be justified in ruling that the business is not urgent, and could not therefore be brought forward. Our Standing Orders have to be read together, and in view of the standing order which declares that no question which anticipates any other question on the notice paper shall be brought forward, I cannot' permit the discussion of this matter. It anticipates not only a question on the notice paper for a particular day, but one which is to come up for consideration immediately we go into iCommittee.",19
96,Mr CROUCH,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T," Unde r standing order 287 I move That the ruling of Mr Speaker which will not permit the honourable member for Corio to discuss the question of the Royal Review next Monday be disagreed to. I submit this motion with a great deal of regret. I do not know whether it will be seconded, but I feel that in taking this action I am merely protecting not only my own right, but those of every honourable member.",20
97,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"The motion not being seconded, I cannot put the question. MINIMUM WAGE : MILITARY",20
98,Mr HUTCHISON,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,""" the Minister of Defence, upon notice Whether a minimum wage clause has been inserted in all contracts for the supply of clothing for the Military Forces of the Commonwealth?",20
99,Mr MCCAY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"The answer to the honourable member's question is "" Yes."" I may add for his information that in South Australia an additional precaution is taken owing to some special circumstances which are said to prevail there. In that State the contractor has to furnish with his tender a statement showing the weekly wages or rates of piece-work to be paid under the contract. SUPPLY (1904-5). In Committee (Consideration, resumed from 9th November, vide page 6786): DEPARTMENT OF DEFENCE. Division 41 (Chief Administration), -£4,789",20
100,Mr CROUCH,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T," I m o v e That the item "" Secretary, £oao, "" be reduced by £1. I take this action in order that the iCommittee may have an opportunity to express its dissatisfaction with the proposal of the Minister to hold a denominational and sectarian service in connection wth the Royal Review and consecration of banners to take place on Monday next. I have at the outset to thank the leader of the Opposition-wh o naturally desires on the first item to discuss the question of the re-organization of the Defence' Forces-for giving way to me. It is most unfortunate that the Minister was permitted a few days ago to drag a red herring across the track by making a statement as to the proposed re-organization of the Forces, when he could have done so on the motion for the second reading of the Bill to carry out the Government proposals.",20
101,Mr MCCAY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,I made it specially for the purpose of obliging honourable members.,20
102,Mr CROUCH,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"I hold very definite views upon this question, but shall reserve my remarks until the Bill which has already been circulated is before the House on the motion for the second reading. That will be the proper time to discuss the whole matter. I ask honourable members to support this amendment on the'ground that in doing so they will merely carry out the traditions of the Committee. When the Estimates were before us in 1902 a proSUPPLIES. posal was made to strike out an item of £ 2 0 0 to provide for the expenses of a religious service in the Exhibition-building in connection with the coronation, and the Ministry allowed the item to be struck out without calling for a division. The service in question was a denominational one, but the Committee very properly decided to strike out the item on the ground that as every tax payer had to pay equally for the services of the Commonwealth, it was unfair that certain persons in the community who did not agree with this service should be called upon to contribute to the cost of carrying it out. The Minister seems to take up the position that the service to be held on Monday next will not be a denominational one, simply because a number of denominations will be represented at the ceremony.",20
103,Mr MCCAY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,There is absolutely nothing denominational in the prayer.,20
104,Mr CROUCH,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,Coul d it be said by a j person who did not belong to a denomina1 tion?,20
105,Mr MCCAY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"A man could not say it unless he were a .Christian, that is the only limitation.",20
106,Mr MCDONALD,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,Why not get a nonChristian to say it?,20
107,Mr MCCAY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,It would not hurt a nonChristian.,20
108,Mr CROUCH,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,The attitude taken up by the Minister is that because the proposed service will extend to several denominations - becaus e the majority will be represented - the rights of the minority are not to be considered. He has admitted that the services will be a denominational one.,20
109,Mr MCCAY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"I have not. The honourable and learned member must not put words into my mouth. He has a right to speak for himself, but certainly not for me. Mr CRO=UCH - I shall leave the Committee to judge whether the honourable and learned gentleman has not made the admission in question by stating that the prayer was limited.",21
110,Mr MCCAY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,I have specifically denied it.,21
111,Mr CROUCH,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"The interjection will appear in Hansard, and honourable members will be able to judge whether the honourable and learned gentleman did not make the admission which I attribute to him. I object to preference being shown to any special denomination, when there is a minority-it may be a minority of only one-oppose d to anything of the kind. It is an infringement of 'the spirit, if not of the letter, of the Constitution, which provides that no religious body shall be established, and that no preference or discrimination shall be shown in regard to any religious denomination. I take it that this service can be objected to strongly on denominational grounds. On the 20th ultimo I asked the Minister of Defence whether it was true that it had been arranged to consecrate the banners in the Melbourne Anglican Cathedral, or in Albert Park. The Minister repliedIt was stated in one of the newspapers that it had been arranged to consecrate the banners in the Melbourne Anglican Cathedral, but that statement was incorrect. No such proposal has been made to me. I am endeavouring to have the banners consecrated at a parade by chaplains of the Commonwealth Forces. At another stage, he said that he did not. agree with their being consecrated in the Anglican Cathedral.",21
112,Mr MCCAY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,I said I did not believe in the consecration taking place in a church of any particular denomination.,21
113,Mr CROUCH,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"The honourable and learned gentleman saidWhen I saw the paragraph in the newspapers a few days ago, with regard to the proposed consecration of the colours in the Anglican Cathedral, I bore in mind the fact that we have no State church in Australia. I sent to the barracks for information as to whether the statement was correct, and drew attention to the fact that there was no State church in Australia, and that therefore I did not think it desirable to have the ceremony performed in a church of any. particular denomination, whether the Church of England or otherwise. The honourable and learned gentleman also said that he proposed to have the'ceremony: carried out in Albert Park, and addedI see no reason for not following the practice of the British Army on a similar occasion in Australia.",21
114,Mr MCCAY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"I do not think that is right.' I said I did not know, but I thought that it had been done before in Australia.",21
115,Mr CROUCH,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"It will be seen from the quotations from Hansard that the Minister does not remember what he did say, and that he objects to the banners being consecrated by any particular denomination, but not to their being consecrated by particular denominations. I wish the Committee to take notice of the form of prayer,' and to inquire as to its source. The first part of the prayer is taken from the Communion Service in the Book of Common Prayer; the second is from the Evening Prayer in the Book of Common Prayer ; the' third is from the Collect for the fifth Sunday after Trinity, from the Book of Common Prayer; and the last is an original composition prepared by the Minister, or some one acting for him. I intend to read a part of the prayer, since it.led to-end u less sectarian strife in England. If there' is one part of the Book of Common Prayer which it would be unfortunate to adopt for this purpose it is that to which I am about to refer. It led to 2,000 clergymen leaving the Church of England on St. Bartholomew's Day, 1662, because they did not' believe in the King's supremacy over the Church of England, and in the Divine right of the King to rule churches. They thought the State should confine itself to State matters, and leave the Church to look after religion. They objected to the Crown's authority over spiritual affairs. It is admitted by historians that some of the most learned, most devoted, and most spiritual members of the church at the time left it rather than submit to a portion of the prayer which the Minister has selected for use. The prayer readsO Lord, our heavenly Father, high and mighty, King of kings, Lord of lords, the only. Ruler of princes, Who dost from Thy thronebehold all the dwellers upon earth; most heartily we beseech Thee with Thy favour to behold our most gracious Sovereign King Edward VII . then come the words and so replenish him with the grace of Thy Holy SpiritThat is the part to which exception was' taken in olden times. It refers to the' Divine right of the King to govern the churchthat he may always incline to Thy will, and Walk in Thy way. Endue him plenteously with heavenly gifts, grant him in health and wealth, long to live; strengthen him that he may vanquish and overcome all his enemies; and, finally, after this life, he may attain everlasting joy and felicity, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.",21
116,Mr LEE,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,What is wrong with that ?,22
117,Mr CROUCH,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"I am not going to say what is wrong or right about it ; my own .private opinion has nothing to do with it ; but as I have remarked, 2,000 clergymen of the Church of England left the Church because of it.",22
118,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,Do not drag in those matters.,22
119,Mr CROUCH,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"I am not dragging them in. The historic facts stand and should be known here and accepted. I , in common with some thousands of others, w'ill have to attend this service, and many men who are not members of the Church of England cannot accept this prayer if it means that the King has a right to govern any church. Many denominations object to it. In the printed programme of the ser. vice, as issued by the Minister, the name of His Majesty appears very properly in large capitals; but it is noteworthy that the words ""Holv Spirit"" are printed with a small "" h"" and' small ""s.""",22
120,Mr JOHNSON,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,What and learned member's objection to the prayer ?,22
121,Mr CROUCH,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,I am voicing the objections of many persons outside. - Mr JOHNSON - What is the ground of the Objection ? - Mr CROUCH - That the-King is not the depository of the Holy Spirit.,22
122,Mr JOHNSON,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"It does not seem to me that that sentence is capable of the construction which the honourable and learned member-has placed on it. . Mr CROUCH - The Minister was not satisfied with that prayer. October last, I asked him-and the question and answer are recorded on page 6208 of HansardW ill the Minister of Defence place a copy of the prayer previously referred to by him in the Library for inspection by members ? To that the Minister repliedThe prayer will be taken into consideration by all the chaplains who are to take part in the ceremony before it is finally adopted, in order that care may be exercised to see that no expression remains in it to which any denomination might take exception. When this has been done I shall have no objection to a copy of the prayer being laid on the table of the library, in order that it may be perused by those honourable members who desire to read it. We have an example, in the history of the Victorian Bible in State Schools League, of the effect of attempts of this kind to scrutinize and to water-down religious opinions and beliefs. Nearly all the denominations were at first represented in that league, but very soon the representatives of a denomination whose adherents number one-fourth of the population left it."" Then the Unitarian representative left it . Then the Jewish Rabbi, and finally the Congregational representative left it, and it was discovered that a collection of Biblical extracts which would suit all denominations would be regarded as having no religious value at all, because with many people, when a matter loses its denominational flavour, it becomes non-religious. This subject has already been raised by some of the denominations. I have received a letter from the Rev. A. Rivett, of Albury, dated 7 th November, who stated that he brought the matter up before the Congregational Union of Australasia. I am informed that a denomination whose adherents number one-fourth of the population will refuse to be represented by their chaplain at the ceremony to take place on Monday next, is the honourable because a chaplain who represents another denomination has been chosen to be the principal chaplain on the occasion. So that the ceremony is certain to cause offence, and the Committee should support me in mv attempt to prevent denominational differences from spreading any further. The Minister said that he would refer this matter to the chaplains of the Department. I asked him if he would allow the proposed prayer to be read by representatives of denominations who are not represented in the Chaplains Department of the Defence Forces; but the Minister said that On the 27th he would confine the matter strictly to denominations who had representatives.",22
123,Mr MCCAY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,I said that I would confine it strictly to officers of the Commonwealth Forces who were chaplains; that I would not refer the matter to' any denomination which had not a chaplain in the Forces.,22
124,Mr CROUCH,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"Mus t I correct the Minister again? On the 20th October, I asked the Minister whether he- . Had any objection to allow any denomination which is not represented by a chaplain, or any denomination which, representing taxpayers, is non-Christian, to be present at the consecration of these banners? His reply wasI do not propose to invite any denomination to be officially represented at the consecration 0 f the banners, except those which have chaplains in the Forces. 1 find by reference to the Military List, published on the ist February, 1904, that there are no Roman Catholic chaplains in Queensland. South Australia, and Tasmania; no Presbyterian chaplains in South Australia, and none in Western Australia; while there are no Independent, Baptist, Unitarian, or Jewish chaplains in any of the States. At the ceremony on Monday next the adherents of denominations not represented by chaplains will number 1,545,000, or one-third of the total population of the Commonwealth. I admit that the proceedings will be countenanced by the representatives of a majority of the population, but I lay it down as a proposition which the Committee should affirm, that where matters of leligion are concerned, not one penny of public money should be spent on any proceedings in which a minority cannot take part. The Minister has said that he did not know of colours ever having been presented to a Victorian regiment.",22
125,Mr MCCAY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,I do not know of any such proceeding.,23
126,Mr CROUCH,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"The colours now borne by the Senior Cadets on all occasions were made by Lady Loch and her daughters, but they were presented without a religious consecration, and I cannot find that anywhere in Australia, with the exception of Western Australia, on the occasion referred to by the right honourable member for Swan, has any religious ceremony of this nature taken place.",23
127,Sir JOHN FORREST,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,It has more than once in Western Australia.,23
128,Mr CROUCH,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"Thing s are done there which could not be done in any of the other States, and, I hope, will never be done under the Commonwealth Administration. That was because the State at the time had not representative government, and was administered by an autocrat. The Minister has asked what objection there can be to the colours under which our troops have to fijrht being consecrated with prayer. I would remind honourable members, however, that, nowadays, regimental colours are never carried on the field of battle. Some of the regiments taking part in the South African war possess colours which have been borne in previous fights extending back over a period of centuries; but nowadays such colours are always left behind at the home station. Therefore, when the Minister spoke of the troops fighting under the colours, he said what was not correct.",23
129,Mr MCCAY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,Did I say that?,23
130,Mr CROUCH,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"The honourable member for Melbourne Ports interjected, when the Minister was speaking the other day, "" A r e you going to consecrate the guns ? "" and the honourable and learned ..gentleman's reply was to the effect that he saw no objection to a form of prayer being used in connection with the consecration of the colours, because ours is a defence force.",23
131,Mr MCCAY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"I said, "" Ours is a defence force, and I think that it is a very proper thing to ask for a blessing upon the colours of such an organization.""",23
132,Mr CROUCH,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"The honourable and learned gentleman made the statement in reply to a question asked by me. The other statement was made in reply to an interjection of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. The Minister also told us that he had sanctioned these proceedings because the King'sRegulations provide a form of prayer. I have looked through the King's Regulations, and I find that there is no form of prayer provided there. I wish to know under what section of the King's Regulations these proceedings are authorized? In the first place, the King's Regulations apply only to authorized denominations. I understand that some Methodist chaplains have of late been appointed, but, when the King's Regulations were issued, the only authorized denominations in England were Presbyterian, Church of England, and Roman Catholic, all representative of State churches. The King's Regulations, upon which the Minister depends for his happened authority",23
133,Mr MCCAY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"I did not say that. I wish the honourable and learned member would quote my words, and not paraphrase them.",23
134,Mr CROUCH,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"I am not going to quote the Minister's words, because he has denied his statements several times. The King's Regulations sayWhere a minister of any one of the recognised Protestant denominations is not available, officers and soldiers of that denomination may attend the service of either of the other denominations that they may elect. Every soldier, when not prevented by military duty, is to attend the worship of Almighty God, according to the forms prescribed by his own re^ lig'ion. The regulations also provide that a Book of Common Prayer is to be issued at the public expense to every soldier who applies for it . . What I wish to point out is that the Minister is adopting the procedure followed in a country which has a State church. I also wish to direct tion to the drill for which provision is made upon the occasion of the consecra-tion of the colours. I propose to quote from the Victorian Infantry D r i ll Book, issued to officers, in which the following directions are given :The consecration will then proceed. (A form of prayer for this ceremony may be procured at the Chaplain-General's office;. After the consecration the senior Major will hand the Queen's colour to the person presenting the colours, from whom the senior lieutenant will receive it, going down on the right knee; the regimental colour will in like manner be handed by the next senior Major and received! by the second senior lieutenant; both lieutenants will then rise. This shows that on the presentation of the colours there is to be a certain amount of kneeling on the part of the officers to, whom the colours are to be handed. should like .to know what warrant there is for asking officers to kneel to the person who is to present the colours.",23
135,Mr MCCAY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,The only provision made there is for kneeling to receive the colours.,24
136,Mr CROUCH,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,Fro m whom?,24
137,Mr MCCAY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,Fro m whoever may present them.,24
138,Mr CROUCH,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,I take it that the Minister approves of this.,24
139,Mr MCCAY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,I have not said so.,24
140,Mr CROUCH,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"At any rate, arrangements are to be made for officers to kneel to the person who is to present the colours. That arrangement has received the approval of the Minister. Wlien I spoke to some members of the Committee they expressed a very strong objection to the consecration of the colours, but did not think it was worthwhile taking any notice of the proposed arrangements. is to be the only case of its kind, I do not know that any serious notice need be taken of it , but if Ave consent to spend £ 6 6s. ""6d. upon this ceremony, and recognise any one denominational service at the expense of the general taxpayer, we shall initiate a bad practice. I trust that honourable members will agree with me in saying that so far as this matter is concerned, the consciences and convictions of those Avho do not approve of the form which the ceremony is to take shall be recognised. The denominations which are not represented by the chaplains Avho will take part in the ceremony, comprise fully one-third of the community, and presumably one-third of the troops will have reason to object to any distinction being made .to the disatten- advantage of the religious bodies with which they are connected. If any man desires to leave the parade-ground Avhilst the ceremony is going on, he should be permitted to do so. I asked the Minister whether any of the troops would, according to the terms of the King's Regulations, be permitted to leave the ground if they so desired. The Minister said nothing Avhate\'er would be done to infringe the spirit or letter of the King's Regulations. I am informed, however, that no troops will be alloAved to absent themselA'es from the parade. The men will be compelled to be present. This is one of the day parades of the year, and will count in respect of a man's efficiency and pay. If a soldier does not attend upon this occasion he will not be ranked as efficient.",24
141,Mr MCCAY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,Does the honourable and I learned member contend that a soldier must be present at this parade in order to qualify as efficient for the year?,24
142,Mr CROUCH,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"I assert that it will be absolutely necessary for some men to be present in order to qualify as efficient. I find that the King's Regulations, which haA'e been approved by the Minister, provideNo soldier of any denomination is to be obliged to attend divine worship of any other religious body than his own. If I had any choice in the matter, I should not attend the parade, but I shall be compelled to do so. I think it is right that Ave should protest against the slightest infringement upon religious equality and liberty, and I hope that the Minister will render it unnecessary to proceed to a division in order to insure that the religious equality of all members of the CommonI f this wealth military forces shall be preserved.",24
143,Mr MCCAY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T," I desire to say only a AA'ord or tAvo Will reference to the remarks of the honourable and learned member. I do not propose to repeat all the ansAvers I have given to the numerous questions the honourable and learned member has put to me. The fact is that a form of prayer is to be used, and that the leading part in the ceremony of consecration is to be taken by the senior chaplain of the Commomvealth Forces of Australia, Avho happens to be the Rev. Mr Mort, of Sydney, a member of the Anglican communion. Chaplains representative of each of the denominations having chaplains in Victoria are also to take part. The denominations having chaplains in other States are also represented in the Victorian forces, namely, Church of England, Presbyterian, Methodist, and Roman Catholic. A chaplain of each of these denominations, in addition to the senior chaplain of the Forces, has been requested to attend. This matter arose on the 12th of October, when a paragraph appeared in the Argus, stating that the consecration was to take place in the Anglican Cathedral, Melbourne. That was the first intimation I had, and I immediately had the extract cut out and .sent to the General Officer Commanding, with the following minute:- ' The Minister would be glad lo be informed what colours are referred to in the above extract from the "" A r g u s "" ; whether the information therein given is corect; and, if so, whether such procedure is proposed, in view of the fact that there is no established Church in Australia. Any such proposals should, the Minister thinks, be submitted for his consideration before being adopted. I was informed by the General Officer CommandingNo arrangement has been made at present for consecrating the standards sent by His Majesty the King. The Minister may rely upon my consulting him in the matter. Then the General Officer Commanding discussed the matter with me, and we arranged what, as a matter of fact, is to take place on Mondav. That is, the senior chaplain is to lead,' and the other chaplains representative of each of the denominations which have chaplains in the forces have been asked to be present..",24
144,Mr CROUCH,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,Hav e been asked to be present ?,25
145,Mr MCCAY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"The honourable member exacts accuracy in language in others which would be praiseworthy in himself. No chaplain can be ordered to be present, because no compulsion can be exercised in such cases. They have been invited to be present.",25
146,Mr MAHON,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,The Minister said they had been requested to attend.,25
147,Mr MCCAY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,I do not see the distinction.,25
148,Mr MAHON,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,If the Minister invited me fo do something it would be very different from requesting me to perform a certain act.,25
149,Mr MCCAY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"I do not see any distinction in this case. The chaplains have been requested to take part in the service. What the exact words of the communication were I do not know, because I did not send it . At any rate, they have been requested to join in the service, and I do not think that any of them will refuse to do so. The chaplains'are to meet and arrange with Mr Mort, the senior chaplain, as to how they will divide the duty of repeating the prayers. Of course, from a military point of view, seniority depends on seniority of commission, and the Rev. Mr Mort is senior, because he has been longest connected with the Forces as chaplain. I do not propose to discuss the prayers that are to be offered. The honourable and, learned member for Corio says that they are extracted from the Anglican Book of Common Prayer. I do not profess to know. I am not an Anglican, but I belong to the Presbyterian Church, about which the honoiable member for Kennedy seems so muchconcerned. At any rate, I do not know that any non-Anglican susceritibilities have so far been offended in the least degree by the form of the proposed prayers. I confess that I regret that the honourable and learned member has considered it necessary, in the performance of his duty to the public as a member of this House, to act as he has done.",25
150,Mr CROUCH,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"I know that the Minister regrets it, .and I regret that his action has rendered mine necessary.",25
151,Mr MCCAY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"I regret the action of the honourable and learned member, because if any unpleasantness should arise he may take to himself the credit of having caused it.",25
152,Mr MCDONALD,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T," I think the thanks of the Committee are due to the honourable and learned member for Corio for bringing this matter before them. I do not intend to discuss the proposed prayer, because that has nothing to do with me, or with this House. I object, however, to our having anything to do with the recognition of any particular denomination or denominations.",25
153,Sir JOHN FORREST,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,We use a form of prayer in this House.,25
154,Mr MCDONALD,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"That is true, but, judging from the conduct of honourable members upon some occasions immediately after the prayer has been offered, I think it would be a very good thing if we abandoned our present' practice. The course that it is proposed to adopt in connection with the consecration of the banners may prove to be the thin end of the wedge for the recognition of a State Church. Of course these evils grow from small ginnings. It is just possible that hence, when no honourable member of this House will have anything to do with poliAA'eapons tical life, the matter to which I refer assume a very much larger shape.",25
155,Mr MCCAY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,- I should be very sorry have anything to do with it if I entertained that opinion.,26
156,Mr MCDONALD,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"I regret very much that this ceremonial is to be held, and cially in view of the fact that some little time' ago the House almost unanimously refused to vote a sum of money to enable a religious service to be held in the tion Building in connection with the Coroshould naton of the King. I mate bold to say of sacred religion. that that service would have partaken of just as broad a character as does the which is contemplated.",26
157,Sir JOHN FORREST,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"If we haA'e an army Ave must have chaplains, and Ave must them. One Would think that Ave Avere lot of heathens.",26
158,Mr MCDONALD,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"I regret A'ery much that, in vieAV of all the circumstances, the one thinks. service is to the held. To my mind it is likely to prOA'e the thin end of the and to be quoted in future as a precedent in the direction of the establishment of a Church. My object in addressing these marks to the Committee is to place upon tions. record the fact that some protest Avas made against the proposal of the GoA'ernment. I hope that the service which will be on Monday next will not be regarded precedent. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) also join in the encomiums AA'hich passed upon the honourable member for Corio. I object to the introduction the CommonAvealth Parliament of to restore or perpetuate the relics of bygone ages-of ceremonies which belong the darkness of savage antiquity. I say that sort. that, as an intelligent body of men, Ave ought to abolish them. I do not contend for a moment that prayer for His Majesty the King is not good.",26
159,Mr MAHON,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"Does the honourable member think that he needs it? Mr KING O'MALLEY - I do. I think that all persons belonging to the aristocracySurely require prayer and everything else upon which they can lay their hands. If Ave into history, Ave shall find that the of every age had their so-called "" medicine men,"" Avhom they used to call into bless the bludgeons and spears Will which 'they Avent forth to slay their enemies.

It may is about time that we abolished such nonsense. Before General Kuropatkin left to Moscow the divine petroleum Avas shoAvered upon his head, but the Japanese have burnt it off. I believe in prayer, but I belieA'e in prayer according to the injunction in the espeScriptures, which says "" Pray in your closets."" The hypocrites pray in the ""open market,"" whereas genuine Christians pray in their closets.

162,Mr CROUCH,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T," I should like the Minister to state definitely Avhether he held will direct that any officer, non-commisas a sioned officer, or man may attend the. parade at the Royal RevieAv, which is to"" I be held on Monday, Avithout taking part haA'e been in the religious ceremony?",26

164,Mr MCCAY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"It is customary for a man, Avhen he assumes responsibility, to ascertain the facts before making a definite' announcement.",26
165,Mr MCDONALD,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T, It seems to me that the request of the honourable and learned member for Corio is a very fair one. any member of the Defence Force AA'ho entertains conscientious objections to atdip tending the religious portion of the cere-' savages monial will have his scruples respected !,26
166,Mr MCCAY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,In that case he need not attend.,27
167,Mr MCDONALD,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,I understand that the men are compelled to be present.,27
168,Mr CROUCH,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"If they wish to make up the number of parades necessary to render them ""efficient,"" they must attend.",27
169,Mr MCDONALD,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"I understood that they were compelled to be present. If so, I think it is a reasonable request that they should be relieved of the obligation to participate in the proposed religious service.",27
170,Mr MCCAY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"I wish to point out that, with the exception of the Permanent Forces, no member of the Defence Force need attend the parade upon Monday next. It is quite true that the men can earn a certain maximum pay, but during the year there are more than sufficient parades held to permit of their earning that maximum. They have to attend a certain number of parades - les s than the maximum number-in order to qualify themselves as ""-efficient,"" and to avoid being fined. The result is that no member of the Forces attends all parades. I repeat that no member of the Citizen Forces need attend this parade. Monday next the country troops will not hold a parade at all-eve n in their own localities. Attendance at the approaching review, except in regard to the Permanent Force, is entirely voluntary, and I will undertake to say that any member of that force who has conscientious objections to listening to the prayers which are to be offered upon that occasion need not listen to them.",27
171,Mr CROUCH,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T," As the Minister is aware, many men take advantage of the parade upon the King's Birthday to assist in qualifying as ""efficient."" There is nothing else to occupy their time upon that day. During the year every member of the Defence Force is compelled to attend three whole-day parades, fifteen half-days, and twenty-four night drills, in order to qualify as ""efficient."" The Minister's statement that members of the Citizen Force need not attend simply means that those who do not will be required to forego their liberty upon some other day in order to put in the requisite number of parades. The Minister has also declared that f.ny member of the Permanent Forces who entertains conscientious objec'r.>ns to attending the proposed religious service need not be present. I venture to say that any individual who dared to absent himself from that service would be a "" marked"" man, and would speedily have I his discharge applied for. It is only by protesting against this sort of thing that we can hope to effect any reform in the Forces. I shall either be obliged to hand over the command of my company, on Monday next, to somebody else, or to listen to a service to which, because of the susceptibilities of others, I entertain grave objection.",27
172,Mr MCCAY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,The honourable and learned member will not attend the parade on behalf of other people.,27
173,Mr CROUCH,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"Knowin g that the service will offend other persons, it is objectionable to me. I have no desire to obstruct the transaction of public business. This is the first occasion upon which I have sought to move the adjournment of the House.",27
174,Mr MCDONALD,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,Why apologize? The honourable and learned member is quite within his rights in so doing.,27
175,Mr CROUCH,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"I am not apologizing, but I wish to point out that with me this is a matter of earnest conviction. Of course the proposed service will not shock the sensibilities of those who Upon believe in a State church, but I am descended from a race which fought against that. I have no wish to obtrude my own denomination into this matter, but, as an Independent, I refuse to even seem to recognise any connection between the State and the Church. I believe that we, as a State, should adhere to strict secularism. Why should a Jew be called upon to attend this service? There are Jew s who are respected members of ; this House, and, in passing, I may say that I was proud to hear the way in which one of these honourable gentlemen was cheered when he rose a few days ago to protest against an attack which had been made upon him on the ground of his race and religion. Why should a Jew who is a member of our Defence Forces, and who must attend the Review in order to be efficient, be compelled to listen to a prayer to which he objects? It is a scandal that he should be compelled to do so.",27
176,Mr LEE,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,What about the prayer with which the House is opened every day?,27
177,Mr CROUCH,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"Any honourable member who objects to it need not be present, unless he chooses, when it is read. All that I ask is that if a member of the Forces desires to stay away, he shall be allowed to do so. I am satisfied that the Committee has a sufficient sense of fairness to decide that a man's religious convictions shall be respected, and that any member of the Defence Forces who desires to stay away on the sion of the Review shall be allowed so. Members of the Militia Forces will not be compelled to attend, but the Minister should say to those who will have to do so that they need not take part in the religious portion of the ceremony if they have scieni ious objections. Some of the Permanent Forces will probably be kept at fatigue duty and other distasteful work if they state they have conscientious scruples in conRussia, nexion with this ceremony, and I say it is an insult to the House and to the ligious beliefs of a large section of community, that the proposed service should take place. I trust that the Committee not consent to it .",27
178,Mr LONSDALE,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T," I the feel just as strongly as does the ber honourable and learned member for Corio that no man's conscientious conexception victions should be interfered with in any way. If there were one word in the posed prayer that was tantamount to such interference, I should say at once that the Minister had done wrong in consenting to it. I am a dissenter, and do not recognise State church; but I cannot conceive of anylearned thing in the words of the prayer intended to be used which amounts to a recognition of a State church, or that could possibly offensive to any one.",28
179,Mr CROUCH,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,The King's supremacy in of the old system. religion is recognised in it.,28
180,Mr LONSDALE,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"Nothin g of the kind. Surelv no one would object to pray that God's blessing might rest upon the King. I am a preacher in the denomination which I belong, and, notwithstanding that am against a State church in every shape and form, I would use this prayer, rightly wrongly, in any pulpit I might occupy. I I were Minister of Defence, the service probably would not take place. I do not gether intend to raise any objection to it, but i did, my objection would be not to the form of the prayer, but to the consecration of nation. the banners. I should oppose the holding of any religious service in connection with their consecration. I cannot see tency of having prayer associated with the consecration of banners which may float over the heads of men when they go forth to their fellow beings. If the honourable learned member had objected to the proposal on that broad ground, there might have been something in his opposition to it ; but should stultify ourselves if we supported amendment merely on the lines on which it occahas been submitted. If the objection had to do been raised on other lines",28
181,Mr CROUCH,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,I adopt the honourable member's arguments altogether.,28
182,Mr LONSDALE,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"Ha d the honourable and learned member opposed the proposal conon other grounds, I might have considered whether the consecration should take place at all ; but surely no one would object to that ask a blessing-Avhethe r for the Czar of ,the Emperor of Japan, or any man. that I shall not support the honourable and relearned member, but I am pleased to learn the that for once he has some settled convictions. I hope that Ave shall have further will evidence in that direction.",28
183,Mr BROW N,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T," I agree with views expressed by the honourable memfor NeAv England, as to the AA'ording of the prayer, and do not propose to take any to it. I haA'e not carefully studied the prayer; but, after all, the objection protaken to the Avording is only a minor an matter. What Ave have to consider are the important principles underlying the Avhole proposal, and I think that the Committee is any under an obligation to the honourable and member for Corio for bringing those principles prominently before us. In this new land Ave have rid ourselves of the old be shackles of denominationalism-of a State Church, and a State system of religionbut in this instance Ave are to have a revival",28
184,Mr LONSDALE,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,There is nothing in that.,28
185,Mr BROWN,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"I object not to the wording of the prayer, but to the methods to be adopted in carrying out the ceremony. The to honourable and learned member for Corio I asked us' to object to the ceremony, not merely because of the AA'ording of the prayer, or but because of the broad general principle 1 f which is involved. It is from that standpoint that I view the question, apart altofrom the technicalities associated Will f I the utterance of a feAV Avords of"" prayer by the representative of some religious denomi",28
186,Mr JOHNSON,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,I think that the honourable member for Corio took objection to parthe consisticular Avords in the prayer.,28
187,Mr CROUCH,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,Not exclusively.,28
188,Mr BROWN,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"I understood that the kill honourable and learned member's objection and related to the broad principle underlying their use. I shail protest as strongly as I can against preference being gh'en to anv we one church, or to anything in the direction the of bringing about the establishment of any State Church in the Commonwealth. I have as great a reverence for the verities of the Christian religion as has any honourable member. I endeavour to cultivate the Christian spirit, because I have a profound belief in those verities; but the proposed ceremony will practically require on the part of those who join in it the recognition of a particular church, or a particular form of religion, and will tend to bring the grand and noble aims of the Prince of Peace into ridicule. It is for reason that I protest against it, and shall support the amendment. I shall support the honourable and learned member, in protesting not against the mere words to be used in the prayer, but against the principle involved in the introduction of a system that must bring the grand and noble religion of Jesus Christ into ridicule, and make it but a mere travesty.  to take part in the discussion of the proposed consecration ceremony, but as some honourable members appear to take a different view from that held by the soldiers as to what is meant by serving under the colours, I think it is necessary to briefly deal with the question. Let me relate to the Committee a little incident which took place in South Africa at the time of the Zulu war, in order to show how highly the troops value their colours. Just before the battle of Isandula, the two battalions of the 24th Regiment met in South Africa for the first time since the Peninsular War, and they celebrated the occasion by setting apart a special d'ay for the trooping of their colours. The sentiments which were expressed at that ceremony are so firmly imprinted on my memory that I shall never forget"" them. It was a regular galadav for the two battalions. Shortly afterwards the battle of Isandula took place, and while General Thesiger, afterwards Lord Chelmsford, was away with part of the two battalions, the remainder, with the colours, remained in camp. If able members had witnessed the anxiety which the men betrayed for the safety of their colours, they would not have anything to say against the consecration which is to take place on Monday next. A banner, after all, is only a bit of silk-sometime s a fragment little better than a rag-but the whole history of a regiment is sometimes contained in it ; and in this case the history of the 24th Regiment was bound up in the little bit of silk which was the subject of such deep anxiety. Honourable members may, perhaps, remember the story of Lieutenants Melville and Coghill, who, ; believing the colours to be in danger, tore .them from, the poles, and wrapped them round their bodies like a cummer-bund. They swam through rivers, they dropped down bluffs, but eventually, in their anxiety to get away, and so save che honour of. '.he regiment, they were shot. The first thing that was asked when we came up with the relieving force was, what had become of the colours? Attempts were that made to ascertain their whereabouts, and. if honourable members had seen the anxiety expressed by both officers and men about their loss they would not oppose the proposed consecration. The regiment with which I served, the Royal Artillery, had no colours with them, because their colours are kept either at London or Woolwich, I forget which.",28
189,Mr CROUCH,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,Are not regimental colours always kept at home?  always kept at home the 24th Regiment would not have had its colours in danger on the occasion of which I am speaking.,29
190,Mr TUDOR,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"But at the present day?  is twenty-three or twenty-four years since I left the service. Some days after, Lieutenants Melville and Coghill were found with the colours wrapped round them, and their bodies were brought into camp at Helpmakaar, on the Natal side of the Tugela. It seemed to me that the saving of the colours was the only thing that kept the regiment together. The colours are symbolic of the unity of a regiment. The names of the engagements in which it has taken part during its whole existence are inscribed on them, and the trooping of the colours once a year is a great day. Those who have seen the trooping of the colours of the' different regiments of Guards at St. James' in London know that it is a sight always to be remembered. The proposed consecration honorservice at Albert Park will be a similar proceeding, to which I see ho objection at all. If the Government think fit to have these banners consecrated, all I have to say is, let them be consecrated. If I were a member of the Forces, and had any religious scruple about being present at a ceremony of this kind, I would stay away. The Minister said that any one who objects to it' may stay away, so that I do not know what objection there can be to the course proposed. The honourable ""and learned member for Corio has told us that men staying away because of religious scruples, or because they object to the ceremony, will have to do fatigue duty. I know that when I served in the ranks my desire was always ta get to church, in order to avoid fatigue duty.",29
191,Mr TUDOR,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"That did not show much respect for religion.  a better man, or, at any rate, I was not a worse man for going there. So far as respect for religion is concerned, I resemble the honourable member; I respect as much of it as I like.",30
192,Mr LONSDALE,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,It would be better for us if the principles taught in church were more often obeyed by us.  to church. The mere act of consecration is neither here nor there. The honourable and learned member for Corio took exception to the wording of the prayer.,30
193,Mr CROUCH,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"No . I said 'that other people were offended by it. It does not matter to me personally.  able and learned member to say that it made the King the head of the Church, .though I could not understand his objection. Similar objection might be taken to the prayer with which our proceedings are .opened, but, of course, any honourable member who objects to it can stay away .while it is being read. The honourable member for Canobolas has told us that there is a great principle involved. I thought that there was a great principle underlying the proposed religious service at the Exhibition Building, and I was not prepared to vote £ 2 0 0 for it, because I am opposed to anything like the recognition of a State church; but I should like to know from the honourable and learned member for Corio what denomination takes exception to the particular form of prayer which is to be adopted at Albert Park. Every one of us, in one way or another, when he prays, asks for the blessing of the Almighty, and that is all that is asked for in this instance. 1 do not cavil at the wording of the petition. With regard to the sentiment created by ^proceedings of this kind, I say that honourable members ought to serve in the Forces if they wish to know the value of sentiment. The colours of a regiment are only a little bit of bunting, but the feeling I had when I saw. the flag flying over Rorke's D r if t , when we came up to its relief, was such as I have - never experienced before or since. If those who follow the banners which are to be consecrated on Monday next have the same feelings it will be a good thing for them. Take away sentiment, and what have we left? Nothing at all.",30
194,Mr BAMFORD,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"Will the consecration ot these banners increase that sentiment ?  think that it is a good thing to consecrate the banners, though I do not care whether it is done by a Church of England clergyman, a Presbyterian, or one of some other denomination. If the ceremony creates in others the sentiment which was aroused in my own breast, it will be a good thing for them.",30
195,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T," I understand that the amendment of the honourable and learned member for Corio is, strictly speaking, to reduce the proposed vote by J £ I , whatever his reasons for moving it may be. I have time and again in this Chamber opposed to the utmost of my ability the reduction of the Defence Estimates, and I take this opportunity to do bo again. There has been a great deal of discussion upon the particular matter referred to by the honourable and learned member for Corio, but I wish rather to give reasons why I think that the provision made for the defence of Australia is too small as it is, and why, in consequence, we should not support the honourable and learned member's amendment.",30
196,Mr TUDOR,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,Le t us first dispose of the question raised by the honourable and learned member for Corio.,30
197,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,There will be nothing to prevent other honourable members from continuing .the discussion of that question after I have concluded my speech.,30
198,Mr CROUCH,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"This is a "" put-up "" thing, to prevent a distinct issue being raised.",30
199,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"I ask that the honourable and learned member for Corio may be called upon to withdraw that remark. 'The ACTING CHAIRMAN (Mr. GROOM ) - I did not catch the remark; but if words of offence were used, I ask the honourable and learned member to withdraw them.",30
200,Mr CROUCH,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"If you, sir, rule that my words were offensive, I withdraw them. I said that this is a "" put-up "" thing, to prevent a distinct issue being raised. ' The ACTING CHAIRMAN (Mr. GROOM) - I think that those words contain a reflection on the honourable member for Wentworth, and I therefore 'ask that they be withdrawn.",30
201,Mr CROUCH,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,I withdraw them.,31
202,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"The dispositions made for the defence of the Commonwealth presuppose an invasion or an attempt by a foreign power to take territory from us, with a view to establishing a colony or naval base in Australia. I do not think, however, that that assumption is a tenable one. I hold that the most likely form of attack would be a raid on our commerce or on one of our chief ports. Australia is too distant from other parts of the world for any important power to contemplate the invasion or seizure of our territory. But we are bringing into existence to meet such a remote contingency a field force, the organization of which seems to have already been practically perfected. Let me give one or two reasons for my opinion that an invasion of Australia will in all probability never take place. The only country which in modern times has carried on a campaign similar to that which would be necessary for the subjugation of Australia, or the seizure of any of our territory, is Great Britain ; but, in spite of her enormous mercantile marine, and the great wealth which she possesses, she found the subjugation of a small people in South Africa an almost impossible task. With the exception of the United States, with which I hope ws shall never have any difference, there is no power in the world capable of effecting a serious landing on our coasts. Furthermore, we should not lose sight of the fact that an enemy could not seriously consider the invasion of Australia until after England had permanently lost command of the seas. On the other hand, it is quite possible that the fleets of England may temporarily in time of war lose command of the seas, though I hope that that will never come about. It is also more than probable that long distance cruisers will occasionally be able to evade the British Fleets engaged in blockading the ports of our enemies.",31
203,Mr JOHNSON,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,That has happened before.,31
204,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"Yes , and might happen again. In time of war the duty of the English fleets would be to, as far as possible, blockade the ports of the enemy; but single cruisers might now and again succeed in slipping through the cordon of British warships, and afterwards try to damage the mercantile marine of Great Britain. And then, with a view to prevent food supplies from reaching that country, they might raid distant ports of the Empire. As it would be virtually impossible, owing to the proximity of the cruisers co-operating with the English Fleets, for such cruisers to attack vessels bringing England's food supplies near the English coasts, that is, at their point of arrival, they would go further afield and seek to intercept them at their point of departure. And, consequently, I hold that the forms of attack which we have most to fear are such raiding of our ports, and such interference with our shipping, as might be made by a powerful commercedestroying vessel of the enemy. The protection of our ports may seem of small moment to people living in the country, but as the four chief coastal cities of Australia contain one-third of the population of the Commonwealth, while, with the exception of a few detached lines in Queensland, all our railway systems branch out from them; as, in short, they are our chief centres of external and internal distribution, their protection is a matter of the utmost importance. A cruiser of heavy tonnage and' fai r armament, such as the Russian vessel, Gromoboi, which recently visited these waters, would be able to so terrorize our merchant marine as to make it take refuge in these ports, and to intimidate our people to the extent of seriously interfering with the whole business of the country.",31
205,Mr MCCAY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,That could happen only if the British Fleet in these waters was destroyed. Mr KING O'MALLEY - On e Russian ship recently paralyzed business in San Francisco.,31
206,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"- I have endeavoured to show that it is probable that foreign cruisers may occasionally escape English blockading squadrons, in the same way as the Russian Fleet escaped from the Japanese squadron engaged in blockading VJadivostock.",31
207,Mr MCCAY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"But directly an enemy's cruiser did any damage in'these waters, the fact would be reported to the British vessels engaged in defending our coast.",31
208,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"I admit that. I think I shall be able to show that that will not take very long-that the fact to which the Minister has referred will make it essential to the cruiser to deliver an immediate attack against our shipping and the bases of our shipping. And I will endeavour to show that our ports are not in a position to repel a sudden raid of this na r ture. Several suggestions have been made with a view to insuring the more effective_ protection of our ports: The'head of the late Government suggested that torpedo-boat destroyers should be obtained. The natural objection I have to such a proposal is that the formation of a separate fleet for Australia would not be best calculated to promote the well-being of the Commonwealth, or of the Empire of which we form an important part. Torpedo-boats are most effective for the purposes of attack; and can develop their best qualities only during night attacks and whilst manoeuvring in smooth waters. enemy's ship would, however, make an attack under the conditions most favourable for her purpose, and would certainly not at night attack a port defended by torpedoboats. The second essential for the tive manoeuvring of a torpedo squadron is smooth water- a condition which seldom obtains along our coasts. Therefore, I think we may, for the present, dismiss the suggestion that we should obtain torpedoboat destroyers. Mr KING O'MALLEY - What about submarine boats?",31
209,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"Submarines , owing to their slowness, are useful more for the purpose of ' attacking than for defending ports. A large number of submarine boats are being constructed iby France, and also by England, with a view to attack each other's ports in the channel. A submarine is too slow to attack a moving ship with any certainty. She can direct her movements so as to deliver an attack at a fixed point and in a given time. If , however, an enemy's cruiser were off our shores, her commander would not insert an advertisement in the newspapers intimating that she would be at a given place at a certain time. not think, therefore, that for defence we can placs much reliance upon submarines. Our harbour defences must, since neither torpedo craft nor submarines are adapted to our requirements, take the form usually adopted, namely, that of a system of minefields, protected by quick-firing batteries, which are themselves protected by heavy guns of position; this latter to keep the enemy's ships beyond striking distance of our mine-field protection armament. With these mine-fields we should be in a different position from that occupied by the Russians at Port Arthur, who largely used floating mines. Floating mines have an enormous moral effect-and , therefore, are most demoralizingly effective-upo n an enemy. Our object, however, would be not only to prevent an enemy's cruisers from coming into our ports, but to enable our own ships to navigate our coasts and harbors with perfect safety after the enemy had been driven from our shores. They would, of course, for some considerable time afterwards be exposed to great danger if floating mines were used for the purposes of defence, and for that leason we have to put on one side any idea of adopting them. I hope that very shortly the great powers will arrive at an understanding precluding belligerents from sowing the sea with floating mines. Ordinary An mines, such as are used for harbour defences, are intended to prevent an enemy's ships from rushing past the forts. We have recently had illustrations of the fact that modern ships of war can stand a treeffec- mendous amount of battering. One battleship recently arrived at Chifu with such a large number of holes in her that they represented a considerable portion of her superficial area. And an 'ordinary armoured' cruiser could undoubtedly rush past any forts we have in Australia. Any mine-fields designed to prevent war ships from executing such a manoeuvre, must be protected by quick-firing artillery of comparatively light calibre. The batteries containing these guns must in every case be protected by heavier guns, capable of preventing a cruiser from approaching within close range. According to May, warships have so 'preponderating an armament that if they were able to approach within 600 yards-whic h is about the range at which they could effectively work all their guns-of a battery of light guns, they would soon be able to put it out of action. Therefore, it is necessary that we should have heavier guns mounted in commanding I do positions, to make the enemy keep at a respectful distance. We have not in Australia any such heavy guns as are mounted on fortresses in other parts of the world; and I do not think that we require guns of excessively large calibre, my whole argument being based upon the supposition that an attack by an armoured cruiser, not by a fleet or battleships, is what we have most to fear. The defences of Sydney are in a far better position than those of Melbourne.",32
210,Mr SKENE,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"Sydne y requires more protection than Melbourne, because it is nearer the open sea.",32
211,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"Undoubtedl y it requires more protection, and for reasons other than that mentioned by the honourable member. It is the naval base for the British Squadron in these seas; and, although I ciuite understand that the Imperial authorities undertake the protection of their bases, we cannot ignore the fact that Sydney is specially liable to attack on account' of its being the head-quarters, and of containing the war munitions of the Admiralty in Australia. For this special reason special measures must be taken to insure the safety of Australian interests in and about that port. Well, sir, I have shown the necessity for two forms of batteries-quick-firin g batteries for the protection of the mine-fields, and batteries of heavier guns for the protection of the lighter armaments; but, of course, it is of no use to have defences-and we have already spent a large sum upon defence works-unles s we have the men to man the guns. We find that before Federation, the States which looked after their own defences had, as a whole, much stronger forces available for immediate use in their forts, than the Commonwealth possesses at the present time. One of the strong reasons advanced in favour of Federation was that our common defences could be made much more efficient than would be possible under the States' Administrations. That promise has been carried out so far as the field forces are concerned; but I regret to say that, there are not now so many gunners available to work our guns at a moment's notice as there were prior to Federation.",32
212,Mr MCCAY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"There is a sufficiency of gunners. I had a return made out quite recently, when I was investigating the very point referred to by the honourable member, and I found that with one small exception, there are a sufficient number of permanent and partially paid gunners to provide the necessary reliefs for manning the forts from time to time.",33
213,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"I quite accept that statement ; but I should like to know how long it would take for the militia garrison artillery to reach the forts at, sav, Queenscliff?",33
214,Mr MCCAY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,As long as it would occupy a train to travel from Melbourne to Queenscliff.,33
215,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,Would everything be in working order within twenty-four hours ?,33
216,Mr MCCAY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,We could mobilize our - garrison artillery and have them within the forts between dark and dawn.,33
217,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"And that might be too late. The General Officer Commanding, however, does not hold that view as to the adequateness of the reliefs provided. In his last report he says The latest pattern guns are now being placed in position in Sydney; and during the ensuing twelve months similar guns will be placed at Hobart, Adelaide, and Fremantle. The detachments for these guns should be permanent troops. It is also laid down that for these guns there shall be at least two reliefs. The increase in the Estimates now submitted only provides for one relief, so that the barest possible requirements are estimated for.",33
218,Mr MCCAY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"Includin g the militia forces, there are two reliefs.",33
219,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"But the General Officer Commanding holds that the quick-firing artillery should be worked by permanent soldiers. I do not wish to deal with technical matters; but it appears to me that if we are to have quick-firing artillery of the kind which will prove most useful in repelling a sudden rush, it will be to our interest to keep in the forts such men as will be able to work them at a moment's notice.",33
220,Mr SKENE,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,That is what was done prior to Federation.,33
221,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,Exactly . I find that within the past few years the field' and garrison artillery-and the field artillery constitutes a very small proportion of the garrison artillery,33
222,Mr MCCAY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,There is no permanent field artillery.,33
223,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"But there is a small cadre force which is used for field artillery instructional purposes. I find that upon the date of its transfer to the Federation, the Permanent Artillery numbered 1,220 of all ranks. Upon these Estimates provision is made for only 755. Furthermore, I find that the Estimates show a decrease of £ 1 4 0 in the Engineers' vote, which covers the submarine mining engineers. The curious feature in connection with this decrease is that, whereas the amounts it will have to disburse are less, yet the Accounts and Pay Branch gets more for doing it ; consequently, it is not economy in the public estate which has brought about the small reduction in the Engineers' vote. The necessity to keep an adequate permanent force is a matter which has agitated the mind of the chief military adviser to the Government ever since he has been in Australia. The General Officer Commanding, in his report of this year, saysI pointed out last year that the reduction of the Royal Australian Artillery to the existing establishment laid down by the Minister for the Estimates of 1903-4 "" can only be viewed with the most serious apprehension, as the numbers are quite inadequate for the duties required of them. The effective land defence of the naval positions on the one side, and of the commercial centres on the other, is most seriously compromised. My point is that the effective land defence of our naval positions, and of our commercial centres, is seriously endangered by maintaining this force at its present insufficient stiength. That is the opinion of the principal military adviser to the Governmenta gentleman whose counsel upon this matter has been repeatedly disregarded, although the first duty of this Parliament is to safeguard the lives and property of the people intrusted to its charge. The General Officer Commanding continuesI represented that a reduction of the Permanent Artillery personnel existing in the six States prior to Federation from fifty officers and 1,170 other ranks to thirty-eight officers and 820 other ranks might be effected, but only as a temporary measure. In spite, however, of my earnest representations, the late Minister of Defence still further reduced the number to thirty-four officers arid 714 other ranks. I say that at the time that recommendation was made the then Minister of Defence took upon himself an enormous responsibility in disregarding the advice of our chief military expert in this matter.",33
224,Sir JOHN FORREST,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,The recommendation upon which I acted was made by the General Officer Commanding.,34
225,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,I trust that the right honourable gentleman will be able to show that his action was not fraught with such serious consequences to the people of Australia as is alleged by the General Officer Commanding.,34
226,Sir JOHN FORREST,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,The reduction was insisted on in Committee of Supply.,34
227,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"I quite admit that the reduction was insisted upon by the Comby me mittee of Supply. But I should be lacking in my duty if I did not urge that the Golery vernment should not have agreed to a cers decrease which, in its own opinion, operate prejudicially to the safety of the people.",34
228,Sir JOHN FORREST,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"The Government ought to have resigned, I suppose?",34
229,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"If I ever occupied a hope responsible position, such as that which was recently filled by the right honourable member for Swan, I should prefer to redate sign my seat in this House and appeal to the country, if necessary, rather than enresponsibilities danger the safety of the people by agreepresent ing to such a reduction.",34
230,Sir JOHN FORREST,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,Then the honourable member would be resigning every day.,34
231,Mr EWING,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,The honourable member occupied a seat upon the other side of the House at the time.,34
232,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"The honourable member for Richmond is interjecting somewhat prematurely, since he is doing so from the' Treasury benches. I regard this matterof defence as an absolutely non-party oneone which it is the duty of all sides of the Hpuse to make efficient.",34
233,Sir JOHN FORREST,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"The Committee of. Supply agreed to an amendment reducing the Defence vote by ,£131,000.",34
234,Mr HUME COOK,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,But it did not say upon what lines that reduction was to be effected.,34
235,Sir JOHN FORREST,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,It did.,34
236,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"I do not wish to labour this question, if honourable members will allow me to proceed.",34
237,Mr BAMFORD,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,Nobod y has attempted to give the question of defence a party colour.,34
238,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"That is so. I hold that this House was absolutely wrong in insisting upon such an enormous reduction, without assigning adequate reasons for disregarding the advice of the General Officer Commanding. That officer's report continuesPractical experience and personal investigation, extending over the last twelve months, have full y confirmed my opinion that the result of this las't reduction can only be to seriously compromise the security of the Commonwealth. In view of these statements, I claim that this Committee should very seriously reconsider its decision of twelve months ago. Continuing, the General Officer Commanding saysI t will be observed, therefore, as represented in my report dated May, 1903, that the permanent minimum of the Royal Australian Artilwill eventually require to be forty-three offiand 922 other ranks, but that, as a temporary measure, thirty-eight officers and S20 other ranks might may be sufficient. In other words, the personnel of the regiment required for the purposes which I have outlined needs to be increased by 200 men. That is a large proportionate increase, but I that, in view of the unqualified statement of the General Officer Commanding, this Committee will see its way at an early to sanction it. I think that a gentleman who entertains such a high regard for the of his position as does the Minister of Defence, will shortly realise that our ports and shipping should be safeguarded from attack, and to this end will carry out this very strong recommendation of the General Officer Commanding to increase the personnel of the force in question.",34
239,Sir JOHN FORREST,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,The General Officer Commanding recommended die maintenance of the present number of that force. He miners in Sydney. submitted an interim scheme.,35
240,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"No . He stated that the number might be temporarily reduced to 858, whereas the present personnel is 755",35
241,Sir JOHN FORREST,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,How many are kept at the barracks?,35
242,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"The cadre force is kept there, but its members are included numbers I have given.",35
243,Sir JOHN FORREST,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,And how many do they number?,35
244,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"I cannot, of course, give the actual number.",35
245,Sir JOHN FORREST,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,How many are at the barracks ?,35
246,Mr MCCAY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"The number varies, but it is always considerable.",35
247,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,My argument is based upon the propriety of maintaining all the Railway men who are required to man the guns in such a position that they mayfeeable to man them within the shortest possible time.,35
248,Mr MCCAY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"A month ago I began to vestigate this very question, and I am still engaged in that task.",35
249,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"I am extremely glad to know that the Minister has been so prompt to deal with the matter. It augurs well for the Deoartment that we have a man of his energy at its head. I also desire briefly refer to the mine-fields which are required to prevent a sudden rush past our forts. Although the number of mines seems to be sufficient for the purpose, I find that in toria they cannot be laid down in less than three weeks.",35
250,Sir JOHN FORREST,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,Who is the honorthan the General able member's authority for that statement,35
251,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,The right honourable memevery ber for Swan will not deny its accuracy?,35
252,Sir JOHN FORREST,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,The work can be carried out in much less than three weeks.,35
253,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"I . think that my statestate. ment is absolutely incontrovertible. It is tolerably well known that the which are available for the protection of Port Phillip, can only be laid down by present force of submarine miners weeks. The personnel of that force could hardly be augmented in time of danger, cause the laying of mines is a very delicate business. In my judgment, the marine mining vote for Victoria should be protected very considerably increased. What is the use of possessing mines if , in csise of gency, they cannot be laid down?",35
254,Sir JOHN FORREST,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,They can be laid down. We have a big corps of submarine,35
255,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"I admit that we are better off in this regard in Sydney. But we have not got enough men of our own, let alone only enough to send any away when they would be most needed. I am not dealing with this matter from a provincial stand-point, but from a national one.",35
256,Sir JOHN FORREST,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,They can be laid in the down in less than three weeks.,35
257,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"What I have stated is an absolute fact. If the right honourable member desires me to do so, I can prove it, but I ask him not to insist upon my labouring a particular point. It is a question of a few kept thousand pounds - a question between ; safety and extreme risk. My right honourable friend, who is quite prepared to spend. £ 4 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 of the taxpayers' money - on the construction of the Transcontinental",35
258,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,He is not serious.,35
259,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,I do not think for one moment that he is ; but he is always telling inus that he desires the Commonwealth to spend this large sum of money on the construction of the line.,35
260,Sir JOHN FQRREST,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,The honourable member cannot grasp that big question.,35
261,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"I do not wish' to carry on a dialogue with the right honourable memto ber, but I do think that a man who wants to spend four millions on such a project, should not be adverse to spending a few thousands to secure the safety from an exVictreme danger of a third of our population. I have shown, I think, that the artillery force, as it stands at present, is much less Officer Commanding ? thinks is adequate, and less than I imagine man who considers the question will believe is necessary. I have shown that the submarine mining force-in Victoria, at all events-is in a precariously inefficient",35

266,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,I thought that the emerhonorable member said that it was one service.,35
267,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"All the submarine miners of Australia are not retained in Sydney. Quite properly, the detachments are held where they are required. It becomes necessary, at a moment's notice, to put down mines if there is an alarm, and an enemy's ship would not courteously wait outside Port Phillip while we sent for men from Sydney to put down the mines at this port. The idea is ridiculous.",36
268,Sir JOHN FORREST,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,The Permanent Forces are supplemented by the Militia.,36
269,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"I am speaking of the Permanent Forces and the Militia. Even i the submarine miners of the Permanent Militia Forces were called on, it would impossible to get the mines laid at Port question. Phillip Heads within three weeks. There is one other point I wish to make concluding. We were told, prior to the establishment of the Commonwealth, that naval defence? one of the results of Federation would be improved defence for the respective Colonies. Now, New South Wales was at that time the best defended Colony. I think I have clearly shown to the Committee that the Naval Agreement. I do not desire exclusive defence for New South Wales; but I must say that the Subsidy. people of that State entered Federation on the understanding, among others, that, by doing so, they would be better deI fended. And without doubt they that fact a sound argument for the contention that the defence of their State should not. at any rate, be diminished.",36

284,Mr CROUCH,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"Does not the sum of £ 5 9 2 , 0 0 0 include the cost of the Central administration which is common to all the States ? ' Mr KELLY - Yes ; but the cost of the Central administration-and I honourable and learned member refers to the General Staff-is simply a matter of about j£20,000.",36
285,Mr CROUCH,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,Does not that include all the new expenditure which is' common to all the States?,37
286,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"It does not materially dein crease the executive expenditure in New South Wales. It has not much to do it. The Commonwealth decided that New South Wales had an over sufficiency of manent artillery. That may or may not correct; but, in my opinion-and I have given reasons for my view-it is absoThe lutely incorrect. Whatever may have prompted that contention, I hold that in view of the representations that were made of attack. to the people of New South Wales prior to Federation, she should not have her fence vote decreased for the benefit of the rest of Australia. We do not mind paying an increased vote in which all the people Australia should share alike; but I hold that New South Wales should not be made to suffer simply because she had the prequite science to insure that the defences of her principal city were in an efficient and quate state.",37

I am commending the Minister for the increase, and I repeat that I hope every penny will be spent. I tected. am quite convinced that the Minister holds the same view as myself. Ministers always think that they do not get enough for their Departments, but the Minister of Defence attack. especially is justified in holding that view. I do not wish to detain the Committee, and should have been infinitely better pleased must surely recognise them. had this dialogue with my right honourable friend not been so long; but I wish to phasize the fact that we are preparing defences on a system which is not best calfence culated to meet the clanger we have most fear. We are told that Switzerland is the prototype of Australia. I do not know if the Minister in making that statespent-i ment meant that it was the prototype of Australia for administrative or for executive purposes; but I hold that we should take no example from that country when we are considering our general policy of defence. In the first place, Switzerland is protected by the European understanding as to the inviolability of its territory.",37
289,Mr HUTCHISON,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,There are armed napresume the tions all around her.,37
290,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"I think that it was by the Treaty of Vienna in 1815 that the inviolability of Swiss territory was assured. For that reason Switzerland has nothing to fear, provided that the parties to the treaty respect it . But they have a citizen soldiery a very high state of efficiency, and I hope that in time we shall have our field forces with and citizen soldiery in the same efficient state. In the meantime, however, we are perneglecting a danger to which we in Ausbe tralia are peculiarly exposed, and which does not exist in the case of Switzerland. population of the four principal cities in that country numbers only about 430,000 souls, and only one is in any'way possible I refer to the city of Bale. Geneva, although close to the frontier, is Desurrounded by mountains, and would be difficult of attack. We all know that Switzerland is a country with impassable rivers of and mountains-the most impossible country to attack that it is possible to conceiveand her citizen forces are, consequently, adequate for its defence. In Australia, however, we have four ports, conadetaining a third of the population of the Commonwealth., which are so vulnerable that they are liable to immediate attack by a raiding cruiser, and such an attack one difference beof extreme danger.",37

292,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"F o u r ; I do not say that they are the only ports that should be proI make no exception, but there are four which, because of their situation, the richness of their commerce, and their insufficient' defences, would be most likely of",37

294,Mr KELLY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"The honourable member I can assure him that Brisbane would not be forgotten. emI point out this danger, and hope that when our the next Estimates come forward the Devote will be very largely increased. I to trust that the Estimates of the Department now before us will not be reduced, and that every penny voted will be spent--and well n the defence of Australia.",37
295,Mr JOHNSON,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T," I very largely endorse the views which have been expressed by the honourable member for Wentworth in regard to the insufficiency of the Estimates to cover the cost of effective defence. The Defence Estimates form an item in the Budget which may be regarded as one of the most important that we could be called upon to consider. National defence ought to be a question of obtaining security, and above ail considerations of expense. Before dealing with that aspect of the question, however, I should like to refer to the discussion which took place this morning in regard to the proposed consecration of banners. I have no desire to go into the question of the advisableness or otherwise of holding the ceremony. That is a matter upon which honourable members and the public may, perhaps, be allowed to hold different opinions; but I do not think there is any great principle underlying it, such as was suggested by the honourable member for Canobolas. So far as I could gather from the remarks of the honourable and learned member for Corio, his principal contention was that the form of prayer was in some respects likely to be unacceptable- I shall not sayobjectionable - to certain sections of the Military Forces. I cannot understand what is the great objection. If there be a likelihood of the form of prayer chosen proving distasteful to some persons, a way out of the difficulty, if time will allow, would be to get a number of clergymen of all denominations concerned to meet together, ancl agree to a form.",37
296,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"If that were done, the banners could not be consecrated for another five years.",38
297,Mr CROUCH,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,The Minister said that he would do that.,38
298,Mr MCCAY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"What ! Send it to the clergymen of all denominations 1 A copy of the prayer was sent to each chaplain concerned, days ago.",38
299,Mr TOHNSON,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"In that case an opportunity has been given to those chiefly concerned to arrive at an amicable agreement in the matter. I understand that the attendance at the parade is to be purely voluntary. If the men were to be compelled to take part in a service which might offend the consciences of some of them, there would be ground of complaint, but I understand that the element of compulsion does not enter into the matter at all.",38
300,Mr MAHON,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,Is this not tedious repetition within the meaning of the standing order ?,38
301,Mr JOHNSON,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"I have been interrupted to a slight extent, but I only wish to suggest an easy way out of what I do hot admit to be a real difficulty. This is not a party matter; it does not concern one party more than another; so that I think honourable members might accept my remarks in the spirit in which they are made, as a friendly suggestion to get rid . of what some seem to think a difficulty, though it does not present itself to .me in that light. Coming now to the question of defence generally, I think that the plea for spending more money on defence .than it is now proposed to spend has been justified by the arguments used by the honourable member for Wentworth in support of his contentions. If honourable members will refer to the second annual report of the General Officer Commanding, they will see that we have a very serious question to face. There can be no higher authority on this subject, nor one whose recommendations are worthy of greater consideration, than the General Officer Commanding.",38
302,Mr MAHON,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"Do you not think that we should have a quorum, Mr Acting Chairman ?",38
303,Mr JOHNSON,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"On page 15 of his last report, the General Officer Commanding, dealing with the subject of stores and equipment, says The serious condition of the stores and equipment was brought' to the notice of the Government in the Minute on Defence, dated 7th April, 1502. This unsatisfactory condition of affairs was further commented upon at length in Clause 13 and Clause 31 of the Annual Report, dated ist May, .1903. It is with feelings of the gravest apprehension that I again invite attention to the unsatisfactory condition of the warlike stores. The previous representations on this subject require but little modification in the present Report, from those made by me in the official documents above-mentioned, excepting in the items "" Fixed Defences,"" '-'Small Arms,"" and ""Small Arm Ammunition."" I need not go into that matter, because I presume that honourable members are familiar with the details referred to. On page 31 of the same document, the Major General says The work of re-organization and reconstruction of the whole of the pre-existing Military Forces of Australia has now been carried through the initial stages, and a new Commonwealth Military system has thus been brought into actual operation. The energies of all concerned must now be concentrated on the solidification of the system which has been accepted. It is reasonable to look forward with the utmost confidence to the result, if only the. whole of the officers and men concerned set themselves as loyally and with equal determination to solidifying the structure as they have to bringing it info being. Then he deals wi,th the question of arms and ammunition, in regard to which I refer honourable members to the report. These, however, are the comments which followI t has been shown that a further Special Warlike Store Vote of ^449,683 is required for the stores enumerated in (1)That is, guns, gun-waggons, arms, ammunition, and equipments on a peace establishmentand (2)That is, guns, et cetera, on a war establishdisposed ment(vide Clause 28 C), and that to provide plete military system as stated in (3)the completion in their entirety of the various units comprising the Field Force and the Garrison Force, under the scheme of organizationan annual outlay of ,£609,419 is necessary (vide clause 25). This expenditure will provide a Field complete in all its details, and fit for active operations of 13,831 men and sixty guns peace footing, and of 27,753 men and eighty-four guns upon a war footing. It will further provide a Garrison Force of 11,752 men and twenty-six guns, exclusive of the armament of the fixed Defences, with behind them an important auxiliary force of approximately 29,000 riflemen furnished by the Kifle Clubs. The troops thus provided, alieady shown in the Minute of Defence, dated 7th April, 1902, are the least number which would afford reasonable security against invasion, which would suffice for the present protection Australian interests. The principle in view in thus laying down the ment. above minimum numbers for the Military Forces of the Commonwealth is that a hostile invasion of Australia, with intention to effect permanent ritorial occupation, would never be attempted with a less force than from 20,000 to 50,000 equipped, well trained, and well organized troops. It is obvious, therefore, that a force at least equal t? that proposed is required to insure any sonable hope of success. These are very important matters, and they emphasize the necessity for not being too niggardly in providing for defence. The General Officer Commanding continues The security by land of Australia, as a whole, cannot, moreover, be considered assured",38
304,Mr MAHON,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"I rise to a point of order. I understand that the honourable and learned member for Corio has moved to amend subtally division 1 of division 41, by reducing salary of the Secretary to the Defence partment by j Q i , his object being to protest against the expenditure of public money for denominational purposes. I contend that tary's salary. any general debate upon the Defence Estimates is out of order. I am not aware that there is any understanding that such a bate should be permitted at the present time. If the whole division were before the Comfor mittee, and the amendment of a specific item had not been moved, the honourable a point of order. member for Lang would be in order, but an amendment having been moved concentrating the attention of the Committee on a certain item, he is precluded from discussing generally the administration of the Defence Department until the amendment has been of.

The organiis incomplete; the departments necessary for a mobile Army nave yet to be created; and are neither sufficient guns, arms, equipment, nor ammunition available.

The victories of the Japanese arms within the last four months have astounded the whole civilized world by their brilliancy and by their astonishing rapidity. The future and far-reaching results of the war have yet to be felt, but it is safe to predict that the opening up of China will follow as a result which, together with the opening of a canal across the Isthmus of Panama, will materially alter the existing political and commercial situation in the Pacific.",40
329,Mr CROUCH,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,That was read this morning.,41
330,Mr JOHNSON,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"Possibly , but I did not hear it. Anyhow I am reading it again. The honourable and learned member is at perfect liberty to read what he likes, and I have an. equal right to quote the General Officer Commanding in support of the arguments I have advanced. He says furtherI t is certain that commercial supremacy in the Pacific will be the aim and ambition of the leading naval and military Powers of the world, and that Australian interests must thereby be seriously compromised, if not imperilled, unless they are effectively secured by a reasonable measure of military defence. In view of the alarming nature of this report-and I take it that it is not unnecessarily alarming, because doubtless it has been drawn up after very careful consideration-it behoves us, as the guardians of the interests of the Commonwealth, to secure ourselves against the dangers referred to. I should like to quote from a leading article which appeared in the Sydney Daily Telegraph of Monday last, which bears upon one or two of the statements contained in the report Of the General Officer Commanding as to foreign, powers establishing themselves in the Pacific. The fact that naval bases are being established by these powers is mentioned as an additional argument in support of the necessity for our keeping ourselves in a continual state of preparedness for the purposes of defence. The article from which I am about to quote refers particularly to the fact that the master of the steamer Ysabel had been refused trading rights in the Marshall group. The writer saysGerman steamers are permitted to trade with British-owned islands in the Pacific on payment of a licence fee of ^ IOO per annum, which Supply. [REPRESENTATIVE'S.] Supply. also be paid by each British-owned steamer engaged in the trade. But the German reply to this neighbourly treatment by Great Britain is to levy a prohibitive rate against the British steamer entering a German island group, and to charge vessels flying the Union Jack more than fifty times as much for the privilege of trading with a German possession as Britain charges a vessel flying the German flag for the privilege of entering a British-owned harbour in the South Seas. The incident is significant as a presage of what may be expected to follow when the feverish struggle for trade, which has already brought the European Powers into dangerous juxtaposition in Asia, is extended, as seems inevitable, to the island groups that lie as it were at the backdoor of Australia. The insatiable craving for fresh markets, which shall be the exclusive property of the exploiter, has already led to a terrible war in Eastern Asia, and now the greedy monopolist is at work also in the South Seas. Australian commercial predominance must inevitably be followed by political predominance in all these islands. It is impossible that the trade with an island group should be in the hands of the subjects of one Power, while the political control should be in the hands of another Power. "" The future of Germany,"" observed the Kaiser, in demanding funds for a huge programme of naval construction, is on the water."" Germany, 11 needs a big fleet to support her in enforcing this policy of grabbing trade by any and every means from those who already possess it. That is obvious. The article concludes as follows: The German colonies in Togoland, the Cameroons, South-west Africa, East Africa, and Kiauchau are little more than military settlements. And there is no reason to suppose that the destiny of the German colonies in the Pacific islands will be any different. That is an additional reason why the latest manifestation in the Marshall Islands of what Bismarck called the "" furor Teutonicus"" is to be viewed with apprehension by Australia. Such an unscrupulous effort to secure a trading monopoly contains a significant warning. Commercial expansion connotes political expansion. And the political expansion of Germany in the Pacific means the creation, not of peaceful trading colonies under the German flag, but of military settlements and bases that must in the future be a source of grave anxiety to the people of the Commonwealth. These warnings are repeated not only in the pressfo'utelsewhere, and we should not disregard them. The matter is one of very serious moment, and one which is well worthy of consideration by this Parliament. But that is not all. I have here a statement which will perhaps open the eyes of honourable members still, more to the gravity of the situation as"" it may possibly affect our future trading interests. The Argus of ioth November contains the following must telegram from Sydney, which is headed ""German Ambitions"" and "" N a v a l Base at New Britain "" :Much has been heard of late as to German activity in the Pacific, but it will be a matter surprise to many Australians to learn that considerable time past the Germans have quietly, under the guise of mercantile expansion, been preparedness. successfully and expeditiously building up a base within striking distance of the Torres Straits route. I wish to emphasize that point. The teleder gram continuesExtensive works are being carried out at Simpson's harbour, in Blancho Bay, and at'Matuti, in German New Guinea. A wharf, t,ooo feet length, is being built, together with spacious warehouses, at a cost of about ^'40,000. The will be larger than any in Australia, and modation will be sufficient for a city with lation of 100,000. So far, however, there no inhabitants at the Bay, and practically no trade is .done there. The ostensibly being carried out for the accommodawhich tion of the island steamers belonging to dcutscher Lloyd Co., which call there at intervals of six weeks. The great bulk of the trade of New Britain, however, is transacted at Hcrbertmates shohe, ten miles distant. Eventually the began to dawn upon observing men that Germany had no base in this part of the world, conclusion arrived at, and now generally held by those interested in island affairs, is that these works are being carried out by the Norddeutscher Lloyd on behalf of the Imperial authorities, who throughout appear lo have taken an active part in all arrangements. The spot is described as an ideal site for a naval coaling base, for the storage of quickfirers and ammunition, and for the equipment of German mail steamers as cruisers in the event of war. Simpson's harbour is situated on a kind of peninsula commanded by highlands of volcanic origin, which could be rendered almost impregnable by the mounting of a few guns. In the opinion of an Englishman acquainted with New Britain, there is no question as to the use to which the works are to be put. I have quoted that telegram, not with the idea of awakening antagonism to foreign Powers, because I recognise that they have a perfect right to provide for the protection of their own commerce, and to establish naval ibases so that they may be prepared to take aggressive measures should they be rendered necessary. But whilst commending, their foresight and enterprise in establishing bases within striking distance of Australia, it would be little short of criminal upon our part if we did not adopt effective measures to protect our commerce and our shores. I have no wish to prolong this discussion more than is absolutely necessary, for my purpose. strongly upon 'the matter of Australian defence, because I realise what it means if we neglect the opportunity of adopting reasonable precautions whilst yet there is time. I realise that there may come a period when it will become of imperative for us to take active meafor a sures for our defence, and I do not wish Australia to be found in a condition of unI f we rush into expenditure naval at a time of emergency the chances are that it will not prove nearly so effective as if would if we incurred that expenditure unnormal conditions, and with a full recognition of the possibilities of the future.",41

335,Mr MCCAY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"If this division be passed the opportunity of a general debate, according to the established practice of the Committee, on the whole of the Estimates of the Department, will end. There is no desire on the part of the Government to undulv curtail a general debate on a big spending Department like that of Defence, but I presume that the honourable member or some one else is ready to continue the debate until we reach the usual hour of adjournment. It was known yesterday that these Estimates would be considered today. The honourable member will have a further opportunity to discuss the re-organization question when the second reading of the amending Defence Bill is moved.  comment at some length on the Estimates of this Department, but as I have a very bad cold I am placed at a disadvantage. In the first place, I wish to call the attention of the Committee to the amount on the Estimates for Queensland. Every member of the Ministry must be aware of the parlous condition of the finances of that State, and if the Defence Estimates relating to Queensland can be cut down without impairing the efficiency of the forces I think that they should. I shall be happy to point out any case in which I consider that the Estimates may be reduced in the interests of that State. The Estimates of the military expenditure in Queensland show an increase of £ 1 6 , 7 3 0 on that for 1903-4, and at the present juncture that is a matter NOES. of some moment to the Treasurer of Queensland. The difficulty is only in relation to the present year, and if we could make a reduction I should be satisfied twelve months hence to vote the full amount. I am satisfied that efficiency can be maintained this year with a reduced vote. It will be remembered that when last year's Estimates were before us certain reductions were promised, more particularly in regard to the General Head-Quarters Staff in Melbourne. I am sorry that that reduction has not been made. PAIRS. Mr MCCAY - In the Head-Quarters Staff?  Head-Quarters Staff. There is also an increase in the naval vote as compared with that passed last year. At the very time when Queensland can least afford increased expenditure in this Department an increased vote is proposed. I recognise, however, that the increase in.the naval vote of that State amounts to only £ 2 . 1 2 9 , and that the people are receiving good value for their money with respect to the cadets and the militia. We have also to bear in mind that one of the gun-boats has been put into commission since last year. I should like to know whether the item, ""General Officer Commanding, including all allowances, except travelling, £ 1 , 2 5 0 ,"" represents the pay of the officer up to the end of the year.",43

338,Mr MCCAY,PARLIAMENTARY REFRESHMEN T,"There are two. The Assistant Adjutant-General for Engineer Services does not appear in the Estimates for this year, and if the honourable member turns to the vote for the Deputy Assistant Adjutant-General, he will see that the pay is to continue only during the absence of the Deputy Adjutant-General. As there are other changes coming into operation, we do not propose to send that officer away at once. Two or three weeks will elapse before the new scheme comes into force.  Minister is following the instructions which the Committee gave when last year's Estimates were under consideration.

However, I shall content myself with these remarks this afternoon, though I may have more to say on Tuesday.",44
350,Mr MALONEY,II F," I wish to make a few remarks in regard to the consecration of banners which is to take place at Albert Park on Monday next. My opinion is that it is an absurdity to bless these banners in any manner; but if they are' to be blessed, every religion to be found in the nation of which they are to be taken as symbolic should be represented. I should be glad to know that a conference of representatives of the various religions of Australia would be called to formulate a prayer and a form of service for the occasion. I speak now upon the subject from a different point of view from that from which I would have spoken prior to the division, because the Committee must be regarded as having affirmed the desirability of holding a consecration service, though I desire to lodge my protest against the holding of that ceremony, unless every Australian religion is represented at it. I have taken the trouble to go through the Military Forces List, to find out how the denominations are represented in our Forces by chaplains, and I have discovered that, although we have no State religion in Australia, certain denominations have a far larger proportion of chaplains of high rank than have others. Honourable members will accept my statement that as the son of an English mother, revere religion of that mother. If she chose give up the Church of England for Roman Catholicism, I have the greatest her religion, and whatever remarks I may make today are not made with a desire to point the finger at any religion. In Victoria the matter. we have recently had 'what is known as Hospital Sunday, and when I say that the PresVictorians byterians collected the largest amount for deserved it. our charities. I pay them my meed of respect and praise for a splendid effort. But how has that denomination been treated matter of its representation by chaplains in OUT Defence Forces? I protest that it has are no colonels. not been treated fairly. I have culled from our Military Forces List, issued in Sepreducing tember, some particulars on this subthe ject, to which honourable members may find it advantageous to refer later on when they appear in the columns of Hannot sard. Chaplains, like members of the fession to which I belong, when they join the Army, are given the privileges and titles of officers of various ranks. Now, I find that in New South Wales there are twentybyterian too six chaplains of whom one ranks as colonel, one as lieutenant-colonel, two as majors, and twenty-two as captains. The ing next in importance, having regard to population-because when I speak of the value or importance of a State, I have gard only to the human beings living upon The earth, with all its richness, only for the human units which it contains. In Victoria there are twenty-nine chaplains, or three more than in New South Wales, 'but not one of them ranks as colonel or lieutenant-colonel, though there are twentyvice. two majors, and seven captains. In the February issue of the list from which I have .taken these figures, four of the majors enjoy the relative rank within of lieutenant-colonel, whatever means. But this privilege appears to have been taken from them. I do not think that it has been done during the tenure office of the present Minister, but I direct his attention to the matter. I am sure that these gentlemen have done nothing to warlieutenant-colonel rant their reduction in rank. Mr Maloney,",44
351,Mr MCCAY,II F,They have not been reduced. There must be some other explanation.,45
352,Mr MALONEY,II F,"The note "" with relative rank of lieutenant-colonel"" was in February, 1904, appended to the names of the Rev. Henry John Wilkinson, the Rev. Joseph Hay, the Rev. Richard George I, Burke, and the Rev. James Kennedy-tw o the of them clergymen of the Church of Engto land, one a Roman Catholic, and one a Presbyterian. That privilege seems to have respect for been taken away from them.",45
353,Mr MCCAY,II F,I promise to inquire into,45
354,Mr MALONEY,II F,Yes. I do not wish to be reduced unless they have,45

Queensland, as well as of New South Wales, has despatched contingents abroad, but, nevertheless, possesses no chaplain who is a colonel, though it has one and ten captains. South Australia has neither colonels, lieutenantcolonels, nor majors, although her demo-. cratic legislation can pretty well vie with that of the other States^ and goes far beyond that of Victoria. There are only three chaplains in that State, and they hold the rank of captain. In Western Australia there are seventeen chaplains, of whom one is a lieutenant-colonel, and sixteen are captains. In little Tasmania, they have seven chaplains, all captains. Since toria is so well represented in the Ministry by the honourable and learned member for Corinella and the honourable member for Gippsland, and possesses twenty-nine chaplains, some of them should rank as colonels or lieutenant-colonels. have also ascertained how the various religions are represented in our Defence Force by the chaplains. I find that every religion is not so represented. The Republic of France recognises every religion, by contributing equally to all ; but, although we recognise all religions as equal, we do not contribute to their support out of State funds. But in our Defence Forces the old ignominy of favouring certain religions exists. In New South Wales the Church of England-to which I allude with' all reverence, and which has covered England with splendid temples-ha s one colonel, one lieutenantcolonel, one major, and seven captains. The Presbyterian Church, to which I have paid my meed of praise for its splendid efforts on Hospital Sunday, has one major and four captains. The Roman Catholic Church has three captains, and the Methodist Church six captains. So that only the Church of England is represented by colonels and lieutenant-colonels. In Victoria, the Church of England is represented by seventeen majors and three captains; the Presbyterians by four majors and one captain; the Roman Catholics by one captain; and the Wesleyans by one major and two captains. I pay my meed of praise to the governing authorities of Victoria, because, although they have not given Victorian chaplains any of the higher ranks, they have brought about a fairer division and a.larger representation than any other State possesses. In Queensland the Church of England is represented by nine captains, and the Presbvterian by one lieutenant-colonel, while the Wesleyans have one captain; the other denominations being unrepresented. In South Australia, the Church of England has two captains, and the Methodists one captain. In Western Australia, the Church of England has one lieutenant-colonel and eight captains; the Roman Catholic Church one captain; the 11 F 2 Wesleyans five captains, and the Methodists two captains. In Tasmania, the Church of England has four captains, the Presbyterians two, and the Wesleyans one. Honourable members will see that only five religious bodies have been mentioned-the Church of England, Presbyterian, Roman Catholic, Wesleyan, and Independent. I Vic- have not the slightest doubt that the representatives of all these denominations will pray with equal earnestness, but it is not desirable' that any preference should be shown for any particular denomination. Would it not be better to invite the repreI sentatives of all Christian religions to formulate a prayer to their Master? If the consecration of an inanimate object, such as the flag, is to have any effect, surely a prayer in which"" all the Churches were joined would constitute a stronger appeal than one offered by representatives of only a few of the Christian churches. It has been the practice of every European nation to invoke blessings on its flag. Every nation prays for' victory, and for carnage. Honourable members will perhaps permit me to present .to their minds the scene pourtrayed in one picture in the celebrated Wiertz collection at Brussels. There we have a splendid portrayal of the man of the futureat the end of the present century-holdin g in the hollow of his giant hand the baubles which have led to the desecration of all that is most high and noble on the earth, which have led to pillage, slaughter, and murder. As he looks upon the flags and baubles, and instruments of warfare, he marvels at the results they have brought about, and which are depicted in the background. We. want no blood-stained flag. Our object should be to keep our flag white and unstained, one that has never known warfare, either between ourselves and our foreign foes, or bloody internecine struggles such as have taken place in other countries.",45
364,Mr LIDDELL,II F,We shall never be a nation until we can show a blood-stained flag.,46
365,Mr MALONEY,II F,Wa r must be a pleasant subject for the honourable member if that is his idea.,46
366,Mr MAHON,II F,Accordin g to the honourable member we must commit murder before we can become a nation.,46
367,Mr MALONEY,II F,"There is one flag upon which no belligerent fires. That is the Red Cross. The nations of Europe paid Switzerland a great honour when they adopted her flag, reversing the colours only, as the badge of mercy and succour upon the battle-field. The people of Switzerland have always used their best efforts in the interests of peace, and it was highly appropriate that their flag should be adopted by the nations of Europe. When we see the colours of France, we can scarcely fail to think of the memorable words of Carlisle, in which he relates that Barbaroux sent a message to Marseilles, asking that there might be sent to him 600 men who were willing to die. His call was responded to, the men marched upon Paris with the tricolour floating over them, and we know of the carnage and misery that followed in their wake. Our Union Jack is only a little more than 100 years old. the emblem of a union that was brought about by the corruption of Lord Castlereagh, who ended his ignominious life by killing himself with his own hand. would have been better for humanity if he had died in the cradle. Our Union Jack, which, as I have said, is scarcely more than a century old, has been steeped in blood. Would that it had not been, or that it could be purified. Then there is the Old Glory of the United States of America, which, until recently, had remained unsullied. Unfortunately, the United States were not to adopt a purely defensive attitude, but carried their flag beyond their own borders. Loving that nation as I do, I regret that it would not accept the offer made by Mr. Carnegie of £ 4 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 .to induce it to abandon the Philippines. United States had continued true to the sentiments with which the Old Glory had been previously associated, their flag would have stood in a higher position today than perhaps that of any other nation. The Christian flag of Russia has been blessed and prayed for by perhaps 120,000,000 of people, and the flag of Japan has been prayed for by the Pagans and Christians of that country. if the God of the Christians is mightier than the gods of the Pagans, victory should have been assured to the Russians, rather than to the Japanese. I protest against the proposed consecration of banners, unless every religion is represented. orable member who preceded me spoke about Colonel Hoad. and I should like to know whether that officer was recalled by the Minister, or came back of his own volition. Mr Maloney.",46
368,Mr MCCAY,II F,He came back at the termination of the period for which he was sent away.,47
369,Mr MALONEY,II F,I understand that he was at the front for only about two or three weeks.,47
370,Mr MCCAY,II F,I could not say.,47
371,Mr MALONEY,II F,"If Colonel Hoad came back without orders, he should not have done so. He should have remained at the front where he - could obtain the information best calculated to qualify him for the high position to which he will doubtless attain in our military forces. If his reason for returning was that he feared chat he would lose his chance of advancement, he has cast a slur upon honourable members of this House, and upon ,the DeI t is fence authorities. The time spent by him in learning something that would be of use to us would naturally be recorded in his favour. If it is not too late, I hope that It Colonel Hoad will be sent back, so that he may enlarge his knowledge. I trust that a clear statement will be made upon this question. If the Russo-Japanese war has demonstrated one fact more than another, it is that coal is almost equal in value to powder and shot, and I should like to know if provision is being made for the defence of the coal mines along the coast of New South Wales. I am sorry content to say that the Victorian coal mines are not protected. As I understand that honourable members desire to adjourn at the usual hour, I shall conclude my remarks for the present, and resume next week.",47
372,Mr MCCAY,II F,"I have not with me the If the papers relating to Colonel Hoad's case, because I did not expect the matter to be referred to today. When Colonel Hoad was sent away, a minute was written to the effect that the probable duration of his absence would be about six months-the anticipation being that the winter in Manchuria would greatly interfere with military operations. Colonel Hoad has been away since the 30th March, or about seven Surely months. He was not recalled by this Government, nor, so far as I am aware, by the previous Government. He has not yet waited upon me since his return, and consequently I am unable to give any further information at present. Of course, The hon- I shall naturally ask him for an official report. In the meantime, I certainly do not draw any inference against him. .",47
