1,Mr MAKIN,DLSTBIBUTTON OF SUBFLUS MILITARY,"Havin g regard to the widespread . distress amongst the unemHouse < ployed in South Australia, and the urgent need for relief before the winter, I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Defence when surplus military stores and clothing will be made availablein the various States?",9
2,Mr FRANCIS,DLSTBIBUTTON OF SUBFLUS MILITARY,"As part-worn and spare military clothing becomes available it is sent to applicant organizations in the various States for distribution. I shall inquire regarding the circumstances in Sonth Australia, and let the honourable member have an early reply. Mr JAMES:- I understand that in country towns the Salvation Army will be the agent for the distribution of surplus clothing. Relief committees in the Hunter electorate' have applied to the Salvation Army for clothing, and have been informed that none is available. Will the Government see that sufficient clothing is made available to these committees for the relief of the unemployed during the winter months?.",9
3,Mr FRAN CIS,DLSTBIBUTTON OF SUBFLUS MILITARY,"As soon as it becomes available part-worn and surplus military clothing is handed over to certain charitable organizations 'which are prepared to bear the expense of distributing jt , Owing to the attitude of the Government of New South Wales, which has refused to issue suck clothing, the Commonwealth Government has arranged with the Salvation Army to distribute clothing in the country districts in that State. I regret that at the present time very little clothing is available for distribution.",9
4,Mr COLLINS,DLSTBIBUTTON OF SUBFLUS MILITARY,"I applied to the Department of Defence for clothing to be made available to the more important centres in the Hume electorate, and was advised that the Salvation Army was the approved distributing agency. When I applied to that organization for information - regarding the towns which had been supplied, I received a reply that clothing had been distributed in industrial centres only. I ask the Assistant Minister for Defence to inquire into this policy, and, if possible, instruct that clothing be sent to country centres also ",9

9,Mr LYONS,DLSTBIBUTTON OF SUBFLUS MILITARY,"In most of the States such councils already exist, and the Commonwealth will have the right to pressed nominate two representatives to serve each. In New South Wales the Comoperations monwealth Government will not be able to co-operate in that way with the State Government. As only Commonwealth Cabinet at an early date? money is to be expended in that State, the council to be appointed there will represent the Commonwealth alone. Probably the council will consist of five members, whose duty will be to investigate is proposed. proposals for the expenditure of the grant, but the personnel has not yet been decided.",10

20,Mr JAMES,REPUDIATI ON OF,"On the 27th April the Treasurer (Mr Bruce) stated that Great Britain had never repudiated a debt to another nation. I draw his to the following statement published in The Worlds Work of March, GKEAT BIMTAI.V IX DEB T TO ITALY . One of the by-products of the discussion European indebtedness to America has been discovery of repudiated debts in certain States. No one has so far asserted the Federal Government has ever ignored its obligations, but particular sins of the States, especially those, of the south during the reconstruction era, have been brought to our attention, especially by writers in the British press. Why should America be so harsh to Europe when we have many claims outstanding against us? But it appears that there is a 3tain on the British shield as well as upon that of South Carolina and other American commonwealths. The adroit Italian intellect has uncovered it. It appears that Edward III . of England borrowed one million florins from Florence to finance his French wars, and that the debt has never been paid.",10
21,Mr SPEAKER,REPUDIATI ON OF,"Order ! On several the Chair has drawn attention ? to the irregularity of prefacing questions by reading long extracts from newspapers. Honourable members are not permitted to make comments or statements when asking questions; an.irregular debate might be initiated by the reading of extracts of a propagandist nature. If honourable members must use newspaper statements as the basis of questions, such statements should be summarized as briefly as possible. "" Mr JAMES - The statement has been made that Great Britain has never repudiated a debt, but the journal from which I have quoted has drawn attention to a debt that has never been paid. How, then, does the right honourable gentleman reconcile his statement that Great Britain has never repudiated a debt with the passage that I have quoted? It is stated that at 2$ per cent, compouud interest this unpaid debt has now accumulated to a sum which would liquidate Italy's debt to England, and the whole of the debts of the European nations to America.",10
22,Mr GUY,REPUDIATI ON OF,I submit that it is not comoetent for an honourable member to ask a question based on a newspaper reportj nn.ess he can vouch for its accuracy.,11
23,Mr SPEAKER,REPUDIATI ON OF,"On that point many i nd varying rulings have been gtven. It i,; the parliamentary practice to require honourable members to vouch for the accuracy of the newspaper reports on which they base questions, but in tlfe majority of cases, of course, it is impossible to give that assurance.",11
24,Mr BRUCE,REPUDIATI ON OF,"The passage which the honourable member for Hunter (Mr. James) has just read from an American' magazine, merely confirms what I said the other night as to the honour and integrity of Great Britain. In endeavouring to show that Great Britain has acted in regard to her creditors as discreditably as certain of the American States, all the writer could do was to go back nearly 600 years to the daya of Edward III . , when, it is alleged, the King borrowed money from the Republic of Florence, a State which no longer exists. I remind the honourable member that there was then no "" Great B r it a in "" ; it was centuries later that the United Kingdom came iuto existence. It is regrettable shat the honourable gentleman should try to support unfounded charges as to lack of integrity on the part of Great Britain, and give countenance to inaccurate and ludicrous statements.

The commission shall appoint a general and such other officers and such servants as it thinks necessary. (2.) The salaries payable to the general manager and the next (fix most highly paid executive officers of the commission shall be subject to the approval of the Minister. (3.) Officers and servants appointed by the commission shall not be subject to the provisions of the Commonwealth Public Service Act but shall be subject to such conditions (includiug tenure of office) as are deterduring any mined by the commission.,15
66,Dr EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Oowper) [11.13]. - I move That sub-clause 1 be omitted with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following:"" A general manager shall be appointed by the Governor General, shall hold office for a period not exceeding five years, and shall be eligible for re-appointment."" At a later stage I also intend to move that, in place of sub-clause 2, a provision be inserted that the general manager shall be entitled to remuneration by way of salary at such rates as are fixed by the Governor General. It was admitted last night by the Postmaster-General (Mr. Fenton) that the greatest responsibility in connection with the new form of control of broadcasting would fall upon'the shoulders of the general manager, and, in this circumstance, it is essential that we shall take every care that the best man available is appointed. I should not have been so anxious to move this amendment had the proposal I made last night been agreed to, for that would have allowed of the widest possible choice in the selection of the general manager.",15
67,Mr ROSEVEAR,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,Does not the bill provide that the appointment of the general manager shall be subject to the approval of the Minister?,16
68,Dr EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"It does, but I desire that the Government itself shall make the appointment.",16
69,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,What the difference in effect between the two proposals ?,16
70,Dr EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"In one case the appointment will be made by the board, and the Minister will merely have a power of veto, while in the other case the Government will make the appointment, and will have the power of initiative. In the early stages of this new system of control - probabl y during the next few weekswe shall have a board of absolutely inexperienced persons, and it is, therefore, highly desirable that the Government shall take the full responsibility for the appointment of the man upon whom will rest the main responsibility.",16
71,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Swan) [11.15] - I am opposed to the amendment. If we going to appoint this commission to do the job why should we tie its hands? first I favoured an amendment of the clause to provide that the action of the commission should be subject to the fit approval of the Governor General, but after consideration I thought that inadthey visable; that it would be Aviser to leave the appointment to the commission itself. The responsibility of carrying out this important task will be on the commission, and it would be most improper to subject that body to political - control. Already it is provided that the salaries to be paid to the general manager and certain others are to be approved by the Minister. I should prefer to see the words "" Governor General "" substituted for "" Minister "". It is well that we should specify exactly what is desired. I reiterate that it would be most unwise, after, appointing the commission to do the job, to tie its hands and allow the Government to step in and make this appointment.",16
72,Mr FORDE,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Capricornia) [11.17] - I support the amendment. It is only reasonable that the Federal Ministry should appoint the general manager. The success of the broadcasting commission will depend largely upon the sort of person selected to act as general manager, particularly as the Government appears to have the idea that the members of the broadcasting commission will be in a position similar to that occupied by the board of directors of an insurance company. Apparently members of the commission will meet only once a month or is once every two months, and the executive work will be ,in the care of the general manager. The right honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) rightly pointed out that the federal Minister appoints the Governor and the Deputy Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, two officials who perform work that is infinitely greater than that which will be 7 allocated to the general manager of the broadcasting commission.",16
73,Mr HUTCHIN,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Does the honourable member suggest that the Government should terminate, as well as make, the appointment of the general manager ?",16
74,Mr FORDE,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"-The five-year period suggested by the right honourable member for Cowper provides a safeguard in that are respect. Presumably members of the Federal Cabinet represent the best brains At in the party that is in power. Surely they can be relied upon to make a wise selection. If they cannot, they are not for the jobs that they occupy. Although they may not be broadcasting experts, will have the guidance of the Director-General of Posts and Telegraphs, and other technical officers. The Postmaster General intimated last night that already there are hundreds of applicants for these positions. What guarantee have we that the members of the commission will make a wiser choice of the general manager than will the Federal Ministry, with the advice that is at its disposal? The amendment is a reasonable one, and I hope that it will be carried.",16
75,Mr ARCHDALE PARKHILL,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Warringah-Minister for the Interior) [11.20] - I suggest that the interests of the community are amply safeguarded by the present wording of the clause. We have decided that a commission shall be appointed to control broadcasting, also that there shall be a general manager and competent staff to carry out the technical details of the scheme. The two bodies appear to me to be quite separate. It is especially desirable that the general manager and staff should be thoroughly competent, and this clause provides that the members of the commission shall cast about for the very best brains available for the executive positions.

78,Mr RIORDAN,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Kennedy) [11.25] The amendment moved by the right honzation. orable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) conclusively proves his inconsistency. Throughout, the endeavour has been to free the Australian Broadcasting Commission from political control. The bill was temporarily withdrawn last does. March because it savoured too much of political control. Re-adjustments made, and the Minister was deprived of many of the powers that previously were allotted to him. Now the right honorwho able member for Cowper desires that, after an efficient body of men has been selected and paid high salaries to act as the Australian Broadcasting Commission, they are not to be deemed competent to select a general manager; the Minister or parliamentary machine must do that for them. Yet I must congratulate the right honourable member for Cowper on seeing the light. Gradually he is coming round to our point of view, and shortly he will make the statement that he believes in the nationalization of this and other great public services. Although of a conservative disposition, he has a secret hankering for nationalization, but he lacks the courage of his convictions. This party does stand for nationalization, and it does not attempt to humbug and mislead the people on the issue. The amendment involves the principle of political interference. The right honourable member for Cowper cannot have it both ways. He must either stand for national control or non-interference, and give the commission full power to select its staff. No man with an independent spirit would act as chairman of the commission if he were dictated to by a political party. I contend that we should not interfere with the that they activities of the board. The country is calling out for economy, and this Government was appointed to put such a policy into effect. Now, after five commissioners at substantial salaries to conduct broadcasting, it proposes to appoint a general manager and six senior officers at salaries which his are not disclosed. My experience of act government departments is that when an officer is placed in charge of a new department he has a staff of twelve or is more around him within three mouths.",17

I contend that Minister should have control so as to enable thi6 Parliament to have some say regarding the appointments to, and the building up of, another government partment. It is strange that the Governlines. ment should now be making appointments when it is using every endeavour to dismiss officers from the Public Service. My experience is that governments commission ? generally appoint to any high positions that are vacant officers holding political views to theirs, regardless altogether of ability or capacity to fill office. The Government's attitude to this bill is as inconsistent as its attitude the policy of preference to returned soldiers.

That matter was thrashed out last night, when it was decided to abolish ministerial control. In view of that decision it right that the commission should appoint its own officers. If that were not so, what would be the position if the general manager came into conflict with the commission on a particular line of be policy? If the general manager had the right of appeal to the Minister the compromission would have absolutely no control. We should avoid auy possibility of a such deadlock occurring between the commisThe amendment, if carried, would violate the first principle of business. If broadcasting is to be a success, the commission must have absolute control of its officers. In turn the general manager should select the his own staff. If the Government interferes - in any of these matters the staff will become disorganized and inefficient. The staff must be highly efficient if this degreat industry is to develop on proper",18

93,Mr LANE,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,Of course that officer may be the most efficient in the world. I have heard that he is able to impress upon every Minister with whom he comes into contact that he is' the only man capable of carrying out any special job.

94,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Maribyrnong-Post master-General) [11.42] - I cannot accept the amendment of the right honourable member for Oowper (Dr Earle Page). His proposal is revolutionary, because the intention of the amendment is that the Governor General shall appoint a general manager for a term not exceeding five years. I agree with the contention of the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory). If we are to repose confidence and responsibility in the commission surely we should allow it to select the staff which is to conduct broadcasting operations. If that responsibility is taken out of the hands of the commission, and conflict arises between that body and the general manager, it will say that it is responsible for the appointment. The British legislation provides that the chief executive officer shall be called the Director-General, and that the first Director General shall be John Charles ""Walsall Reith.",19
95,Dr EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,I have already suggested that the actual name of the Director-General should appear in the bill.,19
96,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"That gentleman was selected because the British Broadcasting Corporation was taking over from the broadcasting companies. This bill provides for similar action in Australia. I do not say that we sball follow entirely the example of the British Government. The British Broadcasting Corporation is given power to appoint such officers and s,taff as it may think fit. Although the Director-General was appointed by the British Government, the British Broadcasting Corporation has the power to dispense at any time with his services.",19

98,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"The British Broadcasting Corporation may dispense with the services of the Director-General, although the appointment was made by the British Goverument itself. We are following a wise example when we pursue the same policy as was adopted in Great Britain. I cannot accept the amendment of the honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page), and I hope that the committee will speedily pass this clause. I do not wish to rush the consideration of the bill, but I remind honourable members that we are now within t.wo months of the time when the commission will have to take control of the A class stations. . Mr Rosevear (Dalley) [11.46] With all due respect to the Minister, who desires to press on with the bill I , and those associated with me, are compelled to remind him that we are opposed to the appointment of any commission at all. If we are unable to defeat that proposal, at least we desire that as much control as possible may be left in the bauds of the executive officers of the Government of the day. There seems to me to be nothing inconsistent between the amendment of the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page), and clause 5 of the bill, not which gives the commission authority to take charge of the general administration o* the act. If the Goverument of the day is not to be trusted to appoint the general manager, how better can it be trusted.to appoint the commission itself? If it is to be taken for granted that a general manager appointed by the Government must be an unsuitable person, it follows that those appointed by the Government as members of the commission are also likely to be unsuitable persons. The bill at present provides that the commission may "" appoint a general manager, and such other officers and servants as it thinks ' necessary, but it then goes on to say that the Minister must approve of the salaries paid. If the Government has to do the paying, it should have the say as to who is to be appointed.",19

I should be prepared to amend sub-section 2, which gives the Minister the power to review the salaries proposed by the commission. In this respect I find myself in agreement with the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Riordan). Some honourable members appear to be overlooking the basic fact, that the general manager is to be the '--Tvant of the commission, and it will be his duty to carry into executive effect the policy decided upon by the commission. If that is not to be the procedure, why appoint a commission at all? For my part, I should not object very strongly to the elimination of the commission, but if there is to he one, then the general manager must be subject to it.  manager if there were no commission?",19

I desire to emphasize the possibility of a serious clash between the commission and the general manager if the commission is not to be allowed to choose its own manager. That is not merely an hypothesis; it is a grave possibility. The Commonwealth Bank has been cited as an institution in regard to which the same policy was followed as is advocated by the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr .Earle Page), but I remind honourable members that if there has been no conflict between the board and the Governor, an that case, it has been, not. because of manner of the appointment, but. in spite of it.",20

104,Mr STEWART,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"The proposal of the Government in this instance follows ordinary commercial procedure, and, therefore, meets with my approval. If it. is desired to provide the commission with an excuse should its policy fail, or should it make mistakes, no better way could be chosen than to deprive the commission of the appointment of its own officers. I urge the committee to give to the commission the fullest power over the appointment of its staff.  support the amendment. It seems to me that the Government proposes to depart from ordinary business procedure in the manner of these appointments, and in this respect I disagree with the last speaker. In the commercial world it is the principals in any concern who appoint both the manager and the board of directors. In the case of an ordinary joint stock'company the principals are the shareholders. In the case we are considering the principals are the public, whose power is vested in this Parliament. In a business concern the manager is the responsible person, while the board of directors is appointed to safeguard the interests of the principals, that is, the shareholders. The general manager to be appointed in connection with broadcasting control should possess the highest qualifications, and a ful l knowledge of all the phases of the undertaking. We should then appoint a reputable directorate to oversee his operations, and to receive from him reports of hia activities, either'daily, weekly or fortnightly, as the case may be. I , myself, have been manager of a company, and I was the responsible person. The principals, that is, the shareholders, appointed me, and they also appointed the directorate. For every board meeting I had to prepare certain recommendations, which I subthe mitted to the directors for their approval.",20
105,Mr GIBSON,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"But it was the directors who appointed you.  pany is first formed the shareholders appoint both the manager and the directorate. I believe that it would be an improper and wrong procedure to appoint a commission, and allow that commission to select a general manager. Mr E. J. HARRISON (Wentworth) [11.56] - The arguments which we have just heard regarding the application of business principles convinces me that it is high time that persons with business training took charge of the biggest business in this country, namely, the National Parliament. As a matter of fact, it would outrage all business principles to appoint a general manager and then appoint a board of directors to conflict with him. I support this clause because I feel that if the Government attempts to appoint a general manager and set him up in opposition to the commission, it will be asking for trouble. The honourable member for Capricornia (Mr. Forde) got tied up in the same way when he stated that the board of an insurance company left the whole of the business management of the concern to the general manager. I agree with him in that, but, at the same time, it is the directorate who appoint the general manager, and they exercise a full measure of control over him. There is no higher authority than the board of directors in the ordinary management of the business, and the , board has full authority over the engagement and dismissal of staff.",20
106,Mr FORDE,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"The shareholders appoint the board of directors. Mr E. J. HARRISON - That is true, and this Parliament is in the same position in respect to broadcasting as the shareholders are in respect to their company. We shall appoint a board of directors, and that board will appoint a suitable general manager. I do not believe that the Minister should have the right to review the salaries which the commission decides to pay to its general manager and other officers. If , however, it is determined to allow this authority, the bill should be so amended as to vest the .power in the hands of the Governor General in Council rather than in the hands of the Minister. It will be objected, of course, that this means the same thing, but should there ever be a Minister in charge who is not a suitable person to overlook the activities of a commission consisting of reputable business men, the Governor General would probably take notice of the representations made to him by the members of the commission.",21
107,Mr JAMES,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Hunter) [12.01 - I support the amendment moved by the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page). I am somewhat of the opinion of the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Riordan),'that in all probability the amendment conflicts with clause 5, which was amended to prevent any miuisterial direction over the general administration of broadcasting. everything depends on the interpretation of the words, ""general administration"". Lawyers may read into their meaning something which was not the intention of the framers of this legislation. Broadeasting is a national utility, and as such should be controlled by the Government of the day. Listeners-in who provide the wherewithal to finance this venture should have some measure of protection, but they will not have it. under commission control. I am opposed to the appointment of a commission, but now that the committee has accepted the principle of commission control, like the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Rosevear), I want to get the best possible for those who pay the piper, and who should have some say in calling the tunes they get over the wireless. Under commission control, what redress will they have? If a member of Parliament receives a protest from a constituent, and makes representations to the responsible Minister, he will receive the stereotyped reply, "" As the prescribed authority reports adversely, I regret that the request cannot be granted"". The Minister should be the prescribed authority. The right honourable member for Cowper is to be complimented on his amendment, because it would provide at least some control by this Parliament over appointees, and enable this Parliament to criticize the Minister if the per-sons selected were not fit to occupy their positions. As the bill stands, we do not know who are to be appointed. We have no guarantee that Eric Campbell or "" De Goat"" may not be appointed, or that New Guard concerts may not be broadcast contrary to the wishes of listenersin. Appointment of the general manager by the Governor General is the proper method to adopt, and I trust that ministerial control will be re-inserted in the bill.",21
108,Mr HOLMAN,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Martin) [12.41 - Ordi narily, I should be satisfied to follow the guidance of the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) on this bill, because it was clear from the address he delivered yesterday that he has made a close^study of the subject; but I cannot help thinking that the amendment he has now proposed involves a departure from, But not perhaps business principles exactly, but from administrative principles. I do not think' that business principles should dominate the control of broadcasting provided for in this measure. I share the disappointment of the right honourable member that we have not received the information we should have as to the proposed personnel of the broadcasting commission; but the chamber has already determined that this enterprise shall be conducted by a commission which is not subject to ministerial control. If the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr. Riordan) will permit me to say so, I think that broadcasting can be conducted as a national, enterprise with safety, provided that it not subjected to the eccentricities of political management. That is the policy that has been adopted. The committee has determined to set up an independent commission, which will be a sort of buffer, to prevent infliction upon an inoJfending public of the aesthetic and political ideas of members of Parliament and their friends. Surely the right honourable member for Cowper does not desire to bring in by a side door what has already been shut out at the front door. Apart from the possibility of conflict between the commission and a general manager independent of the commission, appointed by Ministers, and naturally looking to those who have appointed him for approval, there is this objection to what is proposed, that the appointment of a general manager by the Government brings back a certain element of political control.",21
109,Mr JAMES,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Why should the fixing of salaries be under political control ? Mr HOLMA.W - There is some force in the question. The one thing may appear to cover the other, but does not necessarily do so. The Minister may desire to safeguard economy. The public enterprises of Australia which have succeeded have, with two or three minor exceptions, been those which have been placed under the control of independent commissions. That system was begun many years ago in New South Wales in the days of Sir Henry Parkes, who appointed an independent commission to control the railways of the State.",22
110,Dr EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"The State Railways Commissioners are practically in a posihim, tion like that of the general manager of the proposed broadcasting service. They are full-time officers, and are intimately associated with the actual administration and management of the concerns they to the commission. control. Mr HdLMAN - That is so. But the purpose of appointing independent missions is to ensure that control shall be consistent and reasonable.  appoint the railways commissioners of State?",22
111,Mr HOLMAN,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Yet , but the purpose of appointing a railway, a broadcasting, or any other commission is to ensure that the policy dominating the enterprise affected shall be consistent and coherent over a loug period, and protected from the pressure ofmembers of Parliament, or members' constituents with axes to grind, exercising its best judgment in the interests of the enterprise entrusted to it.",22
112,Mr ROSEVEAR,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Does the honourable member contend that a coherent policy can be followed by part-time commissioners with no insistence upon their attendances ? Mr HOLMAJf - I am sure that the policy of such a concern as the Australian Labour Party is consistent under the control of part-time members. In any case, the difficulty to which the honourable member has drawn attention is a mechanical one, which need not be exaggerated. A railways commission and a broadcasting commission have similar functions to perform. It is true that commissions must be appointed by the Government; but, once appointed, there should be no interference with them by the Government, or even by Parliament, unless further legislation should be necessary, or something extraordinary should occur. In such circumstances, public enterprises in Australia have an excellent chance of succeeding, and many have succeeded, as the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Riordan) would be the first to acknowledge. We give the broadcasting enterprise a chance of succeeding by the appointment of such a commission. I wish that the Minister could have given us yesterday further assurances about the personnel of the commission; but, as he was not able to do so, we must place our confidence in and believe that he will not take any step likely to jeopardize the success of this measure. We must trust him to get the best commission possible in the circumstances, and must then leave all matters Regarding most of the features of this bill, I am entirely with the right honorcomable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page), but the last shreds of authority, and all the protection which is now left to the commission, would disappear if his a proposal were adopted, and the general manager were to he appointed by the Government. Political influences could be brought to bear through the Government upon the manager, and all manners of things disapproved of by the commission might be insisted on as the result of direct political control, which, is the very thing which the committee wishes to prevent.",22
113,Dr EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Cbwper) [12.18]. - A good deal of the discussion on this particular matter has been based on theoretical assumption. It is suggested that, if the general manager were appointed by the Government of the day, the commission would be deprived of power; that it would not be able to function, and that the control of broadcasting would be lacking in business principles. But, when the British Broadcasting Corporation was brought into being, the British Parliament deliberately adopted the principle I am now recommending, by appointing, not only a board of governors to lay down a general policy, but also the director-general, and naming him in the bill. That system has now been in force in England for seven years, with the result that the British broadcasting system is one of the best in the world. Yet we are assured today that the same method of appointment would result in general chaos and disturbance. Mr HOL M AN - Was it not a fact, however, that the successor to the British director-general was to be nominated by the commission?",23
114,Dr EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"I have already said that I would be satisfied with the first appointment by the Government, because, in my opinion, it is better to select a suitable man than a freshlyappointed commission, especially one appointed under the conditions under which we are to appoint this.",23
115,Mr HUTCHINSON,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"The appointment may be "" cooked.""",23

122,Dr EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"We are within two months of transferring the control of broadcasting to a commission, and if the Government has not in mind the men who will, be appointed to the commission, and to the position of general manager, God help the service. We have for our guidance the example of the Commonwealth Bank Board, which has proved the most satisfactory government instrumentality in Australia. For the last eight years the bank has been under a system of coutrol identical with what I am proposing for broadcasting; in fact, my amendment is taken verbatim from the Commonwealth Bank Act. I am sorry that provision was not made in clause 1 for the appointment of a director-general to form a liaison between the commission and the Government. Obviously, the general manager must attend any meeting of the commission if its business is to be conducted satisfactorily. This Parliament is the board of directors for the shareholders of Australia. The commissioners will simply be the nominees of Parliament, and, therefore, provision should be made for control to some extent by the Government of the details of fitted management. I am not propounding an untried theory; this system has emerged triumphantly from the test of practical experience in connection with the British Broadcasting Corporation and the Commonwealth Bank Board. Reference has been made to the system of management in connection with railways and shippiug. I remind the committee that railways commissioners, and the members of the Shipping Board are full-time managing directors appointed by the Government. But for the control of broadcasting the Government proposes a half-time commission, inadequately paid, which is to meet periodically to determine broadcasting policy. The man who will have the responsibility of implementing^that policy will not be answerable to this Parliament. This committee will be recreant to its duty if it does not alter that; and if my amendment is defeated I shall move a subsequent one, that the appointment, of the general manager must be subject to the approval of the Government. That at least is essential.",23
123,Mr HUTCHINSON,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Indi) [12.22] The majority of honourable members have declared against political control in connection with broadcasting, and I am surprised, therefore, that the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) should propose an amendment which will involve even a small measure of control by this Parliament. If the general manager were appointed by the Government, his actions would be subject to criticism, which might effect him in the exercise of his duties, and through him influence the commission. The example of the British Broadcasting Corporation has been mentioned by the mover of the amendment, but we are not obliged to follow any precedent; our endeavour should be to improve upon what has been done elsewhere. If the commission is not absolutely free from political control we shall create serious obstacles to the tion of the best man for that work. The Postmaster-General (Mr Eenton) has declared that the commissioners should be men of ripe judgment, full knowledge, and independence. We shall get the services of the best . men available only if they are assured that they' will not be hampered by political interference.",24
124,Dr EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,Is the honourable member agreeable to wipe out the other restrictions with regard to expenses and appointments?,24
125,Mr HUTCHINSON,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"If restrictions are proposed in the bill, I see no need to add to them. The commission should have the utmost independence, but that will be impossible if the Government is to appoint the general manager. Indeed, I would like to delete the provision that the salaries to be paid to the executive officers of the commission shall be subject to the approval of the Minister failing that I would be prepared to substitute the Governor General for the Minister. In the past, desirable appointments have been prevented through ministerial interference with the salaries. To ensure the utmost harmony between the commission and the general manager, the latter should be appointed by the body whose servant he will be..",24
126,Mr SCULLIN,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Yarra) [12.27] - The bill originally drafted by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr A. Green) contained a clause similar to that now before the committee, and for that reason members of the Opposition might be expected to support the clause now; but the present Government has drastically altered the proposals of its predecessor in regard to the control of broadcasting. My government proposed a salary for the chairman of the commission, which contemplated a full-time appointment; necessarily that appointment would have been made by the Government. If that principle had been retained there would be no need for the amendment proposed by the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page). But as the commission is to be composed of part-time men whose attention will range over many fields of activity, there will not be one full-time officer appointed by the Government in charge of broadseleccasting unless the amendment is agreed to. The honourable member for Indi (Mr. Hutchinson) seemed to be astonished that anybody should suggest that Parliament should exercise control over the commission. When he has had a little more experience he will not give expression to such reactionary sentiments. The general manager is to be the only full-time officer directing broadcasting throughout the Commonwealth, and yet we are told that this Parliament should not, through the Government, have a voice in his appointment. If that is to be our policy we had better abolish. Parliaments, and hand over government to a bureaucracy. The danger of political control can be exaggerated. There is justification for the amendment which, however, would not be necessary if the chairman were to be a full-time officer as the previous Government intended. The departure from that principle has gravely weakened the control of broadcasting. I have no desire for finicky interference by any minister or government with the control of broadcasting, nor do I desire a member to be embarrassed 'by the importunities of persons who believe that their talents should be voiced over the air. But in the final resort this Parliament must have control. Broadcasting is one of the most important services of the community The commission now proposed will consist of men giving only the fag end of their time to this important work. The only permanent directing officer will he the general manager. Honourable members have spoken of the lack of harmony that might result if the general manager were appointed by the Government; but in connection with the Commonwealth Bank the Governor was so appointed. The Commonwealth Bank Board is charged with the management and control of that institution, but broadcasting does not fall within the same category as banking; it is not of the same serious importance. Would any member of this committee favour the appointment of the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank by the Board of Directors, who themselves are part-time officers? The Governor of the Commonwealth Bank is the only controlling officer of that institution who is employed on ful l time, and, therefore, he is appointed by the Government. If the chairman of the Broadcasting Commission were made a full-time officer and were appointed by the Government, I would not support the amendment.",24
127,Mr DEIN,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Lang) [12.34] - I intend to support the clause as it stands. I was somewhat impressed by the statement of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Scullin) that the position should be considered in the light of the fact that the chairman of the commission would not be a full-time officer, but whether he full or a part-time officer is immaterial. It will be the duty of the commission to see that the policy laid down is carried out, and, therefore, I contend that the commission should be charged with the responsibility of .choosing the general manager. This Parliament is providing for the appointment of a commission, because it is considered that a commission will be a more suitable body than the Parliament to formulate the broadcasting policy. The honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Riordan) mentioned that he would support the amendment, because it would result in a step nearer socialization than would be made by the clause as it stands. If a general manager is appointed by the Government, he will be likely to adopt the policy favoured by the Government. It is possible that the Go-, vernment, as well as the commission, will lay down a broadcasting policy. If the general manager owes his position to the Government, he will probably favour the policy of the Ministry, lest he may lose his job. Much will depend on the character of the government in power. If it happens to be one-tenth as bad as the Ministry now in office in New South Wales, I have doubts as to the suitability of the appointment that will be made. Mr Cleary was appointed to take charge of the railways in that State because he was considered to be the best man for the position, but he lost his job because he refused to carry out the policy of the State Government. If the general manager of the broadcasting commission were appointed by the Commonwealth Government, he might be a pliable servant in its hands, whereas if the commission made the appointment, the general manager would not be responsible to the Government.",25
128,Mr SCULLIN,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,The honourable member has no confidence in his own Government.,25
129,Mr DEIN,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"I have confidence in the present Government, but I have had experience that has taught me to have regard to the possibilities of the future. Therefore, I have no alternative but to support the clause as it stands.",25
130,Sir LITTLETON GROOM,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Darling Downs) [12.40] - I have followed the is a debate with much interest, although 1I have not previously participated in it. The right honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) drew rather a false analogy in suggesting that the members of the House are directors. The members of this Parliament are elected to legislate within their constitutional powers, to criticize acts of administrations, and make and unmake ministries, and to discuss matters of policy; but it,is hardly within the province of a Parliament to select officials and administer. This Parliament makes laws in the interests of the people of the Commonwealth, and as the listeners-in cannot be organized as a corporate body, and as broadcasting is a matter of public interest, it is advisable to establish a commission for the purpose of controlling the business of - broadcasting. The vital principle to be observed in the appointment of the commission is the prevention of political influence. Parliament cannot, of course, divest itself of its responsibility, and there must always be a Minister to answer for any legal body set up under the authority of Parliament. The bill as it stands seems to safeguard us agaiust the dangers of political interference; but ministerial responsibility must be exercised in the appointment of the commission. The government of the day will be responsible to the Parliament for the commission that is appointed. the personnel of the commission is not such as that indicated by the honourable member for Martin (Mr. llolman), this Parliament can call the Ministry to task for its failure to secure the best men available, and if it were subsequently found that the commission was not carrying out its duties satisfactorily, the Ministry would be responsible. Parliament will always retain control; but the commission, once constituted, should be free from political interference. The commission can surely be trusted to appoint the^ officers needed to carry out the service of broadcasting. Therefore, I consider that it would be wrong to make the general manager an appointee of the government of the day. That might well lead to a conflict of authority. The general manager would naturally look for the approval of his conduct to those who had appointed him, and would expect direction from them.",25
131,Mr SCULLIN,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Has that happened in connection with the control of the Commonwealth Bank Board? Sir LITTLET ON GROOM - The mere absence of evidence of conflict in that case does not remove the possibility of it. Furthermore, what guarantee have we of better appointments being made by one method than by the other? If the appointment is made by the Government, Ministers will possibly fall buck on the advice of the Public Service Commissioners, or some outside body, whereas the broadcasting commissioners will have in mind exactly the sort of person required for the work that has to be done. Therefore, I support the Government's proposal. Question-That the words proposed be omitted (Dr EARLE PAGE'S amendmately ment) stand part of the clause-put . The committee divided. (CHAIRMAN-MR .

132,Dr EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Cowper) [2.15] I move That at the end of sub-clause 1, the following words be inserted:-""subjec t to the approval of the Governor General"". My purpose is to ensure that the appointment of the general manager- I am not so much concerned about other officers of the commission-shal l be made with the approval of the Governor General. I submit the amendment because, following the decision of the committee last night, it would appear that this anaemic commission will meet only occasionally, so that practically the whole control to of national broadcasting will ultifall into the hands of the general manager, who will be a full-time official. I do not suggest that he should be appointed by the Government. An appointment so made might result in some person with ideas inimical to the general policy of the commission securing the position; but if the commission has power to make the appointment, subject to the approval of the Governor General, we may be reasonably sure that the person selected will be in sympathy with the general policy of the commission. Last night the committee decided that the control of national broadcasting should virtually be in the hands of the general manager. In these circumstances I consider it desirable that, as regards the 'appointment of general manager, the power of veto should be vested in the Government. The bill really contains no indication of policy at all. This must be determined by the general manager. ""With - the alteration of a few words the measure might just as well be regarded as one for the appointment of a milk board or an egg board. It is right that the duration of the commission should be for a definite and fixed term of years, but the Governor General should have the right of veto as regards the appointment of the general manager.",26
133,Mr LANE,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Barton [2.20] - I hope that the committee will not accept the amendment because, for all .practical purposes, the issue raised differs in no essenlisten tial particular from that which was decided by the committee this morning. An appointment "" subject to the approval of the Governor General"" means virtually an appointment by the Government. The right honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) also declares that the bill lays down no statement of policy. The function of the commission, I take it, will be to develop the policy of the existing organization, to provide adequate and comprehensive programmes, and to improve the whole broadcasting system of Australia, so as to give greater satisfaction to the people generally. Obviously, the right honourable gentleman is endeavouring, in a quiet way, to undo what was done this morning after a great expenditure of effort.",27
134,Dr EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,I regard that remark as personally offensive and absolutely unwarranted.,27
135,The CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Since the right honourable member for Cowper has taken exception to the statement, I ask the honourable member for Barton to withdraw it.",27
136,Mr LANE,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"If what I.have just said is offensive to the right honourable member for Cowper I am sorry, and I with- „ draw it. I may, however, be permitted to say that this morning, when it was suggested that he was submitting proposals to override a decision reached last night, 1 he admitted that he thought he might get it altered this morning. I feel sure, therefore, that upon reflection he will admit that what I have just said is fair criticism of his attitude.",27
137,Mr A GREEN,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Kalgoorlie) [2.25] I agree with the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page), and support his amendment. I also deprecate the tone adopted by the honourable member for Barton (Mr Lane). It is regrettable that, simply because some honourable members may in all sincerity disagree with others upon certain aspects of the Government's proposals, they should be charged with endeavouring to secure the adoption of amendments almost, identical with proposals that have already been rejected. The Minister and his supporters should realise that there is honest disagreement with the Government on this matter, and they should be prepared to to the views of the minority, even if they cannot accept the amendments submitted. This amendment is entirely different from that rejected by the committee prior to the luncheon adjournment. If an appointment made by the commission is not approved by the Governor General, the position will not be affected so far as the commission is concerned, because that body will still have the right of selection. All that the amendment means is that the person appointed shall be approved of by the Governor General, which, as we all know, means the Government.",27
138,Mr JAMES,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Hunter) [2.29] - I support the amendment'. It is a modest request, and despite what the honourable member for Barton has said, it differs entirely from the amendment submitted by the right honourable member for Cowper this morning. I remind honourable members that sub-clause 2 provides that the fixation of the salaries of the general manager and the next six senior officers shall be subject to the approval of the Minister. Is it not anomalous that honourable members raise no objection to that, but oppose the amendment of the right honourable member for Cowper? No doubt the amount of salary that will be paid depends upon the support that these executive officers are prepared to give to the Government. We know that the amendment forecast by the Minister in sub-clause 2 is on all fours with that with which we are now dealing, and to which the honourable gentleman refuses to give approval. There should be consistency in these matters, and the Minister should accept the amendment.

139,Dr EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"C o w p e r ) [ 2 . 4 2 ] Now we shall be able to test the sincerity of honourable members opposite. Throughout this debate we have heard them claim that if the commission is to be appointed it should be trusted and given an absolutely free hand. Yet it is now proposed that the fixing of the salaries to be paid to the general manager and his six senior executives shall be taken out of the hands of to the commission and placed under the of the Government. That makes The comit possible for the Government to hamstring the operations of the commission, by offering salaries that are absurdly inadequate for the jobs.

143,Mr JAMES,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,I am not attempting to block the passage of the bill. Honourable members opposite are always ready to reduce the wages of the workers. They should prove tlieir consistency by acting similarly towards other sections of the community.,28
144,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,I am not prepared to withdraw my amendment.,28
145,Mr RIORDAN,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Kennedy) [2.48] - If the Minister's amendment is carried, all control over expenditure will pass from this Parliament. We do - not know what salaries are to be paid. The Premier of every State, and the Prime Minister and the Assistant Treasurer of the Commonwealth are exerting every - effort to cut down expenditure; yet, without having auy say as to what appointments shall be made, or what salaries shall be paid, we are asked to agree to a proposal under which control over expenditure will he taken away from this Parliament. The Government will be the - custodian of the revenue collected from brbadcasting, and should not delegate to a commission its powers in regard to - expenditure. In the past we have had highly-paid officers controlling commissions, and the results have been detrimental to the best interests of Australia. I am the holder of a listener's licence, and look for the redress of any wrong to the body to whom 1 pay the fee of 24s. a year. Is it intended that the commission shall be responsible for the collection of wireless revenue? If the Minister allows - control to pass out of his hands, the commission will be able to spend the revenue it receives without any regard for the protests of those who contribute to the upkeep of wireless services. From an educational point of view, the bill is not worth' the paper on which it is printed. The arrangement of the programmes will rest with the general manager and the board. How could they be removed from office unless this Parliament were able to exercise some control over them? The right honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) claimed 'that Government members should show their consistency by supporting a proposal to take control out of the hands of the Minister. It is now sought to cover up their inconsistency by substituting the Governor General for the Minister; and that, it is pointed out, is a distinction without a difference. principle involved is identical with that to which the Government so strongly objected at an earlier stage, and its acceptance now means that the time occupied in the consideration of the bill this morning w.as wasted. The Minister has not given the committee any information as to what the effect of his proposal will be. If the position is not altered, why is it necessary to make the change? In the interest of the taxpayer, some limitation should be placed on the salaries that are to be paid. The bill should be dropped, Mr Riordan. and control of broadcasting allowed to remain where it is at the present time until our financial position improves. This will impose an additional burden on the taxpayers of the Commonwealth, who will not have any say in the expenditure, although the Government will be responsible for any losses incurred by the commission.",28
146,Mr FRANCIS,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Moreton-Assistant Minister) [2.561 - The intention of the Government, when framing this clause, was to protect the revenue by preventing the payment by the commission of the excessive salaries referred to by the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Riordan). Probably there will be in each of the States some person acting on behalf of the commission. If the salaries of the general manager and of those who conduct the operations of the commission in the six States have to be approved by the Governor General, the funds of the commission will be protected, and no excessive payments can be made. This is a proposal to ensure that the standard sei at the commencement of the commission's operations shall be by no means extravagant. The honourable member for Kennedy argued that some limitation should be placed on the amount that may be paid by way of salary, so that it may not be excessive. The amendment imposes that limitation, and I appeal to the committee to agree to it. Amendment agreed to.",29
147,Mr JAMES,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Hunter) [3.0] - I move That the following proviso be added to subclause 2:"" Provided that such salaries shall not exceed £800 in the case of the general manager The and the next six most highly paid executive officers."" There should be some limitation to the remuneration of these officers. The bill fixes the salary of the members of the commission. The chairman is to receive £500 a year, the vice-chairman £400, and the other commissioners £300. Considerable work will devolve upon the general manager, and his time is likely to be fully occupied. A salary of £S00 would be reasonable and sufficient to enable the general manager to live in comfort, taking into consideration the difficult times through which we are passing, and the ""fact that today many of our people have not the means to purchase even the bare necessaries of life.",29
148,Mr LANE,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,Did Mr Lang take those circumstances into consideration when he appointed the Transport Commission in New South Wales?,30

150,Mr LANE,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,What salary is Mr Goode receiving?,30
151,Mr JAMES,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,The honourable member has a bee in his bonnet so far as Mr Lang is concerned. I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.,30
152,Mr HOLLOWAY,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Melbourne Ports) [3.5] - There should be in the bill some direct link - between the Government the commission. The extreme view in this chamber is that private enterThe prise should have absolute freedom. The Government is anxious that the commissalaries sion shall be absolutely untrammelled, that it may carry out its work successHunter fully, but always with the idea in mind that private enterprise must be guarded. I am supporting every clause way which leaves some link between the Government and the commission, and as this clause does that to a slight degree, 1I have no wish to alter it , and shall, fore, vote for it as it stands. I voted for the previous amendment of the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page), because its object was to provide a permanent link between the Minister and the commission. I thought that wise and proper provision, and i accepted it would have been a reasonable compromise with the Government. As this clause does provide some link between the Government and the commission, I cannot understand the objection of the right honourable member for Cowper to i Dr EARLEP . U ; E - I wish to ascertain the attitude of the Government.",30

154,Mr SCULLIN,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Y a r r a ) [3.7] - There arc three points of view in respect of clause. The first is that of the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page), who does not seem to believe contention that he has put forward. 1, therefore, do not think that this committee should record a vote of the nature that he has suggested. His contention is that because the committee would not agree to the amendment' which vested control in the Minister in respect of the appointment of a general manager, the Minister should have no say in the fixing of the salary of that officer. He is undoubtedly demanding consistency from Government supporters. I agreed with his previous amendment, but, because of that, 1 must support the clause as it stands. I shall not call for a division or cast a vote merely out of pique. I support the clause as amended. The amendment after all makes no. real difference, because it merely substitutes the word, ""Governor General "" for the word "" Minister."" and One could hardly imagine the Minister acting without the concurrence of Cabinet. next question is whether there should be any safeguard as to the amount of the that the commission will pay to so its staff. The honourable member for (Mr James) has moved an amendment which, if accepted, will fix the safeamount, but that is not a sound to fix salaries, because this committee is uot in a position to determine what is equitable remuneration for the members of the staff. thereThe provision in the bill is a wise one. It does not give untrammelled power to the commission to fix the salaries of the officers: it provides that the salaries payable must be subject to approval by the Governor General. For all practical pura poses the Governor General means the f Government. I urge the committee to support the clause as printed.",30
155,Dr EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Cowper) [3.11] Shall we be given an opportunity to vote on the sub-clause itself when this amendt . ment has been disposed of, or shall we be required to vote on the clause as a whole ?

165,Mr RIORDAN,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Kennedy) [3.28] There is no indication in this provision, which deals with the powers and beg functions of the commission, that there will be any improvement in the prothe grammes broadcast. Many country people are anxious that the broadcasting I service shall be used more extensively for educational purposes, perhaps by using the system in couutry schools. Some of musical programmes now broadcast are of little or' no educational value. Families living in the country have not the same opportunities for receiving 42 musical instruction as those in the metro16 politan area. The teachers themselves, in country districts, are not able to keep 26 abreast of current musical developments. Hundreds of thousands of pounds are AYES. paid to the Royal Academy of Music in examination fees- a fact which indicates 'the interest taken in musical training in this country. The Government should do its part to assist in this direction by seeing that dwellers in country districts are able to receive lectures and instruction on musical subjects by wireless. Even the ordinary programmes given over the wireless would be made much more interesting . and instructive if they were accompanied by suitable explanations. For instance, to the uninitiated, the song, "" Y o u tak' the High Road and I ' l l tak' the Low,"" probably means very little, because they do notknow thehistory of the song. It is much the same as if I were to go to a performance at a French theatre. It would mean NOES. nothing to me, because I would be unacquainted with the language - but, if the script of the play were put before me in English, I should be able to follow it with enjoyment. Pianoforte music appeals to me very much; but, because I have not had the advantage of a musical education, a selection from Chopin would mean little or nothing to me-unless it were properly explained. Only recently the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Nelson) told me something of the story behind the song "" When other lips and other hearts."" What would that song, without any explanation, convey to the right honourable for North Sydney (Mr. Hughes) ? Probably about as much as it would convey to me. I was told that the man who composed the music of that song was never able to publish it, because he was a beggar. On one occasion, he went to the house of a certain bank manager to for clothes. While the bank manager was out of the room getting the clothes, beggar sat down at the piano and played the music which he had composed. His benefactor, hearing the music, was greatly impressed by it, and promised to finance its publication. The beggar went out into the street, and Avas killed in an accident. That story would be of great interest to the child mind, and, in regard to music, the child mind may be of any age from five to 55. Let us consider the position of a boundary rider living 011 the borders of the Northern Territory. He may have a family of eight or ten, and be desirous of giA'ing them something in the nature of a musical education. He purchases a wireless set, pays his licence-fee, and has a right to expect instruction as well as amusement from the programmes he is able to pick up. His children are as much entitled to the benefits of a musical education as are those living in the cities. vision should be made on the broadcasting programmes for lectures and instruction on musical and other educational subjects for the benefit of country dwellers. A direction to this effect might, of course, be regarded as interfering with the authority of the commission, which will probably be composed of city men chosen for political purposes. In my opinion, there should be on that commission a representative of the country districts, one who knows the requirements of those living in the country, and Avho will see that they get some return for their money. The Government might even go so far as to make wireless sets available to country residents, for which they Avill merely have to pay rent. This Would be at least some compensation to them for their isolation. A close acquaintance of mine is an old blind pensioner Avho has a little crystal set for which he pays a licence-fee of 24s. a year. He was a pioneer of the mining industry. ""What service does he get now in the mornings? Nothing but headlines from the newspapers-n o lectures. En my opinion the blind should be given free licences to listen in. I repeat that the story behind the song or musical selecing tion should be given. Country residents should have the opportunity to learn something more than the prices of their potatoes or their wool, important though that information undoubtedly is to them.",32

167,Mr LYONS,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Wilmot-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [3.44] - I move That the House do now adjourn. The committee stage on the Australian Broadcasting Commission Bill will be resumed on Tuesday, but if the Government's unemployment proposals are ready they will be introduced and the debate upon them adjourned in order to give honourable members an opportunity to consider them before proceeding with their discussion.",33
168,Mr GREGORY,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Swan) [3.45] - In Proreference to the question which I asked the other day relative to the price of poisons used for the destruction of rabbits, I should like the Prime Minister to say that an immediate investigation will be made to see Avhy these essentials are so scarce and Avhy they .cannot he supplied at a much cheaper price. The rabbit menace is assuming great proportions, not only in Western Australia, but in other parts of the Commonwealth, and the price asked for poisons is, to my mind, somewhat in the nature of barefaced robbery.",33
169,Mr MAKIN,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Hindmarsh) [3.47] - I should like the Postmaster-General to take into consideration the position of persons in receipt of invalid pensions who are not able to pay the listeners'-in licence fee entitling them to the privilege of enjoying the reception of music over the wireless. We all know that in some institutions where these invalids find shelter the provision of Avireless is a wonderful help to them in their moments of affliction. To listen in on a Avireless set would be an equally great source of comfort to others who are living in private homes, Avhose lack of means preAents them from enjoyr it. I should like the Minister to go into the matter carefully and see if he can extend to those persons living in private homes the privilege of relieving the serious monotony which their invalidity entails by permitting them to have free listeners'-in licences. Mr 'FENTON (Maribyrnong-Post master-General) [3.48] - I agree with. practically everything the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin) has said, and I hope to be in a position to indicate what assistance is likely to be afforded to those who have been deprived of their sight. In this connection I pay a tribute to the officers of the Postal Department who devote their week-ends and Saturday afternoons to the making of wireless sets, which they install in various public institutions. I cannot say that I would go the whole length suggested by the .honourable member- I am hopeful that the control of broadcasting will very shortly pass .into other handsbut I can assure him that the matter is being considered and that, so far as is practicable, we hope to be able to adopt his suggestion.",33
170,Mr LYONS,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Wilmot-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [3.49] - I understand that the honourable member for Swan (Mr Gregory) has placed the matter of rabbit poisons before the Minister for Trade and Customs, who has promised an investigation. I shall suggest to the Minister that the promised investigation be expedited. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 3.50 .p.m.",34
