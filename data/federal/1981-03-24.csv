The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the plan to obliterate the traditional weights and measures of this country does not have the support of the people. That the change is causing spread, serious and costly problems, That the compulsory tactics being used to force the change are a violation of all democratic principles. Your petitioners therefore pray: That the Metric Conversion the people are free to utilize whichever system they prefer and so enable the return to imperial weights and measures wher­ ever the people so desire; That weather reporting be the Metric Conversion Act; , That the Australian Government take urgent steps to cause the traditional mile units to be restored to our highways; That the Australian Government request the State Govern­ ments to procure that the imperial and metric systems be taught together in schools.

Plant Breeders' Rights To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The hum hie pet­ ition of the undersigned respectfully itioners are gravely concerned lation regarding plant variety rights. '1 The reasons are as follows: I . We believe it would transfer control, the key aspect of agriculture in this country, to overseas interests not re­ sponsible to the Australian Government. 2. We believe it would restrict the growing and trading of many seeds. 3. We believe it would cause a decline in the genetic diver­ PETITIONS sity of crops making them more subject to destruction by pests and diseases. 4. We believe thorough investigation of the effect of simi liar legislation overseas and a full public debate is required before any decision is made. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that Parliament re­ frains from enacting any legislation on Plant Variety Rights. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.

Unemployment Benefit To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives of the Australian Parliament in Canberra assembled. The petition of certain citizens respectfully showeth: Act be repealed to ensure that That the right to work without discrimination on any ground including, inter alia, discrimination on grounds of race, ethnic origin, pregnancy, marital status, sex and/or sexual preference, is a fundamental human right; and as it was prior to the passing of That it is both the duty and the responsibility of society to fully support those denied work and therefore those who are unemployed as a result of society's inability to provide full paid employment should be guaranteed an adequate income without discrimination on any ground, including inter alia dis­ crimination on grounds of race, ethnic origin, marital status, sex and/or sexual preference, or pregnancy. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that appropriate and adequate laws be formulated and passed to outlaw discrimination in Commonwealth employ­ ment, in employment of persons by statutory bodies and quasi-governmental organisations, in employment of individ­ uals under federal awards, and in employment of all persons in areas over which Commonwealth and Australian Capital Territory equal opportunity legislation should have jurisdic­ tion; and showeth that your pet­ That appropriate laws be formulated and passed to outlaw at the prospect of any legis­ discrimination in the provision of unemployment benefits to all persons without regard to race, ethnic origin, marital status and/or sex.

The humble pet­ ition of the undersigned shows that your petitioners are gravely concerned at the prospect of the proposed Plant Breeders Rights Legislation. The reasons are as follows: 1 . P.B.R. will encourage the take-over of seed companies by chemical companies. 2. Will link available varieties to a particular package of agricultural fertilizers and pesticides. 3. WiII reduce genetic diversity in seed lines for sale. We believe this legislation referendum held before a final decision is made. Your petitioners, therefore, humbly request that Parlia­ ment take positive action as soon as possible to arrest the im­ plementation of such legislation. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Kerin. Petition received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. We, the under­ signed citizens of the Commonwealth, do humbly pray that the Commonwealth Government: I . Note that legislatio� establishing plant breeders' rights in other countries !las had a. Virtual monopoly control into the hands of a few large international corporations seeking to profit from the exclusive rights over plant genetic materials created by such legislation. b. The varieties of seeds available have been restricted mainly to hybrids which will not reproduce truly and will not grow without the aid of artificial fertilizers pesticides, thus maximising corporate profits without regard for the interests of growers and consumers. c. The genetic diversity of crops has been eroded, render­ ing them vulnerable to disease and other environmental threats. 2. Recognize that maintenance of the genetic diversity of plant varieties is crucial to Australian nation, and take all necessary steps to preserve and promote such genetic diversity vent exclusive control over plant genetic materials from faIl­ ing into private hands. 3. Defend the vital interests deners, independent Australian seed companies and their em­ ployees, and consumers of Australian farm and garden pro­ duce, by rejecting any proposal to legislate for the establishment of plant breeders' rights in Australia.

Human Rights Legislation To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: We express our grave concern at the terms of the Human Plant Breeders' Rights Rights Commission Bill 1 979 and the Racial Discrimination Amendment BiIl l979. We note that strong opposition to the form of these Bills was expressed by the majority of our elected Senators. We note that the Bills only escaped amendment because a number of our elected Senators who opposed the Bills could not be in the chamber when the crucial votes were taken. We note that the Human Rights Commission Bill is totally inadequate for a number of reasons which include the fact that the Bill does not permit the Commission to investigate breaches of human rights which occur under State law, e.g. Queensland or Wcstern Australia. Further there is no power to prosecute violations of human rights. We note that the Racial Discrimination Amendment Bill should be publicly debated and a 1979 is also gravely deficient in a number of respects including the fact that the Commissioner for Community Relations loses his independence, powers a�d staff. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Legis­ lature will listen to the voices of the Aboriginal and Ethnic communities, women and other disadvantaged groups, who are opposing these Bills in their present form. We call upon the Legislature to ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Righ·ts. But most importantly in the name of Democracy we call upon the Legislature to send the proposed legi�lation back to the Senate so that all our Plant Breeders' Rights elected Senators are able to be present and vote on the legislation.

The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that the procedures used to de­ termine eligibility for unemployment benefit (Work Test) are and considered inappropriate in times of high unemployment. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that Parliament take note of the Norgard Review of the Commonwealth Em­ ployment Service and the Myer Inquiry into the Administra­ tion of Unemployment Benefit and make the necessary legis­ lative changes to repeal the amended ""Work Test"" procedures.

The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That continued use of animal ingredients in cosmetic prod­ ucts, and the inhumane use of animals in scientific research for cosmetic products is abhorrent and barbaric. That the Industries Assistance Commission, because of the Commission's terms of reference, seems unable to impose any regulation or recommend any regulation which might restrict the activities of the Cosmetic Companies which produce cos­ metics in which animal ingredients have been used, or for which animals were subjected to research. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House of Representatives will: Legislate to require comprehensive cosmetics and toilet preparations to indicate: ( 1 ) whether a product If so, the ingredient and source should be indicated. (2) whether the research and development of that prod­ uct or any of its ingredients involved experimen­ tation on animals. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Humphreys.

That sandmining on Moreton Island poses a threat to the natural ecology or environment. 2. That Moreton Island is included on the interim list of the Australian Heritage Commission, and the Federal Govern­ ment is urged and indeed it must, under the Australian Heri­ tage Commission Act 1975, take into consideration the pro­ tection of the island. 3. That the Queensland Government has recently renewed a further mining lease against the advice of conservationists.

And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Jull. Petition received. Taxation: Child Care Expenses To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of Parliament assembled in the House of Representatives. The humble pet­ ition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that. Taxpayers who incur child-care expenses in order to earn income should be able to have those expenses exempt from in­ come taxation in the same way as other taxpayers can deduct business expenses from their assessable income.

NA MINING PROJECTS: EXPENDITURE ON",18
6,Mr HURFORD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I direct my question to the Minister for Industry and Commerce. Is it a fact that reports of his own Department and also the Department of Trade and Resources indicate that a significant proportion of capital expenditure on mining projects will be spent on imports? For in­ stance, is it a fact that one of these reports shows that such predominantly foreign-owned projects as the Alumax and Utah projects will be 50 per cent supplied from overseas while projects with greater Australian ownership source more equip­ ment locally? Does this demonstrate the import­ ance of having more Australian involvement in these potentially valuable enterprises as well as government influence to ensure that their benefits are spread to other Australians by equipment being sourced here, thus creating jobs in Australia instead of more profits being taken overseas? What action will the Government take to rectify this situation?",18
7,Sir PHILLIP LYNCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The point made by the honourable gentleman is certainly well taken. He can be well assured that the areas in which he has indicated possible apprehension are very much in the Government's mind in its overall in­ dustrial development policies, particularly with respect to resource development. Subject to vary­ ing qualifications, the figure which has been put down for the extent of resource development be­ fore Australia during the years ahead presently stands at about $33 billion. Outside the direct im­ pact which that resource development will have for the working of the Australian economy, there will be, as I am sure the honourable gentleman that air fares to and from that will understand, very significant spin-off effects for Australian manufacturing industry. In fact 70 MINING RIGHTS per cent of this investment is likely to be spent Notice of Motion locally on plant, equipment, wages and salaries, services and infrastructure support items. This will, of course, provide many diverse oppor­ tunities for manufacturing industry, particularly the fabrication and construction material sectors, for transport and for many other service indus­ tries generating, obviously, many new jobs in manufacturing and for Australia generally. not made known to all parties; Of course, a considerable amount of the equip­ ment required in the resource development will come from overseas. That is natural, and I am sure the honourable gentleman would want the companies involved to seiect that equipment last five which is best for the projects concerned, whether that equipment is produced domestically or abroad. The honourable gentleman is very much aware of the firm guidelines which the Govern­ ment has established to maximise Australian equity in the resource development boom. NA NA EmptyHere average weekly ordinary time earnings for full time non-managerial male employees grew by 1 5.2 per cent in 1 980. Will that increase, which is substantially above the consumer price index in­ crease for the same period, have a general infla­ tionary impact especially on prices and interest rates?",18
8,Mr HOWARD,AVERAGE WEEKLY EARNINGS,"The honourable member for Barker rightly reminds the House of the quite unacceptably fast rate of growth in wages that be­ came evident when figures for increases during the December quarter were released recently. The rise in average weekly earnings has been revised upwards to 1 4 per cent and the earnings men­ tioned by the honourable gentleman rose at an even higher rate, by 1 5.2 per cent. It needs to be stated plainly that this development is one of the reasons the Government put to the Loan Council a proposal to increase the rate of interest on Aus­ tralian savings bonds. It ought to be made plain to the critics of that decision that if wages continue to rise at a rate which is inimical to the economic recovery which is so clearly taking place else­ where, the Government must respond with the tools that are available to it. One of those tools is the effective use of monetary policy. I take this opportunity to put at rest some of the nonsense that has been put around in the last few days about the effect of interest rate rises on the availability of money for housing in Australia. That is something of importance to honourable members on this, and I hope on the other, side of the House. The facts are simply that over the three months to January, lending by the major institutions-that is, building societies and banks-was 1 .2 per cent above the level of the previous three months and no less than 1 3.6 per cent above the level for the same period a year earlier. Those are the sorts of figures that ought to be kept in mind by honourable members when people charge in and suggest that the Govern­ ment's interest rate policy is having an unsatisfac­ tory, even drastic, effect on the availability of money for housing in Australia. The forces of supply and demand dictate that we, like any other borrower, have to offer competitive rates if we are to raise money. It is as simple as that. The Government does not intend to allow the critics of its monetary policy to get away with the totally false accusation that funds available for housing have dried up. The figures give the lie to that. There has been some restructuring between banks and building societies but the overall volume of funds available for housing remains at an ex­ tremely high level. RESOURCE INDUSTRIES: EFFECT ON NA",18
9,Mr FREE,BALANCE OF PAYMENTS,"Has the attention of the Treasurer been drawn to Press reports of estimates, pre­ pared by the Department of Trade and Re­ sources, of the effects of expanding resource in­ dustries on the balance of payments? Does he agree with the Department that increased infla­ tion and an appreciation of the Australian dollar are alternative responses to this expansion? Does he agree that these options would result in a 2.4 per cent increase in annual inflation or a 1 . 1 per cent annual increase in the value of the dollar, as estimated by the Department? What economic policies does he propose to pursue as an alterna­ tive to these unacceptable options?",19
10,Mr HOWARD,BALANCE OF PAYMENTS,"The economic policies that I will continue to recommend to the Government are in substance the economic policies that have been followed over the past few years with gather­ ing evidence of success. Insofar as external poli­ cies are concerned, the contribution made to the growing competitiveness of Australian industry by the management of the exchange rate in par­ ticular is something which is now very widely recognised, and it is one area of economic policy in which the wisdom of decisions taken by the Government some time ago has been vindicated with the passage of time. Quite obviously the external policies that we followed have been highly successful, as indicated by the improved volume of private capital inflow into Australia, our much healthier external posi­ tion and the fact that so far as our balance of pay­ ments is concerned, contrary to what was alleged from the other side of the House as recently as 1 2 months ago, the Government has not found it necessary to continue the very large borrowing program that was commenced in 1 977. The pre­ diction made then that that borrowing program was required to supplement a temporary shortfall in the volume of capital flowing into Australia has been demonstrated by the turn of events to be ab­ solutely correct, and is another example of the success that we have had with the economic poli­ cies we have followed. NA",19
11,Mr ROCHER,MILITARY PERSONNEL,"My question is directed to the Minister for Defence. Are certain skills possessed by military personnel deemed to be more import­ ant than others, particularly those involving specialist military technology? Does the cost of training men and women to operational levels warrant the striking and payment of graduated re­ enlistment bonuses? If so, will the magnitude of any re-enlistment bonuses reflect the cost of train­ ing replacement personnel?",19
12,Mr KILLEN,MILITARY PERSONNEL,"The short answer to the first part of the honourable gentlemen's question is yes. In general terms the pay structure of the Ser­ vices would reflect just that. I am bound to tell the honourable gentleman and the House that the re­ engagement of specialists, particularly senior non­ commissioned officers, is a matter that causes both me and the Services a great deal of concern be­ cause these highly trained and highly experienced men are, in Service terms, absolutely invaluable. I would like the honourable gentleman and the House to know that the Government is consider­ ing ways and means of possibly re-introducing a re-engagement bonus scheme which wouldMONICA",19

15,Mr HAYDEN ,MILITARY PERSONNEL,To catalogue them all would take longer than Question Time.,19
16,Mr KILLEN,MILITARY PERSONNEL,"The honourable gentleman would still be walking to Canossa. I say to the honourable gentleman, yes, we are considering re­ introducing a re-engagement bonus. As presently advised it will be done on a selective basis to ensure that the more valued skills are retained. I will keep the honourable gentleman and the House informed. NA",19
17,Mr CHARLES,NATURAL RESOURCES,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. I refer him to a statement in the Internal Research Memorandum No. 2 prepared by the Department of Trade and Resources, which reads: . . . it has been estimated 1 960s only 2 per cent of domestic savings has been allocated to mining investment and clearly scope exists for local investors to play a more significant role in the development of Australia's natural resources. I also refer the Treasurer to a proposal to establish a resources development fund, designed to pro­ vide the Australian public with an opportunity to invest in resource developments-an Australian Labor Party proposal, but similar to one sup­ ported by the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs. In the light of these proposals, does the Government intend to introduce such a scheme? If so, will the Treasurer acknowledge that this would be another example of a Labor initiated policy being used by the coalition parties?",20
18,Mr HOWARD,NATURAL RESOURCES,"J remind the honourable member for Isaacs that when the House last met I indicated both through a statement on taxation and in response to questions that the Government was anxious to maximise the opportunities avail­ able for Australians to participate, particularly by way of investment, in resource development. I said then, and I repeat for the benefit of the House, thal one of the subjects that I believe the Commission of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System-which I imagine will be reporting to the Parliament in the course of this year-will be covering in some detail is the invest­ ment climate, particularly for small - investors in Australia. It will also study constraints on those people and, generally, those aspects of the econ­ omy that affect investment including, I imagine, taxation. The Government makes no secret of the fact that it wants to see maximum opportunities reasonably aVHilable for Australians to invest. If it has the support of the Opposition in that aspir­ ation, all the better. I would be anxious as far as possible to see a bipartisan approach to that sort of matter emerge in this House because all of us have an interest in maximising the opportunities for Australians to share in the development of our resources. I simply say to the honourable gentle­ man that, taking things in a logical sequence, we ought to see what the Campbell Committee has to say on that subject without prejudice to what other examinations the Government might wish to undertake on the subject.

19,Mr FISHER,FOOD,"Is the Minister for Primary EmptyHere Clarke to have rural marketing authorities finance a national television program to promote Australian fresh food? If so, does the Minister that in the period since the late think there is merit in such a proposal? Has Mr Russell-Clarke's previous promotional work on television been successful, and would a broader­ scale promotion campaign be beneficial?",20
20,Mr NIXON,FOOD,"Mr Russell-Clarke's efforts in advertising milk, eggs and cheese have been spec­ tacularly successful. His work with the Australian Dairy Corporation has been first class. There is no doubt statistically that advertising has yielded a great benefit to the industry. Mr Russell-Clarke called to see me last week. On the basis of the suc­ cess that he has had in the egg industry and in the dairy industry, he put to me a proposition that work of this sort ought to be spread on a wider basis to cover the fresh foods industry. There is no doubt that Mr Russell-Clarke has a high recog­ nition rate and a high acceptance rate by tele­ vision audiences. This is because he is a very cred­ ible person. He is a believable person because he tells the truth. The fact is that dairy products and eggs are good for you. If the honourable member for Adelaide were to concentrate his diet a bit more on real food and get away from eating fast foods and putting pork around the barrel he would be a much healthier person. I think Mr Russell-Clarke has a good proposition. I am having that proposition put to other primary in­ dustries that might be interested. We could talk about the grape industry-not the wine industry necessarily. Sir Phillip Lynch - What about wine?",20
21,Mr NIXON,FOOD,"Wine sells itself for some reason. I do not need to expand on that. But certainly the proposition could interest the dried fruits indus­ try, the beef industry and the lamb industry. Im­ agine what Mr Russell-Clarke could do with a barbequed lamb chop on television and how ap­ pealing such an advertisement could be. He put to me a serious proposition that all these food indus­ tries ought to come together in one big program that would have other components of interest to the viewing public. I think the project would have every element for success. NA",20
22,Mr KEATING,FORTESCUE OIL FIELD,"I refer the Prime Minister to the Government's stated policy of not imposing the crude oil levy or a resources rent tax on pro­ duction from the Fortescue oil field in Bass Strait. Given that State oil royalties are calculated on the basis of the price received by the producer, does this mean that Victorian Government royalties payable on Fortescue will be calculated on the full import parity price, presently at $30.23, rather than the existing producer price of around an average of $8 a barrel? Is this another example of a State collecting a tax for itself on a resource that is the property of the nation, particularly an off-shore resource for which constitutional con­ trol resides with the Commonwealth? What does the Government intend doing about this wellhead value question in relation to Fortescue to guaran­ tee that the nation and not just Victoria benefits from this development? Mr MALCOLM FRASERThere are quite firm arrangements between the Commonwealth Government and the State of Victoria in relation to royalties. It is a matter that the Premier has raised with me in recent times. I will be respond­ ing at the appropriate time to whatever he might want to put. I make no further comment on that. The honourable gentleman introduced a some­ what detailed and technical question. I would like to look at it so that he might get a completely pre­ cise answer to the technical points that he put. I will therefore treat the main thrust of the honour­ able gentleman's question as being on notice. PUBLIC HOSPITALS: NEW SOUTH Mr CADMANMy question is addressed to the Minister for Health. Has the New South Wales Minister for Health requested an ad­ ditional $5m from the Federal Government to be made available to fund public hospitals in his State? What is the basis of such a request? Is it justified?",20
23,Mr MACKELLAR,FORTESCUE OIL FIELD,"I have noticed, as has the honourable member, statements emanating from the New South Wales Minister for Health, Mr Stewart, relating to an alleged crisis in the hospi­ tals in that State. I was very interested in of his claim that an extra $ 1 0m was needed. He was prepared to put up $5m if the Common­ wealth was prepared to put up $5m. Naturally enough, I was very concerned about this state­ ment. I thought it may have something to do with the projected State election, and talks of hospital crises may be gilding the lily a bit. So I checked to see the state of play in respect of New South Wales hospitals. In fact, the Commonwealth has made available about $475m to the State this year which is an increase of about 1 1 .8 per cent on the funds made available in the previous year. So there is no question of a reduction of funds to hospitals in New South Wales or in any other State. I checked further because there is a system whereby States request the Commonwealth to pay one month in advance the appropriations which are due. At the present time all the requests for payment from New South Wales have been met. In fact, they are some $ 1 7m short of the ap­ propriation which is available to New South Wales. I am not quite sure why Mr Stewart needs that extra $ 1 0m if in fact the appropriations avail­ able to him and not yet claimed amount to $ 1 7m.",21
24,Mr HURFORD ,FORTESCUE OIL FIELD,Have you asked him? ',21
25,Mr MACKELLAR,FORTESCUE OIL FIELD,"Yes, I have asked him. I sent him a telex yesterday to try to get his response. The other fact that I would like to put before the House is that in 1 979 Mr Stewart got in touch with the Commonwealth and asked whether the Commonwealth would agree to New South Wales introducing outpatient charges. Of course there was agreement from the Commonwealth that out­ patient charges be introduced in New South Wales. That would bring in a substantial amount of revenue for Mr Stewart which would be avail­ able to pay for any shortfalls that he may see there. Unfortunately he has not introduced those charges because he says it is too administratively difficult to arrive at an arrangement with the WALES health insurance funds. He is a particularly slow worker. It has taken him two years to try to work out these administrative arrangements. 1 hope for the sake of the hospitals there that he gets on with the job. NA",21
26,Mr WEST,OIL SPILLS,"Has the Minister for Transport noted yesterday's report by the New South Wales State Pollution Control Commission that large oil spills are inevitable in B otany Bay and that emerg­ ency services to deal with them are most inad­ equate? As there is a national plan which suppos­ the basis edly combines Commonwealth and State resources to combat oil spillage pollution, will the Minister and the Government now afTer increased assistance to the New South Wales State Pol­ lution Control Commission to upgrade these vital emergency measures? Finally, as Botany Bay was formerly regarded as the best equipped port in Australia for pollution control, does the present situation indicate that the national plan to deal with major oil spillages has now reached a stage of unmitigated disaster?",21
27,Mr HUNT ,OIL SPILLS,"Firstly I will deal with the oil spill possibilities in Botany Bay, which are primarly a matter for the State of New South Wales. We have a national plan in association with the States to assist the States should there be an oil spill within the waters under their control. We have also a plan for spills occurring outside the juris­ diction of the States. They come completely within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth. At recent meetings of the Marine and Ports Council of Australia there have been discussions between the Commonwealth and the States about updat­ ing equipment and facilities where it was thought necessary and about examining the desirability of increasing the levy on shipowners to meet the costs of additional facilities that may be required. I have asked my Department to submit to me the models of action that would be taken in the event of a spill in Botany Bay and on the open seas. J am quite satisfied that the Department, in association with the States, has a plan that could cope reasonably well with most situations. There is a need to ensure that the Government of New South Wales is also up to date with all the fa­ cilities and measures that are necessary so that it can cope with problems completely under its own jurisdiction. If it cannot handle oil spills any bet­ ter than it can handle the sewage situation in Sydney it ought to get out of office. NA",21
28,Mr BIRNEY,HOMOSEXUALITY KIT,"J ask the Minister for Edu­ cation whether the Commonwealth Government has provided an amount of $5, 1 26 to the Gay Teachers and Students Association of New South Wales for the production of a kit on homosexu­ ality to be distributed in New South Wales high schools. If it has, will the Minister advise the House what action he proposes to take in the light of extensive public disquiet which has been ex­ pressed about the possible adverse effects of the widespread distribution of this kit on the children of New South Wales?",22
29,Mr FIFE,HOMOSEXUALITY KIT,"I am able to advise the honourable member for Phillip and the House that a grant of $5, 1 26 was approved under the Schools Com­ mission special projects innovation program for two teachers employed by the New South Wales Education Department, Mr E . Ashmore and Mr G. Ostling, to develop materials for possible in­ clusion in a teachers handbook for personal devel­ opment courses in New South Wales high schools. The grant was not made to any organisation, as was claimed in some media reports. At the time that I approved the funds for the project, which is one of 276 projects so far funded under this program this year, I was not informed that the project was, in fact, for the production of a kit on homosexuality. The Schools Commission did not make this known to me in its recommendation, nor was I informed until last Friday that the Act­ ing Director-General of Education in New South Wales had written to the Schools Commission in early January to the effect that although his De­ partment was happy to support the project he could give no guarantee that the materials produced would be used in New South Wales government schools. Had I been advised of the full details of the project and that the Acting Director-General in New South Wales could give no guarantee that the materials produced would be used in New South Wales government schools I would not have approved the provision of funds for the project. I am informed that an initial payment of $3,280 was made in January and that there is a balance remaining of $ 1 ,846. I have sought legal advice as to whether I have the power to withhold further payment. I have also sought advice regarding the money that has already been paid for the project. J am extremely concerned that the Schools Com­ mission withheld from me details of the project when my approval for funds was sought in December of last year. The information contained in the recommendation made to me was different from that placed before the Schools Commission. I have informed the Chairman of the Schools Commission that it is completely unacceptable for the Commission to have adopted a procedure which led to my being given insufficient details of the project for which J was asked to approve funds. I have sought his assurance that this prac­ tice will not continue. Mr Dawkins-I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. Will the Minister table the documents from which he was quoting?",22
30,Mr SPEAKER,HOMOSEXUALITY KIT,I ask the Minister whether he was reading from a document.,22
31,Mr FIFE,HOMOSEXUALITY KIT,I was quoting from some notes. I have said everything that is contained in the notes. If the honourable member wishes to look at them he may do so. NA NA,22
32,Mr INNES,SATELLITE,"I ask the Minister for Com­ munications whether a job impact study has been conducted on the likely effect of the proposed communications satellite on the job security of the 1 ,800 Australian Telecommunications Com­ mission employees working on maintenance and installation in the inter-capital network and the 3,000 employees working in similar areas in the rural network. What percentage of these workers would stand to lose their jobs if the satellite is interconnected with the terrestrial system? What does the Government propose to d o to meet the needs of the workers in terms of continuing job se­ curity and/or retraining should they be made re­ dundant as a result of that policy? Will the Minis­ ter assure the House that in the interest of security and privacy the communications system in this country will continue to operate under the com­ mon carrier system that now pertains? Will the Minister assure the House also that the economic viability of Telecom will not be called into ques­ tion by the intrusion of some other body into the area of communications when all the evidence shows that that very limited market can take only one participant?",22
33,Mr SINCLAIR,SATELLITE,I am appalled that the honourable member is prepared to intrude into the area of generating emotionalism about the im­ pact of changing technology which is designed to bring the benefits of improved facilities to the Australian people. He is trying hard to generate fear among those who are presently employed in providing a network of communications around Australia. Our Government has demonstrated very effectively that it is a good employer. It has demonstrated concern for those who work within its employ. Its concern extends to those who pay the wages.,23
34,Deus ex machina,SATELLITE,Opposition members interjectingMONICA,23
35,Mr SINCLAIR,SATELLITE,"I am interested to hear that honourable members on the other side of the House have no concern about the taxpayers of Australia. Our concern is to marry the provision of services with a level of taxation which the Aus­ tralian people can provide. We will continue to do so in respect of the extension of the satellite sys­ tem, as we will in every other field of government responsibility. Mr Innes-I raise a point of order. Mr Speaker, in the past you have ensured that the answers of Ministers are relevant to the questions. There is no relevance between the sermon which the Min­ ister is now reading to me and the likelihood of people becoming redundant as a direct result of the Government's policy.",23
36,Mr SPEAKER,SATELLITE,The answer is relevant.,23
37,Mr SINCLAIR,SATELLITE,"The Government is con­ cerned about providing an improved level of com­ munications around Australia. It believes that the introduction of the satellite will supplement ter­ restrial forms of transmitting a signal. We as a government are committed to ensuring the maxi­ mum benefit to the Australian public. In doing so, of course, we will be concerned about the impact on those who are employed, whether with Telecom Australia, the Overseas Telecommuni­ cations Commission ( Australia) or any other government agency. Our prime concern, however, is to make sure that we meet adequately the com­ munication requirements of the Australian people. NA Mr SHIPTON My question to the Minister for Defence concerns external threats to Australia. Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the evidence given last week by the Chief of Defence Force Staff, Admiral Sir Anthony Synnot, to the defence sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and De­ fence concerning possible threats to this nation? Has the Minister made an assessment of this evi­ dence? What are current threats facing this country? I include those threats from Monday to Saturday as well as those on Sunday afternoon.",23
38,Mr KILLEN,DEFENCE THREATS,"I have not yet had an oppor­ tunity to consider in the fiat the evidence given by Admiral Synnot because the transcript of his evi­ dence will not be available until, I believe, tomorrow afternoon some time. This is due to mechanical difficulties that face the Hansard people. But I am thoroughly familiar with Admiral Synnot's views on the issue. It is an issue I have discussed with him on many occasions. I simply say that the temptation to try to reduce the subject to simplistic terms should be avoided. There are some countries in the world-I empha­ sise 'some'; Australia is certainly not among them-which can reduce a threat to their national integrity to clear, simplistic terms. Australia can­ not. Australia is not in that position. There are a great range of threats. I notice the honourable member for St George nodding assent. This is the case. I have been just reading the report by Mr Brezhnev, the secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, to the 26th Congress of that party. It is a very substantial document. But it is a very clear asseveration of the basic Marxist­ Leninist doctrine that world dominion remains the aim of the Communist Party. There is no am­ biguity about it at all. Any person vaguely tutored in Marxism-Leninism will reach that conclusion. Mr Bany Jones-Leninism, not Marxism.",23
39,Mr KILLEN,DEFENCE THREATS,"I am grateful to my honourable friend for his interjection and his reassurance that he is so alive. It is a term that Mr Brezhnev has used. I am quite sure that His Excellency the Rus­ sian Ambassador will be delighted to pass on to Mr Brezhnev the fact that the honourable member in the Australian Parliament now cor­ rects the secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The document lays out the program. To the extent that that ambition is pur­ sued it remains a threat to the entire world. The fact that in the last 1 2 months the Soviet Union has moved more fighter interceptor aircraft into its Far Eastern inventory than the United States of America holds in the whole of its Pacific Air Force is, pro tanto to those countries involved, a clear threat. The fact that this year the Soviet Union is spending some $50 billion more on pro­ curement, on military construction and on re­ search and development than the United States of America is a threat to the nations of the world. There is only one other authority that I would cite. I hope my honourable friend will take an interest in this because this is the view of a highly neutral and highly respected academic, Professor J. B. Kelly, a distinguished historian specialising in British relations with the Middle East. In the English magazine Encounter of April 1 980 he observed: Soviet Russia is now in a stronger position than ever before in her history to accomplish her ambitions in the Middle East, whether they be to dominate the routes from Europe to the East, to command the landward and maritime approaches to the eastern Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Gulf, or to lay hands upon the massive oil reserves of the region. I happen to believe in every syllable that Pro­ fessor Kelly has used. Again, that is a threat to the world. Every geo-political disturbance which flows from the stated ambition of the Soviet Union, the fact that the Soviet Union has moved so many fighter interceptors into the Far East, the fact that the Soviet Union is spending such vast sums of money-all these things represent a threat. The temptation-I know that it is difficult for some people to resist--is to seek to define a threat in clear, simple terms; to say: 'There is the only threat'. That is not the case. This country must be prepared for a wide range of threats, varying in terms of reasonableness and seriousness. It was in that sense that Admiral Sir Anthony Synnot spoke.",23
40,Mr YOUNG ,DEFENCE THREATS,Is this the good old Jim Killen of the fifties?,24
41,Mr KILLEN,DEFENCE THREATS,"I think the honourable member has a noogoora bur between his legs. I repeat, it was in that sense that Admiral Sir Anthony Synnot spoke. He was giving evidence to the Committee and explaining the complexity of seeking to find a single threat. There is no single threat for this country. We must be prepared to face a variety of contingencies and it is in precisely that sense that the Admiral spoke.",24
42,Mr HAYDEN,DEFENCE THREATS,"The Minister for Foreign Affairs will recall stating in the House on 1 2 March that he would provide me with a copy of the written agreement between United States Sec­ retary of State Haig and himself in relation to re­ strictions on the operational mode of B52 stra­ tegic bombers using Darwin air base. He is, of course, providing a copy of that document for my inspection today. Is it a fact that the document is expressed in exactly the terms used in the first full paragraph of column 1 on page 667 of Hansard of 1 1 March? Is it a fact that, with the exception of the heading-stating that these words would be the agreed form of expression by the Prime Minis­ ter to the House when speaking to the tabling of the relevant agreement-there is no other com­ ment or notation and certainly no signature or sig­ natures on it? In these circumstances, will he agree that the document has absolutely no stand­ ing in any respect at all? Therefore, how can the Government claim that the United States Government will inform it of any intent to carry nuclear weapons o n B 5 2s using Darwin , especially when the United States refuses to supply such information to allies who are at least equally as important as Australia, such as West Germany and Japan, and when Washington datelined newspaper reports, in the wake of this announcement on behalf of the United States State Department, repudiated any such obligation or intent to advise on the part of the United States Government? Finally, in short does he not agree that the document he referred to is worthless and that no other document exists, including the rel­ evant agreement, stipulating explicitly and in a binding way that B52s will be unarmed, let alone requiring the disclosure of the carriage of nuclear armaments?",24
43,Mr STREET,DEFENCE THREATS,"As I indicated some time ago to the Leader of the Opposition, I have produced for his inspection the document referred to. It was in the same terms, with perhaps a very few minor alterations, as the words of the Prime Minister's statement. It was in virtually the same words. There was no other comment on the document. There are no other documents. I gave the Leader of the Opposition that assurance. He then asked whether the document had any standing. It has standing in this context: As the Leader of the Opposition well knows, the form of words finally agreed, as I made clear in this House some time ago, for use in the presentation of the agreement to this Parliament, was between the Secretary of State for the United States and me. If he believes a document made between representa­ tives of government in that way has no standing, B52 BOMBERS he does not have the same perception of govern­ ment as J do. [f he impugns the integrity of the United States Government and the member of Cabinet who represented it on that occasion, let him get up and say so. NA",24
44,Mr HICKS,LIVE SHEEP EXPORTS,"I direct to the Minister for Pri­ mary Industry a question which I preface by pointing out to the Minister that the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union has claimed that the live sheep export trade is causing a loss of jobs in Australian meat works and is calling for a ration of one live sheep for every sheep carcass exported. Is the Minister aware of claims now being made by. the union that live sheep exports are having an adverse effect on the nation's wool clip? Is that in fact the case? Mr NIXON The AMIEU has run a long campaign against live sheep exports. The basis of its claim in the first instance was that live sheep exports were affecting jobs for Australian workers in abattoirs and that, therefore, that trade should cease. The Bureau of Agricultural Economics conducted a study on the matter, as the House will know. The study demonstrated that in fact that was not the case and that, in the longer term, it might well be that jobs would be created by the continuance of the live sheep export trade. The fact of the matter is that there has been no dimin­ ution in requests from the Middle East for live sheep. I point out to the House that, despite the apparent presumption of the AMIEU, we cannot dictate to the Middle East what sort of sheep or sheep meats it buys. It has a preference for fresh­ killed meat. The fact is that we are supplying only some 28 per cent of the live sheep trade to the Middle East, so obviously there are other markets from which the Middle East would draw if that trade were to cease. 1 point out that, whilst some 5.5 million head of live sheep have gone to the Middle East, at the same time some 4.2 million head of carcass equivalent have gone as well. So as well as the live sheep sales, there is a significant sale of sheep meats. The AMIEU is drawing a long bow in its latest claim that the quality of the wool clip is affected by the fact that approximately 6 million wethers are going out of the country each year. I dispute that it is affecting the quality. It may well be affecting the composition of the flock and there may well be an increasing percentage of ewes in the total flock, but I dispute that it is affecting in any way the quality. The fact is that over the years there has been a change in the composition of the sheep flock of this country and the Australian wool grower has always met the demands placed upon him for the types of wool required by the world's wool users, so I think the AMIEU is draw­ ing a very long bow on this issue.

48,Mr SPEAKER,REPRESENTATIVES,"For the information of honourable members. I present the third annual report of the Department of the House of Rep­ resentatives. The report deals with activities of the Department in 1 980 and refers to business and activities of the House itself. An important devel­ opment within the Department in 1 980 was the expansion of the existing familiarisation pro­ cedures for new members into a more detailed seminar program. Following the general elections last year, the seminar program was arranged by the Clerk of the House, with involvement by my­ self, the Deputy Speaker, the Whips and long­ serving members of all parties, and officers from the parliamentary and Executive departments. Both new and existing members have expressed support for the concept. Seminars in future will be held before the first sitting of each new Parliament. A major feature of the 1 980 parliamentary year was the selection of a designer for the new Parlia­ ment House, and approval by Parliament to pro­ ceed with preparation of a detailed design and with the site. The building program has now begun after an extensive planning period. Site work has almost reached the building level on the western side and the concept of the final position­ ing of the main structure is emerging. Estimates committees operated again in 1 980 under sessional orders amended to incorporate a number of suggestions for improving the working of the committees. Different opinions are held among members as to the role of Estimates com­ mittees and further modification of the sessional orders may be necessary when the committees are re-established in this Parliament. Legislation com­ mittees operated to a limited extent in 1 980. Members of both sides of the House continue to assess these committees as a valuable addition to the legislative process. The sessional orders have been re-introduced in this Parliament with some minor amendment. By analysing its experience and adjusting where necessary, the House con­ tinues to refine its rules of procedure along the road of parliamentary reform. I have previously stressed my commitment to parliamentary reform. 1 re-assert that commit­ ment, and will continue to work, for example, towards the adoption of the Westminster conven­ tion relating to the Speaker, the televising of pro­ ceedings and a revision of our Standing Orders so that committees can perform the tasks we expect of them. The recent reforms of Parliament's pro­ cedures have not been great. The parliamentary institution has exhibited a resistance to change and the fact that there has been reform at all is a major advance. We must ensure that we continue to examine critically our own procedures and proposed avenues of parliamentary reform. We must implement revised practices where necess­ ary. We must ensure that our procedures, or in­ itial moves toward reform, are not allowed to atrophy. The public is generally critical of the role of Parliament today. There is a continuing demand for Parliament's reform. The rising levels of edu­ cation and sophistication among the public have led to greater expectations of the Parliament. We must ensure that we respond to these expec­ tations, and mould a parliamentary institution which more effectively monitors the activities of modern day government.

Motion of Censure",25
49,Mr HAWKE ,YOUTH AFFAIRS,"Wills) (3. 1 4)-I move: That this House censures the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs for deliberately and persistently misleading the House in respect of the possible extension of SAMIN, the Statistical and Management Information Network, in the Commonwealth Employment Service, beyond Brisbane on a national basis. Mr Speaker, in opening the debate on this censure motion against the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs ( Mr Viner) , I ask you and members of the House to contrast some statements. The first statement is taken from the annual report of the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs for 1 979-80, tabled by the Minister in this House on 2 December 1 980. The statement. I quote without qualification from that document tabled by the Minister was in these terms: SAMIN has been implemented in all CES offices in Bris­ bane using the Public Service Board's MANDATA facilities. An evaluation is being undertaken of the system in an oper­ ational environment before further implementation. The statement that the extension of the Statistical and Management Information Network was con­ templated and was waiting upon the outcome of an evaluation in Brisbane caused the members on this side of the House to put a number of ques­ tions to the Minister. Indeed, I asked one-third of such questions on 1 1 March this year. In answer to my question the Minister, speaking in this House, said the following words: That was done initially on the basis that its continuing to be linked into Mandata would depend upon the decision to extend SAMIN nationally and on the capacity of Mandata, given the demands upon it by the Public Service Board and other departments, to fulfil the requirements of SAMIN. He further said: The position is still that an evaluation of the operation of SAMIN in Brisbane will be undertaken before any decision is made to extend it nationally. At that time a decision will have to be made as to whether the Mandata computer or some other computer will be used. There we have two statements made by the Minis­ ter: One which appeared in the annual report was 1981 . about the possible extension of SAMIN nationally, depending on the outcome of an evalu­ ation. That report was tabled on 2 December last year. On 1 1 March the Minister said again that Amend­ the position was still that an evaluation of SAMIN would be undertaken before any decision was made to extend it nationally, and at that time the decision would have to be made as to whether the Mandata computer or some other computer would be used. I ask honourable members to con­ trast those statements made by the Minister in December 1 980 and March 1981 with these two statements: On 4 September 1 980, during the hearing of Senate Estimates Committee B, an in­ terchange occurred. The person being questioned was Mr MACDonald, Assistant Secretary of the Finance Branch of the Department of Employ­ ment and Youth Affairs. Senator Evans asked him: How on earth did you chalk up a surplus in that area? Is it just obsolete equipment? The answer given to that Estimates Committee was in these terms: No, the machines were bought when we thought that we were expanding SAMIN, in 1 979-80, into other States from Brisbane. As it turned out we cannot do that and we have had to dispose of the terminal printers. That reply is quite unequivocal. On 4 September Mr MACDonald said: As it turned out we cannot do that and we have had to dispose of the terminal printers. Mr MACDonald was asked why he could not do that, and his answer was quite clear, concise and unequivocal. He said: The Mandata computer has not sufficient computing ca­ pacity to allow us to expand Mandata beyond Brisbane. He was asked further questions and he went on to say: The Mandata system indicated of computing time would be available. This was agreed to some two years ago by the interdepartmental committee on ADP matters. The arrangement was that although the com­ puter time would be offered to us under Mandata we would have to buy peripheral equipment to run our own system. In other words, w e had to buy to buy the equipment in 1979-80. Subsequent to the letting of contracts and purchase of equipment, the Mandata organis­ ation advised us that in fact, there was no longer sufficient capacity for us to expand SAMIN, our statistical collection system, beyond Brisbane. I suggest to the House through you, Mr Speaker, that we could not have a clearer contradiction out of the mouth of one of the senior members of the Minister's Department. It was put on record be­ fore the Senate Estimates Committee in Sep­ tember of last year. That was before he tabled the report in the House on 2 December. He followed this up with three answers culminating in the one to which I have alluded which is in stark contradiction. But in case that is not enough, in case someone would like in some way to wriggle around that stark contradiction, let me read to the House what is contained in a document from the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs concerning the revised estimates for 1 980-8 1 . This document would have had to have been before the Minister by the end of December 1 980. It would have been to the Department of Finance in January of this year. What does this document say on this issue? Let me read it. The heading on the document is 'Revised Estimates 1 980-8 1 ', the division is capital works and services, plant and equipment, Com­ monwealth Employment Service, computer equipment and the variation item under consider­ ation amounts to $393,000. Under the heading 'Reason for variation' these words appear, which would have been considered by the Minister be­ fore the end of 1 980: The appropriation provided funds to cover the purchase and installation costs of 26 visual display units required in Queensland following the Department's decision not to extend SAMIN to other States. That is the document that was before the Minis­ ter. It was considered by him at the end of 1 980, following which he misled this House about the possibility of the extension of SAMIN, and poss­ ibly Mandata. He said that it all depended upon the outcome of an evaluation of what was going on in Brisbane. Let me repeat what was stated in this document that was considered before the end of last year. Under the heading 'Reason for vari­ ation' the document stated: The appropriation provides funds to cover the purchase and installation costs of 26 visual display units required in Queensland following the Department's decision not to extend SAMIN to other States. Mr John Brown-He ought to resign. to us that a certain amount",26
50,Mr HAWKE,YOUTH AFFAIRS,"Of course he ought to resign. The document that was sighted and authorised by the Minister went on: Following discussions between this Department, the De­ partments of Finance and Administrative Services and Infor­ terminal printers. We proceeded mation Electronics Ltd, it was decided that all the equipment should be purchased and all but 26 VDUs declared surplus . requirements. because of its own requirements There you have it, Mr Speaker. The contrast is stark, clear and unequivocal. Against the state­ ments that this Minister gave to the Parliament on three occasions in answer to questions following up what was contained in the document he tabled on 2 December last year, we have, in terms of what was said to the Senate Estimates committee in September 1 980 and in a document considered by him before the end of 1 980 and which went to the Department of Finance in January of this year, clear evidence of the Department's decision not to extend SAMIN to other States. Mr Speaker, so that there be a clear under­ standing that what we are talking about here is not some peripheral minor issue, let me remind you, sir, and honourable members, of just how im­ portant is this thing SAMIN we are talking about because it may be regarded as something esoteric. I refer the House to the 1 978-79 report of the National Director of the Commonwealth Em­ ployment Service tabled in the House in May last year. This is what is said about the importance of the SAMIN system. The report states: During 1 978-79 the design and development of a new stat­ istical and management information network (SAMIN) was completed. The objectives of SAMI N are to: produce statistics which are more useful for management purposes and the assessment of local and national labour market conditions; provide a data information opment and evaluation of programs and labour market studies; rationalise the statistical burden on CES offices; and re­ duce the costs of collection; and maintain and enhance the current statistical series. The report continues: The SAMIN system will operate on the Public Service Board's Mandata network which consists of a central com­ puter facility in Canberra State capital. In metropolitan and larger provincial centres CES offices will be equipped with visual display units and printers. This will allow each office to enter system and receive daily reports of applicant and vacancy transaction volume. In country offices data will be recorded manually and forwarded to the regional processing and con­ trol centres for input into the system. The report concludes on this point: Progressive implementation of the SAMIN system is planned with its introduction into Queensland late in 1979. Subsequently, SAMIN will be extended to all other States with the aim of having the system operating nationally by early 1981. That is what we are talking about, a sophisticated basically important piece of computerised equip­ ment which is asserted by the Department in its annual report tabled in this House as being essen­ tial to the more efficient discharge of these funda­ mental programs concerned with employment and unemployment and the matching of people registered for employment and vacancies. It is an absolutely fundamental matter. Then we pick up the statement of 2 December to which I have re­ ferred as to what will happen about the national extension of this program. In the report tabled at the end of the year the Minister said that the program would be extended depending upon the outcome of the evaluation. In answers to quesI tions, into which I will now go in more detail; further statements were made misleading this House about the position in regard to the possible extension when in fact, as I have established, the decision was already clearly taken that that exten­ sion would not take place. Having opened in that way, and in the limited time available to me, let me try to flesh out the de� tails and background of this grotesque misleading of the House in regard to this fundamental mat­ ter. The statement to which I have referred was contained in the report which was tabled at the end of last year. A number of questions were asked. I have referred to the one that I finally asked. The first one was asked by the honourable member for Lilley ( Mrs Darling) on 3 March. She referred to the statement in the annual report, and in reply the Minister said: No steps have been taken to extend SAMIN beyond Bris­ bane. The function of SAMIN is still being evaluated against the background of experience in Brisbane. base which will aid the devel­ A similar sort of answer was given to the honour­ able member for Griffith ( Mr Humphreys) on 5 March, when he asked a question about this evaluation. The Minister said: The evaluation is ongoing. I am not aware of a precise com­ pletion date for it. I will make inquiries of my Department and provide the honourable gentleman with an answer. I believe this answer has now been provided. linked to small computers in each Let us look at what emerged, how this situation has arisen and the circumstances in which the Minister found it necessary to mislead this House. data directly into the SAMIN In the latter part of 1 979 difficulties became ap­ parent in regard to this system on which work had commenced in 1 976. By the end of 1 980, ap­ proximately $3m had been expended upon the work of investigation and the initial implemen­ tation of this system in Brisbane. By the end of 1 979 difficulties were becoming apparent and, in the result, through the period January to April 1 980 discussions took place between the Depart­ ment of Employment and Youth Affairs, the Pub­ lic Service Board, and computer consultants, Burroughs Ltd, regarding the problems of the op­ eration of SAMIN and the Mandata network. Those discussions resulted in the appointment, on 3 April last year, of Burroughs as official consult­ ants to the Department to deal with the problems concerning the operation of SAMIN in relation to the availability of time on the Mandata system. Even then we see the beginning of the weaving of this fabric of deceit. The day before, on 2 April, the Minister had given a misleading answer to the honourable member for Griffith, who had asked a question on that occasion. Because of time limi­ tations I cannot go into that. I simply say that that is when the pattern of misleading started.",27
51,Mr YOUNG ,YOUTH AFFAIRS,Wasn'the telling the truth?,28
52,Mr HAWKE,YOUTH AFFAIRS,"No, he was not telling the truth, as he obviously was not telling the truth on those occasions to which I have had the time to allude. Let us see what followed. Mr Speaker, I apologise that I have to do this very quickly. When the Min­ ister's Department appointed Burroughs as con­ sultants to the Department on 3 April because of the difficulties that had already emerged quite clearly in regard to the availability of adequate time on the Mandata system, Burrough's made a thorough examination and reported to the De­ partment that there was not a sufficient avail­ ability of time and that there could not be a national system of SAMIN under the Mandata system. That report was submitted to the Depart­ ment, and obviously to the knowledge of the Min­ ister, by the end of June. So it was known that this problem existed. Despite that situation a contract was let for the supply of 202 visual display units. It was entered into with Information Electronics Ltd on 28 May after this report had been made. That was a disas­ trous decision. Honourable members will recall that it is in that context that we lead up to the situation in September, to which I have alluded, with the terminal printers. Flowing from the De­ partment's decision not to extend SAMIN nationally because of the unavailability of time it was stuck with surplus equipment. In September we wanted the Department to explain what it was doing about disposing of equipment which had been ordered on the basis that the Department was to have a national system. But having made a decision before August not to have a national sys­ tem, the Department had to go about the business of disposing of that equipment. The evidence which I have put before the House shows-the revised estimates at the end of December last year, at which the Minister looked-that the Department was operating on the equipment necessary only for Brisbane. It had to get rid of the equipment because it had made the decision not to go national. Yet this Minister tabled a report on 2 December 1 980 and, on three occasions in this House answered questions on the basis that there still might be an extension of SAMIN possibly on Mandata. On 1 1 March the answer he gave to me was that there still may be a decision to extend SAMIN on Mandata when, in fact, the decision had been taken not to extend and the Department had actually engaged in the disposal of equipment which was necessary to en­ able that decision to be taken. In the very short time available to me let me just anticipate the further misrepresentation in which I believe the Minister may try to engage. I warn him that I know all the facts and he had bet­ ter be very careful about attempting to mislead this House again. He may try to say that a thing called Job Bank may be a basis upon which there may be some extension. I am waiting with eager­ ness to see what he has to say about that because we know the answer. It is one which does not sus­ tain in the slightest way the lies which he perpe­ trated in this House. The final point I wish to make before my time expires is that: if the Minis­ ter wants to mislead this House about the evalu­ ation that has been undertaken in Brisbane I hope he proceeds upon that basis because we will answer him with the facts. The evaluations have not been undertaken on the basis of a possibility of an extension of SAM IN. The facts are that as I have proved, the Minister has lied to this House and, therefore, is deserving of its censure.",28
53,Mr SPEAKER,YOUTH AFFAIRS,Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Is the motion seconded? Mr HoldingI second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,29
54,Mr VINER ,YOUTH AFFAIRS,"Stirling-Minister for Employ­ ment and Youth Affairs) (3.35)-1 welcome the opportunity to debate this matter, which was set down on the Notice Paper during the last sitting week of this Parliament. As I will demonstrate, there is no foundation for the assertions so extravagantly made by the honourable member for Wills ( Mr Hawke) . Having regard to the tone of his speech and his actions in the House; I might say that those assertions were rather hysterically made. The honourable member for Wills alleged on a number of occasions that I misled the Par­ liament on the future development of the Statisti­ cal and Management Information Network, SAMIN-not a fish to be played with but some­ thing to be seriously considered. It is the Statisti­ cal and Management Information System cur­ rently operating in the Brisbane offices of the Commonwealth Employment Service. The honourable gentleman suggested that a decision had been taken that SAM IN would not be' ex­ tended to operate on a national basis. I will quote directly from a question asked by the honourable gentleman on 1 1 March this year. He asked: Is it a fact that a decision was taken by the Minister's De­ partment prior to September last year I stress thisto abandon the planned introduction of the Statistical and Management In formation N etwork on a national basis . . . The ansWer to that question is clearly no. No de­ ' cision has been made to abandon SAMIN on a national basis. It is the usual practice of the Oppo­ sition to attempt to besmirch the reputation of Ministers with wild and unfounded allegations. I acknowledge that that is part of the game of poli­ tics. We deal with such things in the House not every day but as they come along. However, in this case the allegations made by the honourable gentleman reflect on the competence and integ­ rity of officers of my Department. I take such alle­ gations very seriously. The honourable gentleman has challenged statements in the annual report of my Department for the year 1 979-80. That is an attack upon the integrity and honesty of officers of my Department. I say that because SAMIN is a system designed to aid departmental management. Explanations of its development have been given to committees of Parliament and to the public. These expla­ nations have been based on the understanding that SAMIN would go national after an evalu­ ation . It has always been thus and it still is the case . . By way of background, SAMIN was introduced in Brisbane as a system to keep the management of the CES better informed of the volume and nature of transactions conducted by its officer�. Although a system of this kind had been con­ sidered for some time, the discovery that the Pub­ lic Service Board's Mandata system at that time had spare automatic data processing capacity led to SAMIN 's development . SAMIN was introduced in September 1 979 in Brisbane to test its efficacy and efficiency. At that time Mandata was developing. At a point where SAMIN was reasonably well developed in Brisbane, early last year, consultants-the consultants to which the honourable gentleman referred, Burroughs Ud­ were hired by the Department to assess the system and the scope for its further development. Those consultant's reports which were avail­ able to the Department in mid-1 980 led to the De­ partment taking the view that Mandata would not continue to have the spare capacity, the basis on which SAMIN was originally implemented, to allow SAMIN to be operated nationally on that equipment. If at that time SAMIN was to be ex­ tended nationally, it would have been necessary to obtain additional central ADP equipment. In other words, it would have been necessary to up­ grade Mandata equipment. The estimated cost was about $ 1 . 7m. The Department decided not to seek additional ADP equipment as its own pro­ posals for acquiring that equipment for the Com­ monwealth Employment Service, the Job Bank system, of which public notice has been given, were already well advanced. I was informed of the Department's decision in early July 1 980 and I endorsed a course of action which is well sum­ marised in an information bulletin of September 1 980 of the National Director of the Common­ wealth Employment Service. That bulletin, dated 8 September 1 980, was circulated. to CES staff members throughout Australia. I will .quote from one passage of the bulletin which dealt with CES computerisation and described what was happen­ ing regarding Job Bank. It pointed out that SAMIN had by then been implemented success­ fully in all Brisbane offices and, after initial teeth­ ing problems, was operating reliably. It stated: Unfortunately, there are difficulties in extending SAMIN beyond Brisbane in the near future. The Public Service Board'8 MANDATA computer which processes SAMIN data has no further spare capacity. Consequently, SAMIN could only be extended beyond Brisbane by upgrading MANDATA's computer or acquiring other computing resources. I draw the attention of the House to that passage particularly in relation to the passage at the end of the answer I gave on 1 1 March 1981 . I stated: At that timeNamely, a fter a n evaluation was to be completeda decision will have to be made as to whether the Mandata computer or some other computer will be used. After I gave that answer I sought from my De­ partment the papers relating to the matter in order to refresh my memory and to check the ac­ curacy of my statement. The honourable member for Wills tries to make something of that, but the facts are that iri July the advice before me from my Department was that if the Government was prepared to spend $ 1 . 7m to upgrade Mandata, SAMIN could be extended nationally. The alternative was to extend SAMIN nationally by using other computing resources. It might fairly be said that my answer last week contained an error of fact, but one can see clearly what has hap­ pened. That information has been made public by the National Director of the CES to all its staff. For the information of the House I table that document. What had become apparent by that time was that SAMIN appeared, on the face of things and to the extent of the evaluation at that time, to be a success, providing better and more timely infor­ mation about job seeker and vacancy trans­ actions. Therefore, the Department decided to undertake more detailed evaluations of the program. Two separate internal reviews were undertaken. The first reviewed the technical aspects of the system and the second reviewed its impact on the work load of the CES. The techni­ cal review was completed in late 1 980. It showed that the equipment was reliable and that output and operations were satisfactory. That technical review was referred to the Secretary of my De­ partment. Because of its technical nature, it was not referred to me, nor did it need to be. The sec­ ond review has been completed only recently. Coincidentally, it was completed on the day on which the honourable member for · Griffith ( Mr Humphreys) asked me a question about SAMIN. The findings of that review are still being considered by senior officers of my Department. When they have completed their work they will refer the report to me. I seek leave to have incor­ porated in Hansard a copy of the letter which I wrote to the honourable member for Griffith on 1 3 March providing the information I promised to give him in my answer to his question of 5 March. Leave granted. The document read asfol/ows­ D'ear Mr Humphreys, You asked me in the Parliament on 5 March 1981 , about the current state of the evaluation enquire of my Department when the evaluation was expected to be completed. My Department informs me that two reviews of the oper­ ation of 'SAMIN have been undertaken by Departmental officers. The first of these, a technical assessment of the syste,m, commenced in September 1980. This review studied the re­ liability of the equipment; the appropriateness of the pro­ cedures and the condition of in November 1980. A second investigation, commencing in November 1980, looked at the impact of SAMIN on the workload of CES offices in Brisbane. I am advised that this study was corrlpleted on 5 March and a draft report is currently being considered by senior officers of the Commonwealth Employment Service. Mr B. C.

55,Mr VINER,YOUTH AFFAIRS,"In that letter I referred to the two evaluations that I have mentioned. One can see that the answer I gave to the honourable member for Griffith was absolutely correct. I also refer to the answer I gave to the honourable member for Lilley ( Mrs Darling) on 3 March 1981 . After some preamble the honourable member asked: Can the Minister indiCate the implementation of SAMIN beyond Brisbane? I answered: No steps have been taken to extend SA. MIN beyond Bris­ bane. The function of SAMIN the background of experience in Brisbane. That answer is absolutely correct. It will be seen, therefore, that the only decision taken on the extension of SAMIN beyond Brisbane was a de­ cision that it could not be done using Mandata without the costly upgrading of Mandata, amounting to $ 1 .7m, which I have mentioned. In the judgment of my Department, with which I concurred, it was considered that the more appro­ priate course to follow was to look at extending SAMIN in the context of the implementation of the Job Bank national computer network. Conse­ quently, paragraph 1 .2.2 on page 5 of the request for tender documents issued on 27 September 1 980 for the supply of computing facilities for Job Bank stated: This request for tender is aimed at acquiring hardware and software to support two major applications. These are: (a) Job Bank. The circulation of vacancies amongst officers and supportive job filling action. (b) SAMIN. The collection and reporting of management statistics. I would have thought that it was quite clear to all honourable members, if not to the honourable of SAM IN . I undertook to member for Wills, that the Department was issu­ ing tender documents calling for the tenderer to include his tender provision not only for Job Bank but also for SAMIN. On 1 0 December 1 980 the Commonwealth Employment Service issued another information bulletin. Again, that bulletin referred to Job Bank and SAMIN. Under the heading 'News points. Job Bank-Tenders the operation. It was completed Called' it stated: Tenders were called in October for the supply of computer equipment including terminals for the CES Job Bank system. Tenders close in February 1981 and after that a Departmental evaluation team with consultants from Logica-Yours sincerely, They are the consultants in respect of Job BankR. I. VINER will evaluate the responses and make recommendations later in the year. The equipment will support Job Bank and enable extension of the SAMIN statistical and management infor­ mation system to all Regions. For the edification of the honourable member for Wills, that means that SAMIN will be extended to a national network. I table that bulletin. Thus it will be seen that no decision has been taken not to proceed with the implementation of SAMIN on a national basis. The evaluation of the system is cur­ rently before my Department. The tender docu­ ment for Job Bank includes acquisition of soft­ what progress has been made in ware and hardware for the implementation of SAMIN in all regions. J repeat that that means ac­ quisition on a national basis. This is fully reflected in the information bulletins issued by the National Director of the Commonwealth Employment Ser­ is still being evaluated against vice to all staff. The honourable member for Wills has sought to impugn the honesty and integrity of officers of my Department at the most senior level, including the Secretary of my Department and the National Di­ , rector of the CES, by alleging that false state­ ments were made in the annual report of the De­ partment for 1 979-80 tabled by me in September 1 980. I simply point out to the honourable member that he should first read the preamble. It is my preamble and it states: In accordance with the provisions of Section 22 of the Com­ monwealth Employment Service Act 1978, I submit for pres­ entation to Parliament this Report for the year ended 30 June 1 980.",31

57,Mr SPEAKER,INTEREST RATES,"I have received a letter from 16 the honourable member for Gellibrand ( Mr Willis) proposing that a definite matter of public AYES importance be submitted to the House for dis­ cussion, namely: The likely prospect of a further general increase in interest rates and its adverse impact on home buyers, small business, the level of economic activity and employment. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their placesMONICA",32
58,Mr WILLIS ,INTEREST RATES,"Gellibrand) (3.59)-The Oppo­ sition is greatly concerned at the likelihood of a further round of interest rate increases of the order of one per cent or so. We are so concerned because of a decision made by the Government yesterday evening in which it announced an in­ crease in the Australian savings bonds interest rate from 1 1 t per cent to 1 2t per cent, a rise of NA three-quarters of a per cent. That is by far the highest level that the interest rate on savings bonds has reached since they were introduced. The savings bonds rate traditionally has been closely associated with the building society rates. When there has been movement in the savings bond rate it has been normal for there to be an in­ crease in the building society rate, if the savings bond rate movement was upward, and with the increase in deposit rates by building societies in­ evitably there has been an increase in their loan rates and therefore higher loan repayments for home buyers purchasing their homes through building society loans. That, of course, is tremen­ dously important for all those buying homes Rocher, A. C. Ruddock, P. M. through building societies or intending to do so. It is also important in relation to those who would be seeking bank finance-more so now since the decision of the Government last December to deregulate deposit rates by the banks. Now we have the situation where the banks can also attempt to keep pace with savings bond in­ creases by increasing their rates on deposits with­ out having to depend on the Government to ap­ prove increases in those rates. Of course, there is a limitation in the sense that there is still control on the lending rate so that the extent to which the banks can increase their deposit rates is limited to some extent by that fact. Of course, that means that the banks then put pressure on the Govern­ ment for an increase in those loan rates. At present we are greatly concerned that given that increase in savings bond rates the banks will be pressuring the Government very vigorously for an increase in their loan rate. That has become particularly important since the Government's decision to deregulate bank deposit rates last December. Since that time there has been a sig­ nificant increase in bank deposit rates. Savings bank investment account rates are up from 9 per cent last December to l O t per cent now--an in­ crease of 1 t per cent. Rates on fixed deposits by trading banks are up by at least three-quarters of one per cent, in some cases more. This indicates that there was a strong increase in bank deposit rates before last night's decision to increase savings bond rates. Therefore, even before the Government made its decision to increase those savings bond rates, which was announced last night, there was pressure on the Government to allow a further increase in the loan rates charged by the banks for overdrafts and home loans. Now, with that increase in the savings bond rate, that pressure must be greatly exacerbated because the December 1 977 January 1 978 January 1 979 June 1 979 December 1 979 January 1 980 June 1 980 October 1 980 December 1 980 February 1 980 Source: Syntec.",32
59,Mr WILLIS,NOES,"I thank the House. The table demonstrates movements in housing mortgage interest rates for savings banks, trading banks, building societies and finance companies from December 1 977 to the present. We can see from those figures that there has been an increase in the banks are very much competing with savings bonds, as are the building societies. An increase of the order of three-quarters of one per cent must affect the competitive abilities of the banks. Therefore, the banks will be wanting to increase their deposit rates to maintain funds and we are likely to see further pressure for higher rates in the banking area. It seems to us, therefore, that we are looking at about a one per cent general increase in interest rates occurring again. This is because of the press­ ures developing prior to last night and because of last night's announcement. This prospect of rising interest rates is absolutely alarming because interest rates are already at record levels. Interest rates in this country have never been higher than they are at present. Yet we now appear to be fac­ ing the prospect of another one per cent or so in­ crease. Coming on top of record high interest rates that is absolutely alarming. Of course, it makes an absolute mockery of the Government's election promise in 1 977 to reduce interest rates by 2 per cent. Home loan rates are now one per cent higher than they were when the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) made that election promise in 1 977. Of course, if the rates increase by another one per cent it will amount to an increase of some 2 per cent on the level operating when the Government promised to reduce rates by 2 per cent. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table which sets out changes in interest rates on housing mortgages. Leave granted.

Although there was a decline in those rates in 1 979, last year we saw significant increases. In fact, in less than 1 2 months we have had an increase of 2 per cent in home mortgage interest rates-D.S per cent last April, 0.5 per cent last July and one per cent last December. That is 2 per cent in less than 1 2 months. Here we are facing a prospect of a further one per cent increase. This would mean a stagger­ ing rise of some 3 per cent in interest rates in the course of a 12-month period. That is not bad for a government that promised to cut interest rates by 2 per cent! If we have this increase in interest rates, which seems nigh unto certain, this will have a very sig­ nificant impact on home buyers, small businesses and economic activity generally. Home buyers, both actual home buyers and potential home buyers, of course, are most heavily affected by interest rate increases because they must bear the full impact.

60,Mr WILLIS,EFFECT OF INCREASED,"I thank the House. This table shows for 25-year loans amounting to $20,000, $25,000 and $30,000, with varying interest rates, what the monthly repayments and total repay­ ments would be. If we take perhaps the typical home loan of $30,000 we find that a comparison of repayments on the 9+ per cent interest rate, which we had 1 2 months ago, and on the II + per cent rate, which is the interest rate now, shows that the. monthly repayment has gone from about $262 to about $305-a $43 increase. That is a very significant increase indeed. If the rate were to go up by another one per cent the repayment would go up by another $22 a month which would be an increase of $65 per month on repayments 1 2 months ago. A further increase in interest rates will have a very important impact indeed. The size of repayments will be greatly increased. The ability of people to obtain home loans will be greatly reduced. The Housing Industry Association has cal­ culated that for every 0.5 per cent increase in mortgage interest rates some 4,000 potential home buyers per annum are excluded from the market. With the increase of 2 per cent in interest involving a tax deduction. The Government picks up the tab for something like half of the interest rate increase. Still, the increase has a significant impact. It increases the cost of capital and there­ fore the price of investment and, therefore, makes such investment perhaps less likely. So it is also important in that regard. For home buyers the interest rate is, of course, very important indeed. There are no tax deductions for housing interest rates so home buyers and potential home buyers must bear the full impact of any such increases. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard another table which shows the effects of increased interest rates on home loan repayments. Leave granted. The table read asfollowsNA Loan (25 year term) $20,000 $25,000 $30,000 Monthly Total Monthly Monthly Monthly Total repayment repayment repayment repayment repayment repayment 1 67.83 50,351.78 209.79 62,939.72 251 .75 75,527.67 1 74.73 52,421.79 21 8.42 65,527.24 262.10 78,632.69 1 81 .74 54,522.04 227 . 1 7 68,152.55 272.61 8 1 ,783.06 1 88.83 56,650.90 236.04 70,81 3.62 283.25 84,976.35 1 96.02 58,806.78 245.02 73,508.48 294.03 88,2 1 0. 1 7 203.29 60,988 . 1 3 254. 1 1 76,235 . 1 7 304.94 91,482.20 21 0.64 63,193.44 263.30 78,99 1 . 8 1 3 1 5.96 94,790. 1 7 21 8.07 65,421.24 272.58 8 1 ,776.56 327. 10 98,1 3 1 .87 rates that we have seen already in less than the last 12 months some 1 6,000 potential home buyers have been excluded from the market. With another one per cent rise there would be another 8,000 people excluded making 24,000 people excluded in the course of the last 1 2 months. This has, of course, a very significant impact indeed on the building industry and on the housing situation at large. Of course, the reason those people are excluded is simply that they cannot meet the re­ payments. To obtain a $25,000 loan from a savings bank at 1 2+ per cent interest over 25 years on the basis that these repayments are no more than 25 per cent of gross earnings, which is the normal provision required by banks, a buyer would need a gross weekly income of $273 a week. Average weekly earnings are only just slightly above that amount at $278 a week. Over 60 per cent of wage and salary earners earn less than av­ erage weekly earnings. Quite obviously the ma­ jority of wage and salary earners are excluded from obtaining a home loan of that normal kind at the likely interest rate of 1 2+ per cent. Therefore, we find the great impact on the housing market which I mentioned. Of course, this applies not only in relation to home purchase but also it creates enormous prob­ lems in the home renting area, particularly when the Government has been slashing funds for pub­ .lic housing and therefore creating a shortage of rental accommodation. That plus the exclusion of people from the ability to buy puts enormous pressure on rents which are currently increasing rapidly and are likely to increase even more if these policies are pursued, as apparently they will be. Therefore, in the housing area this has a very significant impact indeed and an impact on the building supplies industry and through that the economy in general which, of course, is also affected by higher interest rates increasing the price of investment and therefore making less in­ vestment likely, having impacts on employment. Why then do we have this interest rate spiral which is clearly so damaging? There are basically three reasons as we see it. Firstly, there are the monetarist policies of this Government. This Government is increasingly monetarist in its ap­ proach at a time when such policies are increasingly being exposed as disastrous and unworkable. The rise in the savings bond rate is designed enable the Government to keep the money supply growth within its budgeted rate of 9 to II per cent. The Treasurer has decided to increase the rate by another three-quarters of a per cent to bring in more money, so he can keep the rate of growth of the money supply down to his target rate. This is in contrast with the position in pre­ vious years. Last year the rate blew out by some 3 per cent more than the target or budget rate. In the previous year there was a similar blow-out, but this year the Government seems to be more determined to ensure that there is no blow-out of the money supply rate of growth. Therefore, we can say that it is increasingly monetarist in its proach. This is at a time when all over the world great concern is being expressed about the auth­ enticity of monetarist policies, particularly in the United Kingdom, where it is a subject of enor­ mous discussion. The Government says that we need to restrict the rate of growth of the money supply to reduce inflation, but there is no evidence here, or any­ where, of a clear relationship between the rate of growth of money supply and the rate of inflation. I challenge the Treasurer to produce one skerrick of evidence that there is a clear relationship be­ tween the rate of growth of money supply and the level of inflation. One certainly cannot find it in Australia's history or in the history of any other country, so far as I am aware. Indeed, there is no economic theory which holds that there is such a relationship. Not even the Friedmanites in their basic economic theory hold that there is such a close relationship. All we have is the basic re­ lationship, adhered to by economists for many years, that the amount of money in the economy, times its velocity-the speed with which it is turned over-equals the quantity of goods produced as determined by the price level of those goods and services. It is a simple, basic relation­ ship. It does not follow that if M, the amount of money in the community, is reduced the price level is also reduced. The quantity of goods and services in the community might be reduced. Indeed, that conclusion was reached by two Adelaide economists, Davis and Lewis, in an article published in The Australian Monetary System in the 1 970s, edited by Michael G. Porter. In the chapter on money and income determi­ nation they say, speaking of their economic study: . . . these results suggest that the Liberal-NCP Govern­ ment's strategy of pitching the monetary growth rate target well below the ongoing rate of growth of consumer prices is likely to have a more reliable impact upon output than upon prices. In other words, if one follows this Government's monetary policy one is more likely to reduce out­ to put than inflation. That is what we are seeing at present in the real world. We are seeing it in Australia while this Government is pursuing its monetary policies of 1 976-77 and 1 977-78. It has let them blow out a bit since. We have certainly seen it in the United Kingdom, where those mone­ tarist policies are continuing in a period of high inflation and devastating impact on output and employment. What does undoubtedly go with monetarist policies is high interest rates; there is absolutely no doubt about that. This is because inflation re­ mains high and that tends to bid interest rates up. ap­ It is also because a contraction of the rate of growth of the money supply creates a shortage, so its price, that is, interest rates, is bid up. I refer honourable members to a cable, received today from Europe, on a statement by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe. It states: The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (ECE) today warned governments that reliance on tight mon­ etary controls to tame inflation without an incomes policy could lead to a heightening of social conflict . . . The report suggested that monetarist strategies being fol­ lowed by several governments that have turned away from in­ comes policies could increase social strains caused by higher unemployment, and said the effectiveness of such an approach was yet to be proven . . . The survey added: 'One consequence of the present mone­ tarist strategy has been a widespread escalation of interest rates, which have now reached very high levels, particularly in the United States'. We have there evidence from the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe that mone­ tarist policies are leading to a declining economy and higher interest rates. That situation is likely to occur here, although resource development pro­ vides an offsetting factor in regard to the level of economic activity. Deregulation is another reason we have such spiralling interest rates, a matter to which I re­ ferred in my opening remarks. If the Government persists in its support for deregulation in the middle of the year, when the Campbell committee report comes down, we can expect further in­ creases in interest rates. The banks, in their sub­ mission to that committee said that deregulation would lead to higher interest rates.",34
61,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,INTEREST RATES ON HOME LOAN REPAYMENTS,Mr MiIlar)­ Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,36
62,Mr HOWARD ,INTEREST RATES ON HOME LOAN REPAYMENTS,"Bennelong-Treasurer) (4. 1 5 ) - [ welcome this matter of public import­ ance because of the opportunity it affords to ana­ lyse the different approaches of the Opposition and the Government on the question of interest rates, and to draw out the absolute unrealism of the approach that is taken by the honourable member for Gellibrand ( Mr Willis) . It is an ap­ proach, I might add, that brings him into some conflict with statements made until fairly recently by his own leader, the honourable member for Oxley ( Mr Hayden) who certainly, when he was Treasurer, and since he has become Leader of the Opposition, acknowledged the link between the rate of growth of the money supply and the level of inflation. Therefore, my opening point is that the honourable member for Gellibrand has indicated a very significant difference between his approach and that of the Leader of the Oppo­ sition who, in his calmer moments and when bet­ ter advised, knows as well as do honourable members on this side that there is a very import­ ant link between the rate of growth of the money supply and the level of inflation. Obviously, no honourable member likes high interest rates. Government members are as con­ cerned as anybody else that interest rates should now be higher than they were some months ago. We are naturally concerned, in particular, about the level of interest rates in the sensitive areas affect Australian home buyers. But in a debate like this we have to ask ourselves some fundamen­ tal questions. We have to ask what causes interest rates to go up and whether there are any realistic alternatives to the policy that the Government is currently following. The honourable member for Gellibrand might acknowledge that the ultimate pressure on the level of interest rates in the com­ munity is the pressure of supply and demand. He would surely acknowledge that ultimately the price of money is determined by the volume avail­ able and the demand for it. It follows that those who are interested in bringing down the level of interest rates must demonstrate a capacity to fol­ low policies which reduce the demand on funds available for lending. That is the central point in any debate on interest rates. It is no good bewailing the level of interest rates, or saying that they were at a certain level some months ago and are now at another. It is necessary, if we are to bring down the level of interest rates, to produce a coherent strategy which is better than that followed at present. The first thing that any government has a responsi­ bility to do in regard to interest rates is to curb its appetite for borrowing funds from those that are available in the community. It is sometimes for­ gotten by people on the other side that govern­ ments, by their own activities, have an effect on the amount of money that is available and its price. Every time a government spends more, through borrowing, than it raises through tax­ ation, it puts pressure on interest rates. Every time governments do more than they ought to do in providing services they enter into open compe­ tition with financial institutions which provide money to Australian home buyers. Therefore, every politician on the other side who bewails the price of finance to home buyers ought to look to his own commitments in the public sector-and none more so than the honourable member for Gellibrand who is on record, as every honourable member on this side knows, as being in favour of a much larger public sector. He stands for increas­ ing the competition by the government sector for funds and therefore for forcing up further the price of money. He knows, as well as we do, that when governments increase their own demands for funds they increase competition; that there­ fore they have an effect on the price of money. Anyone who wishes to know who stands for re­ ducing pressure on interest rates in Australia must consider the comparative policies of political par­ ties as to the size of the public sector. Lower deficits, reduced borrowing demands and a that smaller public sector borrowing requirement ultimately reduce the pressure imposed by the government sector. The answer of the Opposition is to ignore that fact, although some, and in par­ ticular the honourable member for Reid ( Mr Uren) , if his questions of some ten days ago are any guide, would have us reduce some of the pri­ vate sector demands for funds so that more could be made available for the public sector. If the ar­ gument is about the size of the private sector, or the public sector, in the economy let us at least have an honest debate on whether the public sec­ tor should be larger or smaller. Let us not cloud the issue. If we have a certain volume of money available for lending in the com­ munity and the public sector demand for it is increased, then there will be as much impact on the price of that money as if the private sector's demand for it were increased. That is why this Government has been so concerned to reduce the overall demand made by Government on funds available in the community. That is why we have been concerned about the size of the Budget deficit. That is why since 1 975, largely through what has been done to reduce the size of the Budget deficit, we have reduced the overall public sector borrowing requirement from 6.5 per cent in 1 975-76 to an estimated 3.4 per cent in 1 980-8 1 . Most of that reduction has been on account of what the Commonwealth Government has done. In 1 975-76 the Commonwealth sector borrowing requirement accounted for 5 per cent of gross domestic product; in 1 980-8 1 that figure was down to only 1 . 5 per cent. In 1 975-76 the State and local sector accounted for 1 .4 per cent and that figure has risen to 1 .9 per cent in 1 980-8 1 . Over the last five years we have seen a reduction in the overall public sector borrowing require­ ment, all of which has been due to the reduction by the Commonwealth Government of its own Budget deficit and its own borrowing require­ ment. In fact, there has been an increase in the States. The Commonwealth has carried more than the lion's share of reducing the public sector borrowing requirement in the Australian com­ munity and has played more than its part in re­ ducing government pressure on funds. Of course, interest rates are higher now than they were some years ago. They are higher now than when the party to which the honourable member for Gellibrand belongs was in office. That is for the simple reason that when the Australian Labor Party was in office it cared not about how the money supply grew or about the level of infla­ tion but it was quite prepared to allow a huge un­ funded Budget deficit. It did not care one bit about the growth of the money supply, it did not care one bit about the effect of inflation and it did not care one bit about the consequences of that for investment and employment in the Australian community. I have said before, and it needs re­ peating in a debate such as this, that one cannot hope to control at the one time both the rate of growth in the money supply and the level of interest rates. We believe there is a link between the rate of growth of the money supply and the level of inflation. We are not obsessed by that link but it is a very important fundamental of our economic strategy, and we make absolutely no apology whatsoever for that. The honourable member for Gellibrand tried to take honourable members on a Cook's tour-a very selective one-to look at the performance of economies around the world. He neglected to tell the House that in growth, prospects, increases in the number of jobs and attracting investment across all sec­ tors, the Australian economy is doing far better than most others. Any objective analysis of econ­ omic conditions around the world at present would acknowledge that. One area of great concern to the Government is a too-rapid escalation of wages. A rate of growth of 1 4 per cent in average weekly earnings over the 1 2 months to the end of December is much too high. It is more than the Australian economy can afford. It diminishes the prospects for further re­ ducing the level of unemployment in Australia. [t will cost Australians jobs if it goes on unchecked and, coupled with the 35-hour week, it represents the greatest single threat to the economic recovery which on all other indicators is so clearly under way at this time. That is one of the reasons the Government is concerned to redouble its efforts to have a firm monetary policy. Of course we would like to see our money supply projection of 9 per cent to 1 1 per cent achieved, because we be­ lieve that that will make a very significant contri­ bution towards achieving the sort of economic stability and maintenance of investment levels so very important for the economic recovery now very much under way. The honourable member for Gellibrand, during his remarks, challenged me to produce some evidence of the link between controlling the money supply and the level of inflation. The best evidence is the evidence of which he is acutely aware-the evidence of the Labor years between 1 972 and 1 975 when there was absolutely no attempt to recognise that link and an absolutely irresponsible approach was taken towards allowing the money supply to ex­ pand. One of the consequences of that was an unacceptably high level of inflation. If the honourable member for Gellibrand is looking for hard evidence to establish the link, he has only to recall the experiences of that period and their consequences. I remind him again that he ought to look at some of the speeches that the now Leader of the Opposition made after he be­ came Treasurer. He ought to look at some of the speeches that the Leader of the Opposition made after he became the Leader of the Opposition. Is the honourable member for Gellibrand now ditching the Leader of the Opposition, as well as some of his other colleagues? The difference that has developed between the two of them on this subject is very interesting. The alternative Treasurer of this country has said today that there is absolutely no link between the rate of growth in the money supply and the level of inflation. He has said there is no evidence or economic theory to link the two. He ought to look very carefully at some of the speeches made by the Leader of the Opposition as far back as the time when he was Minister for Social Security in the Whitlam Government and no doubt coveting the position of Treasurer, when he quite regularly made speeches which certainly demonstrated a far more responsible approach to economic management than was being followed by the Treasurer of the time. In fact, there is a very important link be­ tween the rate of growth in the money supply and the level of inflation. The best contribution that any Government can make towards keeping interest rates down is to reduce its own borrowing demands on the Aus­ tralian financial markets. Every time an Oppo­ sition spokesman calls for more expenditure and more public sector borrowing by governments in Australia, in effect he is advocating more compe­ tition and therefore greater pressure on building societies, banks and other lending institutions to obtain funds. Apparently certain forms of press­ ure are acceptable and other forms are totally un­ acceptable. This Government has recognised from the outset that if one believes in allowing the private sector to provide the wherewithal for economic recovery, it has to be given room to move and to grow, and the demands of the public sector on the community have to be reduced. This Government shares in the regret expressed by the honourable member for Gellibrand about the present level of interest rates but one must ask what the real alternative is. The honourable member for Gellibrand would simply leave interest rates where they are; he would not have any real money supply target, he would com­ pletely dismiss any connection between the rate of growth of the money supply and the level of infla­ tion and would imagine that by following that pol­ icy somehow all would be well in the end. Of course, that is fairyland stuff. It was fairyland stuff when it was tried a few years ago and it would be fairyland stuff if it were tried again. We would be back to the levels of inflation that were experienced then. This Government has recog­ nised that the price of money is dictated by the forces of supply and demand, and to do otherwise is to be totally unrealistic and to fly the economic experience of this country Over the past few years and to fly in the face-MONICA",36
63,Mr YOUNG ,INTEREST RATES ON HOME LOAN REPAYMENTS,"That is not what you said at elec­ tion time. What about your promises at election time? MI' HOWARD-What [ said at Budget time, and what the Government will say at the time of the next Budget, is that there remains a very im­ portant link between the rate of growth of the money supply and the level of inflation in Australia. The honourable member for Port Adelaide invites me to say what we said at elec­ tion time on the subject of interest rates. The honourable member for Port Adelaide will know very well that at that time. I made it very plain that the Government was making no guarantees whatsoever about the future level of interest rates. We reasserted then, as I do now without any qualification at all, our commitment to the pur­ suit of firm monetary policies as the most effective anti-inflationary weapon. At that time the honourable member for Gellibrand took issue with it and the Australian people made their judgment.",38

65,Mr STREET ,POLICY,"Corangamite-Minister for Foreign Affairs) �by leave-It is now five months since I was appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs; not long enough to justify a com­ prehensive survey of Australia's foreign relations and interests, but long enough, and full enough, to justify my setting out some preliminary im­ pressions concerning the nature of this country's foreign policy and some of the more urgent tasks facing it. The first thing that is brought home very forcibly to a new Minister for Foreign Affairs is the complexity which Australia's external re­ lations have now assumed. In this respect there has been a profound change in recent years. The much tighter integration of the international com­ munity; the gradual recognition of interdepen­ dence and the emergence of institutions to man­ age it; the development of Australia itself; changes in our region-all these have moved us rapidly to the stage where Australia is now a sig­ nificant middle power with a range and depth of relations comparable to any country, other than a in the face of handful of great powers. Today our foreign policy is concerned increasingly not only with the classic issues of se­ curity and political relations, but also with trade and aid, with energy and food, with immigration and refugees, and with communications and transport. In its role as a middle power, Australia needs a foreign policy which encompasses not just bilateral relations but the multilateral diplomacy of international organisations and blocs of coun­ tries acting together. And, of course, it continues to include the day to day problems of individual people which assume even greater proportions as the personal contacts between nations rapidly increase. In a general sense, of course, this is well known, but we need to come to terms with what such a wide-ranging or total foreign policy means; what implications it carries in terms of co-ordination; the balancing of differing and sometimes compet­ ing interests, the addressing of multiple audiences, and the use of scarce human resources. Increasing complexity also makes it more important than ever to have a clear sense of Australia's national interest, defined in an enlightened and long term way, so that we can determine our priorities sensibly. I believe that it is essential to understand the needs that have to be served by the foreign policy of a middle power such as Australia. If we are to get things right in what, by general consensus, is going to be a difficult and dangerous decade, the gap between the complexity of our foreign policy, as it really is, and public perception and discussion of that policy must be narrowed. I intend to give this matter careful consider­ ation, to see what can be done on the Govern­ ment's side, to stimulate and promote discussion of the issues which face us. I have just referred to Australia as a significant middle power. This has become a familiar term of self-definition in recent years, but I do not think that we give sufficient attention to what such a status implies, what characteristics a middle power has as an actor on the world scene. The first point to make is that the designation 'middle power' refers to one's overall global pos­ ition and one's status in terms of the whole range of international issues. It does not define a nation's importance in terms of particular issues or circumstances. The 'weight' of a middle power can be very considerable indeed within its region-as ours is in South East Asia and the South West Pacific. It can be very considerable in a particular forum-as ours is in the Common­ wealth. And it can be very considerable in relation to particular resources-again, as ours is in re­ lation to food and energy. In contrast, of course, on a range of other international matters our sig­ nificance is less. This considerable variability in 'weight', depending on the issue and the circum­ stance, is one of the key characteristics of a middle power. It is one which demands very considerable judgment and flexibility in assessing situations and Australia's response to them. Closely allied to this, and again pointing to the need for sure judgment, is the fact that the bal­ ance of opportunities and constraints facing a middle power is more complicated and ambiguous than it is for either the very small or the very powerful. A middle power has more opportuni­ ties, and therefore more temptations to overreach itself, than a small power; and it faces more con­ straints, and therefore greater danger that it will be unduly cautious and timid, than a great power. Certainly the problem of striking and maintaining a proper, realistic balance between opportunity and constraint is at the core of . middle power diplomacy. Both these characteristics point to a third feature of middle power foreign policy. That quality of performance is particularly important in determining influence and status. Great powers are, almost by definition, going to be important in any event; while lack of power sets definite limits on the influence of small countries. But the variable positions of middle powers mean that how seriously they are taken and what impact they have on events in which they are involved will depend largely on the quality of human performance-on the skill, knowledge, maturity, determination and imagination of those who for­ mulate and implement their policies. Obviously this means that it is essential that the conduct of Australia's foreign policy at the pro­ fessional level be of a high standard. But it means more-much more-than that. It means that in the kind of society Australia is-the values it embodies; the degree of consen­ sus and bipartisanship that exists within it; the clarity with which its national interests are per­ ceived; the kind of leadership it enjoys; and, if I may use an old-fashioned but indispensible term, the quality of its patriotism-these things have a great bearing on the effectiveness of our foreign policy. In other words, we should not think of the term 'middle power' in fixed terms, as implying a given status which cannot be changed one way or another. The human factor is vital; it can enhance or diminish us very significantly as international actors. My fourth point is that the range of issues on which we, as a middle power, can and should COli­ centrate substantively is necessarily limited, be­ cause our resources are limited. We must be selec­ tive and resist both temptation from within and pressure from without to extend ourselves unrealistically. The issues on which we can act in this sense must be determined by our national interest and will usually be in our region or will re­ late to · special political, strategic or economic interests that we have. Having said that, however, it is important to go on to make a distinction be­ tween the scope of the substantive policies I have been discussing and the scope of what might be called declaratory policies. By declaratory policies I am referring to the ob­ ligation of a middle power to declare its position on all major issues-issues of war and peace, free­ dom and oppression, racialism, development and poverty. Australia's interests are now sufficiently wide-ranging and our status is sufficiently recog­ nised for it to be not only legitimate but also proper for us to do just that-proper because ultimately those issues can have a serious impact on us, as indeed history has repeatedly demon­ strated in this century, and proper also because, in some circumstances, a middle power can be more effective than a great power, precisely because it does not bring too much power to bear on the situ­ ation and does not automatically engage the interest of other great powers. Our intervention in the Zimbabwe conflict was a clear case in point. I believe that this is important in considering the opportunities available to a middle power: In some situations limited power is an asset rather than a liability. In making the distinction between substantive and declaratory policies, it is important to point out that it is a serious mistake to think of the first as the only ones which are real and important and of the second as merely a matter of posturing. If we have not yet learnt that words, symbols and arguments representing genuinely and strongly held views are important in international affa·irs, we have learnt very little. The history of this country has demonstrated that they are often crucial. My next observation is that for a middle power like Australia which is allied to a superpower, the management of that relationship constitutes a particularly important part of its diplomacy. The ANZUS alliance receives bipartisan support in this country and it is eminently desirable that it should continue to do so. While the alliance is reinforced by ties of friendship and cultural similarities, it is based firmly on considerations of national interest. That is not to say, of course, that Australia's national interests and those of the United States always coincide. Indeed, it would assist the management of the alliance relationship if it were appreciated that differences must exist in an alliance between powers of a very different magnitude. Far from being peculiar to the Australian-American relationship, it is entirely normal. It derives from the necessary trade-offs between the desire to maximise the benefits of co­ operation and shared interests on the one hand, and the concern to safeguard independence of action on the other. We should neither deny the existence of these differences nor engage in para­ noid exaggeration concerning them. We should rather accept them as a part of life and work out our policies accordingly, appreciating as we do that our superpower ally is a free, democratic and pluralistic country. Quite clearly the development of this middle power concept is closely linked to the practical formulation of foreign policy. I turn now to some of the issues which are cur­ rently in the forefront of Australian foreign pol­ icy. In doing so I shall not try to be comprehensive but shall focus on those aspects which my pattern of visits to date has highlighted. The first one is Kampuchea. In the last five months I have had the oportunity of discussing this question in four member countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations, as well as in Tokyo, Peking and Washington. That is, I have discussed it in every like-minded country, apart from New Zealand and Singapore, that has a serious interest in the maintenance of peace and stability in South East Asia. Naturally, I will be looking to discuss the issue of Kampuchea with those two countries at the earliest opportunity. During my recent visit to the United States I also had the opportunity to have a very useful discussion on Kampuchea with the United Nations Secretary-General, Dr Waldheim. Australia regards the implementation of the United Nations Resolution on Kampuchea as essential for the restoration of peace in the region. I want to stress that on the basic issues involved in Kampuchea, our interests coincide with the countries I have mentioned. There should be no misunderstanding about this, either in Australia or outside it, or about the meaning of our derecog­ nition last month of the so-called Government of Democratic Kampuchea. That act of derecogni­ tion was based on two considerations, one moral and one practical. Morally, the regime in question was so repugnant that we felt that continuing rec­ ognition was unjustifiable; practically, as long as the question of recognition remained unsettled it would confuse and distract attention from the basic strategic and political questions at issue. Powerful as these considerations were, the bal­ ance of arguments was not clear cut. Against them, the Government had to weigh the opinions and interests of the other countries in the region which share our basic interests. Some of them are much closer to the sharp end than we are and have had to bear a much greater burden as the re­ sult of what has happened to Kampuchea. This affected the timing of our act of derecognition. The Government makes no apology for this but I want to make it clear beyond any doubt and ambi­ guity that our opposition to Vietnam's invasion of Kampuchea remains implacable. We reject outright that that invasion proceeded on the basis of a concern for the welfare of the Khmer people. We reject outright the claim that the Heng Samrin regime, which the invasion installed, is the legitimate representative of the Khmer people. We deplore and oppose the continued Vietnamese occupation of Kampuchea because it denies the independence of the Khmer people, because it affects the security of Thailand and other Asian countries, because it holds the threat of Vietnamese hegemony in the region and because it imports a Soviet strategic presence into the re­ gion. In this last respect, I draw attention not only to the significant strategic presence which the Soviet Union has now achieved in Indo-China, but to the fact that Vietnam launched its invasion of Kampuchea only after it had signed a so-called treaty of friendship and co-operation with the Soviet Union. It was this which gave it the secur­ ity guarantee against China which was a condition for its attack. We deeply regret Vietnam's refusal to accom­ modate the legitimate interests and concerns of its neighbours and to play a more constructive and co-operative role in the region. In the end Viet­ nam itself will be the greatest loser as a result of its actions, in terms of isolation internationally and from its neighbours, and of domestic economic difficulties and social strains, which have been identified as causes for serious concern by the Vietnamese authorities themselves. Australia will continue to support actively the interests of the ASEAN countries in restoring stability to the re­ gion and the implementation of the United Nations resolution on Kampuchea. With respect to the region, we want nothing but the restoration of peace and stability, the conditions which will allow its prosperity to grow-but we are serious in wanting that. We will watch carefully the efforts to create a new political grouping of Khmers­ what is sometimes referred to as a 'third force'­ and will naturally review our position if the situ­ ation changes significantly. In January I visited two great Asian powers situated further to the north-Japan and China. I was pleased to have confirmed that with both of these ancient and formidable nations Australia has been able to establish a sound relationship, based in both cases on mutual economic advan­ tage, goodwill, and a degree of common percep­ tion of the international scene. With Japan, of course, we have more in common-in terms of similar democratic and free enterprise insti� tutions, of our relations with the United States, and the way we view events on the mainland of Asia. China is a participant in those events, and a most important one. Our interests and China's are not always the same, but as I said we have many perceptions in common-concern about Soviet policies and intentions, for example, and a wish to see stability in East Asia. Honourable members will be aware of recent reports of the results of the re-examination of economic policies and priorities that has been going on in China and the restraints which have resulted from this. As far as Australia's own com­ mercial interests in China are concerned, the pol­ icy of restraint could well lead to a reduction in demand for some commodities supplied from Australia, but these reductions seem likely to be limited, and Chinese interest in economic and technological co-operation with Australia re­ mains high. It is not an easy task for China's leaders to maintain a steady policy course, given the scale of the problems they face and the awakened aspir­ ations of their people for a better and more pre­ dictable life. However, after the convulsions and distortions of the Cultural Revolution, more prag­ matic leaders, who seek to meet these aspirations, have emerged. China's present leaders now look back with bitterness at the years of the Cultural Revolution and its wasted efforts. Vice-Chairman Deng Xiaoping told me in January that it would take longer to undo the harmful effects of the Cul­ tural Revolution than it had to cause them. De­ spite this, Chinese leaders were resolute in saying that they were facing up to the task of rehabili­ tation, were conscious of the demands of their people, and that broad policy lines would not change. I found these statements welcome. I be­ lieve that it is in our broad political and strategic interest, as well as in our bilateral commercial interest, that China maintain its outward-looking orientation and 'Window to the West'. When I refer to strategic interests, I have in mind the glo­ bal balance, the Asia-Pacific area, and North Asia in particular, where four great powers-China, Japan, the Soviet Union and the United States­ are all involved, and where China's favourable disposition is of considerable importance. I turn now to the question of our relationship with the United States under the new Administra­ tion. Recently, as honourable members will know, I have had the opportunity of speaking to several of the key foreign policy and national security members of the Administration, including Vice­ President Bush, Secretaries Haig and Weinberger and Ambassador Kirkpatrick. The first point I should make is that I gained a clear impression from my private discussions that what these im­ portant members of the Administration have been saying in public is not merely rhetoric for its own sake. They mean what they say, they believe that important changes are required in American foreign policy, and they will not easily be deflected from their course. The Administration is proceeding in a very deliberate way and I believe that the end result of the series of comprehensive policy reviews now in train will be a greater de­ gree of predictability in the content and conduct of American foreign policy. This is a development which Australia, for its part, will welcome. Secondly, I was struck by the extent to which the philosophical perspectives and the analysis of the international situation of the Reagan A d m in is t r at i o n and of the Australian Government-as set out in a series of statements over the last five years-coincide. I refer particu­ larly to a shared concern about the grave impli­ cations of the remorseless military build-up by the Soviet Union; about the need to maintain a mili­ tary balance as a condition for stability and effec­ tive negotiations; about the need to improve con­ sultation and co-ordination within the Western Alliance; about the need for purposeful American leadership; and about the need to pay close atten­ tion to crisis situations outside the West itself. Thirdly, I was left with the very firm impression that the attitude of the new Administration to military power is not-I repeat not-that there should be early recourse to it in order to settle dis­ putes. On the contrary, it is that the possession of adequate power is desirable precisely because it reduces the chances of armed conflict. It is be­ lieved, and the Australian Government shares this belief, that it is uncertainty, vacillation, disunity and weakness which increase the prospect of war by inviting expansionist, aggressive behaviour by states seeking to change the balance of power to their own advantage. Preparedness and evident resolution diminish the prospect of war. I stress this point because, either inadvertently or deliberately, it is often misrepresented. There are always some who, �hile they find it possible to re­ main silent in the face of huge military efforts on the part of the Soviet Union, raise the cry of war­ mongering whenever the West shows any sign of matching that effort. Fourthly, the new Administration believes that the various elements of foreign policy-economic matters, human rights, strategic and political questions-cannot be treated as separate and dis­ tinct but that they must all be seen as components of the whole. This may be the most valid meaning of that much used concept 'linkage'. Currently, this is particularly relevant to the way in which the issues at stake in Central America are viewed. For our part, the Australian Government believes that human rights issues are of the greatest im­ portance. But we also believe it wrong to assume that economic reform issues and human rights can be divorced from questions of security and strat­ egy. That distinction does not serve the cause of strengthening these rights. There are precious few human rights in the Soviet Union and Cuba, and in the regimes they support and install. Lastly, the fact that there is broad agreement between the Australian Government and the Reagan Administration on the analysis and evalu­ ation of international affairs, should not be taken as implying that there will be automatic or across­ the-board agreement between us. The very nature of international politics means we shan have our differences. Our perspectives as a regional power, as a developed country with almost exclusively Third World neighbours, and as a member of a multi-racial Commonwealth will necessarily differ from those of a global superpower on occasions. As an ally of the United States we will continue to pursue as helpful and co-operative a role as possible in the responses of the United States and the West generally to particular situ­ ations as they emerge. At the same time, however, Australia will seek to make its contribution on the basis of an independent national judgment, as is currently the case in the Indian Ocean. Equally important, Australian assistance can only be on the basis of complete consistency with Australia's national interests and the maintenance of our national sovereignty. I believe that these realities are well understood and accepted in Washington. The fourth and last issueor complex of issues-that I want to touch on is that of North­ South relations. This is an area where Australia, as a middle power and an active and important trading nation, can play a role. Among developed countries Australia has distinctive interests. They derive from OUf geographical position and the re­ gional concerns flowing from it, as well as some features of our own economy. But there are also vital global interests to be served in efforts to re­ solve North-South issues. This Government is deeply committed to the view that the peace and stability of the world between now and the end of this century will depend to a very considerable extent on progress towards easing the tensions be­ tween developed and developing countries. Efforts must be made to assist the developing world to solve its problems. Only those with an interest in instability and conflict will benefit if progress is not made. Promoting the evolution of a better and more equitable international economic order also holds out the prospect of benefits for both North and South. Assisting the South to realise its full poten­ tial will provide significant economic opportuni­ ties for the North. It has to be recognised that in some important respects, this year is not pro­ pitious for North-South dialogue. There are increasing pressures on scarce budget resources and trends towards restriction of trading oppor­ tunities which made progress more difficult. The combination of serious economic difficulties in developing countries, including continuing infla­ tion and reduced growth rates, with increased East-West tension centred on Afghanistan, Poland and El Salvador, has distracted attention from North-South issues and created an un­ favourable climate. Impatience and cynicism feed off each other. The Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting which is to be held in Melbourne in Sep­ tember will provide a unique opportunity this year for leaders from both North and South to transform the dialogue over North-South issues into practical measures. At the last Common­ wealth Heads of Government Meeting in Lusaka, two years ago, those present succeeded in resolv­ ing the problem of Zimbabwe. Until then it had defeated all efforts at solution. In the same way I hope that at Melbourne the leaders of the Com­ monwealth will succeed in making that meeting a significant landmark with respect to North-South issues. We should certainly aim for such a result. We would want to see such progress translated into effective and sustainable practical programs which would help to mobilise national and inter­ national efforts in the development task. Return­ ing to the point which I stressed earlier, it may be that a determined initiative by a number of middle powers has a better chance of getting things moving in present circumstances. Certainly Australia, as host, will try to give a resolute lead that direction. Mr Deputy Speaker, in concluding what has been in the nature of an interim report to Parlia­ ment, I would like to say that in the visits I have so far paid to heads of government and Foreign Min­ isters I have been very struck by the regard and re­ spect paid to Australia. I think the point is worth making because, while we have in the past oc­ casionally exaggerated our importance in the world, more often we are inclined to indulge our Australian gift for scepticism and deflation by insisting on our comparative insignificance. This is not only self-damaging, it is plain wrong. We are, as I have been at pains to emphasise, a significant middle power. There is an important role for us to play in our region, in the Western alliance, in the Commonwealth, in the United Nations and in the North-South dialogue. We must have the will to respond to the challenge, and the determination to make the most of our opportunities. I present the following paper: Foreign Policy-Ministerial Statement, 24 March 198 1 . Motion (by Mr Hodgman) proposed: That the House take note of the paper. Motion (by Mr Hodgman)-by leave-agreed to: That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the Deputy Leader of the Opposition speaking for a period not exceeding 27 minutes.",38
66,Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,POLICY,"Kingsford-Smith) (4.57)-We have heard an interim report, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs ( Mr Street) de­ scribed it, covering his five months in office. He has paid considerable attention to the fact that we now define ourselves a middle power. In fact, some eight pages of the speech is devoted to defi­ ning a middle power. He has also raised the ques­ tion of Australia being an actor on the world stage. The problem with that sort of reference, of course, is that actors often fail. Their words might be effective, but their performance might be very limited indeed. I think the most significant part of what the Minister has said is that we have our own national interests to look after, and that we have consider­ able weight in S outh East Asia . Having highlighted those words, I want to make the point in my submission that the Government has not acted in accordance with its words. It was about page 1 4 of the speech before the Minister referred to the new Reagan Administration. J want to deal with it from the beginning. The Foreign Minister spoke of the policies of the Reagan Administration. He does not seem to understand that our ally has a vastly different set in of policies now from what it had four months ago. These drastic changes in the way that Washington sees the world have the most serious implications for Australia. It is amazing to note that, as the Minister has now said, there is broad agreement between the Australian Government and the Reagan Administration on the analysis �nd the evaluation of international affairs. There was ap­ parently broad agreement between this Govern­ ment and the Carter Administration a mere five months ago. The inevitable conclusion is that since American policies have changed so drasti­ cally in the short intervening period we do not have an independent foreign policy but an imitat­ ive and subservient one. A deadly serious choice is facing us. Will we use our influence to counsel moderation, to urge a new search for easing inter­ national tensions-detente or the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty was not mentioned in any part of the Minister's speech-or will we, as this Government is doing, take actions and enter into agreements which will encourage i ncreased mis­ trust between the super-powers and trigger a new and criminally expensive arms race ultimately operating against our interests by increasing in­ stability in this region of the world? It is becomiflg apparent that if a major international disaster is to be averted middle powers such as Australia must play an increasingly important role. Australia's importance has increased substantially in the past five years largely because of its resources. It will increase even more in the next decade. The American alliance is important, but it is not, and cannot be, a substitute or an excuse for a vigorous policy of independently assessing our own interests. Super-powers such as the United States and the Soviet Union tend to export insta­ bility and resolve their conflicting interests in places remote from their own territories; for example, in Africa, the Middle East, the Gulf, and in South East Asia. We are still living with the very real problems of Vietnam and Kampuchea. Kampuchea was the first matter mentioned by the Minister. Those problems still affect the United States but pose more ominous problems for the countries of this region, not the least of which is Australia. The United States, like every great power, will put its interests first. Anyone who thinks other­ wise has a simplistic and naive view of the inter­ national arena. It is we who must worry most about the stability of our region. The easy answer-to leave our powerful ally to call the strategic shots-unfortunately is clearly the wrong answer. We already have a number of United States bases in Australia, a subject which I will canvass at some later time. We are contributing substan­ tially to the ANZUS alliance. Do we really be­ lieve that the staging of nuclear weapons through­ out Australia, the contingency against which the B52 agreement has been entered into, will con­ tribute to stability in our part of the world? It will not. If anything, it will encourage the Soviet Union to escalate its involvement with Vietnam to counter that perceived threat. It will decrease respect · among our regional neighbours for our independence of judgment and, consequently, it will lessen the respect with which our · voice is heard in regional councils. It will be a major con­ tribution to escalating a new cold war between the super-powers and in our region · provoking increased instability. When · I com�enced my speech I said that United States policies have fundamentally changed. The Minister for Foreign Affairs should realise that the United States strategic world view has fundamentally changed. For the past four months we have witnessed the most dramatic changes in American attitudes, not only in the rhetoric of General Haig but also in the American activities around the world. There emerge� II clear pattern : Intervention in EI Salvador to prop up a government which, according to the testimony of the United States Ambassador, an experienced and professional man, had slaughtered thousands of its own people; increased armaments and mili­ tary assistance to the Middle East and to the Gulf; an amount of $600m committed in additional arms supplies to Saudi Arabia; additional military aid for. Egypt and Israel; a mooted decision to supply .arms directly to Afghanistan; increased support for South Africa and its repugnant poli­ cies; the establishment of new American bases and the enlargement of old ones in the Horn of Afriqa, in the Gulf and in the Indian Ocean; dra­ matically increased support for the military dic­ tatorships and juntas of Latin America; a return to the Cold War rhetoric of the 1 950s in relation to the Soviet Union; and, finally, the establish­ ment of staging facilities for long range strategic nuclear bombers in Australia. All these events make it absolutely clear that the United States is determined to increase its power in every region of the world. But are these increases hi Australia's interests ? Perhaps it would be comforting to believe that the United States fights for peace, justice and human rights and that the Soviet Union is an unprincipled ag­ gressor. That the latter is true in the case of Afghanistan unfortunately does not make the former proposition tenable. We have witnessed in Washington unprincipled and transparent policy reversals which scrap human rights as an instru­ ment of foreign policy and substitute supposedly an all-out attack on terrorism. The problem we face is that General Haig includes amongst those he calls 'terrorists' patriots who oppose dictatorial governments-governments that the United States supports because they further its own interests and strategic designs. Let me be more specific. Washington supports dictatorships or military juntas in South Korea, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and a score of other countries. It is providing them with increased military assist­ ance and weapons which will be used to crush any dissident opinion, or those who attempt to establish a democracy. But Washington encour­ ages or is about to encourage terrorist activities against such internationally recognised govern­ ments as that of Angola because that Government is socialist or Marxist or perhaps just because it is not in an American alliance. The Australian Labor Party has never held and will not hold any brief for the Soviet Union. We deplore its abuses of human rights and its invasion of weaker countries. We equally deplore any simple-minded attachment to the United States as the paragon of virtue. Our foreign policy has to be based on a realistic appraisal of the faults of both countries and on a willingness to break ranks with the United States when it acts in a way which fos­ ters instability in Asia and the Pacific. The Foreign Minister has implied quite clearly that we should trust Washington. But we must learn from the lessons of recent history how governments in Washington behave, how they pursue their own interests, and how they have made tragic mis­ takes. It is quite wrong for us to be always follow­ ing the United States ship, no matter who its cap­ tain is or what course it takes. Will the Americans really come to our aid in the time of a crunch? I wish to place this matter in perspective. In the early 1 960s the then Australian Foreign Minister, Mr Barwick, returned from Washington and an­ nounced that the United States would support us if we were attacked by the Indonesians. Those were the days of confrontation between Indonesia and Malaysia. Subsequently, it emerged that Mr Barwick had received a secret assurance to this effect from the American Secretary of State, Dean Rusk a secret assurance which was lodged in the safe in the Embassy in Washington. Some time later President Kennedy became aware of the agreement and he countermanded his Sec­ retary of State and made it clear that the Americans would not feel bound by the ANZUS Treaty to come to our aid in such an event. This incident gives cause for a long and careful pause because the ANZUS alliance does not com­ mit anybody to active involvement in anything other than through consultation. Perhaps we should reflect also upon the fact that when Presi­ dent Nixon and Secretary of State Kissinger de­ cided to bomb Cambodia they did not even inform their own Cabinet. Is it any wonder that the American people so revolted against those people who so deceived their own nation that they were thrown out of office? Their policies operated throughout South East Asia and certainly brought about the undoing of Sihanouk in Kampuchea. The Foreign Minister is naive, and dangerously so, if he is asking this Parliament to base our foreign policy on implicitly trusting the American leaders as they change from time to time. Within the last few weeks Washington has offered $ 1 5 billion in additional weapons and mili­ tary aid to Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia. The tremendous danger is that the new Administration in Washington is attempting to impose military solutions on every type of regional problem. United States defence spending next year will be 30 per cent of Federal spending. We have to look at what is happening in the United States. Is not the best defence the wel­ fare of one's own people? In its same Budget the United States has slashed the concessions to the victims of black lung disease-the miners, by $378m. That is where there is a lack of balance and understanding. One can well lose the defence of one's country by a malaise from within. We want to be able to say to new Administrations in the United States: 'Do not forsake diplomacy. Do not forswear subtlety for a simplistic and militar­ istic approach'. The present policies of the United States smack of not only excessive simplicity but also ill-considered haste. We are concurring in­ stead of vigorously urging policies which will not create further instability in our part of the world. But the West Germans did not do that. Last week the West German Foreign Minister urged Gen­ eral Haig not to become so obsessed with the mili­ tary build up that he neglected arms control. We have not made any such representations and we should do so. We are in the process of becoming a major power "" in South East Asia-we already are a major power in the South Pacificbut we have not taken any initiatives commensurate with our status and regional responsibilities. No one pre­ tends that the problems in Vietnam and Kam­ puchea have easy solutions. But if we moved to re­ establish our program of aid to Vietnam we would have some influence and capacity for initiative in that area. In order to retain our capacity for in­ itiative we must preserve a substantial degree of independence. If we lock ourselves in completely with the United States of America strategic view of the world-if we become, as we are in danger of becoming, a South Pacific outpost for Washington-we cannot expect to be taken seriously by our regional neighbours. It is about time we formulated our own strategic view and acted accordingly. In the Middle East the United States Govern­ ment has now promised another $600m in arma­ ments for Saudi Arabia. Naturally, that worries Tel Aviv, so another $600m in military aid is given to Israel. That, in turn, worries Sadat in Egypt, so another $ 1 .65 billion in 'security assistance' is given to Egypt. What a recipe for regional insta­ bility! General Haig has even indicated that he plans to ov'er-arm Israel to deter future adventures by Libya, Syria or other radical Arabs. Is that not a recipe for disaster? No doubt the American economy will improve as the world's biggest arms factories gear up to full international conflict level. Given the way in which Washing­ ton works and the power of the armaments lobby there, we develop a healthy cynicism about cur­ rent United States policy. One of President Reagan's aides admitted this last week: So far the perception we've created is one of willy-nilly shovelling arms all over the world. How true, but how tragic. The Minister in his speech referred to this belief of the Reagan Administration: . . . that the various elements of foreign policy­ economil4,matters, human rights, strategic and political ques­ tions ,, ' . . must all be seen as components of the whole. He continued: There are precious few human rights in the Soviet Union and Cuba, and in the regimes they support and install. We could say: 'True, but what about China, South America and a number of other areas'. His sum­ mary would have been much more impressive and balanced had he pointed out that there are precious few human rights under most of the regimes which the United States supports-as I said, particularly those in Latin America and Asia. A close examination of the report of the Human Rights Commission in Geneva will reveal that of the many countries which systematically practise torture, the majority are supported by the new American Administration. The fact is that the military dictatorship has be­ come the dominant form of government in those sectors of the Third World which are geographi­ cally and politically closest to the United States. It cannot last. Why is it that a government has to get arms to suppress its people? How can that poss­ ibly last when the only solution for those people is to turn to communism and revolution, which has always been the solution, without any regard for human rights and democratic rights? It is most disturbing that the Minister said: It has to be recognised that in some important respects year is not propitious for the North-South dialogue. We hear that from the wealthy countries every year. No year will ever be propitious. Meanwhile, millions of people will starve. The Australian Labor Party has always had policies which relate to humanity and human rights. Ours is a party of concern. This Govern­ ment should not delay any longer making a generous response to the needs of the poorest countries. This Government's performance in providing assistance to the developing world is now at the lowest level it has ever been, This Government is not moving towards meeting the assistance target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product set by the United Nations; it is moving away from it. Its allocation is now down to 0.4 per cent of GNP. The level was highest under the Labor Government. I agree with the Minister in his statement that it is essential that: . . , the conduct of Australia's foreign policy at the pro­ fessional level be of a high standard, But what are the facts? I believe our professional officers are doing their best, but the Government's policies in those areas have led to more than 50 of our career officers recently resigning or transfer­ ring. That is a development which has weakened our ability even to conduct a foreign policy of a high standard. Perhaps for the most glaring example of this weakness we should return to the situation in Washington. In spite of the Jact that we have there a number of diplomatic officers, and 200 representatives of the Department of De­ fence and of the armed Services, there is not one person reporting, on a regular basis, changes in the strategic policies of our American allies, It is those policies that determine whether we get in­ volved in a war, yet we have nobody there report­ ing from that very source. The Foreign Minister devoted a substantial part of his speech to the issue of Kampuchea. I have been to the Kampuchea border. [ have also been to Vietnam and to Thailand and I have been in the camps catering for the unfortunate ref­ ugees. What I want to say now is based on that sort of knowledge. There are glaring omissions in the Minister's analysis. He does not recognise the issues at the heart of the Kampuchean problem, namely, firstly, the attempts by the Pol Pot regime between 1 975 and 1 978 to destroy its own people; and secondly, the rescue of the survivors of the Khmer people by Vietnam. The Minister de­ scribed the Pol Pot regime as morally repugnant. That is mild language indeed for a regime which, in a genocidal fury, slaughtered or starved to death more than three million of its own people. I invite the Minister to go to the refugee camps of this the Khmers and ask them who they fear the most. He will find that it is Pol Pot. The Minister did not spell out the horrifying statistics of the Kam­ puchean tragedy. Further, he made no apology for the continued recognition of the Pol Pot regime long after it had been driven from power and long after its massive crimes had been revealed to a shocked world. The Minister claimed that the balance of arguments for derecognition of Pol Pot was not clear cut. How much more appalling does international behav­ iour have to be to make a recognition issue clear"" cut? Again, the Minister said that the Govermnent's opposition to Vietnam's invasion of Kampuchea was implacable. That is a strong word. It is unqualified by any recognition that the inter7 vention of Vietnam saved the survivors of the Kampuchean people. Is Vietnam to get no credit or even recognition of that fact? Further, the Minister rejected any suggestion-and it was not one made by Labor-that the Heng Samrin Administration represented the Khmer people. The Heng Samrin Administration has struggled to get Kampuchea back on the road to recovery. It gets no credit from the Minister yet his Govern­ ment recognised as the legitimate representative of the Khmer people an exiled junta of genocidal fanatics. This points up the contradiction in the Minister's speech and it makes his analysis pitiful indeed. Having finally steeled itself to withdraw Aus­ tralian diplomatic support from the Pol Pot regime, the Government has taken no steps towards a settlement, ' towards a solution in Indo China. Of course, Labor has long advocated derecognition. What the Government has fol­ lowed is Labor's policy, and I suggest that it now follow another Labor policy. Labor advocates an independent Australian initiative. We shOUld aim as our highest diplomatic priority in Asia to ar­ range a regional conference on the Indo-China issue as a forerunner of a larger conference which would have to include the United States, the Soviet Union and China. Australia should strive to play the part of the honest broker in this issue. That is not beyond the capacity of a middle power as the Minister correctly describes Australia. Ac­ cordingly, we should be setting about persuading the Association of South East Asian Nations states and Vietnam to confer on the Kampuchean issue. Such a conference could aim at the with­ drawal of the Vietnamese, linked to cast iron guarantees that the Pol Pot forces would also' be disarmed and prevented from rushing back into the vacuum created. The conference should aim also at a genuine act of self-determination within Kampuchea. The Minister mentioned the possibility of a Thin! Force emerging in the affairs of Kam­ puchea. But the history of Indo-china since 1 945 shows that the Third Force idea is rriainly wishful thinking. It failed in Vietnam and in Laos. In Kampuchea itself the United States destroyed the neutrality of Kampuchea under Prince Sihanouk. The Minister rightly pointed to the risk of inter­ national isolation of Vietnam but he suggested nothi!1g to prevent it. Australia itself is at fault in helping to force Vietnam into isolation. Our petty and thoughtless action in cutting off our aid to Vietnam in 1 979 is not, of course, to be compared with the ruthless breaking of United States prom­ ises of post-war aid to Vietnam. Overall, the Minister's remarks on Kampuchea are marked by double standards and a lack of compassion. In the case of Vietnam, we can detect the lingering animosity of a member of a party which saw its policies on Vietnam totally discredited, totally defeated, totally humiliated, and which towards the end of that war, helped lead his party to political defeat. The offensive in Vietnam was to stop the downward thrust of China, the new found ally of this Government. That is the point. This Government bears towards Vietnam an obvious animosity, but rancour is no basis for foreign policy. Not one Minister of this Government has ever visited . Hanoi. A lame duck ambassador is in Hanoi because of the Government's attitude towards Vietnam. The;; Government ought to re­ member that people'are entitled to aid. If there is another thrust by China against Vietnam, Australia will receive millions of refugees. Where is the substance of the Government's policy in that event? Where is the influence that will stop trat happening?' It will not be solved by B52 bombers because the Government has already dealt with them. We have to make it clear that Vietnam is the most important power in South East Asia. Our neighbours in ASEAN will agree with that.'What is the 'Government's policy? It is so short-sighted and so mean-spirited that it is contrary to Australia's best interests. The Aus­ tralian people will remember that the parties which comprise this Government took a gener­ ation to recognise the realities of China-indeed, to recognise it at all. ' Fortunately, our national interests will not have to wait that long again to be properly protected by realistic and constructive policies towards Vietnam. The next Labor government will treat relations with Vietnam with the importance and urgency they deserve.",43
67,Mr HODGMAN ,POLICY,It will be a long time off.,47
68,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,POLICY,"It will not be a long time off because the issues are very close to our shores. If the Government thinks it can solve the problems by pitting bombers against flesh and blood it is gravely mistaken. The Vietnamese fought for 30 years against the French and every­ body else, and the Government ought to realise that. Specifically, the Minister's speech raised the prospect of Australia, as a middle power, having an independent foreign policy but it did not follow through with any initiatives. It is on that basis that I make the point that it is about time Australia de­ veloped independent foreign policies which will bring peace and stability into the South East Asian region. It has to exercise its own initiative. It should not leave it to somebody else. This Government has to pursue initiatives that are in accordance with Australia's interests and Australian public opinion. By so doing we will be­ come a better ally to the United States. We will lessen the burden that the Haigs and others want to impose on the American people by the stupid suggestion that the way to peace is through war and that the way to detente is through an escala­ tion of arms. It is a fallacy. It will not work. The American people will reject it before long. It is about time a government in this region stood up and stated: 'We are an ally but because we live in this region we have views which are much more fundamentally orientated to the truth and to the valid claims of the region than those of any high­ powered general or somebody who espouses the cause of democracy in the world when it is failing so fast'. What a tragedy it is that all the wars fought in South Korea or Vietnam have done ' notliirig but bring about dictatorships and com­ munism. They have failed at every level. If people are not granted human rights and a chance to de­ velop their capacity to run their own countries totalitarian regimes are created. It is about time General Haig and others started talking again, as Carter did, about human rights and democracy and about giving aid when promised. Honourable members opposite should not groan. They are young enough to have been involved in those conflicts. What about the 450 Australian dead left in Vietnam? The Govern­ ment should face up to these issues, as have the Australian people. The Government was hounded out of office because of its failure in this area. Today we heard a speech that still puts us in the position of regarding Vietnam as the enemy. That can be a danger, as I have said, if there is a war between China and Vietnam. It is our clear­ cut responsibility as a nation in this region to get Vietnam and ASEAN together to talk about Viet­ nam's withdrawal from Kampuchea once Pol Pot and his regime are disarmed. Those talks should not be held on any other level. Until such time as we organise that conference-we should be ini­ tiating it-we will have nothing but instability in this region.",48
69,Mr SHIPTON ,POLICY,"Higgins) (5.24)-1 congratu­ late the Minister for Foreign Affairs ( Mr Street) on the survey of Australia's foreign relations which he presented to the Parliament today. Of particular significance is his assessment of the new Reagan Administration in the United States. He said that the philosophical perspectives and the analysis of the international situation of that new Administration are similar to the policies of the Australian Government over a longer period. That is a very significant statement and I will bring it to the attention of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Lionel Bowen) later. We in Australia have to decide where we stand. Are we a member of the Western alliance or are we not? We have to accept obligations and responsibilities as a member of that alliance. We have to accept those obligations and responsibilities also under the ANZUS treaty. The Australian Labor Party cannot pretend to have a bipartisan approach to the ANZUS treaty and the United States without accepting that it brings responsibilities and ob­ ligations with it. All that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has done today is to criticise the agreement that the Government has with the United States concerning the B52 bombers, which will be unarmed and carry no bombs. Mr MCLean --What did he say about the Soviet Union?",48
70,Mr SHIPTON,POLICY,"I will deal with that in a minute. He said nothing about the Soviet Union. ] come back to the matter at hand; that is, the Op­ position is speaking with a forked tongue. Of course, our relations with the United States have to be two-sided. They have to be based on a mutual respect of differing views, with neither party being subservient to the other. I believe the United States would not necessarily defend Australia in all circumstances. That is why I re­ gard the ANZUS treaty as important. That is why I believe we have to work at our relationship with the United States towards establishing areas where our national interests coincide. There will be occasions when they do not coincide. Obvi­ ously there will be times when there will be differences between the United States and Australia. That is only right and proper and to be expected. I turn to the question of El Salvador. The cur­ rent instability and uncertainty in El Salvador have provided a dilemma for the United States. The Minister said this afternoon that human rights are of great importance. But President Reagan has had difficult decisions to make. In the Minister's terms, he has had to weigh up the stra­ tegic and political questions, economic matters and human rights issues. The United States has seen at its front door the threat of the Soviet sur­ rogate Cuba exploiting instability and the United States has had to take the strategic decision to supply equipment and advisers. That needs to be understood by allies of the United States, and par­ ticularly by the Opposition. The Soviet-backed Cubans are fostering and further fomenting sub­ version and instability in Central America. I think the analogy is the Kennedy blockade of Cuba. The United States, faced with a virtual Soviet presence on its front door, has had to act to protect-MONICA",48
71,Deus ex machina,POLICY,Opposition members interjectingMONICA,49
72,Mr SHIPTON,POLICY,"-Listen to members of the Op­ position scream when one talks about the United States. The United States has had to act to protect its strategic interests; and that needs to be under­ stood. Nobody on this side of the House wants another Vietnam-type war. Nobody on this side of the House wants any type of war. But let the Soviets back off. Let the Cubans back off. Let them stop supplying advisers and arms. As Senator Wheeldon, a member of the Australian Labor Party, has said in the Senate, as long as Cuban advisers are present in El Salvador, the United States obviously has the right to provide its advisers. The alternative is a Cuban-backed regime. Does the Opposition in this place want a Cuban-backed regime in EI Salvador? Let it tell us that. I believe it does, but let it tell the people Australia. Of course, the Soviets must be laughing because they know that reactions of the type shown by the Opposition will be used by propagandists. They will further be used to exploit and to foster the propaganda war to hide the real issue of the Soviet Union's surrogates and of its expansion in Central America. I turn, as I said I would, to what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said. I think it was the most disappointing speech that I have heard him make in this Parliament. It was, I think, written for him by the left wing of the party. It shows me that perhaps there is about to be some sort of lead­ ership struggle or power play in the Australian Labor Party with the Left being on top at present. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said that Australia was to be an actor on the world stage. He said that this Government has not acted. Of course this Government has acted. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said that there was no apparent difference in our policies today from those of four months ago. I point out to the Deputy Leader of the Oppo­ sition the words that I referred to earlier, the words of the Foreign Minister, who is in the House at present. Whilst we agreed with certain Carter initiatives opposite the Soviet Union and particularly the reaction to the Soviet build-up in the Indian Ocean, there is now a new philosophi­ cal perspective and a new analysis of the inter­ national situation by the Reagan Administration. That is the difference. Obviously there were pol­ icy points on which the Australian Government agreed with the Carter Administration. Now we have an administration in the United States which has a philosophical perspective similar to the per­ spective of this Government, a perspective which this Government has had for a lot longer than the United States has had it. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition criticised the Minister for referring only to the United States on page 14 of his address. However, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition went on to spend most of his time attacking the Minister for what the Minister did say. Then the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, T think, committed his most irresponsible act today. He said that we were supporting the staging of nuclear weapons in Australia by the United States. That is not true. That is a fabrication. I ask the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to withdraw that statement be­ cause that is an attempt to lead the people of Australia astray, to misinform the people of Australia. 1 assume that the Deputy Leader of the of Opposition, by saying that the present Govern­ ment is supporting the staging of nuclear weapons by the United States and Australia, is trying to confuse members of the Australian public and to deliberately mislead them. The Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Foreign Minister have said that the B52 bombers that will call at and use the facilities at Darwin and will fly over the Cape York Peninsula will be unarmed and will carry no bombs. The Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister have said that, yet the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has the gall to get up in this House today to tell the House and the people of Australia that Australia is being used as a staging post for the use of nuclear weapons. That is terribly irresponsible and is a misleading of the House.",49
73,Mr NA BROWN ,POLICY,"And wrong. Mr SHI PTON· ---! thank the honourable member. 1 accept the interjection of the honour­ able member for Diamond Valley. I have dealt with the question of El Salvador. Of course, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition attacked United States policy there. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition talked about dictatorships throughout the world. He talked about South Korea. He did not mention any Soviet-backed country. Mr MCLean-Or the Soviet itself.",49
74,Mr SHIPTON,POLICY,"As the honourable member for Perth said, he did not talk of the Soviet itself. He did not talk about East Germany. He did not tell us of the Vietnamese invasion of Laos. That seems to be comfortably forgotten.",50
75,Mr HODGMAN ,POLICY,Or Afghanistan.,50
76,Mr SHIPTON,POLICY,"No other mention was made. The Minister for the Capital Territory ( Mr Hodg­ man) , who is at the table, mentioned Afghanistan. That was completely ignored today by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. Mr MCLean-Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland.",50
77,Mr SHIPTON ,POLICY,"The c o u n t ri e s of Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland were not mentioned today by the Deputy Leader of the Op­ position. All he said about the Soviet Union was that he deplored the Soviet attitude to human rights. Then he said that the United States was not a paragon of virtue; there are faults on both sides. I take it from that statement that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was advocating neutrality, advocating a neutral foreign policy for Australia. That is what I believe the Opposition stands for. What does that mean? That means that we do not know where we stand. The Minis­ ter for Foreign Affairs said that the lessons of his­ tory are that uncertainty, vacillation, disunity and weakness increase the prospect of war by inviting expansionist, aggressive behaviour by states seek­ ing to change the balance of power to their own ad.vantage. That statement by the Minister is, I thmk, one of the most profound statements on foreign policy matters made in this Parliament. It needs to be restated time and again. He has stated the lessons of history; that the weak are walked over in this world. I think that somebody once said that power speaks through the barrel of a gun. The United States is not aiming to invade anybody; it is responding to the build-up through­ out the world of the Soviet Union. We did not hear from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition about the Soviet build-up in the Indian Ocean. He said that we should give more aid to Kampuchea. The Government has a very creditable record of giving aid to Kampuchea. I believe that the Deputy Leader rejected the total United States presence in the region. I take it that he supports the Soviet build-up in the Indian Ocean.",50
78,Mr HODGMAN ,POLICY,Whose side is he on?,50
79,Mr SHIPTON,POLICY,I believe that the honourable member is on the side of the Soviet Union and his speech today clearly shows that. Furthermore his speech shows that he is an apologist for Viet­ namese aggression in South East Asia. Mr John Brown-Don't you realise that kick­ ing the commie can went out of fashion years ago?,50
80,Mr SHIPTON,POLICY,"I realise that the Soviets have invaded Afghanistan. I realise that the Soviet Union is using Vietnamese facilities at Cam Ranh Bay and that the Soviet Indian Ocean fleet, built up in the Indian Ocean long before the United States responded, is changing at Cam Ranh Bay. [ realise that the Union of Soviet Socialist Repub­ lics has communication facilities in Vietnam and now has a port 2,000 miles south of Vladivostock. That is what I realise the Soviets are doing. The Soviets have built up in the Indian Ocean. This build-up took place, I think from recollection in 1 979 and started long before any United States build up. We have heard no talk about that today. I am very disappointed with the interjection of the honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr John Brown). Whilst he is having troubles with Par­ ramatta Park, I know that he should realise that the Soviets are in Afghanistan. The Vietnamese are in Laos and Kampuchea and are being backed financially by the Soviet Union while it has the use of the facilities I just talked about for ship­ ping, aircraft and communications. The honour­ able member ought to know that. The Opposition ought to face up to the fact that the Vietnamese are a threat in South East Asia. They have the largest standing army in South East Asia. They already occupy two countries and represent a di­ rect threat to Thailand and Malaysia. The Viet­ namese have made border incursions into Thailand in order to put fear into the people of that country. Vietnam has a larger standing force than the combined forces of the countries I have referred to. Those are the facts of the matter. Why did we not hear the Deputy Leader of the Opposition tell us about that today? We have to assume that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is an apologist for the Soviet Union and its aggression throughout the world. In the time remaining, I will switch to a dis­ cussion of Australia's role as a middle power. I thought that the Minister's statement was an interesting intellectual analysis and one of the best we have heard for some time. I wish to talk of two matters arising from my own experience where Australia has played a small role but a role as a middle power. The first concerns the United Nations where the former member for Wills, the Hon. Gordon Bryant, and myself were present as parliamentary delegates. Together with delegates from other countries, we formed a parliamen­ tarians group at the United Nations. This still functions and has full interpretor services part of General Assembly sessions. People from the Third World said to us: 'You as Australians can do that but if one of the superpowers had done it we would not have come proved to me that Australia has a middle power role. It showed that we are respected throughout the world as a middle power and that we can come with clean hands to a discussion of many issues. The other point concerns the presence of the Royal Australian Air Force at Butterworth Malaysia where I was briefly last week. The Australian presence acts as a bridge between Malaysia on the one hand and Singapore on the other. We contribute to the five-power defence arrangements. In fact, we are playing an import­ ant role that needs to be understood in that region of the world. I believe that our efforts there are appreciated. I do not believe for instance that well known that we are helping the Singaporeans to train in Australia members of their army and air forces. That is something that I would encour­ age. We heard nothing about that from the Oppo­ sition today. I congratulate those members of the Royal Australian Air Force who are doing a great job both as ambassadors and in helping the Malaysians and the Singaporeans. My final point concerns Australia and its role in the Common­ wealth. The Minister spoke of the effective role that Australia, as a middle power, played in Zimbabwe solution.",50
81,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,POLICY,Mr Drummond) - Order! The honourable member's time has but expired.,51
82,Mr BEAZLEY ,POLICY,"Swan) (5.40)-I wish to make a couple of points on the speech of the honourable member for Higgins ( Mr Shipton) before passing to the remarks of the Minister for Foreign Affairs ( Mr Street). Firstly, the honourable member disputed the view expressed by the Deputy specifically Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Lionel Bowen) that Australia is now a staging point for the deploy­ ment of American nuclear weapons. I do not see why we have to keep disputing this; we indisputa­ bly are. Most of the American warships which visit my home town and home port of Fremantle carry nuclear weapons. The agreement which was entered by the Government on the use by B52s Australian bases does not preclude the possibility that at some point in time B52s passing through Australia might well be armed with nuclear weapons. We have at North West Cape a facility which is responsible for transmitting fire orders to American ballistic missile submarines. All these facts are well known and well documented from American official sources. Some are attested to by and is the Government itself. We need a far more mature approach than has been displayed by the honourable member to the problems that we con­ front in our relationship with the American stra­ along'. That tegic nuclear deterrent. My second point concerns Vietnam. From 1975 onwards the Opposition made persistent pleas to this Government that if it did not take seriously the moral obligations imposed upon it to provide assistance for the reconstruction of Vietnam that in country would be forced to fall back upon the Soviet Union. We pointed to the difficulties that would occur because of the pressures that would be placed upon the Vietnamese administration by the Soviet Union to allow it the use of the Cam Ranh Bay facilities, with the Vietnamese being forced to succumb if they were not provided with the sorts of material assistance they required for it is economic recovery. We have persistently warned the Government about that and have said that such steps would be against Australia's interests. We have persistently attempted to get the Government to do something about it. Just as per­ sistently, the Government has done nothing. It is now reaping the consequences of not using the pressure that Australia could undoubtedly place on the United States, or the friendly influence or persuasion in which it could indulge with that country, to persuade it to adopt a similar policy. the We are now confronted by the consequences of that failure. The Minister's statement is extremely general, follows a visit by him to the United States dur­ ing which agreements of a specific military nature were entered into. Such discussions must have been based on quite specific understandings about the nature of future directions of American policy and our views on our association with it. Yet none of that appears in this statement-at least not associated with the agreements into which Australia entered. The Minister has dealt with the question of the distribution of power in north-east Asia without giving us the benefit of the Government's views on disputes within the new American Administration on a one-China policy or a two-Chinas policy which, despite former President Ford's visit to China, have not of been resolved. Did the Minister express to the United States a view on proposed arms sales to Taiwan? If not, why not? If so, what did he say; why did he not present the details to the Parlia­ ment in the course of his rather lengthy analysis of our relationship with China? The Minister visited the United States at a time when President Reagan had signalled a shift in United States policy towards South Africa, one potentially of considerable embarrassment to our Government; yet he has given no indication that he exchanged opinions on the matter with the officials he met. The Minister spoke of a commit­ ment to American objectives in the Indian Ocean, without expressing views On whether features of the burgeoning military involvement of the United States in that area, and the massive arms sales to such states as Saudi Arabia, are appropri­ ate meanS of responding to the problems that we confront in that region. An unexceptionable analysis of the requirements of a middle power such as Australia's to assume an appropriate role in world affairs was followed by apparently unrelated, but unequivocal applause for the direc­ tion of the policy of our major ally. This does not really reflect an adequate level of systematic thinking by the Minister on the problems which Australia confronts. There has been in government ranks some evi­ dence that the Government wishes to leap into the type of relationship that Australia had with its major ally in the 1 960s. To some extent the Minis­ ter's statement reflected that view. Probably at no time since the 1 960s has it been more important that this nation's leaders take full adv;mtage of the critical possibilities that years of friendship with the United States permit a country like Australia. It would be wrong to claim substantial influence but ours would probably be more than other powers of an equivalent size, and we are located on the outskirts of regions where the United States is more in need of good advice than anywhere else on the globe. In the past year the Government has viewed, with a degree of relish, the elevation of military strategic issues to the forefront of international lations and the possibilities for deepening global ideological conflict. In the process it has failed to recognise the extent to which these cut across other international interests which it and we on this side of the House have upheld. The Govern­ ment endangers a consensus on a sound defence strategy for Australia. It ignores the very real interest that aspects of our relationships with the United States now give us in the sanity and re­ straint of both super-powers. American facilities in this country give us a very real interest in en­ couraging caution and stability in the Kremlin as well as in Washington. The United States is on the verge of committing some serious mistakes in our vicinity-mistakes which this Government recognises but which, if it persists in its current course, it will be powerless to prevent. On the whole, the Government has maintained and nurtured important links with the Third WorId which were established by the Whitlam Government. It has been committed to this out of principle and a sensible appreciation of the realities of political life in our neighbourhood. These are threatened by some contemporary de­ velopments in United States policy. The Reagan Administration in a number of key policy areas foreshadows moves at variance with our stand. They are moves which with increasing ideological confrontation are inevitable. Perhaps nothing exemplifies them better than the embarrassment this Government will experience in respect of its policy toward South Africa. It is quite evident that President Reagan intends to rehabilitate the South African regime. It is all very well to point out, as the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) did in answer to a question of mine, that the Reagan Administration opposes apartheid. The point is that instead of that being the fundamental feature of United States-South African policy it is now being shifted to the status of a minor snag-a matter we raise with the South Africans but be­ cause of their alleged importance we go no further as we deepen our relationship by grounding it on a mutual security interest. That is a strategy this Government must oppose if it values consistency and its standing in our ,·egion. President Reagan expressed his views publicly on the matter while the Foreign Minister was in the United States but there is no record in his statement of his having raised the matter with the President or any of his advisers. As we have matured over the last decade, im­ perceptibly Australia and the United States have come to play on different chess boards in the in­ ternational arena. That appropriate to a super­ power is one where every regional issue is seen in a re­ global context, and that which is appropriate to a regional power-ourselves-is where we ought to see every regional issue in terms related to the local situation on the ground, that is, isslles of local significance. Our standing in the Common­ wealth is very high as is our standing with a var­ iety of nations in the Indian Ocean-Western Pacific regions. That standing has bceome more important to us than evcr it was in the 1 960s. There is a price, however, for its main tenance and that is our independence, our willingness to ident­ ify with ideological positions and economic priori­ ties which will cut across mili tary-political imperatives in our strategic relations with the United States. The United States at the same time has established a complicated adversary relation­ ship with the Soviet Union which requires a ca­ pacity to respond flexibly to Soviet initiatives, to raise and lower tensions over relatively short periods. It is something which the United States can do because its range of interests and agree­ ments with the Soviet Union is so broad. It is not something that an ally of the United States necessarily can do with the same degree of ease and that is becoming increasingly evident in the policies of the European allies of the United States. They are developing close economic re­ lationships with the Eastern bloc. Those economic relationship require stability in the essential re­ lationships between the individual country and the individual Eastern bloc country. They cannot lower and raise the nature of those relationships at will. Therefore they cannot, as the United States can do, respond to every particular Soviet initiative with one of their own. If at some time a catastrophe occurs like a Soviet invasion of Poland then the cut off in relations that will occur between them and the Soviet bloc will not be able, as the American relationship would be in a few years hence, to be subject to the same degree of backing and filling and perhaps a return to a non­ cold war stance that the United States could per­ haps hope for itself. A major catastrophe involv­ ing the Soviet Union would have that effect on the policies of those countries. Through the B52 agreement negotiated by the Minister while he was away, we are potentially committed to American policy in the Middle East and the Persian Gulf in particular, and yet there is no mention in the Minister's statement of this ex­ tremely important area. The B52 aircraft are inti­ mately linked with various scenarios for inter­ vention in the Middle East by the rapid deployment force. General Ellis, of the Strategic Air Command, told Congress last year: No other weapons system can match the B-52 in delivering concentrated conventional firepower on the battlefield. In the opening hours of hostilities, B-52s with 30 tons of explosives can provide timely and effective assistance in disrupting enemy actions. The projected conventional battle scenario is one characterised by minimum warn­ ing time followed by a massive attack from highly mobile forces aimed at a rapid breakthrough of defensive lines. In this situation, employment timing is critical. Ground forces need all available firepower in the first 48 hours, preferably applied directly to attacking and supporting forces. That is not very much time given the terms of the Government's agreement on consultation about other than surveillance usage of the B-52s through Darwin. It is now a matter of urgency that we in this country determine whether or not we believe that current directions in United States Middle Eastern policy are appropriate. This in­ cludes not only the question of United States pol­ icy on Arab-Israeli issues but also the current United States stress on military response to politi­ cal developments in the region, a stress which is increasingly being rejected by United States allies. It is a matter which is of increasing concern to them because they know and understand what we ought to understand-that the rapid deployment force simply cannot seize the oil installations be­ cause there are too many of them over too great a distance for that to be possible. They cannot inter­ dict a Soviet invasion, and a Soviet invasion is most unlikely because the United States and its European allies know, as we ought to know, that if the Soviet Union sought to intervene in the oil fields it would be an action that would strike at the very heart of Western economic survival, and the response to it would have to entail the severe possibility of global nuclear war. That is what de­ ters the Soviet Union in the Middle East, not a rapid deployment force that cannot arrive there in other than a division of strength even at the height of its development, at the apex of what is planned for it, in anything under a month. There is no evidence in the Minister's statement that he has given any serious consideration to this matter. This country has a direct interest in the stability of the nuclear balance between the Soviet Union and the United States. We have American facili­ ties which monitor compliance with arms control agreements, provide early warning of attack, transmit fire orders to ballistic missile submarines now capable of playing a counterforce role, and assist targeting of Soviet cities and military facili­ ties. The Minister argues, without giving us evi­ dence, that contemporary American military strategy will ensure a stable balance. He owes us more than that. Prima facie contemporary strat­ egy is likely to produce the opposite effect. In SALT II, to be abandoned by President Reagan, the United States has been provided with con­ siderable opportunities to enhance its position with regard to the Soviet Union. No projected qualitative or quantitative change planned in the deployment of American forces is precluded by SALT II-not cruise missiles, not MX missiles, not Trident missiles. On the other hand, a cap is effectively maintained on the deployment of Soviet missiles which are capable of carrying up to 30 warheads as opposed to the current half a dozen warheads. We have the right to express a view on 'these issues in the terms of agreements entered into by the Labor Government, and we have a right be­ cause of the nature of the facilities that we host. Not to have views on vital issues of nuclear arms control in these circumstances, as the Govern­ ment has not, is an abdication of responsibility. There are areas of American policy which consti­ tute a reasonable response to aspects of Soviet for­ ward policy. However, there are a substantial number which do not and which will create dis­ sension with American allies and will raise the risk of wrong signals to allies, adversaries and neutrals alike. The Foreign Mininster indicates that he values consistency in the policy of the new American Administration. There is value in con­ sistency but not if one is consistently wrong and when in a complex world achievement of it is un­ likely. There is no indication in the Minister's statement that he remotely appreciates these problems. HANSARD: DELAY IN PRODUCTION",51

84,Deus ex machina,POLICY,Sitting suspended from 5.56 to 8 p.m. AUSTRALIA'S FOREIGN RELATIONS Ministerial Statement Debate resumed.,54
85,Mr MCLEAN ,POLICY,"Perth) (8.0)-1 welcome the statement made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs ( Mr Street) and particularly his com­ ments regarding the Reagan Administration. Dur­ ing his statement he said that he was struck by the extent to which the philosophical perspectives and the analysis of the international situation of the Reagan Administration and of the Australian Government coincided. He referred to a shared concern about the Soviet military build-up, the need to maintain a military balance as a condition for stability and effective negotiations, the need to improve consultation and co-ordination within the Western alliance and the need for purposeful American leadership. I welcome this aspect of the statement by the Minister, particularly in view of the reaction by some civic, religious and other community leaders to the statement made re­ cently by the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) with respect to the assistance given to the United States of America in its surveillance of the Indian Ocean. In my view the arrangements made with the United States to allow B52 bombers access to our Air Force facilities at Darwin are extremely sen­ sible. I think Australian sovereignty has not been violated; it has been enhanced by our co-operating with our principal ally in a matter of vital stra­ tegic interest to ourselves. We have thereby con­ tributed to our own defence efforts and strengthened the ANZUS Pact on which we so heavily depend. I am at a loss to understand how critics of this policy claim that we have no com­ mon interest with the United States in the Indian Ocean. They obviously ignore the fact that the Indian Ocean is increasingly being seen by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics as one of its spheres of influence. J think recent history pro­ vides ample evidence of this. Since Great Britain began its withdrawal from east of Suez in 1 967-Britain was then in charge of the key control points in both the eastern and western zones of the Indian Oceanthe Soviet Union has moved into fill that vacuum. The Soviet Union has treaty agreements with and access to Iraq, South Yemen, Ethiopia, I ndia and, of course, Afghanistan. Each of these countries belongs to the so-called non-aligned movement. Either I do not understand the meaning of the word 'non-aligned' or it is one of the worse mis­ nomers of all time, but the Soviets are on the island of Socotra. In 1 976 Mozambique granted the Soviet Union facilities to build air and naval POLICY installations at its Indian Ocean bases. Of course there is the improved access of the Soviet navy to the Seychelles. Since the late 1 960s Soviet naval aircraft have undertaken reconnaissance flights over the Indian Ocean. These flights have continued on a periodic basis since that time. A continuous, though fluctuating, naval presence in the Indian Ocean has been maintained, and in the past year Moscow has increased the size of its I ndian Ocean fleet to an average presence of about 30 naval units, in­ cluding guided missile cruisers, frigates and de­ stroyers, nuclear and conventional submarines, supply ships and auxiliary vessels. These naval op­ erations continue to be centred in the areas of access to the Middle East oil fields. Given the de­ pendence of the Western world on Persian Gulf oil, including the substantial dependency of the United States on this source, it is hardly surprising that the Persian Gulf now constitutes the major United States interest in the Indian Ocean. Given recent events in this region, coupled with the increasing Soviet presence there, I am surprised at the way in which the United States is vilified for increasing its military presence in that region. To suggest that Australia and the United States do not have common interests in this matter is absurd. Any number of commentators give any number of reasons for the Soviet action in this area. Some of these reasons include the securing of a sea link between the Baltic and Vladivostok, the projec­ tion of Soviet political and economic power, the denial to the West of access to resources, the op­ portunity to pressure the oil producing countries as Soviet dependency for outside oil increases, and a long term objective of moving against South Africa and its mineral wealth . These and other reasons have been put forward. But whatever the real objective may be, I think that three things are obvious: Firstly, Soviet interests and our interests do no coincide; sec­ ondly, the Soviet Union is moving to a strategic position which will enable it to achieve its objec­ tives; and thirdly, on the basis of history we can hardly assume Soviet intentions as being based on a desire to spread cheer and goodwill throughout the region. Given this kind of scenario, coupled with the fact that the United States docs not con­ trol any of the critical geographical locations that affect access to the Indian Ocean, and the critical shortage of United States bases in the Indian Ocean, I strongly support the Government's in­ itiative to assist the United States in its efforts to increase its surveillance of and presence in the Indian Ocean. At present the United States is stretching itself to the limit. The American Commander-in-Chief in the Pacific, Admiral Long, recently told the United States House of Representatives Armed Services Committee: We cannot go it alone. To the European of operations has been added a third, the Indian Ocean and the Persian Gulf. The United States is at present seeking to increase its presence in Egypt, Oman, Somalia, Kenya and Diego Garcia-but that is all in the future. Obvi­ ously the Indian Ocean nations are not doing enough and we, in Australia, must provide the United States with the kind of assistance that we are now offering if our common interests are to be properly served. I turn briefly to the I sraeli-Arab conflict. I was disappointed that the Minister's statement made no direct mention of this matter. I assume that this question is covered by the Minister's referring to the need for purposeful American leadership of the kind which led to the Camp David Accords. I hope that the United States resolve in this issue does not diminish because 1I have a feeling that the Western world is gradually moving from its long held position of strong support for the State of Israel and that there may be attempts to compro­ mise the security of Israel for other issues. During the early and mid-1 970s a shift in the debate on the Arab-Israeli peacemaking effort was taking place. The issue of boundaries was giving way to the issue of the future of the Palestinian Arabs, which we all agree must be satisfactorily resolved. At the same time the United Nations has been questioning the legitimacy of the state of Israel while the Palestine Liberation Organisation was being treated increasingly as a legal entity within the United Nations notwithstanding the fact that the PLO continues to deny the right of Israel to exist in direct contravention of unanimously car­ ried resolutions of the United Nations Security Council. This trend was continued last year by the so-called European initiative whereby the Com­ mon Market governments sought to bypass the Camp David Accords, formally to recognise the PLO and to call for the PLO's involvement in negotiations for a Middle East peace settlement. My further concern in this matter is that the United States Administration, although it made strong pro-Israeli statements during the 1 980 elec­ tion, has not as yet enunciated a policy for dealing with Arab-Israeli tensions. I ask the question: Is the United States, in pursuing broader East-West issues, going to subordinate the Arab-Israeli conflict to that of Persian Gulf security? If so, will the security of Israel be in any way compromised? In my opinion Israel has every reason to be con­ cerned with the long term trends which have been operating on this issue. I believe that the Govern­ ment should do all in its power to ensure that our support for Israel, as embraced in United Nations Security Council resolutions 242 and 338, is in no and Pacific theatres way diminished. I was interested in the Minister's comments re­ garding the linkage of various elements of any foreign policy, those elements being economic matters, human rights and strategic and political questions. These comments cannot be dissociated from my earlier remarks. I think it is quite proper for the Minister to state that although the Aus­ tralian Government believes that human rights issues are of the greatest importance it is wrong to assume that economic reform issues and human rights can be divorced from questions of security and strategy. There has been a great deal of public comment on the change in emphasis given to human rights in the formulation of foreign policy under the Reagan Administration compared with the Carter Administration. I think it was Dr Kis­ singer who said on this subject that power is the basis of foreign policy and only a country with power can have a foreign policy based on morality because only such a country has any choices. This is important in determining perceptions of other nations to the United States. In the Middle East context I think it means that a weakened United States could not behave as responsibly as once it would have done. It was President Assad who said to Kissinger: 'You sold out Vietnam and Cam­ bodia. Why should we not suppose that you will also sell out Israel?' Hence the importance of the United States again reasserting itself, both from a strategic and a moral point of view. Using human rights as the dominant organising principle of foreign affairs has meant different things to different people. It has created enor­ mous problems for the United States. Those who supported this emphasis constantly sought to dis­ credit successive United States administrations for supporting politically unattractive regimes. They maintained that if such regimes were sup­ ported the United States automatically supported their policies. To these advocates the answer was for America to come home while the Soviet Union continued its imperialistic policies. Still other advocates of this principle felt that it pro­ vided an opportunity to change things for the bet­ ter in those nations in which the United States still had some influence. Senator Moynihan, a former United States Ambassador to the United Nations, maintained that the consistent theme of those who placed human rights to the fore in foreign policy decision making was to be more concerned with the wrongdoing of the United States than with other nations that might be adversaries of the United States. A reliance on human rights alone has led to great difficulties in the United States in recent times. Firstly, it has meant that those seeking ac­ commodation with increasing Soviet power could not, quite correctly, believe that the Russians could be deterred by the threat to them of American words and arguments. Secondly, those in the United States who were prepared to stand up and respond to Soviet power were hindered by the difficulties that United States human rights policies were causing for non-communist, but equally non-democratic, nations which were United States allies. Thirdly, a quite reasonable view has been put forward by the Reagan administration that an overemphasis on human rights undermines authoritarian regimes which have a capacity for change and increases the chance that they will be succeeded by totalitarian governments, specifically communist ones, which obliterate human rights altogether. For these reasons I am pleased that the Minister raised this important issue in his statement. Obviously, if the United States is to give a lead once again to the Western world it will need to provide a greater balance between all the elements of foreign policy formulation, to which the Minister referred, which was obviously lacking in the previous Carter administration. I wish to comment briefly on the speech made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Lionel Bowen) late this afternoon in reply to the ministerial statement. In the course of his 27minute speech he spent 26t minutes attacking the United States. He did not at any stage criticise the foreign policy of the Soviet Union. He did not refer to the way in which it has behaved in A fghani s t an , An go l a , H u ngary, Poland , Czechoslovakia, South Yemen, M ozambique, the Vietnamese invasion of Kampuchea or any simi­ lar issues. I thought his speech was a very unbalanced contribution, characteristic of the speeches of Labor Party spokesman in foreign affairs debates in this Parliament over the last five years. Labor Party spokesmen criticise the United States and Communist China but they will not go out of their way to criticise the Soviet Union. They seek to find a reason to defend the Soviet Union for any expansionist policy it undertakes. 1 do not welcome the arms build-up around the world. I think all of us would like to see the re­ sources of the world which are now being devoted to arms utilised to feed the millions of starving people and to increase the living standards of those who live in abject poverty. Unfortunately, that is not the reality. Until the Soviet Union and its allies change their international strategy, we have a responsibility to secure and defend this nation and give all the support we can to the United States and her allies.",54
86,Mr MORRISON ,POLICY,"St George) (8. 1 5) - The speech by the Minister for Foreign Affairs ( Mr Street) this afternoon on foreign affairs and those aspects of this Government's policy was disturb­ ing. Throughout the speech ran an emphasis on preparedness for war and a concomitant downplaying of the possibilities of peace. For in­ stance, there was no mention of efforts to reduce international tension between the great powers. For the benefit of the honourable member for Perth ( Mr MCLean) I include in that description both the Soviet Union and the United States. Detente has obviously become a seven-letter word. The Minister stated: . . . the possession of adequate power is desirable pre­ cisely because it reduces the chances of armed conflict. Regrettably, the lessons of history are otherwise. World War I and World War II showed that prep­ arations for war inexorably lead to war. The Minister has cast Australia as a middle power. I would hope that the main thrust of a middle power would be to bring some sanity to in­ ternational relations and to seek to reduce the ten­ sion between the great powers. This Government has supported, as have previous governments, both Labor and Liberal, the United Nations Dec­ laration on the Indian Ocean which aims to re­ duce tension in the Indian Ocean. It seeks to set up a zone of peace. There may be some sniggers from the Government on the concept of a zone of peace, but if we cannot get a zone of peace then we will have a zone of war. That is the issue. Very recently, in fact on 1 2 January this year, the Government supported a United Nations resol­ ution. In part that resolution stated: Considering that the continued danger posed by the mili­ tary presence of the great conceived in the context of urgency to the need to take practical steps towards the early achievement of the objectives of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace . . . That was not simply a statement by a small government. It was a consensus statement in the United Nations that was supported by this Government. Yet in the speech by the Minister for Foreign Affairs no mention was made of this effort to reduce tension in the Indian Ocean area. I point out that the Prime Minister has personally supported a similar resolution. For instance, the communique from the Commonwealth Heads of Government Regional Meeting in New Delhi in September 1 980 stated: Heads of government noted with concern that despite the expressed wishes of the littoral and hinterland States, great power military presence in the Indian Ocean has increased and that there has been a deterioration of peace and security in the Indian Ocean area. They further noted with regret that recent events in the region, national situation, have caused a further build-up of great power military presence. Neither of these sane and sensible statements was included in the Minister's speech. Regrettably, in practice the Government has taken steps not to decrease tension but to increase it. Many of us will recall that just prior to the general election, in a fit of ridiculous p osturing, the Government dispatched the main operating units of the Royal Australian Navy into the Indian Ocean. It was de­ scribed as the largest and longest Indian Ocean deployment by the RAN since World War 11again this emphasis on war. The Government said the ships were to exercise with the navies of a number of friendly powers and would visit a large number of ports. The deployment was a monu­ mental flop. There were no major exercises with other navies and the number of ports visited was reduced. In a last minute decision the units were pulled out of an exercise in the northern Indian Ocean with units from the United Kingdom and the United States. That was a sensible decision, but it made a nonsence of the Government's pre­ election posturing. So we can say: 'So much for the Minister's only sensible piece of advice in his speech, that we should not extend ourselves unrealistically. ' The Minister's statement is remarkable in another sense. It displays a yawning gap between the principles espoused and the Government's actual performance. The Minister in his speech pointed to a feature of what he describes as middle power foreign policy; that is, that quality of performance is particularly important in deter­ mining influence and status. H is regrettable that this Government's quality of performance in a number of areas of foreign policy, particularly in Powers in the Indian Ocean area, their confrontation, gives greater Kampuchea, is deficit in relation to their aims. The Minister dealt with Kampuchea at length in his speech. I want to draw the House's attention to a statement on Kampuchea issued by the then Minister for Foreign Affairs on 14 October 1980. [ think the first thing we should note about the statement is the date14 October 1 980, precisely four days before the Federal election. There was, as you will recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, a strong criticism within the then Government, the Liberal Party, about relations with Kampuchea. There was a disenchantment among supporters of the Liberal Party about the Government's policy towards Kampuchea in continuing recognition of the Pol Pot regime. So something had to be done in the pre-election panic. The statement that was issued on that occasion was intended to give the impression that the Government had derecog­ nised the Pol Pot regime, Democratic Kam­ puchea. In fact the statement said: together with the worsening inter­ The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Andrew Peacock, said today that Australia has taken a decision in effect to derecog­ nise the Government of Democratic Kampuchea (the Pol Pot regime) . As we are all aware, it took the Government another four months to the day1 4 February 1981 - to state that the derecognition of the Government of Democratic Kampuchea, the Pol Pot regime, would take effect as from that day. That statement of 1 4 October-four days before the election-was nothing more than a deceptive piece of window-dressing. It was in fact a con­ fidence trick. But there was another deception built into the Government's statement of 1 4 October. That statement followed by only a few hours instruc­ tions to Australia's United Nations delegatiqn to vote in favour of Democratic Kampuchea in the credentialling committee of the United Nations. That meant that Australia, irrespective of what it did a couple of hours later, voted for the con­ tinued recognition of the Pol Pot regime. The Government's inconsistency is patently obvious. On the one hand it sought to give the impression that it had derecognised the Pol Pot regime and on the other it voted to continue that recognition. We should remember that the United Nations is the only forum in which recognition of a country with which we do not have diplomatic relations has any relevance. The United Nation is the only organisation in which recognition or derecogni­ tion of Democratic Kampuchea has any relevance. In 1 979 the Government adopted the policy­ and this is getting back to the history of the credentialling committee-of the previous Liberal-Country Party administrations in arguing, and arguing quite spuriously, that credentialling of delegations in the United Nations is a technical and legal matter and not a matter of policy. For decades the Liberal and Country parties followed that line by denying the very existence of Commu­ nist China. By this ploy it upheld the fiction that Taiwan was the rightful government of China. But in 1 979 the Australian Government missed an opportunity because in the debate in the United Nations the Indian delegation put forward a proposal-a very sensible proposal-that the seat of Kampuchea should be left vacant. But, oh no, attached to this great ostrich-like policy of con­ tinuing to recognise the Pol Pot regime, the Aus­ tralian delegation voted against the Indian del­ egation's proposal. One of the consequences of that decision was that the Indian Government then decided to recognise the Heng Samrin regime in Kampuchea. This meant that the support that India could have given to proposals put forward by members of the Association of South East Asian Nations and other countries for a settle­ ment in Kampuchea was lost. The whole import of what Australia has done in the United Nations has been to continue to give international respectability it continues today to give international respectability-to the Pol Pot regime because by that vote the Pol Pot regime has full membership status in the United Nations and in the United Nations' specialised agencies and regional organisations for the whole of 1981 . confrontation, That recognition still continues. It is not just an academic question. Only last week the Australian delegation to the United Nations Economic and Social Committee for Asia and the Pacific held in Bangkok and led by a Minister of this Govern­ ment sat at the very same table as a representative of the Pol Pot regime. The Australian delegation did not protest the presence of the Pol Pot rep­ resentative. By its action it has continued to recog­ nise the Pol Pot regime. In short, this Government has misled this House and, more importantly, the Australian p eople. If it is the intention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to place an emphasis on the qual­ ity of performance of a middle power the first thing that the Government must do is act consist­ ently and act honestly. That is the intent of any foreign policy that an Australian government should seek to perform. This Government has not acted consistently; it has not acted honestly. In fact, it has not acted in the way that we on this side of the House believe Australia as a middle power should perform.",56
87,Mr FALCONER ,POLICY,"Casey) (8.29)-The House is debating a statement made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs ( Mr Street) concerning the nature of this country's foreign policy and some of the more urgent tasks facing us. In replying to the Minister the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Lionel Bowen) made one comment that I want to take up at this stage. He said that the 'new United States Administration had scrapped human rights as an instrument of foreign policy. I think that is one of the many dangerous over­ simplifications which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition made during his speech. I want to quote from an interview which Mr Alexander Haig, the United States Secretary of State, gave to Time magazine. He was in fact asked a question on that very point. He was asked about the sig­ nificance of human rights diplomacy in American policy at present, and he said: We are concerned that open societies sometimes get vic­ timised by the practical consequences of their openness and by the lack of access to information about totalitarian regimes where, it is our conviction, the major abuses to human rights are occurring today. But this is an ancillary problem related to our more strongly held concern that past human rights poli­ cies have in many instances been counterproductive, not only to the objective of strengthening human rights but also from the standpoint of vital American interests. He went on: There are a number of questions related to this. First and foremost, we must continue to be deeply concerned about abuses to human rights wherever they occur; but there are such questions as whether amelioration of those abuses is best achieved under the glare of public criticism and animosity and or whether it is best achieved in a quieter dia­ logue between states with a healthier relationship. What I want to point out is that there are many ways of approaching human rights questions, many ways of trying to deal with them where we are dealing with relationships with sovereign countries, and I think it is unreasonable to assert in a sweeping manner that the United States has effectively scrapped human rights as an instru­ ment of foreign policy. There can be differences about approach, there can be differences about the end result of various courses of action with re­ spect to human rights and how effective various courses of action mayo be, but in fact it is still a very strong element of United States policy, and indeed should be. Mr Haig's remarks point to a problem that we face in Australia. There is tendency in Australia, in talking about human rights problems, to em­ phasise problems that appear in countries such as Indonesia, the Philippines and South Korea. These are countries which are more open than many of the communist or left wing countries in the region. Therefore one has a greater oppor­ tunity to find out about instances of breaches of human rights. However, one does not have the same opportunity to obtain information about what is happening in more closed societies, in societies which are often run by socialist or com­ munist governments, or governments that claim to have that complexion. So effectively a great public emphasis on human rights issues can lead to a sense of protection being given to closed societies which do not allow us to find out what is going on in their countries compared with more open societies where there is a greater possibility for use to move in or send people into find out what is happening and therefore bring the abuses of human rights to light. That is one of the difficul­ ties that those of us in Australia who want to take action on human rights face in dealing with the situation in an even-handed manner. The honourable member for St George ( Mr Morrison) said that the lessons of World War I and World War II show that preparations for war inexorably led to war. There is an element of truth in that, but perhaps the word 'inexorably' is over­ stating it. Many others would say that prep­ arations for war ensure that we do not face war in future because we deter future enemies. The example that is commonly given to support that argument is the example of the development of power in nazi Germany in the 1 930s and the lack of response by democratic countries to that chal­ lenge which was obviously looming on the hor­ izon. What we want is not an oversimplified state­ ment about preparations for war; what we want is a realistic assessment of what is happening in the world and an appropriate response to what that assessment shows. With that in mind I want to examine some of the attitudes being adopted by the Reagan Administration towards the Soviet Union, and then to look at the implications of those attitudes for Australian foreign policy. One of the problems in American attitudes towards the Soviet Union, in recent years is that there has tended to be a swing from one unreal view to another. [n some circles in the United States there has been an undue naivety about the potential to reach some peaceful accommodation with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. It was an attitude evi­ dent in much of the eastern liberal academic es­ tablishment of the United States of America. Many people in that category tended to take the view that if only we understood the USSR and got to know each other as people through more. cul­ tural exchanges, sporting contacts, regular consul­ tations, et cetera, our fears of the USSR would fade and we would come to realise that we are all human beings of peaceful intent with common interests. Some people who take this view have a tendency to be highly critical of American leader­ ship for supposedly having passed up opportuni­ ties to lessen tensions between the two super­ powers. In my view these unreal expectations arise from a lack of knowledge, of Russian history, both czarist and Bolshevik, and a lack of under­ standing of the essential dynamics of policies aris­ ing from Marxist-Leninist theories. The Soviet Union sees itself as being on the historically cor­ rect side of a fundamental ideological conflict be­ tween the forces of socialism and the forces of capitalism. These factors incline the Soviet Union towards an aggressive and expansionist attitude. Addto this some of the tensions within the Soviet Union itself, the failure of its economy to deliver the standard of living which had been promised to the Soviet people, and that increases also the like­ lihood that any Soviet government will be looking for outside adventures or at least be looking for some outside tensions which it can use to distract attention from problems within the country. Certainly we must understand the very real fears of the Russian people, the people who suffered at the hands of nazi Germany in the Sec­ ond World War. A very real basis of fear exists among people in the Soviet Union, perhaps even to the extent of some sort of xenophobic attitude towards countries around the Soviet Union. That is something that we must bear in mind and with which we must sympathise. At the same time we must realise that there are essential forces within Soviet societies, within Marxist and Leninist the­ ory, which tend to give the Soviet Union an expansionist attitude towards the rest of the world. One problem with the unreal attitude towards the Soviet Union, which I described earlier that if only we could get to know each other as people a bit more then tensions would lessen, is that when some incident occurs which breaks down that attitude of trust and general bonhomie, it can lead to a swing in the direction of excessive mistrust and bellicosity. So one can get a return to the bluster, the abuse, and the general tense language of Cold War rhetoric. We all re­ call, for example, how President Carter made himself look a rather pathetic figure when he complained, after the Soviet Union invasion of Afghanistan, that the Soviet Union had misled him. We then saw something of a tendency in the United States for congressmen, for leading spokesmen on public opinion, to swing towards bellicosity and sabre rattling. in the terms of their attitudes to foreign relations and in particular their attitudes towards Russia. What then do we make of the rather strident statements which are now coming from President Reagan and Secretary of State Haig? A common fear being expressed by many commentators that the language of Mr Reagan and Mr Haig may raise unnecessarily the temperature of relation­ ships and increase the risk of some genuine misun­ derstanding arising between the super-powers about their intentions. That misunderstanding could then raise the risk of actual cOIiflict. Doubt­ less the new Administration feels that the United' States needs to show more resolve and, purpose ,in its foreign policies than has been demonstrated recent years. Perhaps some stiffening of United world . . States resolve is indeed needed at this stage. In that respect, the recent statements by President Reagan may reflect the developments that would have occurred under any President likely to b.e elected in the current political atmosphere. By now, however, I think, the, rhetorical points hav\:l been made. I think some degree of excessive emotionalism has been used in some of the language that has come out of Washington, but that United States resolve should now be ex­ pressed by way of the iron fist in a velvet giove ap­ proach rather than by waving a cutlass around ac: companied by blood curdling screams. Neither United States leaders nor Australian leaders should fall into the trap of abusing the Soviet Union and its leaders merely to satisfy some emotional requirement in themselves. In the Australian context"" as we are developing closer and more fruitful relationships with China, it is particularly easy to see our interests in 'the short term being served by a stridency towards Soviet Union that brings satisfied smiles to the faces of Chinese trade delegations. I have prob­ ably fallen into this trap myself in the presence affable Chinese officials when we have both found common cause in bemoaning the tendencies of the Soviet Union. I believe we would .be wise to to ensure that our foreign policy does not tip too strongly in favour of China vis-a-vis the Soviet Union. After all, the United States opening to China under the Nixon Administration, by which Australia's rapprochement with China became more possible, was not an initiative designed to form some United States-China alliance against the Soviet Union. Both President Nixon and Dr Kissinger, the then National Security adviser and after that Secretary of State were at great pains to point out that the detente with China was not intended to lead to a United States-China condo­ minium to surround the Soviet Union. Rather it was seen as a way of bringing China out of her iso­ lation and ensuring China her rightful place in an overall world balance. I do not believe our desire to pursue harmoni­ ous relationships with China should lead us to court unnecessary aggravations in any re1ation­ is ship we have with the Soviet Union. In other words, we do not need to be rude to the Russians in order to charm the Chinese. I do not say this in any belief that we can afford to be soft or com­ pl;icent in our attitude to the Soviet Union. On the contrary, as I said earlier, we must be fully aware of the fundamental ideological struggle be­ tween the Soviet Union and western liberal democracies and the possibility of this developing in into armed conflict at various points around the This ha.s ' implications for Australian foreign policy. 'Within the context of that super-power re­ lationship between the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics I believe we have a very real role to play. There is no real alternative to Australia being part of the American alliance in both a military and diplo­ matic sense. Ideologically our society has nothing in common with basic Marxist structures, no mat­ ter how much any briefly fashionable romantics in our country like to wear Mao badges or pay hom­ age to whatever other Marxist leader happens to be in vogue at the time. Our commitment to West­ ern Liberal democratic traditions and the basic freedoms of such societies gives us a fundamental common ' interest with the United States. The Australian people would feel that they have some natural alliance with the American people whether or not that alliance was formalised in a treaty. In fact, it is formalised in a treaty in the the form of the ANZUS treaty. That treaty allows us to play a constructive role of influence in our re­ lationships with the United States. We have the of opportunity of having some input into United States policy considerations. We share the results 01 intelligence gathering, a matter of great benefit Australia. I believe that also imposes on us a re­ sponsibility to play a . part in enabling the United States to carry out its global responsibilities. I do not want to suggest that the American al­ liance is the be-all and end-all of all Australian foreign policy and defence policy. We must de­ velop our own regional network of bilateral and multilateral relationships. Under this Govern­ ment we have developed practical working re­ lationships with a number of countries in our region.",58
88,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,POLICY,Mr Millar)­ Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,61
89,Mr FRY ,POLICY,"Fraser) (8.44) -1 must say how pleasing it was to hear the honourable member for Casey ( Mr Falconer) delivering such a moderate and well reasoned speech, in sharp contrast to many of his colleagues. It is always a pleasure to listen to the honourable member for Casey be­ cause he analyses the issue at stake. He attempts to understand the point of view of the other side and gives a reasonable assessment of it. That is in sharp contrast to the honourable member for Perth ( Mr MCLean) , for instance, who always gives a very bellicose, reactionary sort of speech and distorts the Labor viewpoint. 1 must refute the honourable member's accusation that Aus­ tralian Labor Party policy is pro-Soviet and anti­ American. Every Labor member who spoke in this debate said that we should not have a point of view that was pro any other nation. Our policy should not necessarily go along with the Russians, the Americans, the Indians, the Chinese or any­ one else. We are saying that we should look at situations objectively and develop our own policy. That is precisely what we do not do. The sorts of views put forward by the honourable member for Casey conform to that view. I was very disappointed and saddened by the ease with which the new Minister for Foreign A ffairs ( Mr Street) has so quickly and pliantly fallen into line to comply with what we see as the tunnel vision of his leader, the hard-line people his party and the reactionary leaders in the world today such as the Reagans and the Thatchers. It is very sad that those people tend to see things in black and white; they do not see anything in be­ tween. Other people are either with them or against them. They do not try to understand the point of view of the other side. The Minister for Foreign Affairs visited countries which he refers to as like-minded countries. They include most of the Association for South East Asian Nation countries-Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia. He also visited places such as Tokyo, Peking and Washington. He says that those countries are like­ minded. He should realise that all those countries still support the Pol Pot regime which we have only belatedly derecognised. If those countries are like-minded he is being very honest in saying that at least they still support the Pol Pot regime and that they see people who support the Pol Pot regime as like-minded people. It is a great shame that the Minister did not try to be better informed by talking to officials in some countries which were not like-minded which may have been able to enlighten him and give him a more objective view of the situations on the ground. The Minister did not go to any of those countries. If he had he would have had a different view. By talking only to like-minded people how does one get out of having a tunnel vision of the situation in those countries? Of c'ourse, the tunnel vision leads the Min ister to the wrong conclusion-as it has led the Government to the wrong conclusion-that communism and big power politics are the enemy particularly ' in South East Asia. The Government should be looking toward going back to the root-cause of the problem in South East Asia. The root-causes of the problem are the denial of basic human rights to the popu­ lation at large in many of those countries; gross poverty and starvation for millions of people; gross underdevelopment; and gross corruption in many of the regimes. These are the problems to which we should address ourselves, not some vague abstraction called communism. That tunnel vision leads people to the further view that insta­ bility in those countries is caused by big power involvement. There is no question about the fact that big powers become involved. Big powers are involved in Kampuchea. Their involvement is made possible by the instability in those countries caused by the poverty, the underdevelopment and, in some cases-as in Kampuchea and Vietnam-by the involvement of Western coun­ tries such as the United States of America. West­ ern countries went into that region and created in the conditions which allowed instability to de­ velop. They destroyed the social infrastructure of those countries, and moved out and left a vacuum. Extreme people such as Pol Pot were able to move into that vacuum with devastating effects on the community. We did the same sort of thing in Vietnam. We said: 'The problem is that the south is being invaded from the north', without looking at the internal position in South Vietnam. The instability was internal and not caused only by external forces. We seem to be making the same sorts of judg­ ments in South East Asia, Kampuchea and, of course, El Salvador. I am sorry that the Minister did not look at these countries, make himself bet­ ter informed and form a more balanced view of what is going on. My wife and I recently visited Vietnam, Kam­ puchea and Phnom Penh. We found that visit very interesting and very enlightening. We came back with a much better balanced view of what is happening in these countries. If the Minister had gone there he would have a different view from the one he has expressed. He would not have any truck at all with countries which are supporting the Pol Pot regime, or he would try to encourage them to derecognise Pol Pot. If the Minister or anybody else has any doubts about the demonic and horrendous nature of the Pol Pot regime they should look at the photographs which my wife took on the outskirts of Phnom Penh where thou­ sands of human skeletons are being dug out of the ground. Mainly these are skeletons of women and children. It is stark and horrendous evidence of how bad the Pol Pot regime was. If one were to go there and see that and talk the people one would not be talking about the not on. Vietnamese invading Kampuchea. There is no question that the people in Phnom Penh today see the Vietnamese as their saviours. They are regarded as fraternal people who came into them from the horrors of Pol Pot. These people are damned glad to be alive. They recognise that. On our visit to Phnom Penh we would not have know the Vietnamese presence was there. We did not see one Vietnamese soldier in Phnom Penh. We knew they were there because the Kam­ puchean people told us they were being assisted by the Vietnamese. We know they have 200,000 troops in the north keeping the Pol Pot forces check. I can assure honourable members that they are exercising a very benign influence over Kampucheans. The Kampuchean economy is developing in a complete laissez faire, free market atmosphere. The Heng Samrin regime is allowing the normal market forces to operate so that the country can develop an economy. The proof is shown in the Vietnam. fact that there are now 300,000 people back in Phnom Penh. They are coming back in large very numbers. Many of them have come out of the ref­ ugee camps which twelve months ago were seen an insoluble problem. They are coming back be­ cause they have confidence in the Heng Samrin regime and in the way in which it is running the country. The children are back at school. There are not many teachers because Pol Pot cut the throats of most of them. Agriculture is recovering rapidly. The regime has the support of the people in Phnom Penh. I did not get out into the country so I cannot speak for the people there. I have of other people who have toured extensively through the country and the story is the same: They are very grateful for the fact that the Viet­ namese came in and saved them from the Pol Pot regime. To talk about the Vietnamese invading the Kampucheans, dominating them and standing over them is a complete misreading of the situation. I can understand the Minister's holding that view because he did not talk to anybody who has a different view and he did not go and look for him­ self. If he had done so he would have seen that the Vietnamese were not aggressors. If the Kam­ pucheans want the Vietnamese to get out they know what to do. All they have to do is to encour­ age some of their like-minded friends to derecog­ nise Pol Pot and stop giving him support, and the Vietnamese will withdraw the next day. It is very costly for the Vietnamese to be in Kampuchea. They do not want to be there but they will not turn their backs on their brothers in Kampuchea to and let them be slaughtered by Pol Pot. It is just It is quite absurd for the Minister to talk about supporting the third force. The third force is save comprised of people who are not even in Kam­ puchea. It has very little grassroots support. It is absolute nonsense to talk of supporting the third force led by Prince Sihanouk or anybody else. The reality of the situation is that the Vietnamese are there. They will stay there. They have been there for a long time. They have supported the Kampucheans consistently. They supported them in getting rid of the French. They supported them in against the Lon N ol regime and they have now supported them in getting rid of Pol Pot. There is the nothing n ew about Vietnam supporting Kampuchea. More and more countries are now recognising that the Indo-China region is a legit­ imate area of influencc of Vietnam. Vietnam has a population of 40 million or 50 million people. Kampuchea and Laos are both very small coun­ tries. They are vital to the peace and prosperity of As I said, my wife and I went to Vietnam. It is a rundown country. It is badly in need of aid and support. I found it very distressing and I felt as quite ashamed of our Government in that the little bit of aid that we were giving them was c�t off. The condensed milk factory which we sel'lt them is sitting in crates. There' is nobody there to assemble it. We sent them 600 head of beef cattle. We were supposed to follow up with a pasture im­ provement program. In a very petty act we just cut off that program. Whilst it was only symbolic support, its being stopped has created very bad read feeling between our Government and the Govern­ ment of Vietnam, although the Vietnamese know there are many people in Australia who would not have agreed with what happened. It is a great shame that the Minister did not go and look at that area, but I know that the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) would not want him to go to see the situation for himself. The Government has a tunnel vision about what is going on in the country and does not want that disturbed. Normally we take our lead from the Associ­ ation of South East Asian Nations in developing a policy towards Kampuchea. On this occasion, although publicly the ASEAN nations are saying they are opposed to the Vietnamese, privately at least two of them, the Indonesians and the Malaysians, have some sympathy for the Viet­ namese position. I am sure that when the election, which is being held in April, takes place, the present regime will be endorsed. It is acceptable to the people there. I think at that time many coun­ tries will recognise the reality of the situation and will recognise that regime. At some stage we have to think about doing that and getting on with the job of sending real aid-development aid, hu­ manitarian aid-to these countries, particularly Kampuchea and Vietnam. I wish to say a few words briefly on El Salvador. This is another example of a misguided policy of the Americans insisting on sending guns when the President of EI Salvador stated that the strongest army in the world would not overcome the prob­ lems of poverty and starvation in that country. It is nonsense for us to be screaming out about these people acquiring arms. My son visited that country last year. He wrote to me and stated how horrifying it was to see, 1 2 months ago, the national guard in EI Salvador shooting demon­ strators in the back. In the last 1 2 months thou­ sands of innocent peasant people in EI Salvador have been shot down with weapons which were supplied by the Americans to the national guard in EI Salvador. What are these people to do? Are they to sit down and be shot? Of course they will secure weapons. Whether they get them from the Americans or a communist country is irrelevant. These people are driven to desperation. They have to defend themselves. It does not matter where they get the weapons from. If the Americans listened to the advice of the President of the Government of EI Salvador, they would be aware that he said: 'We do not want guns. We want economic aid. We want to be able to develop our country. We want to be able to feed ourselves'. But the Americans say: 'No, you do not want aid. You want more guns to shoot all these revolutionary people'. That is the situation as it is developing in EI Salvador today. I think anyone who really believes that in the long term we can sustain indefinitely this gross social injus­ tice involving the majority of the people in the world, mainly those in the underdeveloped coun­ tries of the Third World who are living in abject poverty, fighting starvation and undevelopment without basic health and education facilities, shows no understanding of the recognition of the continued long term progress towards social jus­ tice to which every nation is entitled.",61

91,Mr VINER ,HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION BILL,"Stirling-Minister for Employ­ ment and Youth Affairs) (9.0)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to establish a Common­ wealth Human Rights Commission. The Com­ mission will promote the observance of human rights throughout Australia within the limits of Commonwealth power. In co-operation with the States on human rights matters the Commission will assist the Government in discharging its inter­ national obligations in the cause of human rights. Our intention to introduce this legislation was foreshadowed in the Government's policy speech prior to the last election. The most recent attempt by this Government to have Parliament approve a human rights commission foundered because of lack of agreement between this House and the Senate on what became known as the Simon amendment, and was related to the rights of the child before as well as after birth. The Govern­ ment has arrived at a formula, included in this Bill, which it believes will be acceptable both to those who voted for and those who voted against the amendments. Since the Human Rights Commission Bill 1 979 was debated in this House last year, several events have transpired which only add to the need for effective human rights machinery in Australia. In August 1 980, Australia ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. To date 65 countries have become parties to this Covenant, many of which have established their own special forms of machinery to promote and protect human rights. The measure riow before the House, and the Commission that would be established under it, will help Australia to dis­ charge the obligations it has assumed under the covenant. Last August, as well, the Government estab­ lished the Human Rights Bureau as an interim measure pending creation of a human rights com­ mission. Recently, the Bureau has begun to re­ ceive representations from the public in the form of complaints, requests for assistance, and re­ quests for information in the general field of human rights. The Bureau has also made sig­ nificant progress in establishing links with non­ government organisations in the human rights field. It is apparent, however, that there is a need for more effective machinery to promote human rights in Australia than is available through the Bureau, and it is the object of the Bill to provide this machinery. The Commission will not be a large undertaking. Its emphasis will be on quality. Its annual cost is currently estimated at about $850,000, to which will be added the cost of the Office of the Commissioner for Community Relations-estimated at $ 350,000 in 1 980-8 1 . The main provisions of the Bill are the same as in the Bill considered by the House last year. As such, they have already been the subject of con­ siderable discussion and debate. I intend in this speech, therefore, to refer to and explain only those changes from the 1 979 Bill that are found in the present measure. The only change of sig­ nificance is that the charter of the Commission has been extended to three additional inter­ national instruments. As with the previous Bill, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights will be the primary point of reference for the Commission. However, in response to the con­ cern expressed in this House, and also in the Senate, during the debate on the Simon amend­ ment about the rights of both children and handi­ capped persons, the Commission will also be required to have regard, in areas of Common­ wealth responsibility, for the rights of these groups as recognised in three international declar­ ations, each of which has been supported by Australia. The three declarations are-the Dec­ laration of the Rights of the child, 1 9 59; the laration on the Rights of the Mentally Retarded, 1 9 7 1 ; and the Declaration on the Rights of the Disabled, 1 975. The Declaration of the Rights of the Child recognises that the Child, by reason of his physical and mental immaturity, needs special safeguards and care, including appropriate legal protection, before as well as after birth. The declaration also calls upon men and women everywhere, on volun­ tary organisations and on governments to strive for the observance of the rights of the child which it proclaims. The rights include the right to special protection to enable the child to develop fully; the right to enjoy the benefits of social security, in­ cluding adequate pre-natal and post-natal care; and the rights to education and to protection from cruelty and exploitation. Similarly, the two dec­ larations concerned with the rights of physically and intellectually handicapped persons call for national and international action to protect the rights they declare. The rights of the intellectually handicapped include the right to be accorded as far as possible the same rights as other persons; the right to economic security and a decent stan­ dard of living; and the right to protection from ex­ ploitation, abuse and degrading treatment. The rights of the physically handicapped include the right to the same civil and political rights as other persons; the right to respect for their human dig­ nity; the right to measures to enable them to be­ come as self-reliant as possible; and the rights to medical and other treatment and to economic and social security and a decent level of living. The three declarations I have just been describ­ ing do not represent commitments in inter­ national law, as does the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. But they express important aspir­ ations, and we are proposing that the Commission should monitor, and report on, the way in which Commonwealth departments and agencies, and activities generally in the Australian Capital Ter­ ritory, are conforming with them. The three dec­ larations are defined in clause 3 of the Bill, and are included in the definition of 'human rights' in the same clause. There are consequential amend­ ments, chiefly in clause 3 1 , which envisage the declaration of further international instruments as part of the Commission's charter. During debate on the 1 979 Bill and in the ensu­ ing months, comments have been made about cer­ tain aspects of the 1 979 Bill that are repeated in the present Bill. Because they are apparently the source of some concern, I should like to discuss three of those criticisms. The first is that the scope of the proposed Commission would extend only to Dec­ laws of the Commonwealth and the Territories except the Northern Territory-and actions or procedures under such laws. The Commission's mandate will not extend to State or Northern Ter­ ritory laws or actions or procedures of State and Northern Territory authorities. However, clause 1 1 of the Bill provides for a range of co-operative arrangements to be entered into with the States and it is the Government's intention and expec­ tation that this mechanism will be fully used. The ministerial meeting on human rights will continue to exercise a role at top policy level in considering issues which require consultation be­ tween the various levels of government and in promoting generally the cause of human rights in Australia. Accordingly, this Bill manifests the Government's continuing commitment to co­ operative federalism, which is already developing well in the human rights field. The second criti­ cism levelled at the 1 979 Bill is that the proposed Commission would incorporate the Office of the Commissioner for Community Relations. Non­ government organisations in the human rights field have particularly voiced this concern. It is motivated by a fear that the work done by the Commissioner for Community Relations will somehow be interrupted or curtailed. The Government's expectation is in fact quite the op­ posite. Let me emphasise, as I did when the pre­ vious Bill was before the House, that the Com­ missioner for Community Relations will continue to carry out the complaint-handling and concili­ ation functions associated with administration of the Racial Discrimination Act. Further, the added resources of the Commission will be avail­ able to assist as required in the important task of combating racial discrimination, and there will be a recourse, as there was not previously, to the Meeting of Ministers on Human Rights on racial discrimination matters. The Government is confident, therefore, that establishing the Commission will not make less effective the role of the Commissioner for Com­ munity Relations in dealing with complaints of racial discrimination. Thirdly, there have been criticisms that the Human Rights Commission is being given inadequate powers�that it has no machinery for enforcement of its findings. That criticism represents a misunderstanding of the essential purpose of the Commission. The purpose of the Commission is to promote discussion and understanding of human rights in the community generally and to recommend to the Government and to Parliament changes in law or practice required to bring that law and practice into line with human rights as defined by the International Covenant or other human rights instruments. For its job, the Commission has been given adequate powers to obtain papers, to call witnesses, to con­ duct hearings and to make reports. A survey of in­ stitutions with similar functions in Australia and overseas shows that the Commission is as well, or better, endowed with powers than other bodies having similar functions. What the critics of the Commission suggest is that it should have some kind of court-like powers of enforcement. In the view of the Government, this may be a possible step for the future, but it is not the next step, which is establishment of the Commission. It is only when the Parliament has laid down laws relating to human rights in a par­ ticular area�for example relating to racial discrimination�that the normal law enforcement machinery should be considered. Even there, the clear cut and authoritative decisions of the courts may not be the correct way to proceed, at any rate in the early stages of the operation of the law. The promotion of human rights in this country will be achieved more through education, through finding new balances of interests and through con­ ciliation than through firm measures of enforce­ ment. In closing, I should like to refer to the final paragraph of my second reading speech for the 1 979 Bill. The thoughts and hopes expressed are as current and important today as they were then. I said: Human rights are about the protection of individuals. I be­ lieve, and the Government believes, that in an era of social change in which governments exercise wide powers and cor­ porations and large institutions greatly influence the lives of individuals, it is important to have an agency that is active in the protection and promotion of the rights of individuals. We see in the world around us too many occasions where the rights of individuals are cruelly violated. The purpose of the Human Rights Commission, and of the machinery associated with it, is to help Australia maintain its excellent record in the protection of human rights, and progressively to develop a better and more comprehensive recognition and observance of the rights of every individual in our community, regardless of financial standing and whatever his or Iter race, age, sex, re­ ligion or status. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr John Brown) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1981 Bill received from the Senate, and read a first time. Second Reading",63
92,Mr VINER ,RACIAL DISCRIMINATION,"Stirling-Minister for Employ­ ment and Youth Affairs) (9. 1 1 )-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This is a purely technical Bill, and is associated with the Human Rights Commission BiII 1981 , which I have just introduced. This Bill will make the Racial Discrimination Amendment Act 1 980 effective. That Act was expressed to come into operation when the Human Rights Commission Act 1 980 was proclaimed, but is inoperative be­ cause the Human Rights Commission Bill 1980 was not enacted. The present Bill will amend the Racial Dis­ crimination Amendment Act 1980 to apply to the 1981 , instead of the 1 980, Human Rights Com­ mission Act. I commend the Bill to the House.

93,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,RACIAL DISCRIMINATION,"Hon. J. D. M. would Dobie)-Before the debate is resumed, I remind the House that it has been agreed that a general debate will be allowed on both this Bill and Australian Federal Police Amendment Bill.",66
94,Mr FRY ,RACIAL DISCRIMINATION,"Fraser) (9. l 3) - When the debate on the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Bill was adjourned I was pointing out how important it is in any democratic society that citizens the right and the means to seek redress for injus­ tices perpetrated by organs of the state, including the police. In Australia one such important organ is the Australian Federal Police and the Bill vides the public with the means of achieving a sat­ isfactory investigation of almost all types of griev­ ances linked with the Australian Federal Police. Most importantly, the Bill seeks to establish mechanism that will not hamstring members of the Australian Federal Police in carrying out their vital role in the community. By strengthening role of the Ombudsman, the Bill seeks to strike sensible balance between providi�g the public with a guarantee that their grievances will be en­ ergetically and conscientiously investigated and, at the same time, screening the authorities from malicious and destructive complaints. However, the Bill still has some minor gaps which could be plugged. I refer to the provision which the Ombudsman has the power to hire police officers to investigate particular com­ plaints. This is set out fairly clearly. It would the benefit of the legislation and would assist Ombudsman if that power were extended to the but hiring of former police officers. people may be sceptical of the objectivity of a former officer, since there is provision for the ing of existing police officers in certain circum­ stances, there could be very good grounds for ing a former police officer if it were clear that deep knowledge of police procedure would great advantage in ensuring a thorough investi­ gation. I am sure that the Ombudsman's office would exercise that right with great discretion. The Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs ( Mr Viner) may care to comment on that proposal. My other concern with the Bill is the potential problem presented by the sub judice law. The Minister may care to comment on that matter also and indicate whether the Ombudsman could be inhibited in any way by such law. It could happen frequently that, the police having taken action Second Reading against a citizen, as a result of which charges have been laid, the citizen may wish to lay a counter­ charge against the police. I can imagine a situation in which the Ombudsman may be inhibited in his investigation by the sub judice law. I believe he use his discretion in handling such a situ­ ation. However, it could present a problem and I would like the Minister to make clear whether the the Ombudsman would be inhibited by the sub judice law. When many complaints are being made against the police it often becomes quite apparent that problems of morale exist within the police force have itself. That has been my experience in the Aus­ tralian Capital Territory. The recent amalga­ mation of the old Commonwealth Police and the Australian Capital Territory Police was charac­ pro­ terised by many teething problems. Over time many of these have been eliminated, but others re­ main. In that respect, I know that members of the Protective Services Division feel that they have a been disadvantaged in the amalgamation, in re­ gard to wages and salaries in particular. I believe they have a legitimate complaint. A recent deter­ the mination, of August 1 980, although it covered a people performing general police duties did not extend benefits to members of the Protective Ser­ vices Division, who lag considerably behind other officers in that respect. It is possible for police officers performing exactly the same work to be receiving significantly different rates of pay-the difference sometimes being as much as $2,000 a by year. The present Minister has been sympathetic to complaints made by the Protective Services Division and I believe he will continue to examine be to these problems and overcome them as they arise. the Many of the initial problems have been overcome, the wages issue is still a matter of concern for Although some quite a few officers. Another problem is that there is still difficulty hir­ in obtaining suitable uniforms for some policemen and policewomen. I understand that there are no hir­ winter uniforms available for the women a members of the Protective Services Division, and be a with winter coming up pretty quickly, the Government should apply itself to the problem and ensure that the morale of the people perform­ ing this important work is maintained. If there is good morale in the force fewer complaints are made against it by the public. The Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Bill 1981 is an im­ portant step forward for Australia. I hope that its spirit will be copied by all other States. I com­ mend the Bill to the House.",66
95,Mr DONALD CAMERON ,RACIAL DISCRIMINATION,"F adden) (9.20 ) -1 want to compliment the Australian Law Reform Commission, which, as all honour­ able members know, is headed by Mr Justice Michael Kirby, on the success it has had over the years. It could be said that the Commission has not won approval for everything it has recom­ mended. I suggest it has won more approval than the Opposition and the back bench of the Govern­ ment side of this Parliament have managed to win in the last five, six or even ten years. Not every­ thing put forward by the Law Reform Com­ mission commands my agreement, but it has had more than its share of success. The Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Bill is one example of its suggestions not only being taken seriously by the Government but also being acted upon and in­ corporated in the nation's legislation. I am keen to speak on this Bill so that I can ex­ press the view that this legislation should be regarded as the ideal by all State police forces within the Commonwealth of Australia. As you are fully aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, I come from the State of Queensland. I think that was your home State before you shifted to New South Wales. Undoubtedly the Queensland Police Force, like the police force of every other State, subjected to varying degrees of criticism from time to time. Some say that the Queensland Police Force is the worse in Australia for its appreciation of the liberties of the individual, and others say that from time to time police forces from other States take that prize. r do not intend to enter into the question of which State has the best or the worse police force. However, I make the observation that an individ­ ual policeman is in some cases probably without full appreciation or knowledge of the power that he possesses. There lies in his hands a greater ability to destroy the lifestyle of an individual than perhaps lies in the hands of the vast majority of the members of this House and the Senate. An arrest involving the action of bricking, which all honourable members will realise is the falsifica­ tion of evidence, or even an arrest based on the personal reaction of a policeman to the behaviour of a person being apprehended can have an effect on a person's life which goes with him or her to the grave. Even the wrongful stopping of a person along the road for a suspected motor offence can have an effect on that person's life at a later I said earlier that I see this legislation as ideal, and it is my fervent wish that every State govern­ ment, irrespective of its political persuasion, study the contents of this legislation, which should be an example to the police forces of the nation. I have long held the view that in a number of occu­ pations one simply cannot win. Those occu­ pations cannot be free of controversy, and do not always have the respect of the public. Politics is one of those arenas. The public will always be div­ ided. The lot of a policeman is not that much different. With politicians, a love-hate relation­ ship exists. The same applies to the police force. A person in trouble cannot ring a policeman quickly enough. A person free of trouble is likely to be either highly critical of police force actions or praiseworthy. The community divides on that subject. Not everybody loves the copper. I think in the Sydney Daily Telegraph today a cartoon showed policemen combing Kings Cross. Some­ one popping up through a manhole-that represented the underworld-said something to the effect: 'We are trying to keep undesirables out of this district. Why don't you beat off?' In a nutshell, I am saying that a policeman will not always be given credit and be on top. How­ ever, one of the inescapable facts is that there are members of the police force who will let the team down. There are policemen who will put their lives at total risk. Many have paid the supreme sacrifice in their efforts to protect John Citizen or save him from one of the accidents about which is we read from time to time. Many have laid down their lives. I think that overall the police forces of this country have given far more to the com­ munity than they have ever asked for in return. However, as with the proverbial barrel of apples, there is always a rotten one. This legislation gives the aggrieved John Citizen the opportunity to re­ port an injustice that he believes has been perpetrated. This legislation will leave open the way for in­ volvement by the Ombudsman. It is opportune to reflect that the role of the Ombudsman since the creation of his position not so many years ago has been greatly enlarged. When a situation gets hot it seems to suit governments of all political per­ suasions to write a reference in legislation to the Ombudsman so he can settle the matter. The com­ bination of the involvement of the Ombudsman and the Internal Investigation Division of the Australian Federal Police will go a long way towards ensuring that where a rotten apple causes an overall poor reflection on a police force that rotten apple will have to answer to somebody at some time. One of the facts of life that I have stage. come to appreciate as I make my way through my three score years and ten is that 100 men can do something, but if one man does the wrong thing the public-including all members of this House-will spend more time talking about that one man who has done the wrong thing than about the 99 people who have spent their lives doing the right or good thing. Mr Barry Jones-Mark Antony's oration said the same thing, but not so eloquently.",67
96,Mr DONALD CAMERON,RACIAL DISCRIMINATION,"I remember that the honourable member's name is Barry Jones, but I do not remember the electorate he rep­ resents. He is somewhat praiseworthy in his observations.",68
97,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,RACIAL DISCRIMINATION,Hon. J. D. M. Dobie )-Order! All honourable members will ad­ dress the Chair and not each other.,68
98,Mr DONALD CAMERON,RACIAL DISCRIMINATION,"Yes, Mr Deputy Speaker. I appreciate the interjection. Perhaps it is every 2,000-odd years that a man with similar wisdom passes through this world. As I was say­ ing, this legislation allows that rotten apple to be torn from the barrel. I believe the respect in which the Australian Federal Police Force is presently held will grow as a result of this legislation. I do not wish to repeat the aspects of the legislation which were outlined by the Minister for Employ­ ment and Youth Affairs ( Mr Viner) in his second reading speech and by other speakers, but I make a special appeal to all the State Ministers of police, including the Queensland Minister for Local Government, Main Roads and Police, the Honourable Russell Hinze, to examine this legis­ lation closely to see what it offers and to balance in their minds the criticism which is directed to their police forces with the high respect in which the Australian Federal Police is held. In so doing they should remember that even though the Aus­ tralian Federal Police Force is held on a very high pinnacle, this Parliament sees this legislation as being necessary. Indeed, I believe the Whitlam Government in 1 975 attempted to introduce simi­ lar legislation · and it was the eclipse of that reign which caused the legislation to go into limbo. Two or three years after that this Government recog­ nised that there was still a need for this legislation. Whilst we can all allude to experiences that we have had with various police forces, I believe it is probably appropriate that I do not introduce mat­ ters of a personal nature. I conclude by simply reminding the various State governments that this legislation is setting a new standard and providing a new opportunity for the Australian people to re­ port their grievances and to feel assured that their grievances against the police will be fully inves­ tigated. That in itself not only protects the Aus­ tralian public but also ensures the enshrinement of tht': high standard which so many of the nation's policemen endeavour to attain but which is so often eroded by the actions of one or two irresponsible individuals who should have never been given the power in the first place. My final observation is one that I made earlier in my comments, namely, that so many policemen fail to realise that in their hands more than in those of me in this Parliament lies the power to destroy or to make so many individual lives in our community. Occasionally some of them truly fumble that ball which causes irreparable damage to be inflicted upon the lives of people who are basically as decent if not better than themselves.",68
99,Dr KLUGMAN ,RACIAL DISCRIMINATION,"Prospect) (9.35)-I rise on the Opposition side of the House to support this legislation because I see it as an improvement. As the last honourable member who spoke, the honourable member for Fadden ( Mr Donald Cameron) , said it is an improvement even on much of the State legislation. J am not aware of all the legislation in the States but I am aware of the legislation in NSW and I must admit that this i� an ' improvement on that. Let me quickly refresh the memories of honourable members as to what ,this Bill when dealing with the handling of compla ints against members of the Australian Federal Police actually proposes could be done. The second read­ ing speech of the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs ( Mr Viner) reads: A complaint by a member of the public as to police conduct may be made to a police officer or to the Ombudsman; where made to a police officer, the Ombudsman mllst be notified. I think that is an important point. It further states: Complaints as to practices and procedures of the force will ordinarily be investigated by the Ombudsman. That refers to general practices and procedures and not specific complaints against an individual member of the Police Force. The speech continues: Other complaints as to the police, that is to say, complaints as to conduct of individual officers, will be investigated in­ itially by the Internal Investigation Division previously mentioned. That is, the Internal Investigation Division which is set up in the police force. The speech continues: If the Ombudsman is dissatisfied with the report of the Investigatin Division on a complaint, he may ask for a further investigation by the Investigation Division or he may carry out an investigation by his own office. I think that is a very important point and I will refer to it again when I deal with the criticism of what the Ombudsmen in other States are doing. The speech continues: The Minister may, on his own initiative, establish a special inquiry into any matter relating to the Force. . . . The Ombudsman may recommend that criminal or disciplinary charges should be brought against a member; if the Commissioner does not agree with the recommendation, the matter shall be referred to the Attorney-General, who shall decide what charges, if any, should be brought. Criminal charges against a police officer will be brought in the ordinary courts; disciplinary complaint from a member of the public will be dealt with by the Federal Police Disciplinary Tribunal to be established under the legislation; I will not go into details as to what the exact method of appeals and so on is, but I think basi­ cally the important point is that there is a method for investigating the Police Force. One of the great difficulties when one is dealing with com­ plaints against the Police Force is that there is no­ body in the community adequately capable of investigating complaints, apart from the Police Force itself. It is a problem that has arisen in Australia and it is a problem which, probably be­ cause we have some similarity with the United States of America and the United Kingdom, has repeatedly been portrayed in films and television programs dealing with policemen who have transgressed the law or people who have made al­ legations against those policemen. I think it is an important improvement that there is provision for the Ombudsman to investigate the problems. Let me quote from the report of the Ombudsman of NSW for the year ended 30 June 1 979. It is the latest printed report but not the latest report pre­ pared. The Ombudsman, Mr Smithers, is a fairly conservative gentleman who is about to retire. He is certainly not an extremely radical person who tends to criticise the Police Force unnecessarily. In the report he states: I have experienced some feelings out my functions under the Act as the powers of investigation are very different to those under the Ombudsman Act. He is talking about investigating the police. He continues: Under that Act I can obtain authority, inspect papers, obtain reports, enter premises and interview anyone and I can carry out a formal investigation if I think it warranted. None of these powers apply under the provisions of the Police Regulation (Allegations of Miscon­ duct) Act. My function under that Act is restricted. I receive complaints, making a decision as to whether there should be an investigation or endeavour to conciliate if it might be ap­ propriate. I then refer the Investigation, I receive a report from him, I decide whether it is properly investigated, and when the investigation is completed then decide whether the complaint has been sus­ tained or not and report accordingly. Under this Act---That is the New South Wales ActI do not investigate in the full sense, I merely act in a super­ visory capacity and finally report to the complaint on the re­ sult of the investigation. I do not, of course, have to follow the police view as to the result of the investigation and in fact in some cases I have not agreed with the Commissioner's conclusion. However, it is somewhat difficult to find otherwise in most instances when there is only available the various statements made by the per­ sons involved to consider and that there is no opportunity to test the evidence. charges originating from a That is the important point. The Ombudsman in New South Wales continued: I have seen in a number of the reports and statements made by the police in the course of an investigation, a tendency to denigrate the complainant and attribute to him some sinister motive. This may be correct in some cases but in many the complaints appear to be genuine ones. Such comments are quite unnecessary and do not help in the carrying out of an im­ partial investigation. To 30 June, 1 979,that is, for the financial year 1 978-79224 complaints were received. By the way, it is interesting to note that in New South Wales in the following year-that is, in 1 980-the number of complaints against the police increased from 224 to 741 . The number of complaints more than trebled in that time. I do not know what the explanation for that is, whether people have become more aware of the ability of the Ombudsman to receive complaints or whether there has been an increase in the mis­ behaviour or alleged misbehaviour of police officers, but I assume it is the former. The Ombudsman in New South Wales went on to state: As detailed earlier, the Ombudsman is limited in his powers under this Act, and has difficulties in making his own indepen­ dent appraisal of the parties involved. There is no right to in­ terview the various parties, other than perhaps the complain­ ant, and any further investigation would be limited to determining whether the police investigation has been prop­ of frustration in carrying erly carried out. Whilst I do not suggest for one moment that the Ombuds­ man should carry out a full scale investigation of these mat­ ters, I consider that at least there should be a right for him to investigate further if he considers that in the public interest he should do so coupled with the right to interview witnesses if he felt it to be necessary. information from any public The Ombudsman in New South Wales went on to make a number of criticisms of the fact that a copy of the complaint in the name of the com­ plainant is furnished to the policeman concerned and that people therefore are worried that there might be cases in which pressure is exerted on the complaint to the Commissioner for complainant to withdraw his complaint. The Ombudsman in New South Wales stated: In such event, if possible, I confirm this direct with the com­ plainant but I do express concern that whilst I have no evi­ dence that influence has been brought to bear on cO\llplain­ ants to withdraw, this would be possible. The 1 980 report of the Ombudsman in New South Wales has not yet been published but it has been tabled in Parliament. In an article in the Sydney Morning Herld of 28 November 1 980 the Ombudsman is reported to have stated in his 1 980 report: I consider that it is essential for the legislation to be amended so that the Ombudsman, where he is dissatisfied with the investigation performed investigate the matter for himself or direct that one of his officers does so. . . . I think that is an important point. It has been embraced in sub-clause (3) of clause 27 of the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Bill, which is before us, if my interpretation is correct. That sub-clause states: For the purposes of an investigation Ombudsman may, by notice in writing, require(c) a member, or an officer of a Department or prescribed authority,I assume that includes a policeman or a member of the Australian Federal Policewho is, in the opinion of the Ombudsman, able to give information relevant to the investigation; to attend before him at a time and there to answer questions In other words, under that sub-clause the Ombudsman would be able to investigate the complaint. I am not one who holds a great brief for the police force, my having been associated with the New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties for many years. I was one of its foun­ dation members and for some 1 3 years I was a member of the executive of that Council. I cer­ tainly became aware, if I had not been aware be­ fore I joined the Council, of many shortcomings in the behaviour of police officers. Having said that, I am aware also that in many ways policemen have fewer civil liberties than do other members of the community. They are unable to refuse to answer questions when cross-examined by their superiors. I draw the attention of the House to sub-clause (6) of clause 7 and the whole of clause 50 of the Bill. Sub-clause (6) of clause 7 states: Where a member of the Australian Federal Police is direc­ ted . . . to furnish information, produce a document or record or answer a question, the member is not excused from complying with the direction on the ground that(a) the furnishing of the information, the production of the document or record or the answering of the question(i) would be contrary to the public interest; or (ii) might make him liable to a penalty; or (b) the information, the production of the document or record or the answer to the question might tend to incriminate him . . . . So, under that provision, a police officer would be in a worse position in terms of civil liberties than would be an ordinary member of the community who, as I understand the law, is not forced to answer questions for the purpose of incriminating himself. The Bill goes on to state that the answers to such questions are not admissible in evidence against such an officer in any civil or criminal pro­ by the police, has a right to ceedings other than proceedings for an offence in relation to a breach of discipline; in other words, if he refuses to answer such questions. Whilst that provides such an officer with some protection, I argue that it is not complete protection. For example, in a case of two police officers being charged with conspiring to obtain a bribe from a member of the public, under this provision those under this Part, the officers would be forced to answer questions which were incriminating and, whilst the answers could not be used in evidence against those officers, they could be used against their alleged co-conspirators. My interpretation of the proposed legislation might be wrong, but the way I interpret it people in fact will be forced to incriminate themselves in some way. I am sufficiently a libertarian to believe that civil liberties should be extended also to members and place specified in the notice relevant to the investigation. of the police force. As far as the police force is concerned, the important thing really is for people who misbehave to be cleaned out of it. That is not easily done. It is generally said-I suppose it is the sort of thing that politicians ought always to say­ that the vast majority of police officers are terribly honest, sincere, able and good people and it is just the odd person in the police force who misbe­ haves. I have not had extensive contact with members of the police force, but I have had sufficient contact with them. I have listened to them in courts and so on-to believe that many police officers, probably the majority, at some stage perjure themselves when giving evidence. [ am not suggesting that they perjure themselves in the sense of trying to frame an innocent person; they are completely convinced that the person concerned is guilty, or they might even have been present when the person concerned committed a certain act. But I believe that for the purpose of gaining a conviction before a magistrate or a jury they will perjure themselves, they will make up a story. Let me quickly give an example of this. I refer to my first contact with the New South Wales police force. Many years ago, in the 1 940s, I was involved in a demonstration in connection with the Sydney University Labor Club of which I was the President at the time. It was not a big demon­ stration but the police expected that it would be. They expected the wharfies to join the demonstra­ tion. Therefore, members of Squad 2 1 , an aggress­ ive part of the police force at that time-possibly it still is-were dressed up in what they con­ sidered to be wharfies clothing. The wharfies did not turn up for the demonstration. Some 30 or 40 university students were there in Wynyard Park near the Dutch Consulate. The demonstration concerned the attempt at that time by the Netherlands to re-enter Indonesia. Members of No. 2 1 Division moved in on the students, roughed them up and arrested some 1 5 of them, including me. In my case, I took the number of a uniformed policeman who assaulted a student. The next thing that happened was that two detec­ tives in plain clothes arrested me and took me away. I was later charged with assaulting a police­ man, resisting arrest and using offensive language. These charges were not true in my case although there is no doubt that such charges were true in some cases. It is true that some people did use offensive language or did resist arrest. It is interesting to note that in every case police gave the same sort of evidence. Fifteen people were arrested and in every case the police­ man would get up in the box and say: 'I am a con­ stable in the New South Wales Police Force. I was proceeding along Margaret Street in a westerly di­ rection at 3.40 p.m. I saw the defendant wildly gesticulating'. That is a lovely phrase. The police­ man would then say: 'I approached the defendant and asked him to desist. I said: ""I am a constable in the New South Wales Police Force and I tell you to desist"".' I notice that the Leader of the position ( Mr Hayden) , who is an ex-member of a police force, is entering the chamber. In every case the defendant was supposed to have said: 'Y ou are nothing but a so-and-so copper' and then another word referring to parts of the female geni­ talia. This evidence was given in 1 4 out of 1 5 cases. Even at that time. I was known for my rather strong anti-communist attitude. After much consideration I was charged with saying to a detective in plain clothes who looked like a wharf labourer: 'You are nothing but a so-and-so commo'. I was charged with using the same swear words but the word 'comma' was substituted for 'copper'.",68
100,Mr HAYDEN,RACIAL DISCRIMINATION,That is imagination.,71
101,Dr KLUGMAN,RACIAL DISCRIMINATION,"That is imagination and it was the height of imagination at that time in the New South Wales Police Force. I hope that things have improved. But the important point is that many people in New South Wales and many people all over the country know that the police have given false evidence against them in court. These people ought to be able to take some action against the police. This brings me to a question which has just re­ cently been raised again, the tape recording and videotaping of alleged confessions. I can see prob­ lems associated with that. One of the problems that has been raised with me by a judge whom [ respect very much for his views on civil liberties is that normally a person going into the box can refuse to answer questions put to him. He can refuse to say anything. However, if a videotape is made of an interview at a police station appar­ ently that videotape could be submitted as evi­ dence. That person may have made statements or admissions at the police station which he would not be p repared to make during cross­ examination in court. I think that is obviously one of the difficulties. Many of us have heard stories about the police. Until the last election a very well known ex­ member of the New South Wales Police Force, the former honourable member for Hunter, was a the member of this place. We have heard many stories about police. I think it is terribly important that this Federal legislation is made to work. It is also important that the States take note of the legis­ lation and, if it works, introduce similar legislation.",71
102,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,RACIAL DISCRIMINATION,Hon. J. D. M. Dobie)-Order! I too must ask the honourable member to desist. His time has expired.,71
103,Dr EDWARDS ,RACIAL DISCRIMINATION,"Berowra) (9.50)-- Unlike my Op­ honourable friend, the member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) , who just concluded his speech, I enter this debate as an unashamed advocate and sup­ porter of the Australian police forces. I would like to stress the words of the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) in introducing the Bill in the Senate. He said: The Bill should be regarded as in no way a reflection on the Australian Federal Police or its members who, with the fewest possible exceptions, perform their difficult tasks with honesty, zeal and devotion to duty. Any police force, and I think the Australian Fed­ eral Police in particular, has a difficult and exact­ ing task to perform which often involves personal danger. As Gilbert of Gilbert and Sullivan fame put it: 'A policeman's lot is not a happy one'. I re­ peat, the Minister said this Bill should in no way be regarded as a reflection on the force or on its high reputation for honesty, effectiveness and de­ votion to duty. In the few remarks that I want to address to the House I wish to refer to the point that the honour­ able member for Prospect raised concerning the use of tapes. I would like to say something about the whole issue of the adapting of police methods to modern technology and in particular to micro­ electronic technology based on the silicon chip. Perhaps this is particularly appropriate on the day when the Minister for the Capital Territory ( Mr Hodgman) has just announced a project by the National Semiconductor company loo king towards the setting up of a chip facility in the Aus­ tralian Capital Territory. In this respect [ have in mind in particular the desirability of police officers using tape recorders, not video equip­ ment, in investigative and interrogation situations. In a spirited debate concerning the much malig­ ned police 'verbal' on Sydney radio only last Friday, Detective Sergeant Tony Lauer, the Presi­ dent of the New South Wales Police Association, finished his remarks by saying: Then the only fair thing to do would be to provide the 9,000 policemen in New South Wales with a tape recorder. With that his radio opponent, barrister Shaun Flood, heartily agreed. In my view, that is bang on. I am certain that the great majority of cases in the long run would be to the benefit of police forces and not hindrance although I am aware many police officers would initially see it as such. T am convin­ ced that a very significant contribution would made to police credibility-this is the key thing-if in fact there were a tape recorder every policeman's pocket. A small recorder would be the honest policeman's-and that means the overwhelming majority of policemen-best de­ fence in a complaint situation and in all other aspects of investigative and interrogative police work. Also it would be of great value in sub­ sequent court recordings. The Minister for Administrative Services ( Mr Newman) in his second reading speech, and my tively colleague the honourable member for Fadden ( Mr Donald Cameron) a few moments ago, ac­ knowledged the contribution that His Honour Justice Michael Kirby's Law Reform Commission made to the proposals in the legislation. Only recently-at the time of the last week of members sitting-in a speech to an international forum of police. forensic scientists, Mr Justice Kirby stressed the importance of taped evidence in courts. He spoke of sound recordings-and possibly video Act recordingsas potentially 'a tremendous weapon' in the fight against crime. r am sure that is absolutely right. What I am stressing is that all along the line, from investigat­ ory discussions in the field, through interrogation, to the courts, it is the credibility of the police which stands to gain. I am certain that police officers, understandably initially suspicious such gadgetry, particularly the pocket recorder [ have talked about, would come to see the gains all round in combating crime and in underwriting police credibility, and would come to see that these gains would far outweigh the disadvantages. A report of a British royal commission in January this year, along with other sources, points to problems in this area-the honourable member for Prospect pointed to some of these. There are two main problems firstly, the cost, and, secondly, the area of authenticating tapes, of preventing the tampering with and editing of tapes. Those are problems which I am confident-indeed I know­ are not beyond the scope of modern micro­ electronic technology. In this matter, therefore, I believe the ball is in the court of police officers at all levels. I believe they should accept the aid of each of modern technology and gain the benefits in terms of the more effective combating of crime and-I cannot stress this too much-the gains in the area of police credibility which this technology offers.",71
104,Mrs KELLY ,RACIAL DISCRIMINATION,"Canberra) ( 1 0.2) -1 speak in in support of both of these BiIls, the Australian Fed­ this eral Police Amendment Bill 1981 and the Com­ a plaints (Australian Federal Police) BiIl 198 1 . 1 believe they will provide a workable system whereby the rights of police officers and the pub­ be lic are protected. The appeals provisions for members of the public to make complaints against in police provide several avenues by which action may be taken. The public may appeal either to the Ombudsman or to the Internal Investigation Div­ ision of the Australian Federal Police. Further provision is made for the responsible Minister to order a special investigation of a specific com­ plaint. The detailed procedures set down for the investigation of any complaint should ensure that all such matters are handled thoroughly and effec­ while at the same time preserving the rights of both the police and public. Where any com­ plaint is made to a police officer, the Ombudsman Mr must be notified. Through this legislation the Ombudsman's role is strengthened and extended, and should result in improved safeguards for of the public in their dealings with the The rights of citizens are further improved under the provisions of clause 4 of the Bill for an to amend the Australian Federal Police Act 1 979. Under this clause, members of the police force must at all times wear identification numbers on the front of their uniforms and there is provision for a penalty of $500 for failure to do so. The arrangements for the investigation of force complaints by means of the Ombudsman, the Internal Investigation Division of the Australian of Federal Police and ministerial action should ensure that a n effective mechanism has been established. The rights of police officers have been enhanced by provision for the Commonwealth to assume vicarious liability for the actions of police in the performance of their duties. In this way, the Commonwealth, like all other employers, will be liable in respect of tort committed by an em­ ployee. In large measure the objectives of the Law Reform Commission report of 1 978 have been enacted, with minor variations resulting from the creation of the Australian Federal Police in 1 979. These measures will be welcomed by members of the police force as well as the general community. This legislation is the culmination of a lengthy procedure for the establishment of the Australian Federal Police Force. We may recall that the pro­ posal to establish a national police force was reac­ tivated following the bombing of the Hilton Hotel in Sydney on 1 3 February 1 978. Sir Robert Mark's inquiry into the organisation of police re­ sources in the Commonwealth was an urgent mat­ ter and the report was tabled on 1 3 April 1 978. The Government acted swiftly to set up a task force to give effect to its in-principle decision to establish a single federal police force incorporat­ ing the existing Australian Capital Territory and Commonwealth police forces. The Australian Federal Police Bill 1 979 became law in June 1 979, and the force was established with Sir Colin Woods as commissioner. The Bills under debate today will extend the effectiveness of our police force. They provide members of the general public with additional safeguards and rights of appeal in their dealings with the police. The rights of police officers are protected throughout the complaints procedure and are further strengthened under the provisions whereby Commonwealth liability is extended. I want to refer briefly to the policewho operate in the Australian Capital Territory. They have ex­ tremely close relations with the community at all levels. The new amalgamated Australian Federal Police has continued the tradition of the previous forces and has provided the community with an excellent service. To give one example, on 28 February this year officers of the police force in the Australian Capital Territory held a fete on be­ half of the Multiple Sclerosis Association. This fete had wide support from members of the Aus­ tralian Federal Police. I think this demonstrates their commitment to work very closely with the community. I have noticed that over the last couple of weeks members of the Australian Fed­ eral Police have participated in the Canberra Week festivities. There is a regular community broadcast program on our local television station, Channel 7. These are just examples which demon­ strate the involvement of the police force in the Australian Capital Territory. One point I think needs to be emphasised. Sec­ tion 69 of the Australian Federal Police Act 1 979 provides for the establishment of a police liaison advisory committee for the Australian Capital Territory. That committee has not been set up, despite the fact that the legislation became law in June 1 979. In March 1 980 the Minister for the Capital Territory sent a message to the House of Assembly regarding the proposed committee, seeking the Assembly's advice on the proposal to establish such a committee. The House of Assem­ bly called for the early establishment of the police liaison advisory committee. The proposed com­ mittee is to be chaired by a commissioner and will have five members of the House of Assembly on it. Its functions are set out by regulation. They are to encourage community awareness and under­ standing of such functions of the Australian Fed­ eral Police as relate to the provision of police ser­ vices in the Australian Capital Territory and to advise the Minister on those. I ask the Attorney­ General (Senator Durack) to give urgent con­ sideration to the establishment of this advisory committee. The recommendation for its establish­ ment is set out clearly in legislation and does need to be activated. I must also provide a cautionary note in re­ lation to the police services in the Australian Capital Territory. When the Australian Federal Police was established, the Government gave a commitment that the police officers of the Aus­ tralian Capital Territory and the community would not be disadvantaged by the establishment of the Australian Federal Police. The Australian Capital Territory was to be the responsibility of a separate deputy commissioner with certain auton­ omy. However I understand that lately the officers of that division have been used on national matters. For example, I have had infor­ mation that about 200 officers from various parts of Australia are being sent to the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, but the big ma­ jority of those are from the Australian Capital Territory. I hope that if officers from the Terri­ tory are being used for these national functions, the Australian Capital Territory force will get compensation. I conclude by recommending to the Minister that the police liaison advisory committee be set up immediately and that the Federal Government continue to retain the identity of an Australian Capital Territory community police force.

105,Mr JOHN BROWN ,AUSTRALIAN TOURIST COMMISSION,"Parramatta) ( l 0. 1 1 ) - The Opposition does not intend to oppose the Australian Tourist Commission Amendment Bill. However, it intends to take the opportunity to point out the Government's deficiencies in the whole tourist industry. No one, least of all a rational party such as the Australian Labor Party-which might be of some interest to some honourable members opposite-could argue against the need to increase the number of com­ missioners from nine to 1 0 or to increase the number of Territory representatives from two to three. I am pleased to see that the Minister for Capital Territory ( Mr Hodgman) is sitting at the table, because we consider that Canberra is one of the very important tourist destinations of Australia for many reasons which I need not underline at the moment. In fact, my colleague, the honourable member for Canberra ( Mrs Kelly) would like to speak in a fuller fashion later in the debate about the charms and delights of Canberra. The Opposition is quite delighted that the number of commissioners is being increased to accommodate the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. Of course, a good deal of their revenue comes from tourism. Such moves are indeed sensible. So too is the third aim of the Bill to bring the financial provisions of the Act into line with legislation covering comparable Third Reading statutory authorities. I hope that this Government will be looking towards redressing the very sexist imbalance of the Australian Tourist Commission. Given the comments of the Minister for the Capital Terri­ tory over the last couple of days on sexism issues, I am sure he would back me up in that regard. At present there are nine commissioners of whom Second Reading only one is a female. Does that reflect community participation in tourism? Of course it does not. The Commission will be the poorer while this state of affairs exists. I would like to come directly to the question of the economics of tourism. The most recent and comprehensive report is that put out by the Bu­ Third Reading reau of Industry Economics. It is fairly old be­ cause the latest figures that are available are those for 1 973-74. I would like to refer to the fourth re­ search report entitled The Economic Significance of Tourism in Australia in 1 979'. There is very little doubt that tourism impacts dramatically on our economy. In 1 973-74 tourism contributed 2.6 per cent of gross domestic product. It employed Second Reading 2.4 per cent of the work force and accounted for 3.2 per cent of indirect tax revenue. These figures, which have been referred to before by the Minis­ ter for industry and Commerce ( Sir Phillip Lynch) place tourism at just about the level of the motor manufacturing industry and just behind the mining industry. Obviously it is a very significant industry. The Bureau of Industrial Economics further predicts that by 1 98 5 overseas tourist spending in Australia will rise from 20 per cent to 40 per cent of total tourism spending. That is the amount con­ tributed by overseas visitors. By 1 985 employment in the tourist industry will increase from 2.4 per cent to about 8 per cent of the work force and will add 60,000 new jobs. Its contribution to the gross the domestic product will rise by 80 per cent to about 4.5 per cent of our GDP. Obviously, as is shown by those bald figures, tourism is a very significant industry. A great deal of informed and uninformed de­ bate has taken place on the possible tourist boom. One thing that is certain is that it is one of the prime growth industries and, as such, we in Australia ought to be capitalising on the expan­ sion. Mr Deputy Speaker, the fact is-you will excuse the tourist pun-we are missing the boat quite dramatically. Including the payment for fares, the amount spent in a year by the millions of international travellers on tourist related indus­ tries is estimated to be the staggering figure of $325,000m, or more than six times the annual value of Australia's gross domestic product. The sad fact is that Australia currently extracts much less than one per cent of all international tourist expenditures-in fact about 0.3 per cent, a very tiny proportion of the tourist dollar. That is some­ thing that the Opposition deplores. Even in the Pacific area, where I would have thought just as a matter of fact that Australia would be the leader, our share of tourism is drop­ ping. In 1 970 our share of tourism in this market was 4.7 per cent. By 1 978 it had dropped to 3.8 per cent, showing just how rapidly we were losing out to the other Asian Pacific countries who are so much more aware of tourism as an industry than we are. The honourable member for Bowman ( Mr Jull) is going to join in this debate. I am sure that he shares the views of the Opposition and the optimism that it would like to express in tourism as a growth industry in the future.",74
106,Mr HODGMAN ,AUSTRALIAN TOURIST COMMISSION,He is a very good man.,75
107,Mr JOHN BROWN,AUSTRALIAN TOURIST COMMISSION,"He is a very good member; I agree with the Minister. I do not know what he is doing on the other side of the House. As a result of our failure to exploit the Pacific area, a great many off-shore venues for conventions, sem­ inars, workshops and other events have become a great deal more attractive than Australia. Local tour operators, convention venue entrepreneurs, tourism support industries and the airlines them­ selves face a great loss of business because of this. For instance, seven nights with all travel and ac­ commodation expenses from Sydney cost less than $360 in Fiji and less than $300 in New Zealand. But five nights all-in cost about $400 in Hobart and more than $700 in Darwin; about 30 per cent higher than, for example, Singapore. In the last Budget the Fraser Government allocated to tourism less than $20m. It is interest­ ing to note that the Government gets back $ l Om of that $20m every 1 2 months in gateway tax, the $ 10 tax it collects from people leaving Australia. So the net contribution to tourism in the last Budget was around the $ 10m mark. I mentioned previously that this industry contributes as much as the motor industry. When we look at the hun­ dreds of millions of dollars expended in promoting that industry I wonder just what the Government is doing in failing to promote tourism as an indus­ try. I know that the argument is quite reasonable that without manufacturing industries we would not have as many people in work; we would not have people wanting holidays; and that tourism perhaps would suffer. I think there is a great im­ balance between the $ 1 Om net for tourism and the hundreds of millions of dollars expended in many manufacturing industries. This Government is neglecting to foster an im­ portant industry. It lacks the imagination and the foresight necessary to capitalise on this growing industry, not only an industry which is economi­ cally significant but also one which gives so much pleasure to the community. The whole leisure in­ dustry is crying out for the type of leadership that an entrepreneurial government could give it, such as was given it by the Labor Government from 1 972 to 1 975. 1 give credit to the present Minister for Industry and Commerce. At least he has some understanding of the tourist industry and has taken some positive steps in recent times. The Bill we are now debating is part of the new-found interest in the tourism business, but it might well be a case of too little too late. I ask the Govern­ ment where it was in the tourism area from 1 975 to 1 978. Perhaps it might say it was on holidays. If it was on a holiday it was doing a lot better than many other people who could not afford a holiday. According to figures from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, growth in tourism in Australia fell last year. The increase in the number of overseas visitors arriv­ ing in Australia was 1 5.9 per cent compared with a growth rate of 25.9 per cent in 1 979. Revenue growth from those tourists fell also. In 1 979 the figure was 27.4 per cent compared with 19. 1 per cent last year. In the same OECD report there is a note of optimism that as the world economy im­ proves so will interest in travel pick up and so will we see a stronger growth rate in the tourist indus­ try. This is in line with predictions previously quoted from the BIE report that by 1 985!overseas tourist spending in Australia will rise from the , present 20 per cent to 40 per cent of total tOUrIsm expenditure. Will we be geared up fon this up­ surge of interest in travel-not just travel but the whole spectrum of the leisure industrJ'? I In 1 972 under the Whitlam Government, in those years of Camelot in Australia, the people of Australia saw the advent of the first Federal Min­ istry for Tourism and Recreation under the direc­ tion of the late Frank Stewart and with it the rec­ ognition that there was a vital role for government in this area, In that time the role of the Australian Tourist Commission was expanded and with it went a brief to step up the promotion of Australia overseas and on the domestic market through the program 'Australia-Land of things to see and do', By 1 975 some $2.34m had been provided in grants and loans for the development of man­ made attractions such as Sovereign Hill, Old Syd­ ney Town, Lachlan Vintage Village and Port Arthur. To the purist, these man-made attractions might seem gauche and almost artificial, but they are essential ingredients in an overall tourism strategy. Our heritage, the colonial frontier people that we were, is encapsulated in places such as Sovereign Hill and Old Sydney Town. These places give Australians of today as well as overseas visitors a dioramic view of our past. Of course it is preferable to visit these man-made at­ tractions in conjunction with the real thing. I might say that that is nowhere more evident than in my home town of Parramatta. In Parramatta some of Australia's real antiquity reposes. Within a radius of less than half a mile exists a cottage that was built by John Macarthur back in I 79 1 - it is the oldest house in Australia; it is still standing-MONICA",75
108,Mr HODGMAN,AUSTRALIAN TOURIST COMMISSION,"A very good Liberal, too.",76
109,Mr JOHN BROWN,AUSTRALIAN TOURIST COMMISSION,I do not know whether he was a Liberal. He was sent back to England for terrible behaviour.,76
110,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,AUSTRALIAN TOURIST COMMISSION,"Mr Millar)­ Order! The Chair is reluctant to interrupt the honourable member in his oratorical safari, but the Chair would be derelict in its duty if it did not observe that even though we are debating the Australian Tourist Commission Amendment Bill and honourable members may distance them­ selves from relevance, the honourable member is required to address his remarks to the Bill.",76
111,Mr JOHN BROWN,AUSTRALIAN TOURIST COMMISSION,"Mr Deputy Speaker, my argument might seem to you to be rather tenu­ ous but we are talking about the promotion of tourism in Australia, which is what the Australian Tourist Commission is all about.",76
112,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN TOURIST COMMISSION,The honourable member is addressing his attention to the Bill. He may proceed. The Chair will hear him.,76
113,Mr JOHN BROWN,AUSTRALIAN TOURIST COMMISSION,"I suggest to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that when I spoke about man­ made and artificial types of tourist attractions, I was suggesting that in Parramatta we have a mar­ vellous collection of real antiquity which is some­ thing to which overseas visitors should be attracted. The reason I mentioned it was that I was hoping that this Government might be pre­ pared to consider subsidising the development of the tourism industry within this part of Sydney. The three cottages to which I wish to refer are: Elizabeth Farm, which was a house built by John Macarthur and where in fact the Australian wool industry started; within 100 yards of that is a house called Experiment Farm Cottage, which was built by James Ruse-that is where the Aus­ tralian wheat industry commenced-and within a range of a quarter of a mile is Hambledon Cot­ tage, which was built by John Macarthur for his daughter, Elizabeth, in 1 8 1 5. Sitting in one small area is a marvellous collection of Australia's real antiquity, looking for development, looking for the injection of government funds to bring this lit­ tle group of cottages up to something that is really significant. I suggest that to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, in passing. I now return to the man-made tourist facilities. We may rave all we like about the grandeur and beauty of Australia's natural attractions, but the fact is that very few international tourists seek them out. I suspect that the cost of domestic air fares, despite the Minister's protestations to the contrary, are the prime re:1son for the neglect of our far-flung natural attractions. I am supporled in my claim that such places as Ayers Rock and the Great Barrier Reef are neglected by overseas visitors by a Qantas Airways Ltd survey con­ ducted on departing foreign tourists in 1 973. This survey revealed, quite disappointingly, that Ayers Rock was visited by a mere 2 per cent and the Great Barrier Reef, which is in your home State, Mr Deputy Speaker, by only 4 per cent of such visitors. That is rather depressing when we con­ sider that the Great Barrier Reef-I know that the honourable member for Bowman has spoken very eloquently on this in the past-is one of the really great attractions of this world. It is one of the wonders of the world. It is a really magnificent attraction for tourists and yet only 4 per cent of our international visitors are going there. Of course, the two-airline agreement which is to be updated will entrench this position probably for another 1 0 years unless the Minister in charge of tourism is able to convince his colleagues to do otherwise. Whilst it is true to say that this situation might have improved since 1 973, it is still evident that most foreign tourists spend their time and money in the capital cities, with Sydney being the most visited. I could not really blame them for that. We are talking about the great cosmopolitan cities of the world, and of course Sydney is just slightly ahead of Canberra. Really, it is one of the most beautiful cities of the world. It is no wonder that overseas visitors go there in droves. I suggest that by investing money in the likes of Sovereign Hill and Old Sydney Town we ensure some diversification of the tourist dollars---a dis­ tribution to regional areas, if you like. I imagine that the coalition government would favour such a strategy. Yet we have seen little, if any, support for the continuatio!l of the former Labor Govern­ ment's initiatives. Who would deny the employment opportuni­ ties created by these man-made, operations; that is, regional job opportunities, which is giving em­ ployment to people in country areas where unem­ ployment is worse? Also to be considered is the ac­ commodation which springs up around these attractions and with it even more employment opportunities. Tourism and leisure activities filter right through the economic system. The BIE re­ port's conclusions stated: . . . tourism is already of Australian economy with direct or indirect effects on almost every industry. It has been stated that tourism or leisure, or the two together, make a contribution to all 1 09 in­ dustry groups in Australia. Any Australian Government ignores tourism at its peril. Given the evidence of all the economic indicators which show the value of tourism to the national econ­ omy, I put it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that there is an overwhelming argument for the re­ instatement of the Department of Tourism and Recreation. Certainly, after 1 98 3 when Labour is in office, we will be looking to do just that. By that time, the leisure industry will have grown to such proportions that it will not be able to be ignored, as seems to be presently the case. Let me list some of the reasons why I believe that nothing less than a fully operational Federal department is capable of effectively harnessing the exciting potentials of the leisure industry. Quite naturally, my top priority is employment opportunity. Here, in an area of our lives which affects so many other industries, a Federal government has a unique opportunity to stimulate the economy and create employment simply by investing in a man-made attractions and other types of tourist facilities. Leisure is a very labour intensive area. The BIE report pointed this out. Areas such as restaurants, hotels and clubs are very labour intensive. I point out to anybody who is interested that the reason New South Wales has the lowest unemployment rate in Australia is to a great extent because of the leisure industry which has built up there. Presently there are 3 3,000 permanent jobs pro­ vided in registered clubs in New South Wales with some 1 00,000 more temporary jobs. It is. very un­ likely that anybody wjll ever create a machine that will make beds or serve meals. That is the beauty of the leisure industry. It is totally labour intensive. While I am on the subject of labour and the leisure industry, I mention the oft-quoted la­ ment that penalty rates inhibit the industry. A very excellent report was produced by Roger Kirby who was then the boss of Travelodge Australia Ltd. He pointed out that it is a total furphy to suggest that penalty rates are holding back the accommodation industry in Australia. It is just wrong. No less a person than Professor Brian Johns, the Director of the BIE, stated: The report showed that the prices of tourist services in Australia are not significantly higher than in other developed countries. Again I quote from a Press release issued by the Minister last year when he visited Tokyo. He cited figures from a world survey conducted by the considerable significance to the economic research department of the Union Bank of Switzerland. He stated: Our tourist industry can compete favourably with other alternative tourist destinations around the world . . . The general level of prices in Sydney was ranked lower than those in 33 of the 45 cities (surveyed). The important and most significant part of that is that we can provide such competitive prices within a framework of a high living standard. There is absolutely no reason why Australian workers ought to lower their living standards in order to attract the tourist dollar. Consequently there is no good reason why penalty rates should be abandoned. They were hard won. Debate interrupted.

115,Mr WEST ,ADJOURNMENT,"Cunningham) ( 1 0.30)-For some time now we have been considerably concerned at the cuts in expenditure to the States for com­ m u n it y h e a l t h services that have been implemented by this Federal Government. The facts are that nationally in 1 975 $59.5m was made available to the States for the community health service. In 1 980-8 1 the same figure-$59.5m­ was allocated. Of course, when one allows for inflation this means in real terms that there was a cut of some 39 per cent. In New South Wales the relevant figures were $25.8m in 1 975 and $24.9m in 1 980-8 1-a cut in real terms of 41 per cent. In addition to these cuts which in effect have a double-banked effect, in 1 97 5 the Federal Government provided 90 per cent of expenditure under the formula and the States 10 per cent. In 1 977 this Fraser Federal Government cut the Commonwealth contribution to this formula to 7 5 per cent with 25 per cent to be provided by the States. In 1 978 this Government went even further and made it a 50-50 arrangement or a dol­ lar for dollar basis. The effect of this financially with regard to New South Wales is: In 1 980-8 1 the Federal Government made $24.9m available and the State matched it with $24.9m-that is almost $50m. But the State had to put in $25m. In 1 975 to get the same $50m the Federal Government would have put in $45m and the State only $5m. Little wonder that New South Wales and other States are having great difficulty in maintaining their community health centre services. I am very concerned at the effect of this in my electorate of Cunningham in the lllawarra area in New South Wales where we have 29 community health centres. In 1 976 there was a staff of ap­ proximately 200. This has been broken down to 1 67 by 1981 . In this financial year New South Wales is experiencing a $ 1 .2m shortfall. The New South Wales Health Commission has been forced to implement a policy of no replacements of vacancies as they occur through resignations or even annual leave, accouchement leave and so on. If the present rate of decrease continues the ser­ vice will be down to a staff of 1 40 by 1 July this year. These cuts, of course, have been in direct care services. The Press release put out by the combined unions employed in the community health centres states: This means that many areas may be without services such as nursing care for the sick and dying, support of the mentally physically and mentally handicapped and in some cases school medical and baby health services. grammes such as pre-natal and parenting education, coronary screening, breast self-examination, health education to schools and community, anti-smoking, special playgroups, relaxation, diabetic counselling etc. will be severely curtailed . . . I want to draw the attention of the House to an article in the IUawarra Mercury of last week which is headlined: 'Cost cutting could add to suffering-Dying cancer patient may lose her aide'. The article states: Mrs Barbara Walsh cried yesterday when she got the news her Community Health nurse might not be calling again after tomorrow. Mrs Walsh, of Harry Graham Drive, Mt Kembla, has ter­ minal cancer. She has been bedridden for 1 2 months. Her doctor calls three or four time.s a day to. ease her suffering. Mrs Walsh's nurse is one of 1 4 Health Com. mission relief employees whose job is on the line because of these Federal Government cuts in this vital service. r want to condemn at this stage the mendacious role played by the honourable member for Macarthur ( Mr Baume). I quote what the honourable member said from the Illawarra Mercury of last week. The headline states: 'Govt couldn't run a hivatory, says Baume'. The article went on to say of the honourable member: He said the Federal Government has increased its contri­ bution to community health services this year by 2l per cent, . . . to $24.9 million. All I can say is that his figures are as shonky as his language is intemperate and his claimed facts are mendacious. I have put on the record what has ac­ tually occurred since 1 975 on this matter. In New South Wales the cuts have been of the nature of 40 per cent under the Fraser Government. We re­ alise that this is part of a wider attack on resource allocations for community health services, public housing and so on. As the Treasury said, if the re­ sources boom continues with a tremendous de­ mand on private infrastructure capital finances and also with a demand on the States to provide the infrastructure for this development we. can see many more of these cuts coming up in the next Budget. I appeal to the House by asking: Do we really want to kill and to terminate the com­ munity health centres that have done so much to improve the health of our people? I look to the day when the community health centres in Australia as set up by the Whitlam Labor Government in 1 974 and 1 975 can not only pro­ vide these preventative health services and these home nursing care services that I have talked about but also can actually employ doctors and specialists in them so that they c�n provide a real ill, alternative to fee-for-service medicine in this country. In addition preventive pro­",77

117,Mr MILTON ,ADJOURNMENT,"La Trobe) ( 10.35)-Often in debates in this House the problems of the aged pensioners of our community are neglected. r take the opportunity tonight to describe the debilitat­ ing experiences of one of my constituents, Mr Albert Bruce, in his successful attempt to avoid losing the fringe benefits of his age pension. In May 1980 Mr Bruce and his wife received a com­ bined United Kingdom age pension of $69 a week which was $ 1 more than the $68 they were al­ lowed to earn before they lost their fringe benefits. Acting on the advice of the Department of Social Security, Mr Bruce immediately wrote to the United Kingdom pension authorities requesting that his total benefit be reduced to $68 a week. This was done by the United Kingdom Depart­ ment of Health and Social Security. Following this desperate measure Mr Bruce was most upset to find that the Department of Social Security im­ mediately invoked a provision of the Social Ser­ vices Act which states that when the Director­ General is of the opinion that a pensioner has directly or indirectly deprived himself of income in order to qualify for or obtain a pension at a higher rate he may deem the amount involved to be income for a period of 1 2 months of the deprivation. Mr Bruce then wrote back to the Department pointing out that his United Kingdom pension had been reduced. Honourable member's should note that this was a reduction of only $ 1 a week. His pension had been reduced in order that he would not lose what were to him his essential fringe benefits. The Department then informed him that as a result of income received from in­ vestments plus exchange rate fluctuations relating to the United Kingdom pension the combined in­ come of him and his wife meant that their Aus­ tralian pensions must be substantially reduced and they would lose their fringe benefits. Mr Bruce, after some considerable correspondence, was able to prove to the Department that he no longer received investment income but the De­ partment stood firm on the exchange rate require­ ments. After months of wearying disputation Mr Bruce then sought the help of the Ombudsman and his Federal member. Finally, in August the Department of Social Security admitted its errors and Mr and Mrs Bruce's pensions and their fringe benefits were restored. My main purpose in bringing up this matter to­ night is in order that Mr Bruce's battle with an un­ yielding legislative machine should not be in vain. His case is not an isolated one. I have had a con­ siderable number of my constituents complain to me about the penalty provisions. Whilst it is true that the Department does not stand in a good light in the case I have mentioned I do not wish to blame public servants for bad government. Many thousands of age pensioners are suffering re­ ductions in pensions and losing their fringe benefits as a result of these penny-pinching penal provisions. I call on the Government to revoke these savage and inhumane means test provisions of the Social Services Act and to restore some measure of dignity and security to many Aus­ tralians in their retirement years.",78
118,Mr FALCONER ,ADJOURNMENT,"Casey) ( 10.40)-I wish to raise a case concerning an application by a con­ stituent of mine for a Service pension. The con­ stituent is Mr B. R. Smyth of lot l 30B Chum Creek Road, Toolangi, Victoria. Mr Smyth re­ cently was denied a Service pension after attain­ ing 60 years of age. The rejection of his appli­ cation was based on the contention that his service did not satisfy the theatre of war pro­ visions required to qualify for such a pension. However, I point out that Mr Smyth had pre­ viously been given written confirmation by the Department of Veterans' Affairs that he had the required theatre of war service. The chronology of events is this: Mr Smyth originally submitted a let­ ter dated 2 July 1 980-in fact he was personally interviewed-in which he inquired about his eligi­ bility. Several weeks later, on 22 August, a letter from the Department of Veterans' Affairs was sent to him confirming that he had the required theatre of war service to apply for a Service pen­ sion. I seek leave of the House to incorporate in Hansard the brief letter that was received from the Department of Veterans' Affairs on this subject. Leave granted. The document read as follows22nd August 1 980 Mr B. R. Smyth 8 Eagle Rise Lower Templestowe, Vic. 3107 Dear Mr Smyth It has now been confirmed that you have the required Theatre of War service to make application for a service pen­ sion on attaining sixty years of age. The relevant forms are enclosed for your benefit. Yours sincerely T. M. STEPHENS Deputy Commissioner",79
119,Mr FALCONER,ADJOURNMENT,"T thank the House. The let­ ter to Mr Smyth quite clearly states: It has now been confirmed that you have the required Theatre of War service to make application for a Service pen­ sion on attaining sixty years of age. The letter attached relevant forms which he was invited to send in for his benefit. On the basis of that advice Mr Smyth made arrangements to re­ tire from his work. In fact, that is the basis of the problem he now faces. He submitted the relevant application forms and subsequently received a let­ ter from the Department of Veterans' Affairs, dated 3 December, in which he was advised that his service did not satisfy the theatre of war pro­ visions. Apparently, at the specific time he was in an area of active service or an area of war oper­ ations that area was not deemed to be a theatre of war. On that technicality he was denied a Service pension. The problem is that he earlier had received written confirmation from the Depart­ ment that he had the required theatre of war ser­ vice. He received that confirmation six or seven weeks after originally making inquiries. One would have thought that it would be a reasonable expectation that appropriate checks of records would be made in that time. My constituent finds himself in a difficult pos­ ition. He retired from his work on the basis of what he thought to be his eligibility for a Service pension. That has now been denied to him be­ cause of subsequent examinations by the Depart­ ment of Veterans' Affairs. I appreciate that every­ one involved in this matter has acted in good faith but I think that the Department, having made a mistake in writing to my constituent and confirm­ ing that he had the relevant theatre of war service, should now bear the consequences. The Govern­ ment should in some way seek to make up to Mr Smyth what he would otherwise have qualified for in the form of a Service pension. I believe that in justice some way around this problem ought to be found so that Mr Smyth can gain the benefits of what he thought he would receive.",79
120,Mr MILDREN ,ADJOURNMENT,"Ballarat) ( l0.44) - Firstly, I commend my colleague the honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr John Brown) for having drawn the attention of the House to a very fine es­ tablishment in my electorate of Ballarat. It is a flourishing industry which has received consider­ able government support through the years and which is providing considerable employment opportunities for a large number of Ballarat people. It is also providing considerable enjoy­ ment and edification for hundreds of thousands of tourists per annum. I refer of course to Sovereign Hill. It is one of the shining stars in the business firmament of my electorate. Since arriving in this House I have heard honourable gentlemen opposite-there are not many of them here this evening-protest the Government's sincere concern for the develop­ ment of industry in this country. Even during this last couple of weeks, the Treasurer ( Mr Howard) has claimed that industry in this country is recovering and that all is looking well again. He claims a new optimism in industry. I hope that he has some concrete proposals to put to the 270 Ballarat workers who recently have been told that their factory is to be closed down. At 3 p.m. on Thursday, 1 2 March, Escor Ltd, the holding company of Franklin caravans, an­ nounced to the Stock Exchange that it was closing Franklins. I am sure that the star-gazers in the Government who are mesmerised by the prospects of Alcoa of Australia Ltd and others of its ilk supposedly mushrooming throughout the land will shed few tears for the misfortunes of Franklins and even less for the hardship about to befall the workers of Franklin caravans and their anxious wives and families. The closing of this fac­ tory, once one of the leading manufacturers of caravans in this country, is a tragic blow to the many skilled and semi-skilled workers who have served the firm so well for so long. They are the victims of this Government's policy of oil parity pricing. Like the blow from a blunt instrument, the Government's policy has forced the closure of the firm. I would have given the Government some credit had it shown concrete signs of concern for industries in rural and provincial Australia. But there are really no grounds for praise, Mr Deputy Speaker. As you would know, sir, since the Lib­ eral Party issued in 1 974 its lofty policy on decen­ tralisation, the story has since been one of miser­ able neglect. I quote from page 52 of the Liberal Party platform policy paper of 1 974. Mr John Brown You wouldn't believe it, .. would you?",80
121,Mr MILDREN,ADJOURNMENT,"J will read from this paper for the honourable member as it is late in the night and I suppose it is time for bedtime stories. The paper states: The well-being of every individual and of the community is directly influenced by the quality of the environment. A better environment can be achieved by a properly organised pro­ gramme of urban improvement and regional development in accordance with the following principles1 . Recognition of the necessity to bring about a better bal­ ance of population throughout Australia and within each State through vigorous encouragement of decen­ tralisation of industry and administration by financial incentives and other means. 2. Urban and regional development is a task of national importance requiring full co-operation between Com­ monwealth, State and local governments to achieve communities which have a good living environment and are economically efficient. The paper further states as one of the goals: (b) regional development through the creation and expan­ sion of viable decentralised centres of population. So the paper goes on. What does it really mean in substantive support for rural and provincial Australia? In 1 975-76, decentralisation assistance was $7 1 .8m or $62.2m deflated by the implicit gross national deflator at 1 974-75 prices. This figure included money allocated to growth centres. By 1 978-79, the aggregate figure for de­ centralisation and growth centres was $35.3m.",80

123,Mr BAUME ,ADJOURNMENT,"Macarthur) ( 10.49)-Tonight I thank the honourable member for Cunningham ( Mr West) for pointing out in his usual calm, quiet, polite way that I had mentioned in a release printed in the Illawarra Mercury that the New South Wales Government could not run a lava­ tory, let alone a health service. There are many swimmers in the State of New South Wales, par­ ticularly off Sydney beaches, who would attest to that as a result of having swum in the polluted waters of the ocean resulting from the incom­ petence and inability of the New South Wales Government even to run an effective lavatory sys­ tem in that State. Mr West-I like your choice of language. That is the sort of language Government members use.",80
124,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,ADJOURNMENT,Mr MilIar)­ Order! The honourable member for Cunningham will remain silent and conceal his reading material.,81
125,Mr BAUME,ADJOURNMENT,"The honourable member for Cunningham has already spoken at length. It would have been courteous of him to have given me the right of response. I do not seek to mislead the people of Illawarra the way the honourable member did tonight. He denied a simple fact which I presented-that this year there was no cut whatsoever in community health funding. On the contrary, there was a 21 per cent increase in federal funding for community health services in New South Wales. Mr West-Compare it with the figures over the last five years, you fool.",81
126,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order ! The honourable member for Cunningham will withdraw.,81
127,Mr BAUME,ADJOURNMENT,"He is a lout. Mr West-In deference to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I withdraw but I suggest that he moder­ ate his language.",81
128,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The ·honourable member will resume his seat and ob­ serve decorum or the Chair will be required to deal with him. Before proceeding the honourable member for Macarthur will withdraw the reflec­ tion on the honourable member for Cunningham.,81
129,Mr BAUME,ADJOURNMENT,"I withdraw the reflection on the honourable member for Cunningham. The delib­ erate obstruction that is going on at the moment, in trying to prevent me from making this very strong point, is particularly offensive to me. 1 stress that there has been no cut this year in com­ munity health funding. The honourable member for Cunningham claimed that federal cuts in funding were responsible for reductions in service this year. That allegation is clearly untrue and graceful. The cuts this year that the honourable member alleges just do not exist. There has been a 2 1 per cent increase. According to the New South Wales Government, which is of the same political persuasion as the honourable member for Cun­ ningham, the funding was sufficient at least to maintain the community health service in New South Wales this year. That is what that Govern­ ment said when the Commonwealth granted a 2 1 per cent increase, but now the honourable member, by some magnificent intellectual ca­ pacity which he displays with such regularity to this House, says that because total funding this year is lower than it was in 1 976 the sackings in the Illawarra health region are directly the re­ sponsibility of the Federal Government. That is arrant nonsense and he knows it because there has been a 2 1 per cent increase in funding. The simple fact is that the New South Wales Health Commission has overspent that increase in regions other than the Illawarra region. Overspending has not occurred in the Illawarra region. Because it is the whipping boy of the State Government it has to carry the overspending in the rest of New South Wales. It always comes last in health spending under the Labor Government of New South Wales. It has to carry the can for overspending in the rest of the State. For the honourable member for Cunningham to pretend that there has been a dark, mischievous plot in the Federal Government's making an alleged cut is arrant nonsense and deception. The honourable member is deliberately seeking to deceive the people of Illawarra about the fact that the New South Wales Government has proved itself in­ competent to handle a 21 per cent rise in funding this year for community health service. That kind of incompetence and deception are typical of the Labor Party, and certainly of the honourable member.",81
130,Mrs CHILD ,ADJOURNMENT,"Henty) ( 10.54) -1 would like to speak to the House tonight about two young men called Robert and Bill. Robert lost a leg when he was 14 years old. Since then he has had an artificial leg which he finds very difficult to wear because it gives him a very bad back, as do crutches also. After he lost his leg he could not settle back in school so, quite unqualified at 1 5 years, he took a job. The only one he could get was driving a fork lift machine, but when there was not enough work for the machine he had to go down into the store room and help out there. He could not cope with the lifting involved so he had to leave that position. As he could not get another job he applied for the dole. He got a job with a tow truck company. This involved long hours, dis­ poor pay and offered no overtime for weekend work. He stayed asJong as he could put up with it but then had to leave and go back on the dole again. He was on the dole for two years but not once during that time was a job offered to him by the Commonwealth Employment Service. His mother's mother took ill in Queanbeyan. The son drove her up to visit and then went back again. On the day he was away from home a field officer called to see him. The husband rang and explained where he was, what he was doing and when he would be home but Robert was taken off the dole. It took a hell of a long fight to get him back on it again. He was taken off the dole be­ cause he was out of Victoria for whatever reason or however briefly. It took six weeks to get Robert back on the dole. Three years ago he applied for an invalid pension. He was knocked back. He has not worked now for over I 2 months. In the last seven years of misery and pain he has worked for about 1 2 months. Every time he applied for a job he was told that they needed someone who was not handicapped. Robert is not handicapped; he is disabled by the loss of his leg. His handicap is given to him by us-by the society in which he lives. We applied for the pension for him again but he was knocked back again. As his mother points out: 'Because he has lost a leg he does not count as a human being any more'. She also said that Robert had reached the stage where he goes down with his dole form and feels as though he is a criminal. Robert is 2 1 . He probably has another 50-odd years in front of him. Is he supposed to live on the dole forever or are we prepared to train Robert and all the Roberts of this world in the work with which they can cope bearing in mind their disabilities? It makes a mockery of the words in the second read­ ing speech earlier tonight by the Minister for Em­ ployment and Youth Affairs ( Mr Viner). The Minister brought out the fact that everyone no matter how disabled he is-physically or mentally-is entitled to a decent standard of liv­ ing, to social security and to the right to live and not just to exist. Robert and all the other Roberts will be interested to hear the Minister's plans for their rights to become as self-reliant as possible. His plans are for them to have economic and social security and to have a chance for a decent level of living because they are certainly not get­ ting these things in today's climate. It is not enough for the Minister to prate about human rights. A government is supposed to do something concrete to help Robert. I shall leave Robert for the moment. Let us have a look at the position of Bill who is 26. He has a long history of mental instability but in be­ tween being institutionalised has fought very hard to work. He is an intelligent man and has held sev­ eral responsible jobs. However, when the stress becomes heavy he loses his job, goes back on the dole and goes back into hospital. Some time ago he tried to commit suicide but simply succeeded in causing himself dreadful damage. It will be years before he is physically fit. Because he was on the dole at the time he gets the sickness benefit only at the rate of unemployment benefit. He needs com­ plete care. He has to be lifted out of bed. He has to be taken to the physiotherapist twice a week. He needs a bedroom, which he has not got. His pen­ sioner mother has a small one-bedroom cottage. Why cannot he go on to the invalid pension at least until he is fit? Why do we have to so humili­ ate and harass those who are least able to bear the burdens? What about Bill's future? What about his human rights? I challenge this Government to take up the responsibility of ensuring that those who are disabled have the right to live and not just to exist; make the Minister's words of today come true. The Government should give them the right to economic security and a decent standard of liv­ ing. This Government is known for its great and humane rhetoric and is condemned for its failure to follow through with action.",81
131,Mr BAUME ,ADJOURNMENT,"Macarthur) (1 0.59) In the minute remaining in this adjournment debate I would like to underline the points I made in my speech earlier this evening by quoting from the Budget figures which dramatise the increase in spending on community health services this year. The table on page 90 of the Budget Speech sets out that the allocation for community health ser­ vices this year is up $ 1 2. 1 m from $55.3m to $67.5m which is a rise of 22 per cent for Australia. For New South Wales there is an increase from $20Am to $24.9m, a rise of $4.5m on a matching grant basis which represents a 2 1 per cent in­ crease. The new total of $24.9m, as I said earlier, was regarded by the New South Wales Govern­ ment as sufficient at least to maintain the standard last year for community health services in that State. Any cuts in services that have taken place subsequently are entirely due to the inability of the New South Wales Government to keep within its 2 1 per cent higher budget.",82
