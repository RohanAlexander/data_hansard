In particular, for the Prime Minister's claim that the great big new tax on mining has not impacted the financial markets and that his taxpayer funded ad campaign is a counter measure to mining industry misinformation when: (1) a secret Cabinet letter from the Treasurer dated almost three weeks ago and released overnight reveals that “the government's tax reforms…impact on financial markets, particularly the financial returns of mining comGillard, J.E. panies, in a number of ways”; and (2) the fact that the Prime Minister's decision to spend 38 million dollars on a taxpayer funded ad campaign was signed off by his own Strategic Priorities and Budget Committee on 20 April, well before the Henry Review was released and weeks before the mining industry rolled out their first as.” We are now on day 5 of",17

13,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer him to correspondence released last night between the Treasurer and the Special Minister of State which shows that the Prime Minister and his senior ministers were planning an advertising ambush of the resources sector well before the announcement of its great big new tax on mining. I ask: how can the government claim last Friday that we are in a national emergency when its $38 million advertising campaign has been planned for months? How can the Prime Minister assert that the tax has not impacted on the finance markets when the Treasurer says that it has? And how can he assert that he was truthful in the parliament last week when he has been contradicted by his own ministers?,20
14,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Coming from the Leader of the Opposition, who was one of the greatest users and abusers of public advertising in his period in government, I find this set of questions remarkable. There was the use and abuse of the Work Choices campaign, not to mention rock-solid, ironclad guarantees concerning Medicare. The honourable Leader of the Opposition asked a question about remarks made in this place yesterday. Firstly, I was very clear about the fact, in response to a question from the member for Farrer, that the government, from the early part of this year, had been intending to conduct a public information campaign in support of the changes to the proposed tax system. Secondly, I further indicated that the government also then used the guidelines which enabled that campaign to be brought forward, given the campaign of disinformation which has been mounted by the mining industry, not entirely unassisted by the Leader of the Opposition himself. This campaign is necessary for the following reasons: (1) the government will not stand idly by while the mining industry runs the opposition's line of attack in this parliament (2) the government will not stand idly by while misinformation is placed in the Australian community by elements of the mining industry who simply do not want to pay more tax and (3) this government will act in the national interest in order to make sure that it can deliver better super, tax cuts for all companies and tax cuts also for Australian small business. The government stands by its actions-every single one of them. Middle East",20
15,Ms VAMVAKINOU,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Will the minister advise the House of the Australian government's response to the incident yesterday between the Israeli navy and a flotilla of vessels attempting to make its way to Gaza?,21
16,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for her question, and I know that all members of the House will be both interested and concerned about this matter. This is a terrible and shocking incident, a terrible and shocking event, and I think many Australians will be shocked by it. I will deal firstly with the safety and welfare of Australian citizens and an Australian permanent resident who have been caught up in this matter. I deal firstly with the Sydney Morning Herald photographer and journalist, Kate Geraghty and Paul MCGeough. Kate Geraghty is an Australian citizen; Paul MCGeough is a permanent resident of Australia but is understood to be an Irish citizen and travelling on an Irish passport. I make that point, which I would not normally make public, because it is important as it goes to contra assistance and access. I indicate that both Ms Geraghty and Mr MCGeough are to be transferred from the city of Ashdod to the Beersheba detention centre. Australian officials have been advised that, in the case of Ms Geraghty, consular access will be granted in the course of today, Tel Aviv time. In the case of Mr MCGeough, Australian officials have been advised that Irish officials will be granted the same consular access. Australian officials have taken the opportunity, as you would expect, of underlining with Irish officials our very keen interest in the well-being of this Australian permanent resident, who would be, as he is to me, well known to many members of the House. So we expect that in the case of Ms Geraghty, so far as Australian officials are concerned, and the case of Mr MCGeough, so far as Irish officials are concerned, consular access will be given in the course of the day, Tel Aviv time. In the meantime, I am advised that the welfare of Ms Geraghty and Mr MCGeough has been confirmed. I made public this morning that there is an Australian citizen, an Australian man, who has been injured through a gunshot wound to the leg. He has undergone surgery and is currently in hospital. He has been visited by Australian officials in hospital, and Australian officials will continue to provide consular assistance to him. I can advise the House that two Australian women, who were also on board one of the flotilla vessels, are being detained at the Beersheba detention centre. As is the case with detained Australian nationals, Australian officials will be granted consular access to these two women in the course of today, Tel Aviv time. I indicate to the House that Australian officials are working assiduously with Israeli officials in Canberra, Tel Aviv and New York-working assiduously not just on the matter generally but also to seek to ascertain whether there are any other Australians who have been caught up in this incident. I can advise the House that to date Australian officials have received no information or evidence which would suggest that any other Australians have been killed or injured in this terrible matter. Our officials continue to work very closely with Israeli officials in that respect. That deals with consular matters. Can I make some remarks in the House so far as this terrible and shocking event is concerned. The Australian government very strongly believes that the onus is now on Israel to conduct a credible and transparent investigation into this matter. That investigation should of course be subject to the scrutiny of the international community. The Security Council, as we speak, is dealing with this matter and may well later in the night, New York time, issue a statement in respect of these matters. What is required is a transparent and credible investigation by Israel which will be the subject of, obviously, the international community's scrutiny and which, in Australia's view, should appropriately be the subject of Security Council consideration. The Australian government's policy position on the blockade of aid or humanitarian assistance to Gaza is well known. We believe there should be an easing of the blockade to enable aid and humanitarian assistance to be delivered to Gaza. We have made that point both to Israel and also in the most recent open session of the Security Council on this matter in October of last year. Australian officials will continue to work closely with Israeli officials on consular matters. We will of course continue to put our view to Israel at officials level in Canberra, Tel Aviv and New York. We await the deliberations of the Security Council. While it may well be the case that an easing of the blockade would help prevent such terrible events occurring in the future, all members of the House would have the view that the only long-term, enduring solution to such matters is a long-term, enduring peace in the Middle-East. Such a peace can only be based, can only be predicated, on a two-state solution. That is why not just this Australian government but Australian governments of both political persuasions consistently have been very strong supporters of the peace process and very strong supporters of a two-state solution, and the Australia government urges all of the parties to engage as quickly as possible in the proposed proximity talks.",21
17,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I call the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, on a brief indulgence.",22
18,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The coalition is deeply concerned by the reports of the events that occurred off the coast of Israel, and particularly by the reports of a number of deaths. We are greatly concerned about the welfare of an Australian man who was injured in this conflict, and we are relieved to learn that the two Australian media representatives are apparently unharmed. There have been many claims and counterclaims in relation to this event, and it is essential that the facts be established. We believe it is in the interests of all sides that there be restraint to enable the facts to be fully investigated. Budget",22
19,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to his letter of 10 May to the Special Minister of State, where he advised: Since the government's tax reforms involve changes to the value of some capital assets, they impact on financial markets. Treasurer, will you now detail, in full view of the Australian people, all the data and numI think bers that underpin that statement?",22
20,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I certainly thank the shadow Treasurer for that question. When big changes are made to the tax system, there is always a need for a public information campaign. We have in place some very big changes to the Australian taxation systemnot just the modernisation of our taxation of minerals but also cuts to the company tax rate, accelerated cuts to the company tax rate for small businesses and changes to the treatment of interest income, with a 50 per cent tax discount and a standard deduction. There are a whole set of very complex changes which are a very big economic reform for Australia, and the only responsible thing to do in preparing for that change is in fact to put in place a public information campaign. Of course, we funded this public information campaign in the budget. I do not recall anyone from the opposition, either at budget time and/or subsequently in estimates, being remotely concerned about the fact that there was going to be a public information campaign, because it is entirely legitimate to have a public information campaign in these circumstances. And it is entirely legitimate do it without legislation, because those opposite know they have done that as well-they have put in place public information campaigns when big and complex changes have been in prospect. The government, as the Prime Minister said before, was contemplating a public information campaign from early this year, as we came to the decision to put in place these very big changes to our tax system. Now, of course, that brings us through to the period when we launched these proposals. I launched them in Parliament House with the Prime Minister and other ministers on 2 May and just prior to that we had the beginnings of the scare campaign, from the likes of Clive Palmer and all of the mates of those opposite, about the prospect of us having a superprofits tax in the mining industry. But even I was shocked by how brazen some of these people in the mining industry were, because after we launchedMr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order that does go to relevance. I asked the Treasurer to release all the information that underpinned his statement, not Clive Palmer's or anyone else's, so his statement",22
21,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for North Sydney has made his point of order. The Treasurer will relate his material to the question.,23
22,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government announced these tax changes on 2 May. And what did we see happen through that week from 2 May? There was one miner that said his company was in trouble, said he was going to close his operations in Australia and then turned around the next day and bought a million shares. But that is not misconduct; that is nothing, given what is going on in the markets when it comes to those opposite. There was also a report that week from one to of our largest companies that said they were going to shelve projects worth billions of dollars, and they were forced the next morning to make a clarification at the stock exchange.  of order. The question was very specific. It quoted the Treasurer's own letter and then asked him for the basis upon which his claims were made, the data. It did not ask him anything to do with any of these",23
23,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Sturt will resume his seat. Ms Hall interjecting,23
24,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Shortland can do her job and I will try to do my job. On the point of order, the Treasurer knows his responsibility to relate his remarks to the question.",23
25,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Also during this week the mining council went to press with paid advertising-once again misleading paid advertising. So there are three examples which have the potential to impact on the market. But this is all irrelevant to those opposite because they are in bed with some mining companies campaigning against this tax. They are nothing but a tool of the mining companies in this debate. It was events like those that had me write to Senator Ludwig asking to bring the information campaign forward, and in those circumstances that was entirely legitimate. Interest Rates",23
26,Mr BEVIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. What has been the outcome of today's meeting of the Reserve Bank of Australia board?,24
27,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Brisbane for his question. Today's Reserve Bank board meeting left the official cash rate unchanged at 4.5 per cent. This news will be welcome relief for many Australian families and businesses around the country who are of course doing it tough. Today's decision means a family with a $300,000 mortgage is still paying around $450 less a month than they were prior to the onset of the global financial crisis. That is around $5,400 less a year. When interest rates rise certainly everybody on this side of the House understands the impacts that that has on families, on businesses and on budgets. That is why our budget is so firmly focused on responsible economic management, bringing the budget back into surplus three years early. That is why we are concentrating so much on building the economic capacity in our economy. That is why we are focusing so much on investing in infrastructure, investing in skills and making sure that our economy is that much more competitive. That is why we are modernising our tax system to make our economy more competitive, to make our economy one in which we build our economic capacity so we can take the pressure off inflation-so we can have sustainable growth with lower inflation. That is the whole point of the budget that we have brought down. That is the whole point of this government from the very beginning: investing in capacity. That is why our modernisation of the tax system is so important. We have got to continue with that reform. This is something that those opposite simply do not understand, because we all recall their failure to heed the warnings from the Reserve Bank about all of the capacity constraints in the economy. They still do not understand the importance of economic reform to building capacity and to making growth sustainable. They simply do not understand why we must move forward to make our economy much more competitive. Tomorrow we do have the national accounts, and I have every confidence that with the right policies in place our economy can continue to be one of the best in the world over coming years. But to continue to do that we have to keep this momentum for reform; we certainly need to do that. I can see the disappointment on the faces of those opposite that rates did not go up today. They certainly would never admit that the official interest rate is still 2.25 percentage points lower today than when the Liberals were last in office. But, from our perspective on this side of the House, we will do everything to reform our economy to build economic capacity and to keep the pressure off inflation so we can grow sustainably. Budget",24
28,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to the $38 million advertising campaign on the current mining tax policy. Given that the government is, in its own words, ‘consulting on the tax', will the government, when it changes the tax, feel the need to declare a further national emergency to spend more money to buy more as to correct its current as? Prime Minister, when will this reckless spending stop?",24
29,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for North Sydney for his question, because I notice that those opposite are quite happy to ride on the coat-tails of a campaign, of up to $100 million based on reports, from the mining industry representing companies who do not want to pay another dollar's worth of tax to the Australian people. Second point: these resources are owned by the Australian people and the Australian people deserve their fair share. Furthermore, if you look at the overall take of tax through royalties over the last years, it has gone from $1 in $3 in profits $1 in $7 in profits. The Australian people demanding a fair share. We make no apology whatsoever for engaging in a public ing campaign to establish the facts of the government's new proposed RSPT and the reforms which it is capable of bringing about-namely, better super for working families, which they would cut; company tax cuts, which they would raise; and tax breaks for small business, which they would rip away. That is the government's reform plan. We intend to get on with the business of putting out the facts to the Australian community. Economy",24
30,Mr SYMON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister explain the importance of responsible economic management to secure economic growth and prosperity for all Australians?,25
31,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I draw the attention of the House to the decision by Fitch Ratings agency on Friday which downgraded Spain's credit grading to AA plus, triggering renewed global concerns about sovereign debt. This is a matter of concern to financial markets and governments around the world. There were also sharp falls on global stock markets over the course of the last month. The US market was down by nearly 10 per cent and the Dow Jones Industrial had its worse performance for the month of May in 60 years. This underlines the fragility of the global economic recovery. The IMF is forecasting that in fact we will have a fragile and protracted recovery for the global economy and, therefore, the world is by no means out of the woods yet. The IMF expects the global economy will grow by 3.9 per cent in 2010. On current IMF projections, real potential output for the global economy is not expected to return to precrisis levels until 2014. 10 This puts in absolute stark contrast the imto portance of responsible economic manageare ment. This puts into absolute relief the responsible economic management policies of advertis- the Australian government. During the global financial crisis, 31 of the 33 IMF advanced economies went into recession; Australia did not. Eight of Australia's top 10 trading partners went into recession; Australia did not. Australia is the only one of the major advanced economies not to go into recession. Australia, as a result, has had the fastest growth, the lowest debt, the lowest deficit and the second lowest unemployment of all the major advanced economies. Without stimulus the Australian economy would have shrunk 0.7 per cent in 2009 and we would have had 200,000 more Australians out of work. Had we followed the Leader of the Opposition's prescription for responsible economic management and gone down the New Zealand road, we would have had hundreds of thousands of Australians out of work on top of those who had lost their jobs already. When the national accounts are revealed tomorrow, Wednesday, our fiscal position will be underlined again as being the envy of the developed world, given the fact that so much of the rest of the world has barely begun the trajectory to economic recovery. The success of our strategy is reflected in the point made just before by the Treasurerthat is, through prudent financial management the government will return the budget to surplus in three years time, three years ahead of time, and will also have net peak debt. This is a critical achievement given the concerns about sovereign debt levels around the world and across OECD economies. This is not the time to follow the prescripbott's tion of those opposite to pull the rug from under economic recovery by the abolition of stimulus. That would be absolutely the wrong call now and it is the call made by the Leader of the Opposition, who says repeatedly he has no interest in economics and who the former Treasurer said he would never have as the Treasurer of the Commonwealth. But go to the specifics of the cuts proposed by those opposite and it becomes even more concerning. It would be the wrong time, for example, to be slashing training programscuts that will deny training to nearly 400,000 Australians. It is the wrong time to be denying tax cuts to 2.4 million Australian small businesses, the wrong time to be jacking up the company tax rate as opposed to bringing the company tax rate down and the wrong time to be cutting and slashing trade training centres across Australia. These centres are necessary in order to build up the skilled workforce of the future. These are fundamental reforms for the future, all aimed at underpinning the skills needs of our economy for the future. The alternative approach by them is to abolish stimulus and to slash and burn-cuts in schools, cuts in training, cuts in computers, cuts in trade training centres, cuts in health, on top of the billion dollar gouge out of health he took last time. On the question of reform and keeping the economy strong, we have had a debate today and yesterday about tax reform. In fact, those opposite have abandoned the real debate. They have now gone onto a debate purely about advertising. Can I say one of the reasons they have abandoned the debate on tax reform is the Leader of the Opposition does not even understand what tax is being debated. Today the Leader of the Opposition was asked a very simple question. Journalist: ‘If I point to that prodsponse uct over there, can you explain to me how that tax would interact with it and how?' Abanswer: ‘Well, the tax falls on everything which is extracted.' That is not right, Leader of the Opposition. But it goes on. Opposition members-Why not?",25
32,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Why not? Come in spinner. Journalist: ‘But can you explain the detail of how like if I point to that product over there, can you explain to me how that tax would interact with it?' Abbott replied: ‘Well, well, the tax falls on everything which is extracted from the ground.' That is the point, Leader of the Opposition. This is not an extraction tax. It is not a production tax. It is a tax on profits. On the first principle of tax reform, he does not get it. He says it is a royalty tax based on extraction as opposed to a tax on profit. The Leader of the Opposition, we know from the former Treasurer, Peter Costello, does not actually think economics is interesting. We know from the former Treasurer that he would never have appointed him as Treasurer of Australia, but not to even understand that the RSPT is a tax on profits and not on volume and extraction and production fails Economics 101. Government Advertising",26
33,Ms LEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the Treasurer's letter dated 10 May about the government's advertising campaign decision made on 20 April asking for it to be exempted from the usual guidelines. Between 20 April and 10 May, were the government's mining as referred to the government's Independent Communications Committee? If not, why not? Prime Minister, if the as were referred, why were they rejected and, if they were not rejected, why was an exemption necessary?",26
34,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question. As I said in reto one of her questions yesterday, the government in the early part of last year decided internally we would be embarking upon an advertising campaign to support fundamental tax reform. Secondly, on the question of expediting that campaign, we took that decision on the basis of the information which was contained in the correspondence between the Treasurer and the Special Minister of State. In terms of the internal deliberations of the committee in relation to this matter, I cannot enlighten the minister in response to her question. I can say to her, though, that when the previous government was looking at a $256 million advertising campaign of order.

I will listen carefully to where he is headed now.",27

41,Ms RISHWORTH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. Why is it important to counter misrepresentations regarding the government's tax reform package?,27
42,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Kingston for her question. It is very important to counter misrepresentations regarding the government's tax reform package, and there are an awful lot of misrepresentations going around, both from the opposition and from sections of the mining industry. I mentioned a couple yesterday and I have a few more to mention today. The Minerals Council have had as on radio recently, and they feature a self-funded retiree saying that the government's tax plan: … may be good for paying off the Government's debt, but it's not good for me. Well, there is one problem with this assertion, one big problem: the proceeds from the resource super profits tax are being dedicated to cut company tax, to cut taxes on small business, to cut taxes on superannuation, to invest in infrastructure and to ensure that people who have deductions of up to $1,000 previous do not have to put tax returns in. If you want some evidence of this, I have a very reliable source to support the government's assertion, and that is in fact the opposition. When the opposition announced its purported savings package a week or two ago it put out a table headed ‘Coalition savings'. This is a double-sided table, and it has a list of savings that are specified as being linked to the RSPT. Guess what they are: Early start to company tax rate cut for small business Lowering the company tax rate Small business instant asset write-off … Resource exploration refundable tax offset State Infrastructure Fundet cetera. There is a total of the savings that are involved in not proceeding with these tax reform proposals, and guess what that adds up to. It adds up to almost $12 billion-the amount the resource super profits tax is proposed to raise over that time. So the opposition nail their own misrepresentation in their own savings announcement. The second example is a statement made by the head of the Minerals Council, Mr Mitch Hooke, last week, with respect to resources that are in the ground, minerals and resources that are owned by the Australian people. He said that they are ‘only dirt' when they are in the ground. I have to say, it is great to see the noble and ancient art of alchemy making a comeback-because, according to the head of the Minerals Council, the process of digging this ‘dirt' out of the ground magically transforms it into gold, or nickel or some other precious metal, but with a twist, because traditionally alchemy was about transforming base metals into gold but, according to the head of the Minerals Council, he can transform dirt into gold. That is some misrepresentation. Finally, we have the ever-present fifth shadow minister for finance in this parliamentary term, the member for Goldstein. On Sky News yesterday he claimed ‘there are people already losing jobs because of the RSPT'. He was then asked to provide examples. He said: Ah, yes, there is people, um, I can't cite them here but they've been told to me. What that does indicate is that there is a giant misrepresentation campaign going on here, both by sections of the mining industry and by the opposition. The government is concerned to ensure that there is a balanced debate about these very important tax reform proposals and there are constructive negotiations with the mining industry about the details of the proposals, because at the bottom of all this is a simple proposition: to ensure that the Australian community gets full value for its resources that are dug up and sold by the mining industry for prices that are way higher than they have traditionally been, and that that value can be transformed into value for Australian businesses that create jobs and generate wealth all around the country across all sectors. That is what this tax reform proposal is about. That is what the government is committed to doing. And that is what the opposition is committed to tearing down. Budget",27
43,Mr IAN MACFARLANE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"2.54 pm)My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the case of an industrial engraving business in my electorate of Groom, Lazertek Australia, which has secured significant supply contracts with a dozen resource and energy companies. Lazertek have advised me via this email that, since the news broke of the government's great big new tax on mining, the turnover from these contracts has fallen by 90 per cent. Will the Prime Minister apologise to Lazertek and all the other small businesses which have been hurt by this great big new tax on mining?",28
44,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can I say to the member for Groom that one of the reasons it is important to have facts in the debate about the RSPT is so that misinformation does not create unnecessary uncertainty in the Australian economy. The Minister for Finance and Deregulation has just gone through one example after another of how the existing campaign by the MCA fundamentally misleads in so many aspects of this tax debate-the reason, therefore, why the government has brought forward an advertising campaign on this question to settle the facts in the minds of the Australian public. Those opposite trade constantly in fear, they trade constantly in misrepresentationnot just in relation to an RSPT; they have done it in practically every other area of public policy as well. That is because the Leader of the Opposition has no positive plan of his own, only fear and loathing in relation to anything positive that we plan or propose for the future. One after another, whether it is a proposal in relation to the economy, whether it is a proposal in relation to how we invest in skills or infrastructure, whether it is posal for climate change or whether it is a proposal in relation to an RSPT, what the Leader of the Opposition does is say: ‘(1) I have no policy; (2) you should be very frightened of that policy.' That is his standard stock in trade. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: he needs to get real with the Australian public and level with them about his own actual policies. Mr Ian Macfarlane- Mr Speaker, I seek leave to table this email from David Williams of Lazertek Australia so the Prime Minister can ring him and explain to him why he is wrecking his business. Leave not granted. Work and Family",28
45,Mr CHAMPION,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. How is the government providing support to Australian families?",29
46,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I very much thank the member for Wakefield for his question because, as he knows, the government values the hard work of all parents, whether they are in the paid workforce or whether they are at home. What we do on this side of the House is support families to make their own work and family choices. That is why the government supports families through the baby bonus and family tax benefits parts A and Bill, and that is why, from 1 January next year, we will be delivering Australia's first paid parental leave scheme. This will give mums and dads extra support so that they can spend more time at home with their newborn babies. Our scheme is fair to families and fair to businesses. The Business Council of Australia, the Australian Industry Group and individual employers have all welcomed our scheme. Employers are now embracing the a proopportunity to work with the government to make sure we give parents more work and family choices. Just today we have seen Westpac and their new collective agreement offering 13 weeks of paid parental leave. This makes Westpac a paid parental leave pacesetter in the financial sector. Westpac, like many other companies, clearly recognises the value of being an employer of choice and the value of family friendly working conditions for attracting and retaining their staff. I know the Deputy Prime Minister, as the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, has a very keen interest in this agreement. Westpac is providing employees with the flexibility to decide on the work and family conditions that suit them and their families. The important thing is that Westpac's scheme will be in addition to the government's paid parental leave scheme. This means that Westpac employees will be entitled to up to 31 weeks of paid parental leave. Instead of supporting and encouraging companies like Westpac, this Leader of the Opposition, of course, is not supporting those companies; what he wants to do is impose a great big new tax on all of these busition. nesses. We know that for 12 years when he was in government, this Leader of the Opposition opposed paid parental leave. All of us know that this Leader of the Opposition in fact famously said that paid parental leave would be introduced over his dead body. Now of course, after a staggering back flip, he has come up with a sham scheme that will impose this great big new tax and see prices go up both for families and for pensioners. ever it was the case that his scheme was introduced, we would see very substantial amounts of money going to high-income earners. High-income families-high-income parents-would be getting around $75,000 under the scheme of this Leader of the Opposition. Mr Tuckey interjecting",29
47,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I hear the member for O'Connor up the back there. He has tried to sum it up this way today. The member for O'Connor said: ‘Well, look, brighter people have brighter children. I mean, and, um, you know, I make the sporting analogy: faster racehorses get faster racehorses.' Well, according to the member for O'Connor, their great contribution to family policy in Austraof lia-the great contribution from the member for O'Connor-is to compare mothers to horses. Thank you so much! What a bunch of absolute dinosaurs opposite. Australian families have been waiting decades for paid parental leave, and this government will deliver or two: it to them. Budget",30
48,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister and I refer to this email from Mr Max Mawhinney, who is a beef producer in New South Wales. He states: Now we have the Rudd resource tax, which will make Ag-lime extremely expensive and significantly reduce the use of this product, in turn reducing the ability of farmers to apply sound management practices to enhance carbon sequestraIndirectly, it will impact on the cost of food. Will the Prime Minister apologise to farmers, who will find environmental best practice more difficult to achieve and force up the price of food to consumers as a result of his great big new tax on mining?",30
49,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the National Party for his question and I go back to my answer to the previous question which If was asked. My answer was that those opposite engage in one thing and one thing alone when it comes to tax reform, and that is a fear campaign. It is a fear campaign in the absence of any form of fact. The Leader of the National Party, if he bothered to read the government's report, through the Treasury, on the economic modelling for the introduction of the RSPT, would know, from its conclusions, the impact on consumer prices. He would know the impact on employment; he would know the impact on overall economic growth; he would know the impact on the expansion of activity within the mining industry and also on the expansion of investment in the mining industry. But as he has raised the general question resource rent tax can I also, for the benefit of the House, refer to an article which has recently been published in the editorial of the Financial Times of London-a leading leftwing journal! It is coloured pink; be very suspicious! It says this in the first paragraph Miners, like oil men, are a tough lot. They are fighting tooth and nail to derail the Australian government's plan for a “super profit tax”. But just as oil and gas companies survived when a similar tax was imposed on them, the mining industry has broad enough shoulders to bear the new burden. It goes on to say: It will be a long-overdue update of the medieval practice of levying royalties Being regressive, royalties squeeze marginal producers while letting those with the most abundant mines keep the largest share of their loot. Furthermore, the article goes on to say, in response to an observation by Rio: The charge that it turns Australia into the “number one sovereign risk issue”, made by Tom Albanese, chief executive of Rio Tinto, is absurd. So says the editorial of the Financial Times yesterday. The Financial Times, I would suggest, is not necessarily a subunit of the Australian Labor Party! It is not a branch of the Australian government; it is the premier financial journal in the world. Its editorial recognises that a resource rent tax is the most effective way of taxing profit rather than volume, profit rather than production. But then again the Leader of the Opposition does not understand what this tax is about in the first place, because in answer to a question this morning-a very simple and basic question to the Leader of the Opposition, ‘Tony, how does this tax actually apply to this product?' he could not answer. He could not answer in one sentence, two sentences or three sentences. In fact he said it was just like a royalties tax. The Leader of the Opposition does not know the first thing about tax policy, nor the first thing about economic policy. The one thing he does know about tax policy is how to jack up the tax rate by bringing in a great big new tax across all Australian businesses that have an over-$5 million turnover-a thought bubble he had one morning without consultation with anyone in his joint party room. This government has the plan for reform; those opposite have a fear campaignone and all. Mr Truss-I seek leave to table the email from Max Mawhinney, which is about food on gross production. prices andLeave not granted. Productivity",30
50,Mr RIPOLL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion. Will the Deputy Prime Minister advise the House of the importance of ensuring fairness in the workplace in securing productivity? Are there any risks to this enhanced productivity?",31
51,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Oxley for his question; I know that he is passionate about ensuring that people in his electorate have decent working conditions and fairness at work. Of course on this side of the House we are always very happy to talk about respecting fairness in people's workplaces, and we are always very happy, too, to point out the alternative: a return to Work Choices, under the Leader of the Opposition-Work Choices mark 2. One of the reasons that we introduced the Fair Work Act was to put focus on productivity growth because of the stalling in productivity growth under the Howard government. If we look at the Intergenerational report about Australia to 2050, we see it confirms that productivity growth was averaging 1.4 per cent during the decade to 2010, after reaching 2.1 per cent in the 1990s. Lifting this productivity rate is a key objective of the Fair Work Act. It needs to be taken into account in every decision taken by Fair Work Australia. With a focus on collective agreement making, that focus is of course about productivity enhancing enterprise agreements, and research has shown that collective bargaining is good for productivity growth. We have also reduced a massive regulatory burden on workplaces through the simplification of awards. We have reduced almost 4,000 federal and state awards to 122 modern, simple awards-that is, 197,000 pages of regulation reduced to 5,753 pages, a massive reduction of 95 per cent in the red tape and regular burden. Access Economics has modelled that the benefit of this to our economy and the benefit of moving to a uniform system of workplace relations for the private sector, as livered by the fair work system, is $4.83 billion over 10 years. That story has a positive impact on economic growth and employment. Access Economics estimates the reform will boost national output by 0.05 per cent and increase employment by some 5,000 jobs at the peak of its beneficial impact in 2011-12. I am asked, too, about threats to the fair work system and its ability to enhance productivity. We know that the Leader of the Opposition is a Work Choices supporter and is absolutely unrepentant about it. On 19 March 2008, the Leader of the Opposition said Work Choices was ‘good for wages, good for jobs and good for workers, and let's never forget that'. Those are the words of the Leader of the Opposition. So maybe the Leader of the Opposition might like to explain this: how is it that when 63 per cent of Australian workplace agreements cut penalty rates that was good for workers? How is it that when 52 per cent of AWAs cut shift loading that was good for workers? How is it that when AWAs-51 per cent of them-cut overtime loadings that was good for workers? How is it that when 48 per cent of AWAs cut public holiday pay that was good for workers? The view of the Leader of the Opposition-pay cuts, loss of basic conditions, penalty rates, shift loading, overtime and public holiday pay-is somehow that all of that was good for workers. Mr Speaker, you might believe that it is a little bit mysterious how the Leader of the Opposition could ever have come to such an irrational view. But I have a theory. My theory is that the Leader of the Opposition was actually indoctrinated by the $121 million of advertising that the Howard government and the Leader of the Opposition engaged in in relation to Work Choices advertising. This was a 24/7 campaign. The Leader of the Opde- position would get up in the morning, make a cup of coffee, walk over to the fridge to get the milk out and there would be a Work Choices fridge magnet. He would get himself ready for work, he would get into the office and the first thing he would do when he was in the office was pick up his Work Choices pen. And then when he was starting to work on Battlelines, having his first preliminary thoughts, they were not very big thoughts so he could have got out his Work Choices pad and written them down. And then, as he was more ready to bring out Battlelines, he would have been working away on the computer looking at his mouse pad every day-24/7 indoctrination has obviously got to the Leader of the Opposition. Fortunately, my department apparently rejected his request for Work Choices budgiesmugglers because the thought was too hideous to contemplate. But I have a standing offer to the Leader of the Opposition and I am waiting for his response. I still have five pallets of Work Choices propaganda. I have done my best. They have gone to Ethiopia. They have gone to East Timor. They have gone around the world. I have done my best to get rid of them, but I have five pallets of Work Choices propaganda. I have 34,000 individual items-Work Choices pens, mousepads and all the rest of it-ready to go. I am asking the Leader of the Opposition, so I do not have to table 34,000 items at some point, whether he can take these items off my hands. They will be very good for his next campaign, because we know that his slogan is going to be ‘Work Choices-good for workers'. Tony, you will really need these on the campaign trail.",31

53,Mr HAASE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his answer yesterday when, in defence of his great big new tax on mining, he said, ‘Whichever way you cut the cake the return to the Australian people via the taxation system is infinitely less than it was a decade ago.' How does the Prime Minister reconcile that statement with data compiled by Access Economics, the Treasury, the ATO and the ABS, which show that the total tax take from mining over the last decade has increased from $2.6 billion to $21.9 billion? Will the Prime Minister explain how he can describe tax revenues, which have increased by more than eight times, as ‘infinitely less'?",33
54,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank very much the member for Kalgoorlie, who has already made a very strong contribution to the tax reform debate for the mining industry, for his question. The bottom line is that only the Leader of the Opposition in this place says that the mining companies are paying too much tax-only the Leader of the Opposition. Ms Julie Bishop interjecting",33
55,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Ah, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, she of national security credentials, interjects and says that in fact there is someone else. But I thought that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said that they were paying just enough tax, whereas the shadow minister for infrastructure-good old Senator Barnaby Joyce-said that they could be paying more tax. The member for Kalgoorlie entered with the fourth position, which was that everyone in the opposition should be able to have their own tax policy. That was a great intervention on the doors the other day. Only the Leader of the Opposition says that the mining companies of Australia are paying too much tax. We know that the member for Kalgoorlie is out there trying to back him up. Budget The bottom line is that they can pay more tax. The government stands by the data that it has presented. I would suggest to those opposite that they engage in their own independent analysis as opposed to simply running out one piece of propaganda after another put out by the MCA. This government stands for tax reform to deliver better super for working families, better tax cuts for small business, reducing the company tax rate and better infrastructure for Australia's regions for the future. That is what we stand for; that is what you stand opposed to. Child Care",33
56,Mr SULLIVAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Early Childhood Education, Childcare and Youth and Minister for Sport, who I know is delighted with the Matildas. How is the government ensuring the stability of the childcare market for Australian families?",33
57,Ms KATE ELLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Adelaide-Minister for Early Childhood Education, Childcare and Youth and Minister for Sport) (3.16 pm)-I take this opportunity to thank the member for Longman for the question. I know that he recognises what a momentous week this has been for the Australian childcare sector. With some 570 childcare centres transferred from ABC Learning to GoodStart, this is a momentous occasion for Australian child care. In the member for Longman's electorate alone, this covers some 14 centres, which are providing care for some 900 children. We know that the families that are relying upon those services and those centres will be very relieved to know that there will be security and quality delivered through those centres going forward. We on this side of the House know that when ABC Learning collapsed in late 2008 it sent unprecedented shockwaves through the childcare market in Australia. At risk of closthat ing without a moment's notice were some 1,000 centres that were providing care for 62,000 families and that were employing thousands of dedicated staff. Mr Laming-What about the double drop-off? Mr Robert-What about the double dropoff?",33
58,Ms KATE ELLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I know that those opposite might not want to hear about how we cleaned up the mess that they helped create, but if they wanted to ask a question on child care we would be delighted to compare our record with theirs and delighted to point out how we have been delivering on affordability and quality. At the moment, we are talking about the collapse of ABC Learning after the market was left to rip under the previous government and what we on this side of the House have done to avert the most negative consequences of that. It has been quick action by this government and particularly by the Deputy Prime Minister and the member for Bennelong, who ensured that the worse potential consequences of this were averted. In fact, we now have a remarkable position, with some 90 per cent of these ABC Learning centres continuing to operate today after the threat of a sudden and immediate collapse. That is something that we should all be very grateful for. This week, 570 of these childcare centres have been transferred from ABC Learning to GoodStart, assisted by a $15 million loan from our government. This heralds a new way forward for the Australian childcare market, a way forward that is based on highquality, affordable and stable care. One thing that is very important for the stability of market going forward is the mix of private and not-for-profit providers. The transfer yesterday to GoodStart increases the share not-for-profit providers have from 22 per cent to some 34 per cent of the market. This announcement is very good news for parents, who can now go to work assured that their childcare centre has a new owner that is in it for the long haul. It is very good news for children, who know that the centre that they are attending has a key focus on quality and on making sure that they get the absolute best in early care. Importantly, it is also very good news for staff, because GoodStart has announced that the accrued entitlements of these workers will all be acknowledged, including their long service leave. While this is all a very positive and exciting step forward, we on this side of the House know that it is much better to prevent these collapses from ever taking place than it is to come along and pick up the pieces afterwards. That is why our government has put in place new measures to prevent a collapse like that of ABC Learning from ever taking place in our childcare market again. In this year's budget, we announced that all large childcare providers will have much more thorough financial viability checks before they are approved for government subsidies and will face ongoing checks going forward. Before being approved, all of these new childcare centre operators must demonstrate that they are suitable to operate a childcare centre. That includes providing information about their financial background and about whether they or any person involved in the managing of their organisation have been associated with an insolvency in the sector before. The government will also have new powers to commission an independent investigation or audit of any particular provider if we believe that there are any concerns about the their viability. We are determined to not allow another ABC style crisis to occur on our watch. We have worked very hard to restore stability to the Australian childcare market. The entry of GoodStart into it is very good news for Australian families and Australian children. Our government is very much looking forward to working with GoodStart to continue to deliver affordable and quality child care in this nation. Budget",34
59,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Prime Minister. This morning I visited a landscape supplier in Queanbeyan which provides road base, limestone, sand and granite to other businesses and currently employs 10 people. The workers there are concerned that the Prime Minister's great big new tax on mining and all extractive industries that make a profit will damage the business, increase its costs and force them to pass higher prices on to customers. Will he apologise to Mr Murray Flakelar and the staff of his business for making their lives so much more difficult?",35
60,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition again for his question on economics. It goes down to the economics of small business. I cannot comment on the individual circumstances of the firm he describes, but let me say this to the Leader of the Opposition about what has kept many Australian small businesses alive over the past 18 months. No. 1: we stimulated the Australian economy. No. 2: we kept more than 200,000 people in jobs who would otherwise have lost their jobs. No.3: we provided tax concessions for small business during the course of the global recession so that they could actually bring forward their capital acquisition in order to keep themselves afloat. The small business tax benefit which was delivered was a huge success for small businesses right across the country. I would be interested to know whether in fact the business in question made utilisation of that particular tax measure, which we used in the course of our response to the global financial crisis. The Leader of the Opposition is bored by these sorts of facts. These facts go to what kept hundreds of thousands of people in work, tens of thousands of small businesses with their doors open. Instead, what he proposes is to pull the rug from stimulus, notwithstanding the fact that the global economic recovery is tenuous, and thereby place at risk and at jeopardy the future of the Australian economy. His only response to the company in question is to send them a big warning bell: whatever you do, do not go from being a small business to a medium business which might have a turnover of some $5 million, because then you would be up for another two per cent tax if the business is incorporated. That is what the Leader of the Opposition stands for. What we stand for is bringing down the taxes on Australian business. What he stands for is jacking up the taxes on Australian business. We stand for increasing the super for the workers employed in that particular industry. He stands for ripping that super away from those workers. He stands also for reintroducing Work Choices. This government has withdrawn Work Choices. He stands for increasing the job insecurity of workers by ensuring that he repeals the government's current arrangements concerning unfair dismissal. He stands for job insecurity. He stands for cuts to jobs, cuts to education and cuts to health as well as the reintroduction of Work Choices, all of which would be of passing relevance to the workers in the firm which he just described.

90,The SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Cowper proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The adverse effect of the government's Resource Super Profits Tax on superannuants, self-funded retirees and senior Australians. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",40
91,Mr HARTSUYKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I welcome the opportunity to raise this matter of public importance as the Rudd government has deceived the Australian people about the adverse effect of their great big new tax on mining and the effect that this tax is having on superannuants, self-funded retirees and senior Australians. But all those Australians building and relying on superannuation are not being fooled by this fraudulent Prime Minister and this desperate, debtridden government. They know the impact of Labor's great new tax. They know the impact that that tax is having on their retirement savings-not in 10 years, but right here and right now. Yet we have a government in denial. While the rest of the country knows that the uncertainty this government is creating has jeopardised investments, jobs, future on the dividends and wealth creation, our Prime Minister has his head firmly stuck in the sand about what this great big new tax on mining is going to do to our nation. The Prime Minister told the House only on Thursday that the opposition was, in his words, ‘wrong, wrong, wrong' for suggesting that this mining tax had any effect on financial markets and superannuation balances. Let us look at the facts. The facts are that Australian superannuation funds are big holders of mining shares. It is estimated that around 9.2 per cent of all investments made by superannuation funds are in resources stocks. In fact, the biggest industry superannuation fund, AustralianSuper, holds 11.71 per cent of its shareholdings in BHP Billiton, a further 3.12 per cent in Rio Tinto and around one per cent in Newcrest Mining. All superannuation funds have similar holdings. Since Prime Minister Rudd's great big new tax was leaked to the media on 13 April, more than $20 billion has been stripped from the mining investments of these superannuation funds and super balances have lost around two per cent in value. But still this Prime Minister chooses to mislead the public and deny that his great big new tax is affecting share value. On Wednesday last week, the member for Pearce asked the Prime Minister about the analysis undertaken by the government on how its mining tax would affect investments of self-funded retirees and their standard of living. The Prime Minister refused to answer the question. He insulted all self-funded retirees by referring to the proposed superannuation guarantee increase as how the government would boost retirement income. But retirees are just that: ees-they have already retired. As a result of that, they are relying on their investments, much of which is invested in the resource sector. What an insult to ignore their concerns and refer to a policy that does not even affect them. In fact, he denied the impacts a day later. He said the opposition were ‘wrong, wrong, wrong' for suggesting that a $9 billion new tax on mining profits would impact on the profits, dividends and share prices of mining companies. The Prime Minister's comments follow those by the Minister for Financial Services, Superannuation and Corporate Law, who said on Monday last week that any suggestion of an adverse impact on resource investments was nothing more than a scare campaign. Information from the Treasurer last Friday confirmed that the government was aware of the adverse impacts of this great big new tax on mining stocks. As justification for Labor's emergency advertising campaign on the proposed tax-a waste of taxpayers' money to the tune of $38 million-the Treasurer stated that ‘the tax reforms involve changes and they impact on financial markets'. But it gets worse. Cabinet documents released yesterday by the Rudd government show that it had planned the advertising two weeks before the Prime Minister announced that great big new tax on mining. The Treasurer and the Special Minister of State were corresponding about the effect that the tax would have on financial markets well before it was announced. So the Prime Minister has known for months that this new tax would impact on the investments and portfolios of superannuants, self-funded retirees and senior Australians, but he has decided to mislead the Australian public. The Prime Minister cannot have it both ways. Either his government was deliberately misleading shareholders and superannuants in retirAustralia about the adverse impact of Labor's great big new tax or he deliberately ignored the advice issued by the Treasurer as justification for the government's $38 million advertising campaign. This is nothing but a tax grab. The government knew in advance what damage it would do to financial markets. It knew it would impact on the shareholdings of self-funded retirees and it knew what it would do to superannuants. And the Treasurer refuses to apologise for the as. He told Radio National yesterday that he thinks: … it's very important that the public has an accurate view of what the government is planning. Very important indeed! Well, the public now have an accurate view. What the government has planned is what is already happening: a significant loss in the value of mining stocks. As I have said, superannuants and investors already know this. They only need to look at their super balance to see what this government is doing for them and their retirement plans. Now the government is further spending their money; it is blowing more dough to convince superannuants and investors that this tax is a good thing. Despite the Prime Minister promising time and time again to abolish government advertising, he is spending another $38 million on his own propaganda campaign. We have the farcical situation where the government is using taxpayer money to convince taxpayers that miners are not paying their fair share of tax. While payers are losing their share of proceeds in their mining stocks being held in their superannuation, they are also paying for it through their tax dollars. This is a government that has already spent money beyond what it is taking from ordinary taxpayers and placed Australia's budget into historical levels of debt-a debt that is going to peak at $94 billion in 2012-13-and now this Prime Minister and this government are ruining the superannuation balances of taxpayers as a consequence of their tax grab on mining. And that is what this is really about. A on mining is nothing but a tax grab so that this government can fund policies and waste more money on poorly implemented programs. The government want this tax because of blow-outs the Deputy Prime Minister has caused in the Building the Education Revolution program. They want this tax because of the Prime Minister's home insulation debacle. And why were there blow-outs in these programs? There were blow-outs because this great big new tax on mining was needed to fund their own incompetent programs they could not implement. They were big on promises and very small on delivering. Let us look at the Home Insulation Program for just a moment. The Prime Minister admitted last Thursday after a question from the member for Flinders that he was warned on three occasions between August and October last year about safety concerns with the insulation scheme. These concerns were expressed by the Minister for Environment Protection, Heritage and the Arts, who fell on the Prime Minister's sword as a result of the bungled scheme, which caused four deaths and over 146 house fires as a result of Labor's $2.4 billion debacle. These safety concerns could have been addressed by the Prime Minister and could have been avoided if he did not choose to ignore the advice tax- given to him by the minister for the environment. There is a dangerous pattern of deceit and incompetence from this government. The Minister for Finance and Deregulation admitted to Sky News in February that this government simply does not ‘dot the i's and cross the t's'. As we have seen, it is the Australian public who suffer as a result of the government's deliberate oversights and incredible incompetence. With the pink batts scheme, it was homeowners who suffered. Now, with the mining tax, it is superannuants tax and investors who are suffering because the Prime Minister has refused to listen to experts and his own colleagues about the impact that his great big new mining tax will have on financial markets and Australia's sovereign risk profile. But, if the Prime Minister and the gang of four do not want to believe me about the impact of this mining tax, they should at least start listening to some of their state Labor colleagues-hardly advocates for the conservative side of politics. They are out there in numbers-lining up, expressing genuine concern about what this tax means for jobs and investment and our economy and what impact a weaker economy will have on the wealth of our nation. I would like to take the opportunity to note in this House some of those concerns. The Rudd government needs to understand that state Labor governments are pleading with the Prime Minister to change the design of his tax, and in fact scrap it altogether. In early May, for example, the Labor Premier of Queensland, Anna Bligh, expressed her concern that the tax would hit investment. The Premier said: You can't expect international companies to make those investment decisions unless they've got absolute certainty about the costs of doing business. In Victoria Premier Brumby said just last week: The two areas that are put to me as needing some fine tuning are firstly in relation to any ment of retrospectivity and, secondly, if the 6 per cent rate is the right rate or should it be a rate. These are pretty big and fundamental changes demanded by the Labor Premier of Victoria. The Labor Treasurer of South Australia also said on 11 May: It is the architecture, the design, the implementation that needs to be fixed, rearranged, If the architecture is no good, the design is no good and the implementation is no good, what else is there? In other words, the whole policy needs to be scrapped. The Prime Minister has accused any critics of this tax as being mouthpieces for the mining industry and involved in a scare campaign. By that measure, the state Labor governments and the state premiers are mouthpieces for the mining industry and involved in a scare campaign. This Labor government refuses to take criticism. It denies criticism even exists unless it can be used to justify its agenda at some stage in the future. The hypocrisy of this government is breathtaking. On the one hand it proclaims that it is conducting ‘meaningful consultations' with the mining sector and in the next breath it is out there rejecting everything the sector is saying. The reality is that as far as the Prime Minister is concerned it is his way or the highway. If you do not agree with him he just will not listen. That is what he is like on climate change, and now that is exactly how he and his ministerial colleagues are behaving on this tax. The arrogance of this government is a disgrace and is not in the national interest. Mining executives are the people who are actually involved in investing in Australia and providing returns to investors and superannuants. Does the government actually believe that mining companies putting investments on hold will be good for superannuaeletion funds? For the government's sake let me quote what a few of our mining executives higher think about this great new tax. What does Marius Kloppers say about this tax? He says: I think that what one can safely say is that if you pay twice the tax in one country that you pay in another for the same product then relatively speaking that other country will become more attractive. readjusted. He went on to say: What I can say though is that there will be an impact on investment, jobs and growth if the tax is implemented in an unchanged form. These are comments from the CEO of one of the biggest investors in Australia's prosperity. But do not take Mr Kloppers's word; why not speak to one of his competitors, Mr ‘Twiggy' Forrest over at Fortescue Metals. Fortescue has announced that it will put the $10.5 billion Solomon Hub and the $7 billion Western Hub projects, which were set to employ 30,000 people, on hold. I quote Mr Forrest himself: The uncertainty in the financial markets caused by the proposed tax and the cash impost RSPT payments will place on future business revenue has necessitated an urgent review of economics surrounding the development of Fortescue's major projects. There are numerous other examples across the nation. Mining executives and analysts are forecasting a trail of destruction as a sult of this tax. Credit Suisse, for example, says the Whyalla steelworks would be unprofitable because of this tax. Citigroup says that this tax will wipe off one-third of the incremental value of new projects in the Pilbara. What a service to Australia's future prosperity-taking a third of the value off projects in the Pilbara! The Prime Minister is ignoring the industry, but superannuants are not. As I said before, superannuation balances have plunged due to a plunge in the value of resource stocks. The superannuants of this country are fully aware of what the Prime Minister refuses to recognise. The superannuants of this country know that this great big new mining tax is decimating their hard-earned savings. The superannuants of this country know, and the self-funded retirees of this country know, just how hard they had to work to build a nest egg for their future prosperity, just how hard they had to work to sustain themselves in retirement, and at one minute to midnight this Prime Minister comes along and rips them off. The superannuants and the self-funded retirees and Australia's seniors know they are being ripped off by this government, not once but twice-firstly by their resource stocks being decimated as a result of this great big new tax, and secondly as a result of their being ripped off by $38 million in advertising to try to justify the Prime Minister's sham tax, this absolute blight on investment in Australia.",40
92,Mr ALBANESE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Grayndler-Minister the for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government) (3.59 pm)-I am very pleased, as the Leader of the House, to respond to this matter of public importance today on behalf of the governre- ment and to defend the rights of all Australians to get their fair share of the resources that they own. As for those opposite, the Leader of the National Party once again throws around the phrase ‘slush fund'. It is always the Nats. You love it when the Nats talk about a ‘slush fund'. You just love the sense of irony from the National Party, who established the Regional Partnerships program. The resource super profits tax is a tax that is simply moving from taxing volume to taxing profits. What is more, it is a tax which moves away from a tax on production to one on superprofits. Therefore by definition this is an efficient tax, which is why it has been backed by all serious economists right around the country and indeed internationally, as the Prime Minister indicated today with the Financial Times editorial of this week. The resource super profits tax is also a part of our national tax reform agenda. It is somewhat ironical also that in today's MPI debate the issue of the interests of superannuants is raised. This resource super profits tax will allow the next step in the Labor agenda of providing for national savings in the national economic interest and personal savings in the interest of working families retiring in some comfort. The increase from nine per cent to 12 per cent is the next step that would have occurred had the Keating government been re-elected in 1996. Those opposite have never understood superannuation. Those opposite have always opposed superannuation. We now have over $1 trillion in national savings as a result of the vision of the Hawke-Keating government, now followed by that of the Rudd government, and Minister Bowen, who is at the table, has played a critical role in ensuring the next step in this reform agenda. This is why when I attended with Minister Bowen the superannuation industry breakfast after this was announced we found it was so warmly received. It is interesting that the member for Cowper, in order to attack the government's reform agenda, simply quotes big miners. There was not a single quote from the industry which he has a responsibility to represent and advocate for within the opposition and within this parliament. But, of course, there is also the reform of company tax. We on this side of the chamber believe it should be reduced by two per cent. Those on the other side of the chamber want to increase it by two per cent. But there is another agenda as well, one that comes in my portfolio of infrastructure. We know that in spite of the tremendous mining boom when you go to regional Australia-whether it is Karratha, Port Hedland, Dampier, Newman, Mackay or Gladstone-you see there is a considerable infrastructure deficit, an infrastructure deficit that the former government was warned about by the Reserve Bank of Australia on 27 separate occasions. This is the infrastructure and skills deficit left by former government which has been a handbrake on our economic productivity. We on this side of the House are addressing the issues. The member for Cowper spoke about projects being put on hold as a result of the resource super profits tax. Indeed, as a result of his political party's position in the coalition, what is really under threat are infrastructure projects right around the nation. Firstly under threat is the infrastructure fund that would fix the issues that are raised in these communities. These communities, with their fly-in fly-out workforces, with their lack of housing and with their lack of export infrastructure through ports, roads and rail, all say, ‘How is it that we've gone through this enormous boom but we still don't have enough infrastructure?' Absolutely extraordinary! What we know is that the opposition would put under threat not just that infrastructure investment but all infrastructure spending. We know of the shadow minister for finance and debt reduction's statement on 20 May about the opposition's commitments that had been made on road and rail infrastructure. He said any other past commitments had been discontinued. In his statement the only new commitment that was honoured by the coalition was the Toowoomba bypass, which has become a footpath because they funded a small amount of the $1.75 billion that is required for that. It took just seven days for this approach to collapse into complete confusion. The shadow finance minister, when asked by the Geelong Advertiser and the Colac Herald how the coalition would fund roads in the area, said they would use Roads to Recovery funding. So every local government area in the country now knows that their future funding is under threat. On the same day the Leader of the National Party, when asked by Australian Transport News, said, ‘We're standing by all the our promises.' He said that they would take funding from the existing Nation Building Program, that somehow they would squeeze it in. What he ignored was the fact that the Nation Building Program is fully allocated until 2013-14. The $37 billion is the subject of memorandums of understanding with the states-all signed and agreed with work progressing and proper planning of infrastructure development. When they came into government in 1996, the opposition cut the roads budget by $2 billion over their first eight budgets. The office of the shadow finance minister responded to the Australian Transport News about the Nation Building Program: You would reprioritise … We would obviously consider all the programs as a whole. When asked specifically if this review extended to projects due to start this year, the answer was, ‘Yeah, of course.' So there is no doubt with that statement that the coalition has a hit list. We need to know what is on the hit list. Is it section 4B of the Geelong Ring Road? Construction is due to commence this year of the Kempsey bypass. Perhaps that is on the coalition's hit list. It was never funded by them. There was no work done by them. Perhaps that is on the hit list. The member for Cowper perhaps is aware that that is the case. Perhaps the upgrade from Woolgoolga to Arawarra on the Pacific Highway is on the hit list. The Hunter Expressway is perhaps on the hit list. Mr Fitzgibbon-They have form.",44
93,Mr ALBANESE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We know that they do have form because in 1996 the Howard government cancelled the Belford Bends project even though construction was about to begin. We know that it was on the hit list then. Perhaps the whole Hunter Expressway is on the hit list. Perhaps the Seaford to Noarlunga rail extension in the electorate of Kingston in South Australia is on it. We know that this is a vital project. We know that we can only trust the opposition when there are carefully prepared and scripted remarks that can be taken as gospel truth. But the fact is that project has never been supported by those opposite, so perhaps that is on their hit list. The sinking of the rail line at Northbridge in Perth is a project where we have announced a contract is being called. Perhaps that is on the hit list of those opposite. Mr Laming-Because you ran out of funding.",46
94,Mr ALBANESE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The clown opposite says, ‘Because we ran out of funding.' This is a joint project. Mr Hartsuyker-Madam Speaker, on a point of order: he should withdraw that.",46
95,Mr ALBANESE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I withdraw.,46
96,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The minister has withdrawn. The minister has the call.,46
97,Mr ALBANESE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for Bowman confirms with his interjection that there is a hit list. He says they have run out of money. That is their excuse already for making this hit list. I thank the member for Bowman for his honesty, and we will be reminding people of that. The Dampier Highway in Western Australia, the Great Eastern Highway and the Roe Highway are all funded by this government and construction of all are scheduled to commence. Are they on the hit list? They are all important infrastructure. The Great Eastern Highway and the Dampier Highway are important for developing our productivity agenda. The new Isis River bridge in the electorate of Hinkler is perhaps on the hit list. Construction is due to commence in September 2010. The upgrade of the southern approach to Cairns is perhaps on the hit list-$150 million allocated, construction expected to commence in 2011. For Calliope Crossroads near Gladstone, the upgrading of the southern approaches to Gin Gin, planning is under way and construction expected to commence in this mid-2011. All of these projects are under threat because of what the opposition has said. We know that the opposition needs to come clean about its secret infrastructure hit list. We know that important infrastructure is occurring in Darwin-$50 million for the port of Darwin, vital infrastructure developmentMrs Bronwyn Bishop-Madam Deputy Speaker, a point of order: it would be very interesting if the speaker opposite could reDeputy turn to the topic.",46
98,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Mackellar will resume her seat. A matter of public importance is always a far-ranging debate. The member for Cowper had fair licence. The minister has the call.,46
99,Mr ALBANESE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The fact is that they do not want to hear about this agenda. They do not want Australians to know. They will not get through an election campaign saying that they are opposed to the resource super profits tax. They are opposed to every initiative that this government has done. They are going to make cuts, but they will not say where the money will come from. They make promises in their electorate that simply do not stack up when it comes to the nationbuilding agenda of this government. The member for Cowper has ignored the fact that the Rudd government has committed $3.1 billion to the Pacific Highway. That compares with $1.3 billion during their entire 12 years in office. Almost three times as much in half the time is our commitment. He is opposed to infrastructure spending in his own electorate. It is no wonder that his own electorate is so hostile to his activity. need to come clean about where these cuts will be, as they have been caught out. They have been caught out trying to say one thing in their electorates and another thing here in Canberra and the different statements of the shadow finance minister make that clear.

100,Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"In listening to that diatribe of nothingness, I cannot help but think that the government has given up even trying to defend its great big supertax on mining. In fact-dare I say it-the great big ‘super' tax is well named because it is indeed a tax on people's super. The government's contrivance is to say that taxing our most important export earning sector is somehow going to help employers find an additional three per cent for the superannuation guarantee charge-which is in fact going be borne by employees, who will have to forego an increase in take-home pay. It is an absolute nonsense. What are they trying to say-that they are going to hypothecate the tax, that it is going to be absolutely dedicated to some purpose? Of course it is not. It is going to consolidated revenue, just like any other tax that they impose. This tax is simply designed to try and make up for the fact that they have plunged this country into debt and deficit. They were left an inheritance by the previous government of no debt-we paid off their last $96 billion. We had money in the bank. We left them with no deficit-we left them with a surplus. That was the situation when the great financial crisis came upon us from overseas. That is what saved us from going into two quarters of negative growth, a technicalMr Hartsuyker-And the mining industry.",47
101,Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am comThey ing to that. That saved us from going into two quarters of negative growth and going into technical recession. The fact is that this government has done nothing but accrue debt, accrue deficit, and embark upon a great gouging of taxation to back up its profligate spending. If the real answer to solving an economic crisis was debt and spending then Greece would be in great shape. The bottom line is: you never learn. Every time we get a Labor government we get debt and deficit, and we have to come back in and fix it up. Then, because we have made it look relatively easy, it looks like a good opportunity for a change. So Mr Rudd was given a go. Well, he has had his gonow it is time for him to go. This country deserves better. If we look at the way in which this great big new tax on the mining sector is going to impact upon seniors, upon superannuants and upon retirees generally, we will see the attitude that this government has to senior Australians. They use words like ‘burden', ‘problem' and ‘challenge'. They want to find a solution-'How dare they grow old!' They are taxpayers. They are the people who built this country, and all you want to do them. Here they areMr Hale-We are looking after their pensions",47
102,Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I hear the word ‘pension' mentioned. Which party insisted that there be an increase in pensions for single pensioners? It was the opposition; we forced the hand of the government. We were the people who made MTAWE the index factor, not the government who, before that, had been in for 13 years. Do not give me that tired old argument. The fact is that we put the pensions on 25 per cent of MTAWE, when it is higher than the CPI. We are the people who have looked after people's retirement incomes-not you. You simply regard them as a burden and you disparage them. That is the difference between us. Mr Hale interjecting",48
103,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Solomon might be better off outside the chamber.,48
104,Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This great big tax that is imploding upon our superannuation means that people who are receiving their superannuation right now have had their investment devalued, their stream of income lessened. Yet this is a tax that you have said you will not implement for how many years? Well past the next election. Furthermore, when are all the other bits and pieces that you say are tied up with it to come in? A couple of years after the next election? Mr Hartsuyker-In 2020-some of them.",48
105,Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"In 2020. At the same time, they ask taxpayers to fork out $38 million to pay for an advertising campaign to try and convince good, sensible Australians-who may have more sense than the government, I suspect-that somehow is insult this new tax is good for them. It is no wonder that this government has succeeded in exempting itself from its own guidelines. First of all, I would point out that under both governments there were guidelines for how advertising campaigns had to be conducted. The department of finance oversaw all three sets of guidelines-the MCGC set, the Auditor-General set, and the watered down Allan Hawke set. All of those are written by the department of finance, and the department's opening words are the same for all three sets. But what is different is that under the MCGC guidelines, under the previous government, there was no get-out clause. Any advertising campaign-it did not matter what it was-had to go through the system in order to go to air. But even under the Auditor-General's so-called guidelines there was a get-out clause. It is no wonder that you wanted to get out of complying with the guidelines as set down, because they say: Campaign materials must be presented in objective language and be free of political argument. I do not think you have met that guideline. The guidelines state: Campaign materials must not try to foster a positive impression of a particular political party or promote party political interests. The guidelines say campaign materials must not: … directly attack or scorn the views, policies or actions of others such as the policies and opinions of opposition parties or groups; Goodness me-are we not disparaging and scorning mining companies? That would not comply with these guidelines. They then say campaign materials must not: … be designed to influence public support for a political party, a candidate for election, a Minister or a Member of Parliament … My gosh-no wonder you needed a get-out clause. When you should ask",48
106,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Mackellar needs to remember the use of the word ‘you' is inappropriate and she needs to speak through the chair.,49
107,Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Through you, Madam Deputy Speaker, I would say that the bottom line is simply that their campaign could never have got through the guidelines as set down by the Auditor General and then watered down under Allan Hawke. As I said, the bottom line at every turn is that this big new supertax is adverse to the interests of senior Australians. It is a tax on super. If you tax something, you get less of it. Every dollar that goes into Mr Rudd's pocket is one dollar less in superannuation recipients' pocketsMr Laming-Like the mining families.",49
108,Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Of course, and mining families. But if you look at Mr Henry's performance in estimates, his statement was that it really would not make any difference whether the tax was 50, 70 or 80 per cent-it would still be the same outcome; investment would still go on in this country. When he was asked how it would go at 100 per cent he backed off a tiny bit, but not entirely. He even pointed out that a totally government owned company in Norway was happy to pay out 95 per cent of its earnings to the government-that is, the government paying itself. What we have to recognise with the impact of this tax is that any deferral in investment is what is important here. If a company has to make the decision about whether or not to go ahead with a mining development in this country, which was profitable when the tax was predictable-as it had been over the usual time frame-as against an investment in another country, which will come in and make more profits in light of the proposed tax here in Australia, then in fact we get a deferred investment and it goes off to another country, and we are the poorer for it. During the recession our mining and minerals companies underpinned our economynot in terms of the so-called employment factor but in terms of the actual value of the exports. These are the things that the government wishes to sweep under the carpet, but these are the things that the Australian people, and particularly senior Australians, are a lot smarter about.

109,Mr BOWEN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Prospect-Minister for Financial Services, Superannuation and Corporate Law and Minister for Human Services) (4.24 pm)-One month after this government announced the biggest reforms to superannuation since the introduction of compulsory superannuation in Australia, we finally have the opposition talking about superannuation-not talking about the reforms, not outlining their position, not responding; but at least they are mentioning the word ‘superannuation'. We have had two contributions from those opposite. We had the member for Cowper, the shadow minister against superannuation, and I welcome him back to the debate. He has been in the witness protection program for a month: not a word from the shadow minister against superannuation about the reforms, not a word about their plans for superannuation. Then we had the member for Mackellar, a symbol of all that is wrong with the opposition, a symbol of all that is wrong in relation to superannuation-a member of the other place and of this House who opposed the introduction of superannuation tooth and nail in this country, who railed against giving working Australians and working families a chance to save for their own retirement, who railed against giving them tax concessions so they could have a dignified and comfortable retirement and who is still opposed to superannuation so many years later. So we had the shadow minister against superannuation, and the shadow minister for seniors, who is meant to actually care about Australians retiring for their own incomes, and all they did was rail against superannuation. What we have is an opposition not willing to talk about the serious reforms to superannuation. Well, we will talk about them, and we will also talk about the scare campaign that the opposition is so grievously running. Superannuation, for the record, despite the opposition of the shadow minister for seniors, despite the opposition of the Leader of the Opposition and everybody who sits opposite, has been a good thing for Australia. has been a very good thing for Australia. It was introduced by a Labor government against vociferous opposition from those opposite. Its benefits have been many. It has created a pool of funds for infrastructure investment. It has created a pool of funds at the disposal of the economy, which was very important in terms of getting through the global financial crisis. But, most importantly of all, it has improved the capacity of Australians to save for their retirement. When Australians put money into superannuation, it gets invested. And since compulsory superannuation was introduced we have had returns of 7½ per cent a year, as opposed to an average inflation rate of four per cent a year-so Australians having the chance to become self-funded retirees, with the support of the Australian tax concessions. This was a visionary plan, but not all saw the vision of the Labor government introducing superannuation. The member for Warringah told the House on 25 September 1995: Compulsory superannuation is one of the biggest con jobs ever foisted by government on the Australian people. And he has not changed his spots. He went on to say: I say to the voters of Australiayou can just hear him saying this, can't you‘Beware! There is no pot of gold at the end of the superannuation rainbow. Any money you put in is your money and you are certain to get back less than you put in.' Now, I know the Leader of the Opposition is bored by economics. We know he does not understand economics. But I would have thought he would at least understand the principle of compound interest and return on investment, and understand that if you put money into superannuation and invest it over your working life you have a chance of a It dignified and comfortable retirementsomething he opposed, but something I do not think he even understood. But it is time to rejuvenate the financial system. It is time to rejuvenate superannuation and make it even better, to build on the reforms of the previous Labor government, to deal with the savings gap, which has been assessed by the Investment and Financial Services Association at $690 billion. It is time to deal with that by increasing the superannuation guarantee from nine per cent to 12 per cent, by dealing with the equity of taxation treatment of superannuation. As I said in the House yesterday, superannuation is taxed at a flat rate of 15 per cent. That is very attractive if you are on the top marginal tax rate. It is quite attractive if you are on the second-top marginal tax rate. It is even very attractive if you are on the next marginal tax rate. But it is not attractive if you are on the lowest marginal tax rate in Australia. If you are one of the lowest paid workers in Australia, if your income is under $37,000, there is no incentive for superannuation-and the opposition just do not care. They rail on behalf of mining companies. They are a lion when it comes to defending mining companies. They are a mouse when it comes to defending lowand middle-income earners in Australia, with not a word to be said-and, worse, they actively oppose our plans to introduce more equity into superannuation in Australia. They rail against it and they actively oppose it. They will vote against it, they will campaign against it, and that shows their true colours. The other thing we have done is improve the tax concessions for people over 50something I thought the member for Mackellar, as the shadow minister for seniors, would have supported. It was something the shadow minister for superannuation did support before he got rolled. On 19 April, to a great fanfare, he announced opposition policy, which would be to allow people over 50 to make more tax concessional contributions to their superannuation accounts. It was a written speech, carefully scripted-gospel truth. It lasted a month. It lasted a month before shadow minister for finance announced it had been discontinued. The shadow minister for superannuation got rolled and he should hang his head in shame that he has let down, and his party has let down, people aged over 50 who are trying to save for the future. What the opposition has instead done-in this MPI and in so many other places-is engage in a scare campaign. They do it so well. I say you have to stick with what you are good at in politics-and they do it so well. They did it on the petroleum resource rent tax. They did it on national superannuation. They did it on Mabo. They did it on the CPRS and now they are doing it on this. They love a good scare campaign. I know many in the community want to know about what is happening with share prices in Australia. They want to know about what is happening to the impact on share prices. So let us just go through it for the benefit of the House. From 30 April this year the Australian Stock Exchange 200 Materials Index that covers mining companies has fallen by 6.3 per cent. That is what enables the shadow minister for superannuation to get up here and say, ‘$20 billion has been wiped off the value of Australian mining stocks, and it's all due to the resource super profits tax.' Well how about the Standard and Poor's 500 materials index, which covers the United States: a 9.7 per cent reduction. In Brazil-the home of Vale, one of the world's biggest miners-the materials index showed an 11.2 per cent reduction. Clearly they are very worried about the resource super profits tax in Rio! Mr Burke-They are reading the Australian!",49
110,Mr BOWEN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"They probably read the Australian in Brazil; I am sure it has a very the wide readership! In South Africa the mining index has fallen by seven per cent. They are all indices which have fallen by more than the Australian materials index between 30 April and 1 pm today. Mr Laming-They're investing in Australia, as well.",51
111,Mr BOWEN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for Bowman says that it is because these companies invest in Australia, as well. That's a good one! Well done, and thanks for coming, the member for Bowman!",51
112,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The member for Bowman will have his chance in a few minutes; otherwise he will not have a chance.,51
113,Mr BOWEN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Please explain why the South African, Brazilian and American mining indices have all fallen. He says it is because those countries invest in Australia. Well, maybe that would explain why the Nikkei index has fallen by 12.1 per cent, why the Standard and Poor's 500 has fallen by 8.2 per cent and why the UK FTSE has fallen by 6.6 per cent, compared, in Australia, to the ASX 200 falling by 8.6 per cent. So let us have less of the scare campaigns from the opposition. I welcome the opposition debating superannuation in Australia. I would welcome their response to our plans for superannuation. I welcome the member for Goldstein, who rolled the shadow minister for superannuation and discontinued his policy to support people over 50. But why don't they start by saying what their plan is? They could start by disavowing the Leader of Opposition's plan in Battlelines. In the Leader of the Opposition's book-carefully written, scripted, gospel truth-he laid out his plans for superannuation. He wants fewer self-funded retirees. He wants fewer superannuants. He wants to abolish the tax concessions on superannuation. Now, a 30-yearold in the workforce today, under current arrangements, would have a retirement lump sum of $456,000. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop interjecting",51
114,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The minister still has some time.,52
115,Mr BOWEN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We would add $108,000 to that. The Leader of the Opposition would take away $211,000. (Time expired)",52
116,Mr LAMING,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Bowman) (4.34 pm)There are few things more dangerous than a government in hegemony with a ton full of cash inherited from a previous Treasurer. In fact, there is only one thing more dangerous, and that is a government on the skids, with ashen faced government MPs watching as their popularity plummets, with no money left in the kitty to continue the spin. I, for a moment, want to acknowledge the staff in the Prime Minister's office watching this debate today, with a far more difficult job to do. They have no money left and they are still trying to maintain their boss's desperate spin. We have had two government speakers. The first of them was reading out a stump speech about investment in major infrastructure. The second was this member of the government talking about compulsory superannuation when the debate today is about superannuants-a slightly different suffix. Superannuants are mostly individuals, in this country, who are self reliant and hard working. They have had a career of saving and they are watching it being wiped out by a Prime Minister desperate to cling to some flotsam to protect his political career. All this Prime Minister wants is an exit strategy and I feel for those on the other side of this chamber-intelligent, hard working MPs-hoping to be able to see their policies become reality but watching those policies erode in front of them. We just need a little bit of factoid here, don't we, because what we are talking about is a mineral tax that is wiping out the wealth of superannuants in this country. What we are talking about is a mining sector that knows full well that it is an internationalised sector. They rely on the investments of large companies that Ian Harper from the Melbourne Business School will tell you are subject to internal price transfer. And the tougher you make it for them here in Australia the more they will invest in their mines in Chile or Africa. There has been a distortion in the debate that these are somewhat non-renewable resources slipping through our fingers like sand and that we have to grab a few dollars for our labour base before it all disappears. The argument is complete froth and bubble, because these minerals are going to be there for decades to come. What we need is some form of security and sovereign knowledge that there is security to invest in Australia. That has been eroded in weeks, and that is shown in the stock market-through shares, dividends and superannuation values-and it is shown in the attitude of ordinary Australians towards our Prime Minister. In areas with little to do with the mining sector, Australians will tell you they are nervous about this supertax grab. And they are nervous because they know deep down there are superannuants who invested in a block of land at Emerald in the hope that they might be able to build there and solve the housing crisis, but they have had contracts fail. They are nervous because they have invested in this sector and just hope for a stable return that the coalition offered over 12 years, a stable fiscal base-not this ridiculous policy plinth that is simply a grab at tax, as if it is the only way to fund this government's foolish spending. It is this government that wasted so much debating time in this chamber saying that in some way this is funding the superannuation increase from nine to 12 per cent. Let us be honest. It is a $9 billion tax grab to fund $200 million of tax concessions, and the rest just feeds its spending addiction. It is a spending addiction on that side of the House that must be stopped somehow. What we have is a denial about reality. There is no willingness on that side of the chamber to talk about company tax. There is a simple rule in business: if you make more money as an entity you pay more company tax. You cannot get away from the fact that mining taxes have gone from $2.6 billion to $21.9 billion over the past decade. This is not a debate about whether mining companies can pay more tax or not. This is a debate about confidence in this government to run our economy, and that is why it is in so much trouble. The pure fact is Australians do not trust a government advertising campaign that cannot even be honest that these mining companies pay company tax. I would be deeply disturbed if I were an Iluka shareholder being misrepresented on Q&A by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, Lindsay Tanner, that they will somehow be better off under this tax. I would be concerned about companies like Fortescue, if I held shares in them, predominantly Australian based which has little option to do what large multinationals do and that is shift effort internationally. And I would be worried about Mount Gibson and Atlas and other firms that thought they had sovereign stability but instead have Rudd sovereign risk. Australians were yearning in 2007 for them some form of spin instead of substance, for some promises without delivery, and of course for rhetoric without action, because they had not had that for 12 years. They have had two years of that now and look where it has left us. It has left us with uncontrollable, unaccountable spending and a Rudd government on the slide. (Time expired) Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (4.39 pm)-I certainly welcome the opportunity in this matter of public importance debate to talk on the resource super profits tax and superannuation, especially following the member for Bowman. Let us talk about some ‘factoids', shall we, that the member for Bowman referred to. The fact is that the Rudd government's tax reforms will broaden and strengthen the economy, ensuring all sectors grow in a sustainable way that benefits all Australians. The proceeds will be invested in superannuation savings, new infrastructure and tax cuts that will create jobs and help small businesses grow and thrive, and this will add 0.7 per cent to GDP and boost wages by 1.1 per cent. But I welcome the opportunity to speak on this MPI for another reason, and that is to debunk the misleading campaign that we hear from those opposite and from the mining sector. Let us talk about the Liberals' campaignthis latest scare campaign. If we go back a bit, the opposition opposed the petroleum resource rent tax. This was going to destroy the resource sector. They opposed national superannuation, and the Leader of the Opposition has said in the past that compulsory superannuation is one of the biggest con jobs ever foisted by government on the Australian people. This is how serious he is about protecting those most senior in our community. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has said that the state mining industry is paying its fair share of tax. The opposition leader now saying that the mining industry is paying more than its fair share of tax. Now we have Senator Barnaby Joyce, the shadow infrastructure spokesperson, saying the mining industry could pay more tax. The member for Bowman has just said that it is a distortion to say they are not renewable resources. I am looking forward to hearing further explanation of how the mineral resources in this country are renewablebecause somehow it is a distortion, according to the member for Bowman. So I look forward to hearing that into the future. Let us look at the mining industry's campaign. I think we have heard it before. The opposition said that the country would collapse if Work Choices was ripped up, yet here we are still standing with the economy still thriving. The mining industry is claiming that it is putting on hold all new investments and it will walk away from existing investments. Let us look at this claim, shall we. In Queensland, a consortium of coal mining firms has put in a bid of $4.85 billion through the Queensland Coal Industry Rail Group, which comprises 13 coal producers, to purchase the Queensland coal track network. Does this sound like the actions of an industry that says it is no longer going to proceed with investments and is going to pull out of current investments? Let us look at these companies. Are we talking about small companies that are wanting to make these investments? No. Let us look at some these 11 coal producers: BHP Billiton, Ensham Resources, Macarthur Coal, Peabody Energy, Rio Tinto Coal, Xstrata Coal, Wesfarmers Resources. These are big mining companies. Why have they put this bid forward? Because, as the Queensland Coal Industry Rail Group has said, the offer would encourage fair and open access, optimise network performances, enable early system expansions and encourage rail haulage competition. This is is not what an industry does if it is about to walk away and go overseas to Africa, as we have just heard, or Chile or wherever else the member for Bowman tries to claim. Let us have a look at the alternative that the Rudd government is putting forward. Australians will get a fair share of their nonrenewable resources. They are owned by the Australian people. This is a tax on profits, not production-a concept the Leader of the Opposition appears yet to grasp. It is a fairer tax for all. It ensures that we restore what this country was getting from the resources sector a decade ago. Ten years ago, Australia was getting $1 for every $3 of mining profit from royalties and charges. Now it is getting $1 in $7. We deserve our fair share. That is what this resource super profits tax will do. It will provide company tax cuts, small business company tax cuts, small business instant write-offs, an increase in the super guarantee to 12 per cent, super for low-income earners, more generous super caps, a rise in the superannuation guarantee age from 70 to 75, 50 per cent interest deductions up to a $1,000 limit and optional standard deductions. These are the some of the things that will eventuate from this tax.

(58) Clause 307, page 236 (lines 18 and 19), “(other than payments of instalments ployers under Division 2 of Part 3-2)”. In moving these amendments, I am taking up my remarks of the other evening. There may be very good and altruistic reasons why women undertake a career. Unfortunately, most women in Australia are stewing on having children because of the economic hardship that would fall upon not only them but also their children. I emphasise that point. These amendments are about who should undertake the administration of this money. I state again that while the emphasis is on career women all the time in our society, as it is in this bill, there is no emphasis at all on the stay-at-home mums. One woman who is on $140,000 is going to get $140,000 when she has a baby. The stay-at-home mum will get nothing at all. The Minister for Families, Housing, Community Service and Indigenous Affairs is shaking her head. I would take an interjection from her and let her explain to us what she is saying. All the speakers in this place that are backing you, Minister, have got up and said how wonderful it is that people will be able to get the same amount of money when they take time off to have their babies. I am not against that; I am quite happy to go along with that. I am just asking: what about the other women? Numerous women in that category have rung me up and bitterly complained. I will be moving a resolution in the House on the substantive issue, because it is a money bill and I cannot do that this evening. Getting back to the amendments, they are simply to take the employer out of administering this payment to these mothers and putting the government in their place. The GST and the BAS were colossal impositions upon small business. I remember that I was at a to meeting where one of the ladies there, when the Leader of the National Party was saying what a good thing it would be for all of us, omit spontaneously burst out crying. A couple of by emblokes put their arms around her and took her out of the room. She was a good friend, so I went over and saw her the next morning. She is a hardware store owner. She said: ‘Bob, I just simply couldn't take any more work. We get up at seven o'clock because of all the builders. Then I have to rush back over and get the kids breakfast. A lot of these blokes work late. Then I have to get the kids dinner. Then I have got to do all the bookwork for the business late into the evening. I couldn't face up to another bit of work.' We would ask the government to consider that they have made an error here in placing the responsibility upon the employers. This burden should not be borne by the owner operators. If you want to differentiate it out and say that Woolworths and Coles have to do it, that is fine by me-the corporates. But for owner-operator businesses to have another huge burden of responsibility placed upon them is wrong. If they lose a good and key employee because a mother has to go off and have a baby and she needs time off to raise that baby through that early period, the business has obviously lost a very valuable employee. On top of that, they have the burden of administering these payments as well. So I recommend these amendments to the House. I would have liked the opposition to have backed the amendments, but there seems to be an element of hypocrisy there because they have informed me that they are not backing these amendmentsamendments that they actually moved in this place.",55
119,Ms MACKLIN,PAID PARENTAL LEAVE,"Jagajaga-Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs) (4.50 pm)-I thank the member for Kennedy for his contribution to the debate. Just to clarify one of the issues that the member for Kennedy has just raised about a woman who may be earning $140,00 before she goes off on parental leave, under the government's scheme she will only be entitled to exactly the same amount as a woman who is a casual worker or a seasonal worker, the federal minimum wage of just over $540 a week. I make that clarification for the member for Kennedy. By contrastand maybe this is where the misunderstanding arose-the opposition has put forward a different scheme. As the member for Kennedy would be aware, the opposition is proposing a new tax on larger businesses, a new tax expected to raise around $3 billion a year. That tax will be imposed on most things that Australians buy. From the revenue derived from that tax, the opposition proposes that if a woman is earning-and to take the figure that the member for Kennedy has raised$140,000 before she had her baby then, under the opposition's scheme, she would be entitled to six months of maternity leave paid at her full wage; she would get $70,000. That is the opposition's proposal: a highincome woman earning $140,000 a year would get $70,000 over a six-month period, paid for by this new tax. That is the opposition's scheme; it is not the government's scheme. The government is very clear that we think we should have a government funded scheme, which is what this bill is about, and that we will pay it to women for 18 weeks at the federal minimum wage no matter what her income is. There is a work test and there is an income test, but-to go to your point-that is the relevant proposition of the bill. Mr Katter-Minister, can we get yourself and the government to look at stay-at-home mums?",58
120,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAID PARENTAL LEAVE,"Member for Kennedy, the minister has the call. You can have another call, but not at the moment.",58
121,Ms MACKLIN,PAID PARENTAL LEAVE,"If the Deputy Speaker will allow me, I will take the interjection, because it is a very important one. I do want to indicate to the member for Kennedy and to all the mothers who are at home-and increasingly we are having dads at home as well-that we certainly respect the hard work that they undertake at home caring for their newborn babies and their children. We want to make sure that we do give people a choice, and that is why we are continuing to support the payment of the baby bonus and family tax benefit parts A and B. If a mother or a father is entitled to paid parental leave, they will not be entitled to the baby bonus or family tax benefit part B, and it will be taxable, whereas a mother at home will be entitled to both the baby bonus and family tax benefit parts A and B. So we certainly do want to support mums at home, and I absolutely respect the hard work that they do. Mr Katter interjecting",58
122,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAID PARENTAL LEAVE,The member for Kennedy will have another chance if he wishes.,58
123,Ms MACKLIN,PAID PARENTAL LEAVE,"I will go to the member for Kennedy's amendments which he has just moved. The primary purpose of his amendments, as he has just outlined, is to remove the role of employers in providing parental leave pay to their long-term employees. The first thing I would like the member for Kennedy to be aware of is that we are requiring that this role be undertaken for long-term employees only-that means employees of more than 12 months. That is the first thing. It will not apply to shorter term employees. To give the member for Kennedy an idea of how many people we expect this to apply to, we understand that only nine per cent of all businesses will be a paymaster in any given year. (Extension of time granted) I understand the member for Kennedy's concerns about small businesses, and I think his points are well made, but I inform him that we expect only three per cent of small businesses to be the paymaster in any one year. So we expect a very small number of small businesses to have to undertake this task. The other remark I would make is that the member for Kennedy's amendments are really contrary to the whole objective that government has. We do want to see employers having a role in the whole Paid Parental Leave scheme. We want to see that paid parental leave is delivered as an entitlement women participating in the workforce. That is one of the reasons we are having employers be the paymaster to their eligible long term employees, in exactly the same way that they currently pay them. There are a couple of other things that I think might help the member for Kennedy. We certainly understand, as many employers do, that paid parental leave really does return benefits to employers. Many employers understand that, and that is of course why they offer their own paid parental leave schemes. One of the things we have done in this legislation is delay the requirement on employers to be the paymaster, so they will not have to start being the paymaster for their long-term employees until after 1 July next year. This recognises that they need a little bit of time to get used to the new scheme and also ties it in with the beginning of the financial year. employers do not want to start that on 1 January, when the scheme begins next year, the Family Assistance Office will make the payments for the first six months. We also will be providing employers with the necessary funds to pay parental leave pay in advance. We certainly do not want to have any adverse impact on their cash flow. Employers will not be making superannuation contributions during the paid parental leave period. They will not accrue any additional leave entitlements during a period of parental leave pay. Also, employers will not have to change the normal pay cycle. They will not have to set up any special accounts or report back to the Family Assistance Office. They will just have to do what they normally do, which is pay the parental leave pay to their the employees with the usual tax deducted. The estimated transitional costs are in fact very small and, based on Productivity Commission analysis, will be far outweighed by the for benefits that employers will receive through retention of any skilled staff. Finally, I say to the member for Kennedy that any reasonable costs incurred by employers will of course be tax deductible. As a result, we will not be supporting these amendments.",58
124,Mr KATTER,PAID PARENTAL LEAVE,"I will be very brief. I think the points that Tempe Harvey has continually made should be listened to by the government. I accept that the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs is not giving us any joy on the wider issue of looking after the stay-at-home mums. But she is clearly not hostile to them either, and we appreciate that. We would also appreciate the government's seriously considering the very reasonable and sensible points being brought forward by Tempe Harvey and her If group. Originally, I very strongly supported the minister and the government as well as the opposition on the Paid Parental Leave Bill 2010. I apologise to the House for my slight confusion of the policies of the opposition and the government on this, but then again there is so much confusion on that issue that I can be excused for making such a mistake. I would also like the minister to consider the stories she is getting about only three per cent and nine per cent and so on. Minister, you should have been in your position long enough to know that you do not always get the straight line from people in the Public Service and you really have to do a lot of the homework yourself on these issues.

127,Ms LEY,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"I am pleased to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (Medicare Levy and Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2010. This bill was introduced on 13 May 2010 and increases the low-income threshold for the Medicare levy and Medicare levy surcharge in line with increases in the consumer price index for the 2009-10 income year. This bill maintains the intention of the low-income thresholds by ensuring that individuals and families on low incomes remain exempt from the Medicare levy and Medicare levy surcharge according to changes in the CPI. So this is an annual event and, I have to say, a quite unremarkable one. The low-income threshold for the Medicare levy and Medicare levy surcharge has been increased in line with the CPI since 1996-97. Similar bills have been introduced into this House by the previous coalition government and the current government in every year since 1996-97, with the exception of 1998-99, when the CPI was a negative figure. The increases to the low-income threshold for the Medicare levy and Medicare levy surcharge will apply from the 2009-10 income year. I commend the bill to the House.",60
128,Mr NEUMANN,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"I speak in support of the Tax Laws Amendment (Medicare Levy and Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2010. I come from a working-class family in Ipswich, and we thought when I was growing up that the provision of both education and decent health care was absolutely vital. My local member of federal parliament during most of the time that I was growing up was Bill Hayden, who brought in Medibank over the objections of doctors and the Fraser coalition government. He brought in many reforms. Medibank gave working class people, people on low incomes, pensioners and others their first opportunity to access a decent healthcare system in this country. It was long overdue. Medibank was a great initiative, but it was gutted and effeclegislation tively neutered by the Fraser government. Medicare, which was brought in by again a Labor government in the 1980s during the Hawke-Keating years, was absolutely vital. We want to make sure that people on low incomes who cannot achieve financial security and are in a position where they need decent health care but cannot afford it are provided with quality care in our health and hospital system. I am pleased with what we are doing in the budget both nationally and in my area, which I will talk about very briefly. I am also pleased that this housekeeping bill, which makes a difference to people's lives financially, has been brought forward once again this year. The Medicare levy is imposed at a flat rate of 1.5 per cent on a resident's entire taxable income. We want to make provision-and I think there has been a bipartisan approach to this-for people on low incomes not to be liable for the Medicare levy. We have a progressive tax system in this country. It is not a regressive tax system when it comes to income tax. We want to make sure that people who have what economists would call low economic status are provided for in terms of their costs for health and hospital care. Medicare is a great Labor initiative. I am pleased that the previous, coalition government undertook the adjustments every year, except, as the member for Farrer said, in 1998-99, when there was a negative movement in the CPI. The legislation proposes to increase the Medicare levy low-income thresholds for individuals and families, lining them up with movements in the consumer price index. The legislation also proposes to increase the Medicare levy low-income threshold for pensioners below the age of eligibility for the age pension to make sure that this group of individuals will not have a Medicare levy liability when they do not have an income tax liability. As the makes plain, increases apply to this income year-that is, 2009-10-and future income years. This is an important change because it means that people do not have to pay the levy if they are low-income earners and there will be more money in their pockets. It means that they will be in a position to afford to pay for the necessities of life, such as food and clothing for themselves and their children. It is important to make sure that they have extra income in their hands to do those sorts of things. The provision of health care and making sure that Medicare operates successfully, efficiently and effectively is crucial to people not just nationally but locally in my area. As federal members of parliament, I am sure that all of us have had people come to us from time to time in relation to Medicare and, certainly, in relation to private health insurance and other issues. How we treat people on low incomes in a decent way, by providing adequate services in terms of primary health care and hospitals, says a lot about where we are at as a country, in the states and in our communities. What the government is trying to do with respect to building the National Health and Hospitals Network for the future adds to a lot of the legislation that we deal with every day in this place, including this legislation. Creating the National Health and Hospitals Network, which the Prime Minister often says is funded nationally but run locally, will be important. Making sure that Medicare is strengthened is also critical for our health and hospitals system. Each year we see budgets in this place and money is rolled out. The Rudd government is delivering an additional $2.2 billion over four years for better access to more doctors and GPs. Those GPs engage with Medicare every day in their practices. This unprecedented amount of support for Medicare is critical in my community, which has a shortage of doctors. We have had that shortage for quite some time. The provision in the budget will help my community. Additional doctors, more subacute hospital beds and additional aged-care beds will also make a difference. The legislation before the House is quite minor, but, like so much legislation, it will make a difference to people's lives. It will make a difference to low-income earners and pensioners, and they are the ones we should care for the most. As a Labor representative always believe that we should care for those in need, those on low incomes and those who are struggling. That is because of the experias ences that I had in my household when I was growing up, and certainly many others on this side of the House had those experiences as well. I dare say that some on the opposite side of the chamber had those experiences as well. This important legislation might be housekeeping legislation, but it will make a real difference in people's lives by putting money back in their pockets, and that will make a difference to my community. I support the legislation.",60
129,Mr TUCKEY,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"O'Connor) (5.13 pm)The Tax Laws Amendment (Medicare Levy and Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2010 has been represented as a simple measure. It is a measure that has occurred in all years bar one. It proposes to address two issues related to the Medicare levy per se and the Medicare charges, which were altered during the years of the Howard government for good reason. Of course, that has been sustained by this government in its desperation to find any amount of money possible to fund its failed health policies. Quite properly, the levy and the thresholds involved do not call upon lowincome earners to make a contribution to the health budget of Australia if they earn income below the level referred to in the legislation. There may be a reason that the parliament deals each year with those amounts of money when it is openly admitted that they are adjusted to the consumer price index. The consumer price index is, of course, known. Often the adjusted amounts in this circumstance are increases in real terms. The parliament continues to make this adjustment and records it in the Hansard on an annual basis. As I said, there was no adjustment in only one year, and, of course, that was a year in I which the CPI demonstrated a negative movement. It is interesting to note in that regard, and a consequence of that period under the Howard government when inflation, with all of its debilitating effects, was just about wiped out of the Australian economy, that it became apparent that pensioners, for instance, needed a new index, which became known as MTAWE, which is, as I recollect, a 25 per cent proportion of male total average weekly earnings. This is an arrangement that is of importance because it adjusted people's pensions to a figure more commensurate with the huge increase that was occurring in real wages under that disgraceful scheme known as Work Choices-so blackguarded in this place. But the real increase in wages for workers, and of course their employment opportunities, were huge during that period and it was appropriate consequently to ensure that pensioners could better meet the cost of living that arose in those circumstances by being given a percentage of male total average weekly earnings. This legislation deals firstly with the cumstances of pensioners, and, of course, even fully-fledged age pensioners have additional income from time to time. It sets out in the tables to be found in the explanatory memorandum the threshold after which persons must pay the Medicare levy at a rate of 10c in the dollar for every dollar they earn over and above the threshold until such time as they pay the full rates applicable. Nevertheless, the surcharge is of much more interest to me inasmuch as it was an initiative of the Howard government which I had argued for in 1998 with a policy that, in the first instance, recognised the foolishness of the argument of community rating, where a young and healthy person was obliged, and is still obliged, to pay the same private health insurance premium as a more elderly person. Of course, when it comes to the business of health and the cost of delivering health services, age is a major contributing factor where the costs increase rapidly. The first point was that it became patently obvious that people had worked out the system and the system was this: while you were young and healthy and unlikely to be affected, other than if you had a car crash or some sporting injury or fell under a bus, to use a common term, then in fact you had to pay the levy unless you were one of these people we are dealing with today whose income was lower than that. The threshold is quite low-an income that does not exceed $18,488 in the adjusted schedule for taxable income or family income. Until then the levy does not apply. But you paid it, as you had to, and you took the risk on ever having to get in the queue for a public hospital. Usually the form of injuries that people suffered in their youth guaranteed them access to a public hospital, even if it were, for instance, a premature heart attack that might be visited upon someone in their 30s or 40s. cir- Under that community rating principle, and at a time when you turn, say, 50 or 60 and your knees or hip joints were starting to give you some pain and suffering or you required other treatment, which was termed elective surgery, you went and joined a private health fund. Of course, the private health sector under the Hawke-Keating government was getting loaded up with people for whom they could not increase the premiums above the community rated premium, which was set by government, and the government faced massive payouts for people needing elective surgery. And the Howard government, in recognising this, but not as I proposed in 1998 by having a three-tier insurance premium structure with an entirely different approach to support the people who could not afford it, said that if you had not entered into an agreement with the private health insurers at an age which I recollect was 30-it is not mentioned in the second reading speech or elsewhere-then in fact an additional one per cent would be added to your Medicare levy. Then there was a further surcharge that applied to people whose income exceeded another level, which meant they were highincome earners and, as such, they could and should pay more if they failed to purchase private health insurance. These measures deal with those matters, and they are the traditional arrangements that apply in setting these particular requirements. Another measure the Howard government introduced, which had some relationship to my 1988 policy, was a rebate on all private health insurance policies. During the HawkeKeating government, and I think quite deliberately so, there was huge pressure being put on the private health funds to service all of the high-risk sector in the health services industry. They were on the verge of collapse. It has to be remembered that the Australian Constitution forbids the commercial conscription of medical practitioners and dentists and people of that nature. I think that was put in in 1946-included in the referendum question that for the first time ever gave the Australian government the right to participate in health services. I could never understand why at one stage the Prime Minister was threatening the states with some form of referendum when such a referendum was conducted in 1946 and he has all the powers he needs if he wants to accommodate the cost. The whole purpose of the rebate was to give 30 per cent of the premium cost by way of a rebate to all persons who participated in private health, and to increase that to 35 per cent and 40 per cent as people passed age thresholds, which I think were 70 and 75though it might have been 65 and 70. That has seen a massive escalation in private health insurance participation. On the one hand there is a stick that says you will pay additional surcharges, as mentioned in this legislation, if you do not join a private health fund at a certain age and/or when your income exceeds a fairly substantial amount of money-around $130,000, as I recollectand, on the other hand there is a carrot whereby if you join voluntarily not only are you protected from those surcharges but also the government gives you a rebate. At the last election, the Rudd opposition promised faithfully, one of these cross your heart promises, that they would never revisit that rebate and attempt to alter it. But, surprise surprise, we have been through that exercise in this House-another broken promise; they attempted to means test it. You can raise all sorts of socialist philosolocal phy about when a rebate of that nature should be paid, but if you consider the commercial arrangements the government is getting a very good deal by convincing people they should pay two-thirds of their own hospital costs through a private health insurance scheme. That is what it does-it is no gift to those people any more than some government contribution to private schools is a gift to the parents. They pick up the other probably 80 per cent of the cost of educating their children in a private school. If all those schools were to close down-and the private health system was on the threshold of that at the end of the Hawke-Keating governmentone would wonder where the state and federal governments would find the money to educate all those kids. I think attendance now at private secondary schools for years 11 and 12 is over 50 per cent-and it could be higher than that. The reality is that we are still dealing here with a system that in these circumstances, outside of the stick, gives no incentive for more people to participate in the private health industry. Yet, were everybody to be in the private health industry, and were people subsidised up to 100 per cent of the relevant premium cost, the cost to the Australian taxpayer would be less. A very generous premium rebate/subsidy scheme up to 100 per cent could be provided and it would cost less than the present system. But, oh no, we are now being managed by a government that believes it knows best. It believes it can manage the corner store much better than can a small business couple; it can manage public hospitals better than a state administration, and the federal Minister for Health and Ageing will be more available to 21 million Australians seeking health services than a state minister for health-or for that matter a local shire president or mayor in smaller communities where the administration of hospitals should reside. It would be less expensive and they would have the responsibility of appointing a director of nursing who would have the qualifications to run the hospital, just as they appoint an engineer to design and oversee the construction of their roads or a chief executive to manage the financial affairs of their council. It could be done quite easily and would be less expensive than even these regional boards that are now proposed for a health scheme that nobody seems to understand. The other fact of life is that when this money is collected and these particular rates and surcharges are collected it will not all within a bull's roar, to use an old saying, of the cost of running public health servicesexactly the same as we see with the Building the Education Revolution costs. In fact you get a situation that you can see advertised in last week's Sunday Times in Perth. You can get an air-conditioned, four-bedroom, brick and tile house with a home theatre, an office, two bathrooms and all the trimmings which can be built for $160,000 as advertised. Yet this government, as it manages to shop with its $16 billion expenditure for adding buildings to schools around Australia, needs nearly $1 million to build a tuckshop or, for instance, a covered assembly area which a typical farmer would buy for $50,000 or $60,000 and put all of his expensive and very large plant under. So we have this issue that we should be raising taxes from the Australian people for the purpose of empowering governments and member of parliaments who pride themselves on their ability to run a business, yet they cannot get within 400 per cent of the cost of construction of a building when compared to the private sector-and day after day after day the private education people are demonstrating what happens when people make these decisions at the grassroots. So it is a much bigger deal than the matters we deal with today. As the financial impact documentation relevant to these measures points out and advises, if we do nothing then, based on that, in 2010-11 government revenues will drop by $90 million, in 2011-12 by $45 million, in 2012-13 by $45 million and in 2013-14 by $45 million. But considering we are going to change those figures each year I think those forecasts might be as good as some of the other forecasts that we have been hearing in recent times. The reality is that this an additional tax system that still applies, but it will be reduced somewhat by relieving certain people on very low incomes-and $18,000 go in this day and age is a very low incomefrom the levy and it will also adjust the surcharge entry point to $31,000 or $36,000 depending on whether it is family income or personal income. That will provide some relief to people, but in fact they should be taking out private health insurance. They should accept their responsibility to do so and they should make sure, by so doing, that they do not crowd out the very needy and deserving who are dependent on-(Time expired)",62
130,Mr GEORGANAS,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak in support of the Tax Laws Amendment (Medicare Levy and Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2010. This bill proposes to increase the Medicare levy low-income thresholds for singles and families in line with movements in the consumer price index, or CPI. This will be welcome news for many of my constituents in the electorate of Hindmarsh who are on low or fixed incomes. The Medicare levy lowincome threshold for pensioners below age pension age will also be increased to ensure that individuals in this cohort will not incur a Medicare levy liability when they do not have an income tax liability. The increases will apply to the 2009-10 year of income and later income years. The government understands that cost of living increases hit lowincome and fixed income Australians the hardest, so these threshold increases will ensure that the Medicare levy does not add to those cost pressures. The Medicare levy is imposed at a flat rate of 1.5 per cent on a resident's entire taxable income. However, low-income earners are not liable for the Medicare levy, consistent with the progressive nature of income tax. The low-income threshold in the Medicare levy surcharge provisions will also be increased to come into line with increases in the CPI so that a low-income family member will continue to not be subject to the Medicare levy surcharge. For example, in 2009-10 a couple where one partner had an income of $140,000 and the other had an income of $18,488-which had increased from $17,794 in 2008-09 in line with the movements in the CPI-would be above the Medicare levy surcharge threshold of $143,000. However, the low-income threshold in the Medicare levy surcharge provisions would ensure that the partner on $18,488, whose income increased in line with movements in the CPI, would not have to pay the surcharge assuming the couple did not have appropriate private patient hospital cover. The higher income partner would still be liable to pay the surcharge. In my electorate of Hindmarsh there are more than 20,000 people aged over 65. To many of them the cost of living and the cost of health care are key concerns. For them it will be welcome news indeed that the government will continue to support them and continue to respond to the needs of people who have less capacity to pay but no less a right to access quality health services and health care in Australia. I note that similar amendments have been announced in previous budgets and have been supported by both sides of the House. I hope that that will be the case this time around as well. It is important to note that if the bill is not passed June 2010 affected taxpayers might have their tax refunds delayed or might need to have their assessments amended once it has been passed. This amendment complements the Rudd Labor government's historic health and hospital reform program, which is the most significant reform since the introduction of Medicare. To begin with, the government is investing $1.2 billion in training and supporting more doctors, nurses and allied health professionals as part of building a national health and hospitals network. This includes an additional $523 million investment in Australia's nurses and these investments will ensure that our health workforce meets the needs of Australians today and the growing demand for health services into the future. The Rudd Labor government is also investing $390.3 million to support almost the equivalent of 4,600 full-time practice nurses in general practice in a major boost to primary care never seen before. For the first time, GPs in urban areas will be eligible for funding to help employ practice nurses. More practice nurses will help take the pressure off GPs by providing clinical support in areas such as wound care and immunisation, managing recall and reminder systems and patient education in areas such as reducing alcohol consumption and quitting smoking et cetera. The Australian General Practice Network has found that practices employing a practice nurse see more than 800 extra patients each year. With GPs then able to see an extra 3.8 million patients each year across Australia, patients will find it easier to get an appointment and easier to have access to these services. Annual incentive payments of $25,000 per full-time GP for a registered nurse and $12,500 per full-time GP for an enrolled nurse will be made available to eligible accredited general practices. By 2013-14, an by 30 estimated 4,537 GP practices will receive more funding, worth $31,500 per year on average, to make better use of highly skilled practice nurses. The government will invest $103.1 million to better support nurses working in aged-care settings and to better support the current aged-care nursing workforce. These are just some of the things. The government will provide $59.9 million in incentive payments for existing aged-care workers to upgrade their qualifications and remain working in the aged-care sector. There will be $21 million to fund an additional 600 enrolled nurse training places and 300 registered nurse scholarships over four years for agedcare nurses to upgrade their skills in recognitional tion of the increasing frailty of older Austrayears lians in aged care. There will be $18.7 million to trial new models of care to expand and improve the role of nurse practitioners in aged care. That will be building on the 2009 budget changes to provide access to Medicare and PBS for nurse practitioners. This investment will support greater access to primary health and care services for agedcare residents. There will be $3.5 million to explore regulation of personal care workers and assistants in nursing in aged care. This will assist in considering the inclusion of personal care workers in the National Registration and Accreditation Scheme for the Health Professions. To better plan for the aged-care workforce needs into the future, the government will also provide $500,000 to conduct a research study of staffing levels, skills mix and resident care needs in Australian residential aged-care facilities and, as part of the Productivity Commission's inquiry into aged care, examine future workforce requirements-which are very importantincluding the influences of supply and demand, and come up with the options to ensure the sector continues to have a suitably qualified workforce to provide the best possible care. These measures, together with those announced in the Tax Laws Amendment (Medicare Levy and Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill, will assist in building our worklocation, force, including the need to continue to provide high-quality care to our ageing population and the need for our allied health professionals in rural and regional areas, which have not been forgotten either. The government will provide $34.1 million for two new rural locum programs to give around 3,000 nurses and 400 allied health professionals the time to take leave. The government will also invest $6.5 million in providing 400 addiclinical training scholarships over four for allied health students in rural and regional areas to provide more opportunities for those interested in working in the bush. Mental health is another area that the government is looking at as a priority in this budget. In the health and hospital reforms the government has committed to supporting and expanding the number of specialist mental health nurses. These are very vital changes and additional investment in Australia's health workforce. They are an absolute necessity, together with the changes that we are making to the legislation. These will ensure that people have better access and better services all in place through this legislation. I also mention an announcement made the other day through the Medicare offices that are around Australia. It was quite welcomed in my electorate where we are going to colocate services in a particular shopping centre where there is a Medicare office. We are going to include the agency of Centrelink together with Medicare in an office in West Lakes. This is part of the Rudd government's service delivery reform plan where more offices will have Medicare working side by side with Centrelink under one roof. Many shoppers at West Lakes shopping centre and residents from around the area in my electorate will benefit from the new co-location service which will give them better access to a whole range of government health and social welfare services from one convenient including their local Medicare office to deal with their Medicare issues. I suppose adding a Centrelink service to the existing Medicare service will simplify people's dealings with government by giving them more control and better support and assistance when they feel that they need it. Importantly, there will be no job loss announcements as a result of this co-location. The site I am talking about currently offers Medicare services, which will be now joined with Centrelink services, and the number of staff is expected to increase to cater for the Centrelink services. More than 140,000 people in Adelaide's north-western suburbs use Medicare office services. This is just another example of the Rudd Labor government delivering better health services for the people of Hindmarsh and better access to health services in and around Australia and especially in the electorate of Hindmarsh.",65
131,Ms HALL,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"Shortland) (5.44 pm)Firstly, before turning to the substance Tax Laws Amendment (Medicare Levy and Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2010, I would like to link into what the member for Hindmarsh was saying about the collocated Medicare office that has just been announced for his electorate. I would like to put on the record that we have a collocated Medicare and Centrelink office in the Shortland electorate. It replaced the Belmont Medicare office, which the Howard government closed holus-bolus in 1997. The Belmont Medicare office had been one of the best patronised Medicare offices in the area, but there was one problem with it, and that was that it was located in a Labor-held electorate. In the 1998 and subsequent elections Labor promised to reopen the Belmont Medicare office. I made representations to the previous government about the need for it, especially for elderly residents. While public transport was good going north, it still took elderly residents quite a while to travel to Charlestown, where the Medicare office was. Alternatively, they could travel to Lake Haven on the Central Coast, but it was quite difficult for residents to travel in that direction if they did not have a car. It took Labor getting into government to deliver that vital service, that Medicare office, that the people of Shortland electorate-people living in the Belmont, Swansea, Ballantyne, Redhead and surrounding areas-had longed for. That Medicare office was snatched away from them by the Howard government. Mr Deputy Speaker Georganas, when the Medicare and Centrelink office is operating in your electorate, you will find that your constituents benefit from it. The residents are finding the Medicare office at Belmont very useful. It is all about delivering services to people in the area that they live, recognising that older people need to have the services close to them and making government services userfriendly. It is about delivering to people, not of the about people delivering to government. Before I go to the substance of my contribution to this debate, there is another issue that I am very disappointed to have to raise. I have to make an apology to you, Mr Deputy Speaker Georganas. An arrangement was made between the government and the opposition for you to speak before the member for O'Connor because you needed to be in the chair. Unfortunately, the member for O'Connor did not honour that agreement. In his contribution to this debate, the member for O'Connor was quite scathing of the Rudd government's honouring of commitments. Well, the member for O'Connor could not even honour a simple commitment made between the government and the opposition to allow the member for Hindmarsh to speak before him so he could make his contribution to the debate. This place operates on the goodwill of all parties. On many occasions, we allow members of the opposition to come on to the speakers' list when they had not been on it. We are mindful of the fact that members of the opposition also undertake chair duty, and we need to be flexible in that. On many occasions, two government members will speak or we will let two opposition members speak, just so this House can function. Unfortunately, on this occasion the member for O'Connor did not honour the commitment. When I pointed out to him that you needed to be in the chair, Mr Deputy Speaker Georganas, his comment was it was your problem. Well, I do not see it as your problem; I see it as a problem for the House. I was extremely disappointed by the member for O'Connor's actions. I thank you and I thank the member for Braddon for filling in for you and sitting in the chair to allow you to make your very valuable contribution to this important debate. The Tax Laws Amendment (Medicare Levy and Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2010 is consistent with what has happened in previous years. It proposes to increase the Medicare levy low-income thresholds for singles and families and to increase the Medicare levy surcharge low-income threshold in line with movements in the consumer price index. The Medicare levy low-income threshold for pensioners below aged pension age will also be increased to ensure that individuals in this cohort will not incur a Medicare levy liability when they do not have an income tax liability. The increase will apply to the 2009-10 income year and later income years. Similar legislation to this has been through the House on many occasions. In fact, there has been a threshold adjustment for every year since 1996-97. There was not an income adjustment in 1998-99 because there was a negative movement in the CPI. I believe this legislation will be noncontroversial. I look to the opposition to support this legislation, because it is legislapublic tion that helps Medicare function in the way it is intended to. Medicare has been looked upon as being the greatest reform in the history of the Australian health system. It provides universal health care to all Australians and it ensures that, if somebody is sick, they will be able to see a doctor; and, if somebody needs hospital treatment, they will be able to enter a hospital. That is vitally important to all Australians. I have to say that there has been a new reform that I think will come up to the mark as far as being one of the most important health reforms in Australia's history-that is, the national health and hospital reform that was agreed to at COAG on 20 April. This replaces eight separate health systems with a single national health and hospital network, combining all public hospitals, all GP services and related services. It dedicates one-third of the GST revenue currently paid to the states and territories so that the Commonwealth can take majority financial control of the entire network and invest this revenue directly in health and hospitals. It puts small local hospital networks in charge and makes sure that the networks meet national standards and publish accurate performance reports. Medicare was a landmark reform. The national hospital network will be landmark legislation when it passes through this parliament. The Rudd government has delivered on health for the Australian people. Labor has always delivered in the area of health for the Australian people, be it Medicare or the hospital network reform. I have to say that this is in stark contrast to the years of the Howard government, when the now Leader of the Opposition was the then health minister. He used to stand up in this place with rolled gold, rock-solid, ironclad guarantees that Medicare would be looked after on his watch-and he failed. He failed to look after hospitals. He ripped $1 billion out of public hospitals. His response to the Rudd government's budget this year is to rip another $1 billion out of hospitals. He is the $2 billion man, constantly ripping money out of health. He used to stand up in this place and say that he and the Howard government were the best friends Medicare ever had. Bulkbilling reached record low levels when he was the health minister, and the cost of healthcare became more and more expensive. The real win for the Australian people was when the Rudd government won and he was no longer health minister. Just as he is lazy and does not like economics, I remember him saying he did not like health, he was not interested in health, he found health rather boring, he had been health minister for too long and he wanted to do something different. That was obvious, and his contempt for health is obvious now, with his plan to another $1 billion out of health. The Leader of the Opposition is a real risk to health. He is a real risk to the Australian people. And he is a risk that, quite frankly, the Australian people cannot afford. Contrast that to the Rudd government's performance in the area of health, where you have a $64 billion agreement for health and hospital funding over a five-year period; $600 million in an elective surgery waiting list reduction plan-and that was for 36 superclinics. But in this year's budget there was funding for an additional 23 superclinics. I know members on this side of the House are all competing to get funding for those superclinics. There has been $872 million in investment in preventative health; $1.6 billion to close the life pectancy gap between Indigenous and nonIndigenous Australians; $134 million in investment for the rural and remote workforce; $3.2 billion for 35 health infrastructure projects; $300 million in low real interest rate loans for residential aged care facilities; $293 million for 23 transitional care facilities-and this was agreed to all before the budget. In the budget there was more money for health. It is phenomenal that one government can commit so much to health when the previous government ripped so much out of health. What it does is show that the Rudd government has a real commitment to the Australian people, the Rudd government recognises how important health is, the Rudd government recognises how important Medicare is and the Rudd government recognises how important it is to invest in hospitals and health services and in the training of doctors. The Rudd government also realised how important it was to respond to The blame game report that was conducted by the previous parliament and brought down in November 2006-a report, I might add, that the Howard government could not even respond to. The rip now Leader of the Opposition was the health minister at the time, and he did not even sit down, read the recommendations and come back with an answer to the recommendations that were included in that report. That is very different to the approach of the Rudd government, which has made health a priority. In this year's budget the government is investing $7.3 billion over five years. There will be $470 million invested to improve after-hours access to GPs and primary care services, and that will be supported locally by Medicare. In the Hunter we have after-hours GP access that operates out of the local hospital. It is a wonderful service. It is a service that has looked after the people of the Hunter for a very long period of time and will continue to exflourish. There are also some after-hours GP practices that provide care for people in the Lake Macquarie part of the Shortland electorate. But on the Central Coast these initiatives will really be welcome because they do not have the same level of after-hours care that is available in the Lake Macquarie part of the Shortland electorate. I welcome it with open arms. As I said, there is $355 million in the budget for 23 new GP superclinics. I might add that that is one of the areas that the opposition intends to rip money out of. The opposition does not have a grasp of on-the ground services needed for people living in our communities. I know that the member for Paterson was delighted to see the GP superclinic open in his electorate recently, so they are welcome. There will be $523 million invested in training support for nurses. That will be very welcome. That includes nurses working in general practice. I know that the doctor's surgery that I attend has two practice nurses. They are very valuable members of the team operating out of that practice, and I know that the extra money will be welcomed, not only by the GP practice that I attend but by all GP practices in my electorate and, I am sure, throughout Australia. There will be $467 million to modernise our health and hospital system, through electronic records. This is something that has been pursued for a long time. When in government the Leader of the Opposition was very supportive of electronic health records. Now that he is in opposition he is planning to ‘discontinue'-I think that is the word-the plan to introduce electronic health records. Having electronic health records is really good health practice; it is a way of ensuring standardisation across the health system. Once again, it is something that the Leader of the Opposition will discontinue and rip out of the health system. I might stop going through all the wonderful initiatives that have been put in place by the Rudd government. They are initiatives that really take health care to a new level will be great for the Australian people. They have been welcomed in the Shortland electorate. I conclude by saying that I am extremely disappointed by the performance of the opposition. I have been extremely disappointed by the Leader of the Opposition, particularly when he was health minister. He was the minister who actually gave the terms of reference to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing to undertake the inquiry into health funding. It issued The blame game report, which identified chronic problems within our health system and chronic workforce shortages and made some very strong recommendations on how to address the problems that existed in the health system. The report was ignored by the Leader of the Opposition when he was in government. The Rudd government did not ignore the report. We read it. The minister and the Prime Minister took on board the recommendations that were included in this report and went about reforming our health system-reforms that compare with the major reform of Medicare. I commend this bill to the House. I hope that the opposition will support it. It is a very important bill for those people who depend on it, and it must pass through the House by 30 June.",68
132,Dr EMERSON,TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"Rankin-Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy, Minister Assisting the Finance Minister on Deregulation and Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs) (6.04 pm)-I would like to thank those members who have taken part in the debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (Medicare Levy and Medicare Levy Surcharge) Bill 2010. This bill increases the Medicare levy low-income thresholds for individuals and families in line with increases in the and consumer price index. The individual threshold amount is to be increased from $17,794 to $18,488. The level of the family income threshold is to be increased from $30,025 to $31,196. The Medicare levy low-income threshold for pensioners below age pension age is also increased so that individuals in this cohort do not pay the Medicare levy when they do not have a tax liability. This will also ensure these pensioners receive the full benefit of the increase in the pension announced by the government in the 2009-10 budget. The lowincome threshold in the Medicare levy surcharge provisions is similarly increased. This change ensures that a low-income member of a family will continue to be exempt from the Medicare levy and Medicare levy surcharge. The amendments to the Medicare levy lowincome thresholds apply to the 2009-10 year of income and later income years. The annual adjustments to the Medicare levy and Medicare levy surcharge lowincome thresholds have enjoyed bipartisan support for more than a decade. I would again like to thank those who have participated in this debate and commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading",71

134,Mr DUTTON,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"This that legislation-the Excise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2010 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2010-is proposed as one of the recommendations of the Preventative Health Taskforce, which handed down its findings last September, and also of Australia's Future Tax System Review. This will see a 25 per cent increase in the cost of cigarettes and tobacco products, aimed at producing the number of people who smoke. This is the first increase above inflation in the taxation on tobacco in over a decade. The expectation of the government is that this measure will increase revenue by $5 billion over four years. According to the World Health Organisation, tobacco is the secondhighest cause of death in the world. It is responsible for about one in 10 adult deaths or five million deaths each year. According to data in 2007 of the Australian Bureau of Statistics, Australia had one of the lowest smoking rates in the OECD with around 17 per cent of people aged 15 years and over smoking every day. However, Indigenous Australians are far more likely to smoke, with those in remote communities even more likely to do so. One in five Indigenous deaths is attributed to smokingthat is, 20 per cent of the Indigenous population. Higher rates of smoking can also be observed within lower socio-economic communities and in other disadvantaged groups. The Taking preventative action report of the National Preventative Health Taskforce has identified that around 41 per cent of pregnant teenagers, 38 per cent of unemployed people, 34 per cent of people unable to work, 32 per cent of people with a mental illness, 78 per cent of male prisoners and 83 per cent of female prisoners are smokers. These are all groups where price increases for tobacco should have a real impact. As awareness of the negative impacts of smoking tobacco has increased, the proportion of people who smoke has inclined. Yet tobacco contains an addictive stimulant in the form of nicotine, which does mean that quitting smoking can be very difficult. The decline in smoking rates in Australia, a fall of 40 per cent for men and 44 per cent for women, between 1989 and 2007 was among the biggest in the OECD. But, given that the total cost to Australian society of tobacco is estimated at $31½ billion each year, reducing the number of people who smoke and the quantities people smoke is vital. There has been a lot of discussion about what is the proudest part of Tony Abbott's very successful record during his time in the health portfolio as part of the Howard government. This must rank as one of the most significant achievements of Tony Abbott as Minister for Health and Ageing. There were many other achievements: the increase from about $19½ billion a year that was spent on health when we came into government in 1996 to about $52 billion a year by 2007 and the record investment in public hospitals. Increasing the private health coverage from the low-30s per cent up to the mid-40s was I think one of Tony Abbott's most successful achievements as health minister. Immunisation rates increased from 52 per cent up to 90 per cent-an amazing outcome for Tony Abbott as health minister. Tony Abbott increased PBS expenditure over that period and introduced reforms which put the PBS onto a sustainable path into the future, which was incredibly important with an ageing population. They are all significant events that Tony Abbott can be very proud of. People can understand that Tony Abbott, as opposition leader, has a proud track not just as a health minister but also as a cabinet minister for about eight years in the Howard government. He is a person with experience. The fall in smoking rates over his term as health minister must rank as one of the highest of his achievements in that portfolio. However, smoking is still the leading preventable cause of disease and premature death in our country, so considerably more work is needed to further reduce the rate of smoking. Australia does have a moderate tobacco price by international standards. Therefore, increases in the cost of cigarettes and tobacco products to bring Australia more in line with international pricing are not unreasonable. That is the reason the coalition first called on the government to increase the tobacco excise rate more than 12 months ago-not in reply to this budget but in reply to the one before that. We saw it as a legitimate means of trying to reduce the rate of smoking. Although it took the government some time to catch up, we have supported the measure proposed in this bill. Increasing the cost of cigarettes and tobacco has proved to provide financial incentive for people to quit smoking, thereby reducing the long-term strain on the hospital and healthcare system. This coalition, when elected at the next election, will continue that commitment to the Australian people. We are genuine in our resolve to improve services in public hospitals and to improve the coverage of private health insurance beyond even the 10 million people who have private health insurance now in our country, because we want to ease the burden on our public system. We want to make sure that mums and dads who are waiting long periods of time in emergency departments in the early hours have better and faster access to health professionals. We want to make sure that we record continue the great work of Tony Abbott when he was health minister so that we can improve health outcomes. We have some amazing statistics in this country when you contrast us to similar countries. We have something to be very proud of. We have a great number of graduating doctors coming through the system at the moment and I know, while some medical students have expressed concern about where they will be trained and where they will be doing their internships, these people have not just popped out at the two-year mark of the Rudd government. These are people who went to university because of new places created by Tony Abbott when he was health minister. So we want to make sure that, when the coalition is elected at the next election, we fix some of the mistakes that Labor has made in health. There has been a waste of money in some areas in health. Putting GP superclinics alongside existing practices has caused great distress among doctors and practice nurses operating in those existing practices. What sense does it make to put millions of dollars of taxpayers' money into a GP superclinic which sits alongside an existing practice, a practice that might be trying to help young people give up the habit of smoking or addressing the chronic disease that they might present with? Why would we put those surgeries under pressure and potentially have them close if a flood of those doctors go into the new GP superclinic when already there exists a viable practice? There is a lot to be rectified. A lot of damwrite age has been done not just to the health system but to the Australian economy in a very short period of time. This government has thrust our country into enormous debt. We started with $20 billion in the bank. This is a government that, instead of spending some of that money on health and instead of spending some of the stimulus package on health, decided to waste that money. That will make it more difficult for the coalition and indeed the next government to make the decisions about health that we want to, because we will have billions of dollars in interest each year to pay off Labor's debt. This is always the legacy of a Labor government. It always makes it hard to invest in health and the sorts of programs that we want to when we succeed a Labor government, because always Labor thrusts this country into debt. That is the Achilles heel that Labor brings to government. It is a burden that has now been thrust upon generations to come. It will take generations to pay Labor's debt back, but the coalition is committed to doing it. We want to invest further in health at the same time as we manage the Australian economy responsibly. We support the bills. There is a lot more work that needs to be done in health. There needs to be a redirection of the investment in health. The coalition is the only party at this election that stands to serve the Australian people in getting better health outcomes for all Australians.",72
135,Mr ZAPPIA,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak on the Excise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2010 and the related bill, which increase the rate of excise on cigarettes and tobacco by 25 per cent. Just before I get on to my remarks, I want to respond to some of the comments made by the member for Dickson just a moment ago. I begin by saying that he may well wish that he could rehistory in respect of the track record of the Leader of the Opposition when he was the Minister for Health and Ageing. But the cold, hard reality is that he cannot. The opposition leader, during his time as minister for health, slashed a billion dollars from the health budget of this nation. People well remember that it was during his time that hospital waiting lists increased and there was a shortage of doctors and nurses. The health system was in absolute crisis-so much so that I can recall that in the lead-up to the 2007 election his own Prime Minister, in a mercy dash to Tasmania, said that they would take over the Mersey hospital as part of their attempt to restore their credibility on the management of the health system of Australia. For all their protestations and all the attempts by the member for Dickson to try and change that record, the fact of the matter is that the Australian people well recall what it was like trying to get a doctor and trying to get into hospitals during the term of the last government. Getting back to the essence of these bills, in money terms the raising of the excise on tobacco cigarettes by 25 per cent means that on each cigarette there will be a price rise from 26.22c to 32.775c. For a kilogram of tobacco, the price will increase from $327.77 to $409.71. The measures raise the percentage of tax in the retail price of a packet of 25 cigarettes from around 62 per cent to around 67 per cent, which is still considerably lower than in France, where the tax percentage on a packet of cigarettes is around 80 per cent, and in the UK, where the percentage is around 77 per cent. As the minister has made clear, all the additional revenue raised will be invested in the National Health and Hospitals Network fund. This is the fund that the Prime Minister and the health minister have announced and which has been agreed to by seven states and territories. It is intended to reform Australia's health and hospital system. It is a reform that is absolutely necessary following the administration of hospitals and the health system in this country by the previous government. This reform will ensure that the federal government will take responsibility for 60 per cent of the funding of all public hospitals. The Commonwealth government will also take full responsibility for GP and related services provided outside hospitals. It will replace separate health systems with a National Health and Hospitals Network. It will dedicate one-third of GST revenue to health and hospitals and will put local hospital networks in charge of hospitals. Furthermore, local hospital networks will be funded for each service that they deliver. Importantly, national health standards will be set, cost shifting will be avoided and funding will be better targeted. The reforms start from 1 July 2010. We will then begin to deliver 1,300 new hospital beds, more than 6,000 new doctors and an additional 2,500 age care beds through the Commonwealth takeover of primary and age care. In addition to that, in the recent budget it was announced that a further $2.2 billion will be committed to building a modern health system for all Australians. That $2.2 billion will be used to provide an additional 23 GP superclinics around the country at a cost of $355 million, $417 million to enhance after-hours services, $523 million to train more nurses and $467 million for individual electronic health records. I want to spend a moment on that further $2.2 billion of expenditure, because most of it will be cut by the opposition if they win government. We heard a moment ago the member for Dickson criticising the government's investment in GP superclinics around the country. There is a GP superclinic already under construction in my electorate of Makin, and I welcome that investment. It was a total investment of $25 million, jointly funded by the federal government and the state Labor government. It is an investment that will see a GP superclinic provided, with all the ancillary services that go with it. I know that will ensure that better health services are provided to the people I represent. Yet I see the opposition saying that they would cut that funding and that they would not proceed with the GP superclinics that this government has committed to. In one of the other cuts they have mentioned, they would not proceed with the individual electronic health records commitment of $467 million. I have spoken in this place on another occasion in support of an electronic health system for this country and the importance of it. The ability of doctors in hospitals to have at their fingertips accurate information about the patients they are treating will undoubtedly ensure that we have a much more efficient health system and a much more accurate health system, which can only be good for those people who are being treated. I know that is a policy supported by the medical fraternity generally. I am surprised to see that the opposition is now suggesting that they would cut it, given that when they were in government they had said they would support an electronic health system for Australia. They have clearly now done a backflip, again highlighting that in reality they are not committed to a better health system for Australia and that if they will go back to their old stance of making cuts to the health system, as they did when the current Leader of the Opposition was the health minister. It is expected that this measure will result in a reduction of tobacco consumption of about six per cent and a reduction of two to three per cent in the number of daily smokers in Australia-around 87,000 Australians will probably give up the habit of smoking. In introducing these measures the minister for health outlined the serious health effects and costs to the Australian community of tobacco related illness, and I want to reiterate some of the facts. Each year around 15,000 Australians die of tobacco related illness and 750,000 hospital bed days are taken up by patients with tobacco related illness. The total financial costs to Australia associated with tobacco use are in the order of $31.5 billion each year. Through a range of strategies-including health warnings, tax rises, banning smoking in workplaces and other venues, advertising bans and other measures-smoking rates in Australia over the last two decades have been almost halved, from 30.5 per cent in 1988 to 16.6 per cent in 2007. Across the world, around 5.4 million people die each year from smoking related illness. More concerning to smokers should be the fact that tobacco kills up to half of all users. That is quite a frightening statistic: tobacco kills almost half of all users. Yesterday was World Tobacco Day. Mr Deputy Speaker Georganas, I note that you-as a former smoker who, I understand, gave up some years ago-made a speech in respect of World Tobacco Day, in support of the campaign to reduce the number of people who smoke throughout the world. It is a day which focuses attention on the global disastrous effects of tobacco consumption, and it is one of the international strategies aimed at elected curbing cigarette smoking. Mr Deputy Speaker, I hope other people follow your lead. Not surprisingly, the increase of the excise on cigarettes has not been received well by smokers. In my own electorate I have been contacted by several of them. Some might say that if smokers do not want to pay the tax they can simply give up or cut back on smoking. For someone who is addicted to smoking, it is simply not that easy. I am sure that most smokers would want to give up if they could. I note that a high proportion of smokers are in the lower socio-economic status categories of society. In fact, those who can least afford the cigarettes are spending the most on them, and they will therefore contribute most to the increased revenue raised. People who are poorly educated, unemployed, unable to work or on low incomes and Indigenous Australians are more than twice as likely to smoke as other Australians, with smoking rates amongst the unemployed and Indigenous Australians at more than one in three. For example, smoking levels amongst the unemployed are at about 38 per cent, whilst for the most advantaged sector of society smoking rates in Australia are around 14 per cent. What I would like to see and what I urge the minister to consider is the provision of increased support to smokers for the purchase of nicotine patches or similar aids to help them quit smoking. Increasing the range of items which attract a PBS rebate when prescribed by a GP should be considered, as I know some of the products available can be costly. Of course the costs of tobacco smoking are not borne only by the smokers. The effects of passive smoking on children, other family members, work mates and people in social venues is well documented. It is estimated that around one in 10 tobacco related deaths is due to second-hand smoking. I repeat: one in 10 tobacco related deaths is attributed to second-hand smoking-in other words, people who do not smoke but are in the company of others who do. Over the years we have seen action taken by all three levels of government in Australia to curb the effects of passive smoking on others in the community-for example, bans on smoking in workplaces, in public venues and in vehicles which children are in are now commonplace. One cost to the community which is difficult to quantify but which is undoubtedly significant is the cost to communities and the environment through damage caused by discarded cigarette butts. Each year about 24 billion cigarettes are sold in Australia. It is estimated that around seven billion of these end up as litter in our streets and waterways. In fact, I have seen a figure that suggests it higher than 24 billion cigarettes-perhaps up to 32 billion cigarettes. Whichever it is, it is a huge amount of cigarettes that are sold. If a third of those butts end up in our streets and our waterways, they not only create a litter problem but also create additional environmental and health problems. Given that cigarettes contain about 4,000 chemicals, one can only guess the damage they cause to the environment, particularly waterways, once they are discarded. Cigarette butts can take up to 12 months to break down in freshwater and up to five years to break down in seawater. There is also the cost and risk of fires caused by carelessly discarded cigarette butts. Many house fires and large bushland fires have been attributed to cigarette smoking. Again, the actual costs are impossible to measure-and, of course, you cannot put a price on human life. As recently as six weeks ago a wheelchair-bound resident in my electorate died as a result of a fire which authorities believe was caused by a cigarette. I said earlier that there has been significant progress over the last two decades in reducing the number of smokers in Australia. Clearly, a sustained campaign of education, advertising restrictions and increasing public places where smoking is prohibited are measures that are working. I therefore welcome the announcement by the government that, as from 1 July 2012, all cigarettes will be sold in plain packaging. In view of the initial reaction to this measure by the tobacco companies, I expect it will be another positive step in reducing the number of smokers in Australia. I wait with interest to see what level of resistance tobacco companies put up to the plain-packaging proposal. This measure, in conjunction with legislation restricting internet advertising of tobacco products, updating and expanding the graphic health warnings on packets and increasing anti-smoking advertising revenue is by $27.8 million over four years to take it to more than $85 million over that period, should make a difference in reducing the level of tobacco use throughout the country. I welcome the announcement by Minister Snowdon-the Minister for Indigenous Health, Rural and Regional Health and Regional Services Delivery-made yesterday as part of World Tobacco Day, that a new workforce to tackle Indigenous smoking rates and promote healthy lifestyles would be established in 20 regions across Australia. He said that 82 positions, to start in July, would be created. Almost half of Indigenous Australians smoke, and one in five deaths amongst Indigenous Australians is caused by smoking. Through the employment of regional tobacco coordinators, tobacco action workers and healthy lifestyle workers, and the Quit Smoking and Healthy Lifestyle programs they will be responsible for, it is hoped that smoking rates amongst Indigenous Australians will be reduced. It is only through these kinds of targeted programs that I believe we can make some real inroads in reducing tobacco consumption amongst Indigenous people. I heard the shadow minister for health speaking on this legislation a few moments ago and I understand the opposition will be supporting these measures. I certainly welcome their support. Unlike what the Leader of the Opposition had proposed, however, the money raised from these measures will go into our health and hospital system. He proposed earlier that it would go into clamping down on people who are welfare recipients. I believe these measures go a long way towards not only improving the health of our nation but assisting people, through the accompanying health reforms, to quit the smoking habit. While I accept the legislation is not welcome right throughout the community-certainly three million smokers throughout the nation would not be pleased about it-it nevertheless has the support of the medical community, the Cancer Council of Australia and other authorities who have studied the effects of smoking on health across our nation. I commend the bills to the House.",74
136,Mr TUCKEY,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"O'Connor) (6.33 pm)This legislation, the Excise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2010, has good purpose and the coalition obviously supports it. Let me say, nevertheless, that I am not exactly sure what this had to do with excise on tobacco products but I did hear the member for Makin make some reference to the government's GP superclinics. My recollection was that there was an ironclad guarantee made at the last election that the government would deliver 36 of these clinics around Australia. Some of us thought they might even turn up where there is a shortage of doctors. The member for Makin tells me he has got one. He must be one of the three members who has. So the government has again failed to keep its promise. We are lectured daily by the Minister for Health and Ageing about how much money she is spending or how much of Australian taxpayers' money is being given to the states. I refer to that as measuring excellence by expenditure. We also have excellence by promises that are not kept. Furthermore, the coalition has identified this scheme for what it is: (a) it has not happened; and (b) it simply replaces the services that were given by independent members of the medical profession, by general practitioners. It is another attempt to socialise the services of medicine by putting-as they typically do-these facilities in where there are plenty of doctors anyway. As with the argument that has prevailed in this place when it comes to how you might fund the difficulties that people experience in getting dental services, the idea that you just send away the money and, hey presto, a lot of disadvantaged people get services, ignores completely the availability of dentists who will go and work for wages in the public sector when, as we well know if we are in the habit of visiting a dentist, they can make about 50 times as much in the private sector. There is no purpose. You create GPs superclinics-a fancy name-and put a lot of services under one roof, if you have got a roof. I think we have only got three roofs. And one might even ask why it is necessary to build before you get the people. You can rent premises. If you go into a Bunnings warehouse you will not find too many that are owned by Bunnings. They know that the economic benefit is in renting the premises and conducting their business therein. But this government has to build the structureno doubt at similar cost to what we are seeing in the Building the Education Revolution-before it provides the service. But, again, if the service is not placed in areas of significant need through the absence of other medical practitioners, then it serves no beneficial purpose. Another issue that arises out of all of this that I have experienced in my electorate, and more particularly in some of the nicer places to live, is of medical practitioners, maybe with family obligations, who are only working two or three days a week, yet when another practitioner tries to bring in a couple full-time practitioners from South Africa, the UK or some of the more desirable spots they are told by the socialised Medicare system, ‘You have got enough provider numbers and you do not need any more practitioners.' But the practitioners are not available. I just thought I would make those points, considering the remarks of the member for Makin. What we are talking about is something that governments of all political persuasions choose to do-to tax us to save us from ourselves. I am not objecting to that and I note the second reading speech of the Minister for Health and Ageing in which she talked about increasing the charge per stick-in other words, per individual cigarette. That initiative came out of the GST tax reform. It was the Howard government that introduced it because previously the excise related to packets. It was being manipulated by people with larger packets of 30 cigarettes instead of 20. There were all sorts of practices going that the stick proposition, which is accepted by this government at this stage, overcame. It was a good measure. However, notwithstanding all the arguments relevant to the consumption of alcohol, it will not bite the bullet on volumetric taxes for alcohol. There was the farce that was the alcopops issue. Even the revenue that the government predicted from alcopops is now starting to decline. What did it do? It taught kids to buy full bottles of spirits at 40 per cent alcohol instead of the five per cent mixers that looked like a good profit for the government. We will tax you to save you. The kids are not that silly. I am anxious that the increase in the cost of cigarettes will have the desired reduction which the minister refers to. I think it is something like three per cent or thereabouts. It has already been reported that some people have reduced their discretionary expenditure in other areas. They are addicted. They are of buying cigarettes and paying the tax. The media producers will be interested to know that one of the losers has been magazines. That might balance out over a while, but for all the claims, which can only be applauded, the second reading speech tells us: This action has had a dramatic effect. That is the various warning labels and things of that nature. It continues: The number of daily smokers aged 14 and over in Australia has been reduced from approximately 30.5 per cent of Australians in 1988 to 16.6 per cent in 2007. That is good news. But in that period we are told that there has not been any adjustment in the excise other than by way of the CPI automatic adjustment. What caused that reduction? It was all the things that have been mentioned. It was an extensive advertising campaign-at times almost offensive but I will not complain about it. The second reading speech says: That is why successive Commonwealth and state governments have taken action to reduce Australia's smoking rates. This has included action at the Commonwealth level by increasing taxationno they did not; the increase has been very modest in that periodconducting hard-hitting social marketing campaignshooray for thatbanning tobacco advertising and introducing graphic warning labels. But in my view the most successful initiative is: States and territories have also acted smoking inside licensed venues, running Quitline services and hiding cigarettes from view at point of sale. I think that major cutback has resulted primarily from making the practice of smoking extremely inconvenient. There are so few places you can have a smoke. I am fortunate that I never bothered to take up the habit. My mother smoked from aged 13 to 73. She died at 83 and it was not from smoking. I do not promote that to encourage people to smoke. But there seems to be a lot of reasons to quit. A lot is said about passive smoking. I operated in the hotel industry for nearly 30 years and can well remember walking into some of the venues in my hotel and virtually could not see across the width of the room. I would have to replace the carpet very regularly for all the cigarette burns on it. I did not need anybody else's help; I was just taking the smoke in and, to date, it has done me no harm. I am not saying that as an excuse. I am just pointing out the vagaries in all these situations. I think that this is a tax grab. It might work, but I do not think it is going to work as well as past campaigns that tried to convince people that it is not smart to smoke. When we start a campaign on so-called recreational drugs, we will see a decline in the level of violence in entertainment areas and drinking places these days which the police forces in most states, certainly in Western Australia, still want to blame on alcohol. Alcohol should be taken in moderation, and the fact is that it is not when people are drunk that there are those scenes of violence that we are seeing so regularly. In fact, they find some difficulty in fighting at all. There is a period of time after which their belief in their own ability no longer meets that ability. Alcohol tends to generate a bit of courage for a certain amount of time, but of course it is not much good for your reflexes. But it is different with people who take these by banning so-called recreational drugs. We had a case in Perth the other day where an elite footballer got caught down an alley sniffing cocaine. The standing joke throughout Western Australia was that this bloke was a bit unlucky that the police caught him; if he had been caught by an AFL inspector, nobody would know about it. And, if he had been 17 years old or thereabouts, a recently drafted rookie, and he had a positive test under the AFL regime, not even his parents would be told about it. I said on radio while that was getting publicity-and I will repeat it in this place-that it almost warrants a law being passed in this House that prevents TV and other media broadcasts of elite sports that do not have a zero tolerance and an open and transparent drug policy. The AFL policy is driven by the industrial relations associated with the players association. It is a blight on our TV companies that they have not done something about it. There would be no elite football and there would be no footballers buying Ferraris and Lamborghinis, as some do, if in fact the TV stations did not pay the AFL very substantial amounts of money. I think the last contract was $700 million for about three years. It is up to the TV managers and owners to insist. I think Rugby League has a much more aggressive policy. I cannot comment on union, but they probably have as well. But the AFL stands out as an elite sporting operation that believes that their players can go to various venues and be seen taking drugs-and it is those drugs that start the fights, I can tell you. I have seen too much of it. In particular, it is those drugs that make person believe that kicking a man who is on the ground in the head is okay. If that had occurred in any of the establishments I had, the person who did that would have been lucky to get out of the bar alive, because everybody else in the bar would take to them. It is just unacceptable. It is now considered par for the course. Of course, if you have got a flick-knife in your back pocket, you might stick it in someone. Who would have done that in years gone by? So we have got a problem. We have a government that has a simple solution to any perceived problem: put the taxes up. As the member for Makin mentioned, that might cause considerable hardship to some people. All of these tax increases on alcohol or cigarettes make recreational drugs a cheaper option, and that in itself, I think, is a problem. There is no taxable solution to these drugs, and it is the responsibility of the parliament to do more about it. I was encouraged to read in recent days about some so-called big drug busts. Let me come back to that footballer. Nobody has asked him where he got the drugs. These people are charged and there is no legal requirement for them to say where they got them from. Okay, it might be from some shifty character down that alley, but in many cases they are going regularly to the same place. As one politician in Western Australia said-I wish I had thought of it myself-on one occasion: if a 14-year-old kid knows where to get drugs, how come the police forces of Australia don't? Is it a fact that if you are a small dealer it does not matter? To the credit of the Western Australian state government, they have now brought in legislation-and some people very much object to it-that says they can search you on demand, with no reason given. They will mostly do that in entertainment venues. My a view is that, if you have got some amphetamine or some ice in your pocket, in the first instance, hopefully, the police will put you in a paddy wagon, take you in, lock you up and call your parents to say, ‘You had better come and get them.' The reality is that possession is not always for the purpose of sale, but it is illegal. We do not make cigarettes illegal, and some people say that might be the right thing to do. But there is that tobacco you can buy under the counter. I have forgotten what it is called but it has a name. It is smuggled into the country in large quantities, and apparently a lot of people know where to get that sort of tobacco, which of course does not carry any excise charge whatsoever. But again, obviously, governments usually get a lot more upset about people that smuggle goods that contribute to government revenue. I do not know why, when they should just be concerned with their detrimental effects on people's health and more particularly, in this day and age, young people's health. So the government have put up the price. They say they are going to spend the money on campaigns. I might add, and it is worthy of some note, that I am just not sure how this plain packaging will work or how it will comply with consumer law. Consumer law today just about covers a tin of baked beans with information-in the first instance, information that this is bad for you, in the case of cigarettes. But are people going to know other aspects of it? Are they going to be told all the things that are listed here that could be in the cigarettes, and are they entitled to know whether some brands are safer than others, if they can be? I think there are a few consumer law issues that one might want to address in that part of the legislation. Anyway, it is typical of this government: if you can tax it you should, and don't worry where the money goes thereafter. Of course, in this case, as with alcopops, they tell us they are doing it purely to save us from ourselves. I think the evidence is that in a of reasonably low increases in taxation there was the dramatic reduction of smoking mentioned and that the campaigns are of more value than the tax is a burden. (Time expired) Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (6.53 pm)-I rise to speak in support of the Excise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2010 and Customs Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2010. These bills seek to increase the excise and excise equivalent customs duty rates for tobacco by 25 per cent. The Customs Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2010 contains amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 in respect of imported tobacco products that are complementary to the amendments to the Excise Tariff Act 1921. These amendments increase the rates of customs duty for tobacco products by 25 per cent, which is the same as the increase in rates of excise duty. The increased rates of customs duty will apply to tobacco products imported from all countries, including those goods imported under any of Australia's free trade agreements. These amendments will ensure that the rates for customs duty on imported tobacco products are the same as the rates of excise duty on those goods when produced in Australia under the Excise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2010 and the Excise Tariff Proposal (No. 1) 2010. As with the amendments to the excise applying to tobacco products, the amendments to the customs tariff will also take effect from 30 April 2010. I understand this increase is not welcomed by the tobacco industry, nor is it welcomed by the many people who smoke. The government, however, does have a responsibility to do what it can to reduce Australia's smoking rates. I know that there will be those who argue that this measure will not reduce the rates of smoking, and it appears that the period member for O'Connor may be one of those people, referring to this as simply a tax grab. However, to make this statement is to do so in ignorance of the many calls from various reports and inquiries to increase the cost of tobacco as a measure to tackle the terrible consequences of this choice of lifestyle and also to ignore the evidence of the results of such price increases around the world. In supporting these bills, I do not argue, nor does the federal government, that increasing the cost of tobacco on its own will address all of the health problems associated with smoking. Those calling for action on tobacco certainly argue for a range of measures to be taken. The member for Makin has talked about the risk of smoking and second-hand smoking. These risks should not be underestimated. The worse examples I have seen in relation to smoking are pregnant women and new mothers. I was amazed when I saw pregnant women with their hospital bands on standing outside maternity hospitals on the footpath smoking. I have seen a mother with a newborn baby in a carry-pouch, with the baby facing her as she smoked and blew smoke into the baby's face. Clearly we have a long way to go in educating about the harm of cigarette smoking for unborn babies and second-hand smoke around children. One of the recent comprehensive assessments of tobacco and its effects is the national Preventative Health Taskforce report released on 30 June 2009, entitled National preventative health strategy: the roadmap for action. Chapter 3 of the report, entitled ‘Tobacco: towards world's best practice in tobacco control', outlines 11 key action areas. The report outlines the case for prevention. In support of these bills, I will read from the report. The report at page 170 states: The case for action on tobacco is clear. Since 1950, when the dangers of smoking were recognised, almost one million Australians have died because they smoked. Trends in recent years have been encouraging, but there is no room for complacency while the death toll from tobacco continues, thousands of young people each year start smoking, nonsmokers are exposed to second-hand smoke, disadvantaged groups are disproportionately affected, the overall cost of smoking to the economy is more than $30 billion each year, and tobacco companies maintain efforts to promote sales of their lethal product. Australia has been among the global leaders in tobacco control … we have the opportunity to show the way to the rest of the world in terms of what can be achieved through a comprehensive, coordinated, evidence-based, long-term strategy that is conscious of the needs of the entire community. We know what needs to be done. The strategies set out in this report are based on the best internaper tional evidence and research, together with advice from some of the world's leading experts in tobacco control. The task force in their report made reference to the international Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which was the first treaty negotiated under the auspices of the World Health Organisation. It was adopted by the World Health Assembly on 21 May 2003 and entered into force on 27 February 2005. The task force report notes that, if the comprehensive approach outlined in the strategy outlined in the report is implemented, modelling suggests that we can achieve a reduction in the prevalence of daily smoking among adult Australians aged 18 plus from 17.4 per cent in 2007 to 10 per cent or lower by 2020. I am sure that all of us in this parliament would agree that this is a target that we should all do what we can to achieve. The report, in addressing the key action areas, stated: … to accelerate declines in smoking in Australia it is essential that we step up efforts in: - Taxation policy - Public education - Legislation - Health system interventions, particularly those aimed at high-need and - High-risk groups. The report notes that increasing prices is one of the most effective measures that government can take to reduce tobacco consumption and prevalence. Analysis of changes in smoking prevalence in the largest Australian states in response to changes in various interventions found that the costliness of cigarettes has the most powerful impact of all the policies studied and that the effect of price was greatest among those on lowest incomes. In Australia taxes presently comprise 68 cent of the total cost of cigarettes. This percentage is considerably higher in other Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, countries, for example, 80 per cent in France, 78 per cent in the United Kingdom, and 76 per cent in Canada. Of 19 OECD countries listed in the report for 2003, Australia has the third-lowest taxes on cigarettes. The taskforce report recommendation action 1.1 is to: Ensure that the average price of a packet of 30 cigarettes is at least $20 (in 2008 $ terms) within three years, with equivalent increases in the price of roll-your-own and other tobacco products. Of course, the Preventative Health Taskforce report is not the only recent inquiry into the consequences of smoking and the detrimental consequences to people's health and the increasing costs to the health system of our country. The Australian government's most comprehensive review of the health system in Australia undertaken by the National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission during 2008 and 2009 also looked at the cost of chronic illness in Australia and the causes of such illnesses. The Health and Hospitals Reform Commission reported in its A healthier future for all Australians final report in June 2009 that chronic conditions affecting our health are more prevalent than ever before. Over the last century the report states that chronic disease has become more prominent than infectious disease as a cause of death, and this trend is likely to continue. Already, more than 50 per cent of GP consultations are for people with a chronic condition such as heart disease, cancer, neurological illness, mental disorders and diabetes. Expenditure on chronic disease in Australia accounts for nearly 70 per cent of total health expenditure on disease. We know that many chronic diseases are preventable. Smoking, excessive alcohol, lack of physical activity and low fruit and vegetable consumption are all risk factors which contribute to the burden of chronic disease. The report goes on to state that good health is therefore about more than health care. Governments must take action to nudge people towards health-promoting behaviour. In addition to the Preventative Health Taskforce report and the Health and Hospitals Reform Commission report, the Australian Future Tax System review also looked at the issue of tobacco taxation and concluded: There is a strong case for a substantial one-off increase in tobacco excise. Australian for cigarettes are moderate by international standards and taxes constitute a relatively small share of the retail price. It recommended a substantial increase in taxation depending upon evidence on the costs of harm from tobacco smoking, the indexing of tobacco excise to wages rather than CPI, and the removal of the duty free allowance for tobacco. The increase as a result of these bills is expected to reduce the number of smokers in Australia by two to three per cent, or by approximately 87,000 people. It is also expected to reduce the total consumption of tobacco by around six per cent. This move has been endorsed by the Australian Medical Association, the National Heart Foundation, the Cancer Council of Australia, the Australian Nursing Federation, the Public Health Association of Australia and Action on Smoking and Health among other public health groups. Tobacco related diseases are responsible for approximately 750,000 bed days in hospitals every year. Cigarettes are toxic and poisonous, containing 4,000 chemicals. Cigarettes are estimated to cause one in five of all cancer deaths. We also know that cigarettes cause heart disease and strokes, among many other chronic diseases. I was pleased to attend this year's launch by the Heart Foundation of the Go Red for Women Day at Parliament House today. This campaign is about lifting the awareness that four times more women die of heart disease each year compared to breast cancer. Smoking is one of the factors causing heart disease in women. I hope to lift awareness of this risk in heart disease when I hold my own Go Red for Women day on Friday, 11 June, at a breakfast function in my electorate of Petrie. Many local women will be attending and receiving important information about preventative measures they can retail prices take to avoid heart disease. Many organisations are working hard to lift awareness about the risk of smoking. The Rudd government is ensuring that it is playing its part to address preventative chronic diseases in Australia. I am proud to be part of a government that is tackling this important issue and introducing measures that form part of a comprehensive package against smoking, including a world first-the government will introduce legislation to ensure that cigarettes in Australia are sold in plain packaging by 1 July 2012. I support the move to plain packaging as part of the initiatives to reduce the numbers of people taking up smoking. This was also a recommendation from the Preventative Health Taskforce. Research has shown that industry branding and packaging design reduce the effectiveness of graphic health warnings on tobacco products. There are those who may seek to argue that increasing the cost of cigarettes will not reduce the number of cigarettes being smoked. The same argument was of course put up when the government sought to increase the excise on alcopops. One year ago the opposition and the distillery industry argued that an increase in the cost of alcopops would not see a reduction in the consumption of such drinks, and of course we have heard the same comments from the member for O'Connor today. Well, one year on the Bureau of Statistics figures show that Australians drank 19 million fewer standard drinks in the 2008-09 financial year compared with the previous year. This is drinks overall-not just a reduction in alcopops, as the member for O'Connor claims, but overall alcohol consumption. In relation to premixed drinks, a 30 per cent drop in consumption, equal to 440 million fewer standard drinks was recorded. This shows that the tax rise was effective in cutting binge drinking. Peter Miller a senior research fellow at Deakin University said: … for the first time in about five years we seen a real decrease in alcohol sales across board. This is incredibly good news for the federal government's alcopops tax. What this evidence shows, and what the evidence from the Preventative Health Taskforce report and the Health and Hospitals Reform Commission report shows, is that by increasing the cost of products such as alcohol and tobacco in a targeted way, and as part of a broader preventative health strategy, positive results can be achieved. Yesterday, nations across the world embraced World No Tobacco Day. The Rudd government embraced this day, with the Minister for Health and Ageing, Nicola Roxon, announcing that the government will provide $5 million to help support antismoking services around Australia. The $5 million for Quitline will help support the increased demand for services. Increased support for Quitline was a recommendation of the National Preventative Health Taskforce. The $5 million in one-off funding will be made available to: address one-off costs from this period of high demand for their services, including increased hours of access where appropriate; develop and deliver counsellor training, including specific training to help high-risk and highly disadvantaged groups quit; develop new and online quit support resources; and improve quality and national consistency across Quitline services. This funding is in addition to the Rudd government's comprehensive anti-smoking package, following the landmark COAG agreement that delivered fundamental reform to Australia's health and hospitals system. Importantly, revenues raised from this measure, and other existing revenues from tobacco, will be directly invested in better health and hospitals through the National Health and Hospitals Network. This governhave ment is committed to health and hospitals the reform across the country and a key element of that reform is a focus on preventative health. This is an area that in the past has had little recognition or investment. The Rudd government are taking action to improve preventative health through: a record $872 million investment in preventative health, including programs in schools, workplaces and community settings; $103.5 million under the National Binge Drinking Strategy; the decision to establish the Australian National Preventative Health Agency; and $449 million to improve the quality of care for Australians living with diabetes. I have mentioned the Australian National Preventative Health Agency. The bill establishing that agency was introduced in the House on 10 September 2009. I was proud to speak in support of that bill at that time and continue to support the establishment of the National Preventative Health Agency. The establishment of the ANPHA has been recommended by both the Health and Hospitals Reform Commission and the National Preventative Health Taskforce. In fact, the creation of the National Preventative Health Agency was proposed at the 2020 Summit. Unfortunately, that bill has been delayed by the opposition in the Senate since October last year, with no indication that the opposition will be changing its position any time soon. The member for Dickson, in speaking on the bills now before the House, talked about the opposition's proud history in health and, more particularly, the Leader of the Opposition's record as Minister for Health and Ageing in the Howard government. The current shadow health minister may look back at the Leader of the Opposition's record as health minister with pride, but that is not the reality. The reality is that the Leader of the Opposition ripped $1 billion out of the health system when he was health minister. Now, as Leader of the Opposition, he stands in the way of preventative health in opposing the Australian National Preventative Health Agency Bill. He has, in the past, opposed the increase in the excise on alcopops, and the government has had no indication that he will support the broader health and hospitals reform agenda that the Rudd government is putting forward. The opposition have already indicated that they support an increase in the excise of tobacco. In fact, the opposition leader referred to his support for an increase in his budget reply speech. I would like to think that their support on this bill is a positive step forward for the opposition and that they will stop opposing for the sake of opposing and get behind the government's health reform agenda, but I suspect that that is not going to be the case. I support these bills. I believe they are a positive step forward in trying to tackle the costs and the health implications of smoking in this country. I commend the bills to the House.",78
137,Mr CHESTER,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak on the Excise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2010 and related bill and to join in the broader debate about harm minimisation and prevention measures to reduce the devastating impacts that cigarettes and other tobacco products have on our community. This is significant legislation because of its social and economic impacts for the broader community. The previous speaker-before she got carried away with all the rhetoric about how life was created around about the time that Kevin Rudd came onto the planet-referred quite seriously to the fact that a million lives have been lost since the 1950s. As someone who has lost a close family member-my father passed away almost three years ago from lung cancer-this is a matter of personal significance to me. I think everyone in this place has lost a loved one to preventable diseases associated with tobacco use. Smoking is an insidious habit with a deadly outcome. Having said that, tobacco remains a legal product in Australia. Balancing that fact with the fact that people may choose to undertake activities which we know are bad for them is an issue that I think deserves further exploration and consideration in a broader national debate. In her second reading speech, the minister reflected upon the impact of tobacco on our community. The statistics are quite damning. She argued: Tobacco is perhaps the most deadly legal product available in Australia. It is the leading preventable cause of disease and premature death in Australia. In 2003 it was estimated that smoking results in approximately 15,000 Australian deaths a year. This is more deaths than murder, illegal drugs, motor vehicle accidents and alcohol combined. Tobacco related diseases are also responsible for approximately 750,000 bed days in hospitals every year. The total cost to Australian society to tobacco is estimated at $31.5 billion each year. The impact on the health sector, because of chronic disease presentation in all forms, is a major issue for our government and our community. Given the enormous cost of tobacco products to the community, it does make sense for governments at all levels to take steps to reduce the incidence of smoking. There has been some success in that regard over many, many years. Back in 1945, from the figures that I have been able to research, the male smoking rate was 72 per cent. Just think about that: almost three out of four men smoked. It was an accepted practice. It was common. It was just a normal part of growing up, to a large extent. My father was one of those who, as a young 14-year-old fellow, took up smoking. He and his brothers-of which there were many-all took up smoking in their early teens. By 2007 that figure had fallen to 21 per cent, but most of the big gains, the more dramatic drops, were made prior to the 1990s. Figures have not reduced naturally at the same rate since that time. There have been drops of about four per cent in each of the past two decades. People, I think, are resistant to change in this regard. Some people are resistant to all the messages that have been put forward in various public health campaigns and they are also, I believe, resistant to the fact that the product price has been increasing. I will touch on that a little bit later on. We may get to the stage where, no matter how much we are charging for this product, people will find a way to get their tobacco product in one form or another. Public campaigns to reduce the incidence of smoking have largely enjoyed a bipartisan approach at state and federal level over many years. I think the previous speaker referred to the fact that Australia has led the world in reducing the incidence of smoking. Some of the past government measures that have been aimed at reducing the number of smokers have included health warning labels, bans on marketing of tobacco products and bans on smoking in public places. Quite recently, even Victoria introduced a ban on smoking in cars when children are present. I am happy to say, as a former chief of staff of the Victorian Nationals, that it was a policy initiative I pushed very hard with the member for Northern Region, Damian Drum. The argument was that young children are basically captives in those cars-they have no choice about how they get themselves around-and should not be exposed to the dangers of passive smoking simply because their parents or friends have the habit. There have also been bans on smoking in public places generally and there have been graphic advertising campaigns and increases in the excises charged by governments. On this point, it was argued in the House by the Minister for Health and Ageing that the findings from the National Health Preventative Taskforce supported increasing the price of tobacco. I am not arguing with those findings. The report said: Increasing prices is one of the most effective measures that government can take to reduce tobacco consumption and prevalence. Australia's Future Tax System Review also looked at the issue of tobacco taxation and concluded: There is a strong case for a substantial one-off increase in tobacco excise. Australian retail prices for cigarettes are moderate by international standards and taxes constitute a relatively small share of the retail price. In her second reading speech, the minister went on to indicate that higher taxation makes a significant contribution to cutting smoking rates and that this has been shown to be particularly effective with young people, whom you would normally expect to have lower disposable income and would be more directly affected by an increase in price. Obviously, a key focus of any campaign to reduce the incidence of cigarette smoking is to target our young people, to target the next generation of addicts. The measures in the bill add significantly to the cost of tobacco products and will increase government revenue over the budget forecast period. The government's decision to increase the excise and the exciseequivalent customs duty rate by 25 per cent means that the increased tax on a packet of 30 cigarettes is about $2.16. This will push the price of a packet above $15. The government argues that it is part of a comprehensive package against smoking, including what it bills as a world-first decision to ensure that cigarettes in Australia are sold in plain packaging by 1 July 2012. I note the member for O'Connor raised some concerns about pending legal action from the industry and issues of consumer law. On the point of the plain packaging, the cigarette industry throughout its history has shown a remarkable resilience and capacity to evolve with the times and to get around whatever legislation it is faced with that is aimed at reducing its marketing. I am sure the clever marketers within the tobacco industry will develop some form of slip-on packet or some sort of slip-on sheath, if you like, to promote their product. You can just imagine the scenario where there will be a black-and-white packet of cigarettes for sale and you happen to get a free container to put the cigarettes in-a container which will have the brand's material splashed all over it. I am not sure whether the legislation can overcome that issue or whether the drafters of the legislation even considered that point. It seems almost self-defeating, though, if you have a black-and-white packet and the industry is out there giving away free coveralls or sheaths, if you like, to continue to brand their product to the marketplace, particularly to younger smokers who may be attracted to whatever product the industry happens to be giving away at the time. That concern aside, the issue of the excise and the revenue generated for the government is significant. The total tobacco excise in 2008-09 was $5.6 billion and it is forecast to grow to $6.3 billion by 2013-14. Even though the minister has indicated that she expects the number of smokers in Australia to fall by two or three per cent-the previous speaker referred to an estimate of 87,000 people-the revenue to the government will actually increase over that forecast period. I believe we need to keep having a broader debate about how we approach this whole issue of prevention and harm minimisation for cigarette smokers and whether we are serious about trying to reduce the actual number of smokers in the community over the longer term. As I said, the decline has been significant over the past 60 years, but the actual rate of decline has reduced in recent times. There are a few facts we need to consider from various pieces of research over the years. During my research on the bill, I found information suggesting that nearly half of smokers under the age of 30 had started smoking by the age of 15. I therefore believe it is critical that, in any public awareness campaigns we undertake, we really target young people and this myth that it is somehow cool to smoke. The great difficulty we have in that is the industry is so clever at product placement now. You see it in the movies and you see it in pop culture-it is very difficult to overcome that issue. I do not know how we are going to overcome it when there are Hollywood stars promoting an image of smoking that dates back decades and continues. The industry today has even more reason to engage in product placement and more surreptitious marketing of their products to get young people involved and to get young people hooked on their product. On that point, tobacco is regarded as being more addictive than heroin or cocaine. People become addicted out of habit or in response to stress or they are physically addicted to the nicotine. I want to touch on that point a little bit later on. Smoking is also more prevalent among lower income groups and Indigenous Australians, with the average person smoking between 100 and 120 cigarettes per week. As previous speakers have indicated, Australia has a relatively low prevalence of smoking. In comparison to the rest of the world, I think we come in third behind Sweden and Canada. The points I want to make about these facts deal specifically with the issue of addiction. We are talking about addicts a lot of the time. We are talking about people who are taking up the habit and staying in the habit over a long period of time and about the fact that smoking addiction is more prevalent among our poorer households. If you take some really rough figures and say that a smoker may smoke, say, four packets per week of 30 cigarettes each it works out to about $60 a week, which is somewhere in the vicinity of $3,000 a year and about $150,000 over a 50-year smoking career. That is a huge loss of income to a household over that period of time. I do have some degree of sympathy for addicts. As I referred to earlier, I grew up with a father that who smoked throughout his whole adult life. He had a great deal of difficulty in kicking the habit. I do have some sympathy for the people who are addicted to nicotine. For some people it is almost impossible for them to break the habit. It is reasonable to question the point of whether increasing the excise is actually well directed to reducing the incidence of smoking in the community. By its nature as a flat tax it does have a higher impact on our poorer families in the community. Obviously a higher percentage of total household income is literally going up in smoke amongst those poorer socio-economic groups as well as amongst our Indigenous community, which, as we heard previously, has a higher incidence of cigarette smoking. I understand that cynics could say that the people choose to continue smoking. It is a voluntary tax and you do not have to pay it. If you give up the habit you do not have to pay the tax anymore. For someone who has never smoked that is an easy path for me to take. But, having seen my father and other close friends in great difficulty trying to give up the habit, I have more of an appreciation that these people are addicts. If the research is even close in saying that smoking is more addictive than heroin or cocaine, this is a product which is very difficult for some people to give up even if they want to. When we are talking about people who are addicted to products like cocaine and heroin we have a whole range of supporting mechanisms in our community to assist them to get off that particular illicit substance. when it comes to cigarette smoking we seem to take a rather more blunt instrument in the sense that we just keep pumping the prices up and hoping that the smokers will drop off by the pure weight of the financial impact on their lives. I am not convinced that that is the best way to go, particularly when you look at the unintended consequences. Perhaps in some of our poorer socio-economic households you may have a mum and dad who still manage to find money for the smokes. I am not sure whether the kids in those households are getting the best and fullest opportunities to achieve the potential that they would have if their parents were not using so much of the household disposable income on cigarettes. I do understand that some of the cynics would say that they choose to continue that smoking, but I think we need to recognise how difficult it is for some people to give it up. I believe if we are determined to reduce the number of smokers we really need to look at the issue of the nicotine patches. I understand they are not on the PBS for everybody-for veterans it costs $5.40 to purchase nicotine transdermal patches that have a dispense price of $54.78. Our Indigenous and Torres Strait Islanders pay $33.30 for the same product and, as far as I am aware, other people pay the full price. Nicotine replacement therapies are regarded as one of the best ways to break the habit. I do accept that the real price increases and reductions in affordability have been regarded in the past as the most significant policy intervention to reduce tobacco consumption, particularly for young people on limited budgets. But some people, as I have referred to, simply cannot give up tobacco products and we continue to hit them harder with this excise. I am not sure when we start trying to be a little bit smarter in how we target those people, the genuine addicts, But who, no matter what price we charge, will find a way to get their cigarettes or other tobacco products. The other consideration I want to raise briefly in the time that is left to me relates to the increased cost of cigarettes and, as a result, the likelihood of an increase in illegal tobacco products. I want to refer to an article which appeared in the Age on 30 April this year by Lindsay Murdoch and Geoff Strong, which I thought was quite a good one in that it referred to the concern that perhaps an increased excise will end up, inevitably, making it more attractive for illegal tobacco products to get on the marketplace along with the consequent influence of organised crime. The article said: Sydney University professor Renee Bittoun runs Australia's only dedicated smoking cessation clinics in two of Sydney's hospitals. She believes illegal tobacco, both locally grown and imported, is widespread and could account for a quarter of all tobacco being smoked in Australia. I have no figures to back that up. I am just referring to the fact that the professor has given her opinion in that regard. The article continued: Bittoun fears that the government's increase in excise will further increase illegal tobacco's market share, doing even more damage to the lungs of those who inhale its smoke. That point is relating to the fact that health officials say that there is a dense fungal contamination found in tobacco products, usually because of the way it is cured. They believe that has a toxic response in lungs, liver, kidneys and skin and in allergies including bronchitis and asthma. This is in addition to lung cancer issues relating to the smoking of all tobacco products. It is an interesting point that the professor has raised. In the article she said: “It is not hard to grow and, given it looks spinach, might not normally attract much attention. I have been told the Tax Office loses $400 million a year in excise due to illegal crops. Given the size of government excise, chop chop is very cheap and it is often sold under the counter by weight by unscrupulous tobacconists, grocers and even service stations.” As I said, I do not have any additional research to add to that opinion but it does seem to make sense that, if you are forcing the price up of the legal product, there would then be more opportunities for illegal operations, and the value of the product is such that it will draw the attention of organised crime. The article went on to say: Indeed, a 2008 report by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police identified 105 organised crime groups involved in illicit tobacco trading. Most of the groups were also involved in either drugs or weapons smuggling, or both. According to PricewaterhouseCoopers, tobacco smuggling has been linked to organised crime in Australia, including drugs, money laundering, identity fraud and stolen car rackets. I do not seek to be alarmist or to take away from what I believe are the government's good intentions in reducing the incidence of tobacco use in the community, but I think the point is well worth considering, particularly the issue of whether the plain packet legislation will actually be effective in the community or whether it will just be subverted by the industry as it comes up with its own way of putting a cover over the top of the plain packet. I am sure that those packets can be easily manufactured and made freely available, particularly to young smokers. I also have concerns, which I have already raised, about how long we should keep on targeting people who are addicted to cigarettes through tax increases without looking at other ways to assist them if they are genuine in trying to give up. I understand that the government will be providing more funding like big for public health awareness campaigns, which is one of the few forms of taxpayer funded advertising I agree with. We see a lot of propaganda campaigns run by governments, but I believe that public health campaigns aimed at reducing the incidence of cigarette smoking would be welcome and have bipartisan support now and for many years to come. I finish on a more optimistic note. The chairman of the Preventative Health Task Force, Rob Moodie, has a different view on the issue of chop-chop use that I referred to earlier. He says: It is much easier in Australia to manage illegal tobacco than it is in … Europe, for example. He goes on to say: … policing illegal tobacco is going to have to be dealt with, but increasing the excise is likely to be a key tool to encourage smokers to give up. As I said at the outset, I think we are dealing here with a very important social and economic policy area. The impact on the community and also the impacts on the government in terms of the health budget are very significant. I thank the House for the opportunity to speak on the bill tonight.",86
138,Ms HALL,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"Thank you very much, Madam Deputy Speaker Saffin. I understand that you will be speaking after me in this debate. When somebody relieves you in the speaker's chair, I am sure you will make an outstanding contribution to the debate. I rise to support theExcise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2010. I acknowledge the fine contributions that have been made to this debate by members on both sides of this House. I understand that the opposition will be supporting this legislation and that the member for Wentworth, when he was Leader of the Opposition, was also very committed to introducing an excise on tobacco. This legislation puts into practice the ernment's announcement of an increase to the excise rate applying to tobacco, cigarettes, cigars and snuff, and the relevant excise-equivalent customs duty rates applying to the equivalent imported products by 25 per cent, applying on and from 30 April 2010. Separate notices were gazetted on 29 April 2010 to give effect to the collection of higher excise and excise-equivalent duty rates. As required by the excise and customs provision that allowed the relevant offices to publish these gazettal notices, these notices specified that it was intended to introduce tariff proposals into parliament within seven sitting days of the sitting of the House of Representatives after publication of the gazetted notices. As I said, there have been a number of fine contributions to this debate, and I think smoking is an issue that we as a society need to face. I was once a smoker myself, and I must say that I found giving up smoking to be one of the hardest things I have ever done. I appreciate how difficult it is for a person who is smoking to quit, but I have not had a cigarette now for almost 30 years. My father was a very heavy smoker and, as a result of his smoking, he got cancer had to have his voice box removed. I have many acquaintances who have smoking related problems and friends who still smoke, and I understand from their perspective how difficult it is to kick the habit and how addictive cigarette smoking is. But, no matter how we look at it, it poses an incredible risk to our health, think it is beholden on governments to look at ways that they can encourage people to stop smoking. This legislation is one tool of the many that need to be introduced by governments to address this issue. The Preventative Health Taskforce looked at smoking and highlighted in its report that gov- between 1950 and 2008-that is, almost 60 years-more than 900,000 Australians died prematurely because they smoked. That is a significant proportion of our population, and as a society we have lost many, many valuable people. Smoking is not only an enormous cost to our economy but also an enormous social cost, because every one of those 900,000 people had families, contributed through work to our society and during the stages of their illness there was a cost to our society. That really highlights the fact that we need to address the issue of smoking. The social cost of smoking exceeded $31 billion in 2005, but it is impossible to put a dollar value on the grief, suffering and loss of families. I was quite young when my father died, and I found it incredibly difficult to come to terms with it. But there was one and only one reason that he died, and that was the fact that he smoked in excess of 60 cigarettes a day. He was an educated man who knew that smoking was a health hazard, but he continued to smoke, and that is the case with many people. It is very interesting to note that the Preventative Health Taskforce looked at a number of papers. In their final recommendation they highlighted a couple of things that we as a government and a society need to do to help people move away from smoking, and at the same time they acknowledged that it was going to take quite a considerable amount of time before smoking was eradicated in our society. There are still people and I taking up smoking. I am particularly concerned about young women and the impact it has on their health. I will talk a little about that in a moment. The first issue that the Preventative Health Taskforce identified was that we needed to increase the price of tobacco products, invest more money in media campaigns and implement other policies. Increasing the price of tobacco products is seen as highly effective. People react to increases in price. It is one of many tools, but it is not the only answer because, as has been said by other speakers, if a person is truly addicted to smoking they will go without something else. It is one tool but it is an important It is a tool that needs to be taken up by government. The paper also suggested that policies and programs in combination would institutionalise the threat of tobacco. It also talked about plain packaging. The Minister for Health and Ageing has already made an announcement on plain packaging of cigarettes. It is one of many tools that need to be part of a feast of measures introduced by government to address the issue of tobacco smoking. I note that yesterday was World No Tobacco Day. As part of World No Tobacco Day, Minister Snowden has made an announcement in relation to putting in place more programs to assist Indigenous Australians to stop smoking. One program takes into account regional tobacco coordinators. There is one in the Hunter region, which is part of my electorate. There are also tobacco action workers and healthy lifestyle workers. In all, there are four workers in the Hunter, in the Newcastle-Lake Macquarie area, which most of my electorate covers. I am sure the Central Coast part of the electorate will also receive some coverage. I would like to just quickly move to an issue that I think is very important and links very closely to not smoking: Go Red for Women. This month, June, the Heart Foundation is conducting its Go Red for Women campaign. I will be organising a special forum in my electorate. I will be inviting people who live within the Shortland electorate to come along to this forum. I will have some expert speakers to talk to the women of the electorate. It is a shocking fact that heart disease is the main cause of death of women in Australia. It is killing an average of 31 women every day and yet 80 per cent of women are unaware of the fact that heart disease is such a risk to their health. I note that 11,221 Australian women died of heart disease and 2,774 women died of breast cantool. cer in 2008. That shows how many women and how many families are affected by heart disease. One of the key factors impacting on heart disease is smoking. The Heart Foundation makes the point that it is very important for women to stop smoking. In Australia 16 per cent of women who are 18 years of age and over smoke daily. One of the facts that I find quite disturbing is that young women are taking up smoking at a faster rate than young men. It increases the risk of heart attack and stroke, as well as cancer, obviously. It affects the arteries that supply blood to the heart and other parts of the body. It also reduces the amount of oxygen in a person's blood. Breathing other people's smoke, second hand smoke, is also very harmful. There have been a number of court cases that have highlighted this fact. It is also important to note that smoking is becoming a lot less socially acceptable these days. It is something that should be highlighted to women. There are a few key strategies that people can put in place. They can set a date for quitting and begin to change their habits. They have to learn how to handle stress and how to get around the urge of smoking. From my own perspective, I made a number of attempts before I was finally successful at giving up smoking. On a number of occasions I made excuses for starting to smoke again. I would say, ‘I'm stressed.' There was always a reason. There comes a time when a person needs to say, ‘This is the day I am going to stop. No more excuses, I am going to learn how to handle stress. I am going to do other things to handle those tough and stressful times'things like exercise or going outside or doing something that just breaks that urge. It is important. Do not give up. If you have one cigarette, that is not the end. Do not see that as a failure; just say, ‘Okay, I made a mistake. I'm still going to undertake a quit program.' Consider nicotine replacement products; call the Quitline. Once a person stops smoking, they find that they enjoy their food a lot more. Overall, one in seven women smoke daily, but it is more common among women aged between 20 and 49. About one in every five women in that age group are daily smokers, and it is most common amongst women aged 40 to 49. As I have said, the proportion of young female smokers has increased, but after one year of stopping smoking, the risk of disease halves compared with those who continue to smoke. Between two and six years after stopping smoking, the risk to the person is reduced even more. Smoking was the fourth largest contributor to the burden of disease amongst females, responsible for six per cent of the total burden of disease in Australia in 2003. I think these are startling ures. I think they speak for themselves. During the month of June, during the Go Red for Women campaign, we need to consider these facts. We need to consider that by stopping smoking you immediately reduce the impact that it has on your health. The longer you refrain from smoking, the better it is for you. As I was saying before, two to six years after stopping smoking, the risk to your health is the same as that for a nonsmoker. I commend this legislation to the House. I see it as part of a package of measures that is needed to reduce smoking in our community. I see that the Minister for Health and Ageing is in the chamber, and I know that she is committed to reducing the number of people who smoke in Australia. I note that she has a particular interest in young women and would be very supportive of the Go Red for Women campaign and the women with heart disease coalition. I commend the legislation to the House.",91
139,Ms SAFFIN,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"I rise in strong support of the Excise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2010 and a cognate bill, and I want to thank the Minister for Health and Ageing for having the policy will to introduce such a measure because, yes, while we are talking about excise and customs bills, we are also talking about health. Health is the issue. And the health issue-the good health of all-has to prevail over all other considerations in this debate. I am pleased to see that people are accepting that. When this legislation was first announced at the end of April there was a straw poll done in my local area. I came out in strong support of it immediately because of my long concern for the health impacts of smoking, and there was broad support in the community. Some people say that it can impact on those who are the poorest most severely, and I will turn to that in a minute, but just on the health issue: in the minister for health's secfigond reading speech she focused on a number of issues, and there is one that I just want to quickly reiterate-that is, smoking results in approximately 15,000 Australian deaths a year. That is just unbelievable. We talk about road accidents, we talk about other areas where one death is too many, but 15,000! And we still tolerate that people smoke. We understand it is an addiction and we understand that it has to be dealt with as such, but it is a health issue. When we were doing the straw poll in my electorate of Page, I was asked if I believed in banning it. I said banning rarely works; we just have to make it so unpalatable and so difficult that people cannot do it. We know that prohibition did not work with alcohol and it does not seem to work with other drugs either. The minister also put some other figures on the record. I have had a background in health over the years, locally in particular, but also broadly-I was on the New South Wales Cancer Council-and I want to mention here Professor Simon Chapman and Dr Arthur Chesterfield-Evans, two people who are very proactive in trying to get smoking stopped in Australia. I just wanted to mention and commend their efforts. I have thought quite a deal about something else the minister said-that smoking is responsible for approximately 750,000 bed days in hospital every year. That is a lot of bed days; that is a lot of bed numbers. We are having a debate right across Australia about health reform. People want changes; they want things to be different. Can you imagine: if we had no-one smoking in Australia, there would be 750,000 bed days available for other people with other illnesses. We can imagine what that would do for our health and we can imagine what that would do for the budget. I understand the total cost to the Australian society of tobacco is estimated at $31.5 billion each year. That is unbelievable. I know it is not just the 25 per cent excise that is being struck in this; there are a whole range of other measures that go, for example, to plain packaging and to internet advertising, and there is money being injected into hard-hitting anti-smoking campaigns-$27.8 million, as I understand it. On 31 May it was World No Tobacco Day, and that is the day on which the minister announced the $5 million that would go into Quitline. A lot of people in my electorate do want to quit, and they need help. My office manager quit two years ago-she knew I was going to say this, so it is all right!-and good on her. She smoked for a long time, and she smoked a lot. A lot of people here have talked about smoking. When I grew up it was normalwe did not know it was bad for us; we did not have that information. My mother smoked; everybody smoked-we all did; it was seen as normal. We now know the problems it causes, and with that knowledge we have to make changes. The point I made at the beginning of my contribution is the point I want to finish on. It is frequently said, and I am often asked about this by journalists, that these measures will impact most on the poor. Like a lot of decisions, things can impact on the poor and we all have to be mindful of that. But this is a situation that we do have to change. We do not strike the excises and tariffs in a differential way-that is not how we do excise in Australia. What I can say is that people on low incomes and beneficiaries on government pensions and benefits have been helped in other ways, particularly over the past three years. The Australian government has reduced the tax burden on working Australians, and someone who gets $20,000 a year will have received a tax cut of $750 per year over the three years 2007-08 to 2010-11. If we go up the scale, someone on $30,000 will have received a cut of $750; $40,000, $1,800; $50,000, $1,750; $60,000, $1,350; and $80,000, $1,550. It is to the lower end of that earning scale that I am addressing these remarks. A raft of other measures have been introduced, such as the Paid Parental Leave scheme that is coming, the education tax refund and changes to the pension. The pension has been increase by $100 a fortnight for singles and $76 for couples, and there is also the abolition of Work Choices and other measures. The government has introduced a range of measures over the last three years that have put more money into the pockets of people, and particularly those people at the lower end of the earning scale. I thought it was important to inject that into the discussion tonight. In summing up, I strongly support these two bills being debated cognately. I support the health initiative of the 25 per cent increase in excise, and all the other measures that go with it. I support the fact that we are directing a lot of it to our young as well, and particularly to young girls so that it can be totally not cool to smoke. At the moment it can be seen as cool to smoke, and we have to make it uncool. Some of those hard-hitting as certainly make it uncool. There is enormous pressure to smoke. With those comments I commend these bills to the House, and I also thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, for taking the chair and enabling me to contribute to this debate.",94
140,Ms ROXON,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"in reply-I thank the member for Page and other members who have contributed to this debate on theExcise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2010 and the cognate bill. One thing is for sure-there is very broad support within this House as well as in the community for our taking this step and doing all we can to reduce smoking in the community. It is interesting, when you consider the last two contributions, to note the changing world and the success we have had in Australia in being able to discourage people from smoking. People tell their stories about how all of their friends smoked when they were young, and those of us of different generations, some of us even younger than me, have had an entirely different experience. That is a tribute the work that has gone before us, but in a way it strengthens our argument that we need to take these next steps to ensure that we can reduce tobacco consumption even further. As I have already outlined in the House, on 30 April 2010 the excise on tobacco was increased by 25 per cent as part of our government's anti-smoking reform package. Since that time, the Australian Taxation Office and the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service have been collecting excise and excise-equivalent customs duties at the higher rate, and the legislation we have been debating today will formally confirm that higher rate. Of course, that needs to be passed by the Senate. While the opposition have indicated that they will support this legislation, they have suggested that it represents a tax grab and is not a public health measure. They say this despite the fact that this was a key recommendation of the Preventative Health Taskforce, and they say it despite the fact that this has been endorsed by bodies such as the Cancer Council Australia, the Australian Medical Association, the Australian Nursing Federation, the Heart Foundation and the International Union Against Cancer. And they say it despite the fact that every year in Australia over 15,000 Australians die from smoking related illnesses, and smoking is estimated to cause one in five of all cancer deaths. I am pleased that, despite this criticism, we do now have the opposition on the record as being willing to ‘not oppose' this legislation and to allow this important measure to proceed. Given how enthusiastically the legislation has been received in the broader community and the very clear public health outcomes, it is a shame that the opposition has had to be dragged kicking and screaming to this outcome. I think it is a shame that perhaps some of the members of the opposition were not carefully listening when these to announcements were made, because I have seen, from some contributions including the shadow minister's, that they have been calling for this money to be dedicated to health. We have already agreed to, and committed to, this money being dedicated to health. In fact, we have gone way beyond that. The Prime Minister, in his announcement, made clear that not only the increase in excise on tobacco but the entire amount of excise which is collected from tobacco is dedicated to health through the National Health and Hospitals Network Fund. The sad truth is we spend a lot more than that already on health because of the high demands on our system and because of the growing and ageing population. So I can make clear that those commitments have already been made. We do believe in making sure that you have the public health benefit of dissuading thousands of Australians from taking up this habit or of encouraging many to give up this habit. Also we can actually ensure that the sufferers of tobacco related diseases, who do require approximately 750,000 bed days of treatment in our hospitals every year, can get treatment. All this helps the sustainability of the health system. I also want to add very briefly for the House's benefit that when I introduced this bill into the House it preceded World No Tobacco Day, something that the member for Page, who is now in the chair, mentioned. That was yesterday and I used the occasion yesterday to announce another anti-tobacco measure, that the government will provide $5 million to help support Quitline services around Australia. Since the increase in the tobacco excise, there has been an increased demand for Quitline services. I think that has been proving our case that an increase in price does encourage people to give up. That is a good sign. We have had some reports that in some instances Quitline calls have doubled for a period of time. Whilst that is a very good sign about the number of people using this as an opportunity to kick what is a lethal habit, it has put some pressure on Quitline services. This extra funding will assist Quitline to provide their invaluable service, being there for people when they want to quite smoking. Of course, this was one of the other recommendations from the National Preventative Health Taskforce. It means that we have a comprehensive response to the problem of tobacco smoking in Australia. I urge members to consider this as an opportunity to pass that message on even more broadly. I think some of those remaining few of my colleagues who smoke might be getting a little bit sick of me reminding them of this fact. But, as one of the other speakers in the House mentioned, smoking is a risk factor. Today we launched a report from the National Heart Foundation of Australia and the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare about the risks of cardiovascular disease to women, a disease previously known very much in the community as a disease of men, perhaps older men in particular. This report shows that it is a very large killer of women as well. One of the biggest risk factors is still smoking. We know we can decrease the burden of many illnesses in this country if we can persuade people not to take up this dangerous and lethal habit, and we hope that our package of measures will help encourage people to do that. I thank members for their valuable contributions to the debate. I thank the opposition for supporting these measures and I urge the House to support this bill and the cognate bill to deliver major preventative health reform in Australia. I hope that I can have the opposition's support for all this to be treated expeditiously in the Senate. I commend this bill and the other one to the House. Question agreed to.

143,Mr DUTTON,AUTHORITY AND PRIVATE HEALTH,"I should place on the record clarification in relation to some of the comments made by the Minister for Health and Ageing in her summing up of the last debate. She completely misrepresented what I had to say as part of that debate. It is a clear method of operation of this minister to try to misrepresent, but I will let others draw their own clusions. The key amendments in the Health Legislation Amendment (Australian Community Pharmacy Authority and Private Health Insurance) Bill 2010 are the result of the agreed negotiations arising from the Fifth Community Pharmacy Agreement between the Minister for Health and Ageing and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia. The bill proposes amendments to the National Health Act 1953 relating to these arrangements for approving pharmacists to supply pharmaceutical benefits subsidised by the Commonwealth. It is intended that the Fifth Community Pharmacy Agreement will commence on 1 July 2010 and expire on 30 June 2015. The National Health Act 1953 currently gives effect to the pharmacy location rules and the operation of the Australian Community Pharmacy Authority only until 30 June 2010, the expiry date of the existing Fourth Community Pharmacy Agreement. These amendments are required to extend the location rules and the operation of the ACPA for the term of the fifth agreement, to end on 30 June 2015. In so doing, they enable the implementation of the Fifth Community Pharmacy Agreement, signed on 3 May this year. Pharmacy services are a key component of primary health care. They are important to all Australians, for there would be few who would not enter a pharmacy at some time every year to have a script filled or as a first point of call for advice on minor injuries or ailments. This Fifth Community Pharmacy Agreement will provide spending of more than $15.4 billion over the next five years for delivery of pharmaceuticals and pharmacy services to the Australian community while providing around $1 billion of savings on forecast spending, according to the government. The expenditure will go to more than 5,000 community pharmacies across the con- country to dispense PBS medicines and provide other professional services and to meet the community service obligation arrangements with pharmaceutical wholesalers to ensure timely delivery of pharmaceutical products to those pharmacies and, in turn, to the consumer. Medicare Australia's latest annual report showed that almost 200 million prescriptions were filled in Australia in the 2008-09 financial year-almost 10 for every man, woman and child, a six per cent increase on the previous year and a figure that is sure to continue rising over the years of the Fifth Community Pharmacy Agreement. It shows the integral role community pharmacy plays in the nation's healthcare system. It is one of the foundations of the system. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme could not operate without it. The Fifth Community Pharmacy Agreement does not differ greatly from past agreements put in place by the coalition, which shows that the Rudd government realises the efficacy of those past arrangements. Key features of previous agreements have been retained, in particular the retention of the community pharmacy location rules and the prohibition on a community pharmacy being co-located in a supermarket as well as continuation of the wholesaler community service obligation payments. The coalition introduced the location rules in a past agreement to ensure provision of widespread community access to pharmaceutical services. They were later amended to prohibit co-location of pharmacies in supermarkets to maintain that access. The coalition supports free market principles, and we want to see competition in the pharmacy sector, but we recognise that the supply of pharmaceuticals which include dangerous drugs is very different from the retailing of other products. Retailing is about maximising sales and that is not the culture that suits the supply of pharmaceuticals, which should be provided on a needs basis, professionally supervised and professionally monitored. So, as a government, we were prepared to take the decisions that would keep pharmacy apart from the big supermarkets and their retail chains. We did not then, and do not now, believe that replacing focused, often family oriented, businesses with departments of major retail chains would be an improvement on existing arrangements. Delivery of effective, efficient and professional pharmacy services to consumers through a unique community pharmacy model are arrangements that have served Australians well. They are the pedestal on which community pharmacy rests and are necessary to maintain a system that remains among the very best in the world. In negotiating past agreements, the coalition has sought savings from the Commonwealth, but it has also been prepared to introduce other measures to boost community pharmacy and the quality of service it provides to consumers and to ensure the provision of those services across our geographically dispersed nation. The third agreement covering the period 2000-05 introduced the location rules but, importantly, it included incentives for the pharmacy networks in rural and remote areas to continue to provide quality services and to expand services. It also provided further recognition of the wider and growing role of the pharmacy sector in the provision of health care. The fourth agreement in 2005 established the community service obligation funding pool to ensure that it was commercially viable for pharmaceutical wholesalers to supply the full range of PBS medicines to pharmacies across Australia regardless of location. It also funded a continuation of a greater role for pharmacists to deliver new programs to improve health outcomes in the community in areas such as asthma, diabetes and communicable diseases, and it provided funding for improved access to community pharmacy services for Indigenous Australians. In the main the Fifth Community Pharmacy Agreement recently signed by the Minister for Health and Ageing continues to build upon those core measures. There are two further matters regarding the fifth CPA that I will comment briefly upon tonight. Under the fourth CPA a review of the location rules, among other matters, was carried out. I note that the results of that review are due to be provided to the government and to a consultative committee established under the new agreement in the very near future. As the agreement says, these are ‘complex issues with significant impact on community pharmacy'. Care will be needed in dealing with them. Secondly, there is one change in this agreement that has drawn criticism, and that is a move to allow pharmacists to dispense some medicines without a doctor's prescription. The coalition notes the agreement allows for such dispensing only under specific circumstances such as a patient not being able to get to their tor to obtain a timely prescription renewal. The coalition has been informed that further details surrounding this change are yet to be finalised and that appropriate consultations with all stakeholders are still to take place. is also understood that these changes will require legislative change at a state level and therefore will provide an opportunity for further scrutiny. The coalition will not oppose the amendment which will bring the Fifth Community Pharmacy Agreement into operation. It is worth noting, though, that this health minister does not have a proud legislative track record. Her record in bringing health before this parliament is particularly poor, as is this government's record in actually achieving results with its promises in health like fixing hospitals by mid-last year and having more than a score of so-called GP superclinics opened around the country by next month. Where are we at? The Prime Minister now says he has a plan for hospitals, but he said he had one at the last election. He has promised at the forthcoming election to achieve with that plan what he promised at the last election-that it will fix hospitals, although the word ‘fix' of course has dropped off his website. No-one will know until some undetermined date in the future exactly when that fix will come, but we know that Mr Rudd's fix-the one he said that he would complete in 2009-will not be completed now until at least 2020. And what a fix it is: a noodle nation plan of federal and state bureaucracies with money churning around between them before at some point it gets offloaded to a local hospital network where-and I stress this-local clinicians are explicitly barred from serving on governing councils, another broken promise from Mr Rudd who says this plan is all about federal funding and local management. Mr Rudd told doctors and nurses they doc- would have a say under his plan in the running of local hospital networks, yet clause A10-b-ii on page 14 of the National Health and Hospitals Network agreement signed with the states clearly says that clinical exIt pertise on network-governing councils should be external to the particular network. Our health system is a massive, complex, $100-billion-a-year enterprise, and Kevin Rudd-the Prime Minister who could not even oversee a program to put pink batts into ceilings for free-is going to fix it! I very much doubt that. The Prime Minister's plan has disaster written all over it. What of that other big health promise-to deliver superclinics around the country? There are not many of them, and those that do exist are not all that super. After 2½ years in office, just three are open and considered to be fully operational-three out of a promised 31. What a track record this health minister has! Can anyone really believe that this government, this health minister, will deliver the 59 of these clinics now being promised? Mr Rudd and Minister Roxon are good at making promises; they just cannot keep them. They cannot deliver on their promises. They promised they were not going to change private health insurance. The Prime Minister put it in writing before the last elecduced tion. But that promise meant nothing. The government tried, twice, to cut rebates to those who choose to take out insurance, to take responsibility for their healthcare costs. The government's determination to press on and introduce a means test on the rebates remains. There were commitments not to change the Medicare safety net. Those commitments were dumped in a series of callous attacks on patients: a decision to slash Medicare rebates for cataract surgery in half, ing elderly Australians to abandon treatment or pay hundreds of dollars more for it; a decision to drastically cut rebates for macular degeneration treatment, which left some sufferers with the frightening alternative of blindness; and a decision to cap safety net support for IVF and, likewise, for many obstetric services. The health minister was forced to back down from most of those illthought-through attempts to claw back costs at the expense of patients. And now this government want Australians to trust them to spend billions of dollars to ‘reform' health. is a so-called ‘reform' that even the states baulked at until Mr Rudd bought their support with billions of extra dollars. For all that, Victorian Premier John Brumby assessed that under Mr Rudd's reforms there would be ‘no big changes'. I turn to the other matter in this bill, amending the Private Health Insurance Act 2007 in relation to the Lifetime Health Cover provisions of that act. The bill amends the legislation to ensure it is consistent for all new migrants to Australia. It removes an anomaly that allowed some migrants extended periods of time-unavailable to Australian citizens and most migrants-before the Lifetime Health Cover provisions applied to them. The change will make the Lifetime Health Cover provisions consistent for all. The Lifetime Health Cover provisions were part of several measures the coalition introto strengthen private health after it had been trashed by the Keating Labor government. When the Keating government was thrown from office private health insurance levels had fallen to a calamitous 30 per cent of the population. The introduction of the Medicare levy surcharge for higher income earners who did not take out private health insurance, 30 per cent rebates for those who did take responsibility for their health care by taking out private insurance cover and the forclifetime cover provisions, which encourage people to join and maintain health insurance, have seen health insurance coverage levels rise to around 45 per cent of the population. Around 11 million Australians now insure themselves and, in doing so, relieve pressure on our overstretched public hospitals. Since the Rudd government came to power these important pillars of the health system have been under attack-none more so than the rebates for private health insurance. As I said earlier, this minister and her government appear determined to attack the It rebates. Their attacks are ideologically driven with no thought for the consequences. We have warned that the consequences of those attacks, should they succeed, will be serious-a departure from insurance and more people seeking treatment in the public hospital system, with all the attendant problems that will cause. We remain steadfast in our opposition to the government's attempts to change the rebates for private health insurance. That said, the coalition does not oppose this bill.",98
144,Ms HALL,AUTHORITY AND PRIVATE HEALTH,"I start my contribution to this debate on the Health Legislation Amendment (Australian Community Pharmacy Authority and Private Health Insurance) Bill 2010 by saying that I believe that the Minister for Health and Ageing can and will deliver on health reform and the remaining GP superclinics. I have a lot more confidence in the minister than I would ever have in the shadow minister. He says one thing in parliament and one thing in his electorate. We cannot believe anything members of the opposition say. History will judge the current Minister for Health and Ageing as one of the best, if not the best, health ministers Australia has ever had. Her impact in the area of health has been outstanding, and I know, from travelling around my electorate, that my constituents in Shortland really appreciate what she has done. If it were not for the minister for health, the people of Belmont would not have their Medicare office. It was her commitment to the people of Shortland electorate that delivered that Medicare office. I find it quite amazing when I sit here in parliament and listen to the contributions of those on the other side of the House. It was particularly amazing to listen to the contribution of the then health minister, now Leader of the Opposition, when he ripped a billion dollars out of health. He gave these rolled gold, rock-solid, ironclad guarantees that he would deliver on health, but all he did was take money out of health and weaken our health service. He has made another commitment to the Australian people to take another billion dollars out of health if the sition are elected at the election later this year. I urge people to be very sceptical of what the shadow minister for health and the Leader of the Opposition have to say, because we all know what a great risk they pose to Australia. Mr Coulton-Madam Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. Could I ask the member for Shortland to come back to the matter at hand.",101
145,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,AUTHORITY AND PRIVATE HEALTH,Would the honourable member for Shortland please proceed. There is no point of order. It is a wide-ranging debate and it was directed to health.,102
146,Ms HALL,AUTHORITY AND PRIVATE HEALTH,"Thank you very much, Madam Deputy Speaker. It is really interesting to see the member jump up on a point of order against me, yet he was quite prepared to let the previous speaker make a very, very wide-ranging contribution to this debate. I rise to support the Health Legislation Amendment (Australian Community Pharmacy Authority and Private Health Insurance) Bill 2010 today. The purpose of the bill is to arrange the approval of pharmacies to supply pharmaceutical benefits to the community beyond June 2010. I have to say that the process involved in reaching the agreement was a lot smoother than it was in reaching the agreement on the previous occasion. That was the occasion when the Leader of the Opposition's friend, the then CEO of Woolworths, Roger Corbett, was lobbying very strongly to allow pharmacies to operate in supermarkets. I think it was really touch and go whether or not that happened. It was only after the lobbying of many people that a sensible position was reached and the agreement was finally signed. If my memory serves me correctly, there was actually a delay in the signing of the agreement because of the procrastination of the then Minister for oppoHealth and Ageing, who just happens to be the Leader of the Opposition, who just happens to be the person who tells the Australian people to only believe what he says if is written in front of him. He is such a risk to this country. If he were ever to become Prime Minister, I hate to think what would happen. The other aspect of this legislation deals with Lifetime Health Cover and non-Australian citizens. I think this change to the legislation brings clarity. I know that it has caused confusion for a number of people. I have particularly been dealing with a constituent in my electorate who found that they had a problem relating to the fact that they did not quite understand the legislation. As such, they found themselves disadvantaged. So this is quite non-controversial legislation which should pass through this parliament without too much trouble, and it is legislation that I am sure both sides of the House will support. I will finish by saying: whatever we do, remember the Leader of the Opposition was once the health minister. He ripped $1 billion out of the health system and he would rip another $1 billion out of the health system were he to be elected Prime Minister. I say to the Australian people: he far too big a risk-one we cannot afford to take.",102
147,Ms ROXON,AUTHORITY AND PRIVATE HEALTH,"in reply-I thank the members for their contributions to this debate on the Health Legislation Amendment (Australian Community Pharmacy Authority and Private Health Insurance) Bill 2010. I think it would be fair to say that both sides of the House seem to have taken the opportunity to have a fairly broadranging debate. I must say I found the member for Shortland's contribution a little more heart-warming than the opposition's! However, it is good to know that the member for Dickson can support legislation like this, because I think everyone in this place does appreciate the vital role that community pharmacists play. The agreement that is reflected in this legislation is a $15 billion agreement. It is a big Commonwealth investment, and it is an investment to ensure that the community can get the medicines they need and to make sure that pharmacists are available across the country and in fact continue to be very well distributed across the country. This legislation provides for two things. It makes sure that the Community Pharmacy Authority and the pharmacy location rules continue for the term of the fifth Community Pharmacy Agreement, until 30 June 2015. As I mentioned in my introductory comments, the amendments are the result of agreed negotiations with the Pharmacy Guild and the Australian government. There are also some minor amendments to the Private Health Insurance Act 2007 that were necessary to correct technical errors in the existing provisions relating to Lifetime Health Cover and new arrivals and ensure that the policy is applied fairly and consistently. This is a good piece of legislation; it is important. Unlike the assertions made by the is opposition that we have a poor legislative record, we in fact have a very strong legislative record. It is true that the coalition in the Senate has opposed many reform initiatives, but despite that we have been able to introduce expansive reforms, ones that are benefiting the community-and I look forward to the time when the member for Dickson provides a contribution after having actually visited the superclinic in his electorate. I know the member for Parkes, who is in the chamber, will be very pleased when his is open. He tells me he will happily stand next to me in a photo when that happens, because it is something that his community campaigned heavily for. We look forward to doing that. I commend this bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading",103

149,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being approximately 8.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Hume Electorate: Gunning Public School",103
150,Mr SCHULTZ,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to speak on the ongoing Building the Education Revolution and, in particular, inconsistencies regarding the costings in the construction of school halls and libraries. Gunning is a small town in the Hume electorate with a population of around 480, and the Gunning Public School has 56 students. The P&C association contacted me in late April, wanting to alert me to the problems that they have experienced with the whole process involved with the BER program. In February-March of 2009 the Gunning Public School were given a short time frame of only days to nominate their project for BER funding. In consultation with the then staff and the P&C executive, Gunning Public School applied for a new library and the conversion of the back of their existing library into an open-plan office block and sick bay area. For decades the situation has been that any child in the sick bay was stuck out the back of an old administrative building, unsupervised. The only person who is able to check on children in the sick bay is an admin officer who answers the school telephones, but to check on the sick bay the admin officer has to leave her room and walk down a corridor into the sick bay room. When the plans for the school's new library and admin block were scoped the school was told that the budget of $850,000 would not build a library and convert the office. The office conversion was then descoped and the school was told they would only be receiving a new library. Whilst the school is not complaining about receiving a new library, which was greatly needed, the members of the P&C, who class themselves as a group of financially responsible parents and citizens, are just asking, ‘Why is the library costing so much money?' At the heart of the P&C's confusion is why a single, seven metre by 11 metre new library building is costing taxpayers $850,000 or approximately $11,000 per square metre. Gunning P&C are a very active and resourceful parents group and are constantly conducting fundraising activities to improve facilities for their children at the school. Between 2005 and 2009 many of them worked on a project to raise funds for, and eventually build, a new long day care centre in Gunning, which I opened last year. The total cost for the construction of this building, which far exceeds the size and scope of the single library at Gunning Public School, was less than $500,000. The P&C have a unique school fundraiser that they conduct annually and which has been going strong for 13 years. Parents and children all go out in the middle of winter to the numerous shearing sheds in the Gunning area and scrape out sheep poo from under the sheds, bag it and sell it as garden fertiliser. This very successful fundraising initiative is called Gunning Gold. The parents and students of Gunning Public School are about to embark on this annual fundraiser. The money raised from this hard earned fundraising event is very wisely spent on necessary school projects. I will be outside tomorrow morning joining representatives of the Gunning Public School at the protest rally that has been organised to highlight the growing number of rorts and inconsistencies that are being exposed in the BER program in relation to the blatant waste of taxpayer money. I will stand alongside not only Gunning Public School but all those other schools in attendance and call on Minister Gillard to implement an independent investigation into how and why this program is costing taxpayers so much money. In closing, I say this: in the words of the president of Gunning Public School's P&C, $850,000 is a hell of a lot of sheep poo! Education Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (8.33 pm)-I certainly welcome a discussion on the Building the Education Revolution program and the Rudd government's commitment to an education revolution. That is what I wish to speak about tonight. This government, when coming into office, made a commitment to invest in education in this country, at a level that this country has never seen. We are investing in the Digital Education Revolution, the Trade Training Centres Program, the Building the Education Revolution, the Smarter Schools National Partnerships, the national curriculum, more transparency through the My School website and the Local Schools Working Together Program. These are all fantastic initiatives that schools in my electorate are embracing. I do not intend to go through all of those in detail this evening. I wish to take the House specifically to one of those elements, and that is the computers in schools program. This is a program that has been embraced fully by the secondary schools across my electorate. I was disappointed to read today an article by the LNP candidate in Petrie, Dean Teasdale, who said that the schools in Petrie have been failed. He said that a new computer had been promised for every student from years 9 to 12 but that ‘new figures released today'-not saying where those figures came from-'show that in the federal seat of Petrie, Kevin Rudd has broken his promise, with only 1,407 of the computers actually installed in schools, out of 5,586 student entitled to receive one'. I am amused by this article because the candidate says that we have failed to deliver but he then goes on in the next paragraph to say, ‘This program has one year to go.' He acknowledged that the program was still ongoing, so how can he claim that the program has failed to deliver when the time frames are still in place and there is progress in this area? What I can say is that in relation to the schools in Petrie we have delivered computers to secondary schools in rounds 1 and 2. In fact, the schools in Petrie have already reached a two to one ratio of students to computers. This means that the government has already provided funding for 2,136 computers in Petrie schools, and the next round of funding will take this ratio to one to one. I would like the LNP candidate for Petrie to come out and say to Grace Lutheran College, Mueller College, Australian Trade College North Brisbane, St John Fisher College, Southern Cross Catholic College, Clontarf Beach State High School, Redcliffe State High School, Aspley State High School, Redcliffe Special School, Aspley Special School, Woody Point Special School, Bracken Ridge State High School, Deception Bay Flexible Learning Centre, Deception Bay State High School, North Lakes State College and the Lakes College at North Lakes that under an Abbott government those computers will not be delivered. In fact, the whole system is going to be scrapped. Not only will computers in schools be scrapped but also trade training centres will be scrapped. A whole range of education programs will be scrapped, including the Smarter Schools teacher quality program and the Productivity Places Program. A whole range of programs will be scratched under an Abbott government, because they seem incapable of running programs and bringing a budget back to surplus. They are saying it is too hard and they cannot do it. They can work on a surplus but they cannot work on delivering programs and a surplus. But this government can deliver the programs that it has committed to. It will deliver the computers to these schools in my electorate. I say to the LNP candidate for Petrie, Dean Teasdale, who is out there on his website proudly saying he went to Grace Lutheran College: go talk to Grace Lutheran College. They were the first school that wrote to me saying how fantastic this program is in delivering these computers to schools and what a successful program it has been. They said that they are extremely pleased with the overall outcome of the rollout. They are very excited and proud of the work done by the team at Grace and of the difference it has made to their students' learning. Can I suggest that the LNP candidate stop writing articles and get out and talk to the schools in Petrie and he will find out that the parents and the schools are very pleased with this program and do not want it scrapped. Home Insulation Program",104
151,Mr WOOD,ADJOURNMENT,"La Trobe) (8.38 pm)Jacqui and Alex Qureitem have been trying to get help from the government to fix their roof insulation problem since February this year. Getting nowhere with helplines, Jacqui and Alex approached my office on 3 March with a letter, part of which I will read out: I've been trying to get help or even some information to ease our mind. As you know, since Mr Rudd has announced the free insulation we have been bombarded by people knocking at our door and even ringing us all the time. On the 14 January, two men knocked at our door and insisted that we have to do it because the house is about 15 years old and it is free and the government will pay for it. I wish I didn't listen to them and agree to It was a big, big mistake. On Saturday the 16th January they arrive about 11 a.m. to do the work. No mask, no proper clothing, no gloves. I had to give them some disposable gloves so they can work. I am very worried about the work they have done especially regarding the down light covers. We are scared to put the lights on. We are using table lamps to light the house. We rang the man in charge of the company-no answers. We rang 1800 808 571(the hotline) and we were referred to 131792. We need someone to come and inspect the work so we can relax and make sure everything is safe. Please help us because no one is listening or telling us anything and they don't know what we are supposed to do. We just need someone to come and check the work that's all; please .. please. We are very grateful that at least you are listening and trying to help us. Regards, Alex QUREITEM I made representations to the Minister Assisting the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, Greg Combet, on the couple's behalf. At this point, I must also thank Neil Mitchell for giving Jacqui the chance to speak on his show, and I believe this helped very much towards an inspection of the couple's house being arranged on Tuesday, 23 March. An inspector confirmed that the house is a fire risk-and I have that inspection notice with me. The department then engaged the same company to fix the problem that did the initial job. Jackie and Alex were extremely nervous that the same company was sent to remedy the job that was botched in the first place. My office was advised by the department that there was nothing it could do about it. We were assured by the government that this was the only way to go forward. Two men arrived on Saturday, 27 March to fix the installation-27 days after Jacqui and Alex had approached my office. The men went up into the roof to fix some of the do it. covers. Jacqui and Alex were anxious. When light bulbs fell on the ground and were breaking on the floor in the family room, Alex asked them to leave because he was afraid that they did not know what they were doing. Eventually, having no other choice, Jacqui and Alex agreed to let the company back in. The company returned to fix the roof in early to mid April. The government thought this was sufficient. It is apparently not normal procedure to get a second inspection. Most houses will get only one inspection. But we kept on the government's back to get an independent assessment of the job that was supposed to fix the roof. Through representations again to Minister Combet's office, we finally got another inspection done on Monday, 24 May. Lo and behold, you wouldn't believe it but it came back againthe house is still a fire risk. This puts a question mark over the way the government is handling this matter. What about all the other houses around the country? Are they safe or do they just think they are safe? Do they all need second inspections too? How many houses have been fixed by the original installers? The other thing is that this family has been living in a house with a fire risk since February. The government has known about the family's predicament, but the government's own procedures have failed this family. We still do not have a result. The house sits as much as a fire risk now as it was nearly four months ago. I expect the government to resolve this problem for this family in my electorate on 10 June, as it has organised for another independent inspection-this time to actually fix the problems at the house. A full investigation must be initiated. It is tragic that four people have lost their lives and that there have been 146 house fires, 1,500 electrified roofs and 240,000 dodgy insulations across the country. My electorate of La Trobe is no exception, and the way this program is being managed and implemented is a disgrace. I feel sorry for all those people living in fear, waiting and wondering whether their house will catch fire. I urge the government to make sure a second inspection is carried out of all houses. Building the Education Revolution Program",106
152,Ms BURKE,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to do something outrageous tonight: to highlight the great work taking place under the Building the Education Revolution Program. I say outrageous because, from what you would read in the paper, nothing good is happening out there. However, this is not what we are finding on the ground. Overall, great this program has supported the construction industry and is improving infrastructure at all our schools. Overall, the BER program has been a tremendous success for schools and communities across Australia. However it would be easy to assume the program has been a rorted failure based on the way it has been misrepresented in much of the conservative media. News Limited, in particular the Australian, is running an extremely one-sided campaign against this program. They are deploying unprecedented resources to nit pick and find examples to suit their own agenda. In doing so they are completely neglecting many of the real stories out there on the school grounds. The vast majority of school principals and school communities are happy with the government's investment. I, like all the members in the chamber, have been all to my schools and all of them are exceptionally happy. The recent ANAO report highlighted this fact with the following statement: Overall, there are some positive early indicators that the program is making progress toward achieving its intended outcomes. Lead economic indicators, including construction approvals, show that the introduction of BER P21 contributed to a reversal in the decline in non-residential construction activity that resulted from the global financial crisis. Education industry stakeholders, including peak bodies, Education Authorities and a substantial majority of school principals have also been positive about the improvement in primary school facilities that will result from the program. Recently I visited Essex Heights Primary School, one of my great local schools undergoing a massive transformation as a result of the BER and the Victorian government's Building Futures program. The Essex Heights community-staff, parents and students-are absolutely thrilled with their BER project, a multipurpose facility. Essex Heights is a school that has been crying out for investment for many years and they are delighted that the federal government has stepped into fund their new hall, which will benefit students, staff and the community well into the future. They also got a double whammy, getting $6 million in the state budget to rebuild the entire school-and, can I tell you, it needs to be done. The school's principal invited the Australian along to join with senior staff, the parent's association, and the project's builders for a tour of their under-construction hall. Sadly, the Australian showed no interest in taking up this offer to come and visit a good news story about the BER project. But the rest of us were there, and we had a great time. During my visit I spoke with senior personnel from the construction company working on this project. They are a very large firm and are involved in over 25 BER constructions. They are very supportive of the program and the essential stimulus that it has provided in their sector of the economy. Critically for the company, the stimulus came at a time when private capital was withdrawing from development and construction activity. As a direct result of this program, they have created over 800 new jobs across Australia to handle their increased workload. Many of those jobs are apprentices. This is an apt example of the massive benefits that this program is delivering to the construction industry. Even more importantly, the program is leaving behind vital infrastructure in our schools that will be enjoyed for many years to come. It was an absolute delight to stand in the middle of this big empty building to see the joy on the PE teacher's face. He had not been inside, and he was working out where his basketball court was finally going to be. It was a delight to see all the parents, too. These are the stories overlooked by the Australian, which seem content with assessing the overall merits of the program on the basis of a number of isolated examples-and confecting many of those. On Sunday, I opened my first BER program at St Mary Magdalene's Catholic School in Chadstone, another school delighted with the outcome of their program. The irrelevant and inapplicable comparisons made between BER projects and commercial fit-outs or private dwellings do little to support the case that the Australian is running. As the ANAO report states: In many cases, concerns from principals and community members about value-for-money relate to a misunderstanding of the building standards Education Authorities are expected to adhere to in building education infrastructure. The fact is that the ANAO audit found that the BER program had delivered good value for money. The benefits to our school communities, to our children's education and to the construction industry as a result of the BER program are unequivocal. The communities in my electorate are all very excited about the projects that we are going to be leaving behind for them. Transport Infrastructure",107
153,Mr HAWKE,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to speak on the issue of transport infrastructure in my electorate of Mitchell. It is timely that I raise this matter here tonight in the House, because 2010 was the year that the long-promised north-west rail line for North West Sydney was to commence. Service was to commence in this month, according to the first initial state government ise in 1998. I do not need to remind the House that this promise has been cancelled, re-promised, cancelled and re-promised almost uncannily in sync with every state election. Now we have a timetable that has the completion of the north-west rail link in 2024. Tonight I want in particular to raise the proposal of Mr Ron Christie. He has written an independent report that calls for an independent agency, Transport for Sydney, to be modelled on the successful Transport for London. It is important that the government, and particularly Infrastructure Australia, take note of this. With the worse government in New South Wales history, people in Sydney and New South Wales have completely lost faith in the ability of government to deliver infrastructure in key parts of our state. My electorate of Mitchell has the highest rate of car ownership in Australia. That is because of the lack of transport options. It has the second highest proportion of couples with dependent children of any electorate in the country. It was one of the fastest growing corridors in Sydney. It still remains a very fast growth corridor. No government is proposing to put in any transportation options until 2024. This has led to citizens, independent bodies, newspapers-including the Sydney Morning Herald and the Hill Shire Timesand other agencies, such as the Hill Shire Council, to form their own group, called the Build It Now Coalition. What this represents is a new thrust in New South Wales because government has failed in its job and in its fundamental responsibility. What we see in the Build It Now Coalition is a response to the abject and utter despair of the average citizen in New South Wales because the government will not deliver what it promisesespecially in transport infrastructure. Of all promthe submissions that were put to the independent inquiry by Mr Ron Christie-more than 500 submissions-over 24 per cent were on this issue of the north-west rail line. About a quarter of all submissions to this independent body were on the single item of the north-west rail link. It is a vital and key piece of infrastructure for Sydney. I want to note that in successive federal budgets since the election of this government and the formation of Infrastructure Australia there has been very little funding of any nature for infrastructure in Sydney. The much vaunted, much claimed and much talked about need to raise taxes, to raise capital and to invest in infrastructure has no application to every single resident of Sydney in every single seat in Sydney because there simply is no infrastructure funding for Sydney. In last year's budget we saw a meagre $40 million for a study for a western metro line from the city to Parramatta, which was to go right through the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government's electorate, uncannily. But the incompetence of the New South Wales government knows no bounds, and that project has been cancelled as well. So the money had to be returned to the Commonwealth. The money provided in last year's budget for a study for a western metro line through the minister for infrastructure's own electorate had to be returned to the Commonwealth by the New South Wales state government. And of course we all know of the absolute and utter failure of the New South Wales government to put a credible submission for infrastructure funding to the federal government in the first year of Infrastructure Australia. Here is a great new body of the federal government to deliver infrastructure in Australia-money on the table-but the New South Wales government fails to put even a credible submission together for any of that infrastructure money for Sydney. I praise the work of the Build It Now lition. The north-west rail link was supposed to open this year. We have a timetable from the Build It Now coalition which says that we can complete this by 2017. I urge the New South Wales government to do so, to get on with the job, to put proper applications into the federal government and to seek all available funding to get this vital piece of transport infrastructure built for the delivered. residents of Sydney, north-west Sydney and my electorate of Mitchell. Economy",108
154,Mr HALE,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight in this adjournment debate to update the House and the people of Solomon on the projects that were committed to before the first election and on how they are going. I have no doubt that the centrepiece of the program that I committed to when I put my hand up to be the member for Solomon was the cancer care unit. It is good to be able to say in this place that the Alan Walker Cancer Care Unit is completed. The first patients began to be treated in April, which is fantastic. The centre now provides a service where people do not have to go interstate; they can actually get cancer treatment in the Northern Territory and in Darwin, which is significant. It was a $28 million commitment delivered by the Rudd Labor government through the hard work of the Prime Minister as well as the Minister for Health and Ageing, Nicola Roxon. On Saturday I had a great deal of pleasure in opening the first stage of Tiger Brennan Drive. It is a $110 million commitment-$74 million from the Commonwealth and $36 million from the Northern Territory government. This will ease the traffic congestion in the morning from Palmerston into the city and vice versa, giving people time to get home earlier and spend time with their families. We have also opened up more of a coa- seamless access through to our East Arm Port facilities, which will quicken access for semitrailers. The second stage-the southern bridge-will be opened in June and the northern bridge in July, with completion of the project in November. This was a project that drew blame for both the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory government for a long time, and it is on track to be The GP superclinic at Palmerston is a fantastic project. Palmerston has long suffered with inadequate medical services in that area-a rural area-and now has a $10 million commitment from the minister, which was made previous to the last election. The roof is now on. People would be aware that during the wet season we do have problems with building, but the roof is on now. It is being fitted out and we are looking at an August opening. We have been running the after-hours service throughout the night in a facility nearby and have had some 28 representations, on average, each night. That saves people driving into Darwin to go to Darwin Hospital. It has been a fantastic thing for the community and I look forward to opening that with the minister and hopefully the Prime Minister in the near future. Other projects are in law and order. We committed $2 million towards CCTV cameras in the CBD in the Casuarina area as well as in the Palmerston area, and I am happy to say that they have been rolled out and are now in operation. When you take on politics you want to make a difference; we all say that. I am happy to be able to stand here tonight and talk about these projects. They were probably the four biggest commitments that we made. In addition to that, as we have gone along we have been very well looked after by the stimulus package-185 houses for Defence, which was fantastic. That kept our tradies working, kept our apprentices in jobs and kept infrastructure rolling along during the global financial crisis. I have a very good announcement to make on Friday with regard to social housing. That is something that as a government we cop criticism about from time to time from those opposite and from the media. We can be very proud of Tanya Plibersek as our Minister for Housing-the first ever-and the job that she has done, especially in that housing affordability and social housing space. I think that is significant. What are the threats to what we do? I would ask my opponent, as all my colleagues are asking their opponents going forward: what programs are you going to cut? We have fought for a long time to have our doctors trained in the Northern Territory and now have a $30 million commitment. The building has started, but I have real reservations that if Tony Abbott becomes Prime Minister we are going to lose that. I need to know: is my opponent going to come out and stand up for the Northern Territory, or is she going to back down to Tony Abbott? One of the great programs that we ran during the global financial crisis was the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program. I know that my lord mayors in Darwin and Palmerston are really worried that the money they received and are going to receive into the future from the Rudd Labor government is in jeopardy. I know where the comments by the shadow finance minister point. When you start to use words like ‘discontinued', that makes me very nervous as a Territorian and as the member for Solomon. We have also committed $50 million to the expansion of port Darwin. Do we lose that? We need to know; she needs to come out and tell us if she is going to stand up for the Territory.

155,Mr COULTON,ADJOURNMENT,"In the final two minutes of this adjournment debate I would like to comment on the remarks from the member for Chisholm and the member for Petrie, who were standing up in here singing the praises of the BER. The member for Chisholm had the audacity to say that this was some sort of orchestrated campaign by the Australian newspaper. I would suggest that all the members of this House step onto the lawn in front of Parliament House tomorrow morning at nine o'clock and speak to some people who are coming from all over Australia and who have real concerns about the blatant waste of money under this BER program. Tomorrow there will be a mock-up of the canteen that is being constructed at Tottenham Central School. I ask all the members of this House and the public in general to decide for themselves: is that good value at $610,000? It is a canteen that will not fit a fridge, will not fit a pie warmer and does not even have enough room for the staff to operate in and serve the children. This canteen is exactly the same one that was delivered to Toomelah Public School in northern New South Wales in my electorate for $650,000. This is a town that had its CDEP program discontinued in June. It has massive unemployment, huge social problems and high levels of mental health issues. Since the CDEP program was discontinued there have been nine attempted suicides. So I ask all members of the House to come out and speak to the people tomorrow.",111

The Labor government would no doubt make below these levels. We are very fortunate that Howard government for over 10 years. But the control is by year after year of discipline, year to GDP ratios in Australia from 1997 to 2007. Following that it was 1.6 per cent, two per 2001 to minus 0.1 per cent, but then it was cent, 1.5 per cent and 1.6 per cent-every one decade of fiscal discipline. It is because of that today. But that discipline has been shredded third year of exceptionally high deficits, and left the station. It is now projected to peak show discipline after this year.

Budget Paper No. 1 makes very instructive to have a look at what another we often look to, the UK. In 1997, at the time to GDP ratio in the UK was 43 per cent.

That is a roll of honour, a decade that we are as well positioned as we are under the Rudd government. We are now in their the debt is starting to mount. The debt train has at $94 billion, and that is only if the government told, ‘We're not quite ready to be disciplined going to get better.' I do not believe them. The people do not believe them.
