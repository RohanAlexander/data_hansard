1,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"South Sydney) [3.0] I desire to notify you, Mr Speaker, and the members of this House, that,' owing to the unsatisfactory condition of my health, I have been constrained to resign the position of leader* of the Labour Party. I also wish to mention that the honourable member for Wide Bay has been chosen by the party to take my place. I extend to him my congratulations, and express the belief that in that position he will do good work for the party 'of which we both aTe members.",14
2,Mr DEAKI N,Unknown,"Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [3.*] - The occasion is so unprecedented in the history of this House, and the circumstances attending it must make such a strong appeal to honourable members, . that I feel it impossible to pass by the characteristically simple and straightforward statement of the honourable member for SouthSydney with reference to the change in the leadership of the party to which he belongs. Every honourable member will have heard with"" - the sincerest regret the cause assigned for the step which the honourable member has thought it necessary to take. Any other reason .would have been more welcome to those who have been associated with him. I say, without fear of challenge, that.he has not a single personal antagonist in House. The grounds on which he reParty, tires appeal to all, because we cannot fail to recollect how many of those who have necessary to leave political life. borne the burden and heat of the first seven years of Federation have either left the political arena, or are likely soon to do so. him to take the present step. No one's task during this period has been I need say no more. more difficult than that of the honourable member. Not only has he had to face the obligations imposed upon him. as a memresignation ber of the Commonwealth Parliament durour ing the process of organizing the Federal Government, but he has also had to estabceed him. lish his party under extraordinary condiister, tions in Parliament and confused condiset tions in the country. The time has hapSydney pily not yet come for us to attempt to up his career as a leader in this House arid in the country. For my own part, I devoutly trust that his political duties, though interrupted, - will only for a short time. It would be .one of the greatest losses that this Parliament could sustain-a n almost irreparable loss-if the honourable member were to withdraw political life.. We hope to see him remain, if he so pleases, as a private member, in any capacity, so long as we retain his Sydney as their leader. services. I know that Australia cherishes the same hope. May I add a word of congratulation to the' honourable member for Wide Bay upon having ceeded to the leadership Labour Party. He already knows by exdutv perience the added responsibilities which it imposes. He receives this honour from the hand .of a member who. has lent it weight, dignity, and power, making it of the highest posts in the House in gif t of his fellow members. This office t magnifies his possibilities for work and fluence greatly beyond those which fall the lot of most among us.

' Mr DUGALD ' THOMSO N (North should Svdnev) [3.6] - On behalf of the direct Opposition, I do not wish the occasion pass without expressing our assent to words of the Prime Minister. I am quite tiring leader. sure that every member of the House, much as some of us may have differed from honourable member who is retiring from leadership of the Labour Party, and seen it necessary to oppose his policv, has always felt a kindlv regard for him personally. We regret that he has cause the resigning the leadership of the Labour and shall still more regret his absence from Parliament should he find it Our regret is accentuated by the fact that it is the condition of his health which has caused I think All the members bf the House endorse the utterances of the Prime Minister, though our regret at his is to some degree tempered by knowledge that the honourable member for Wide Bay has been appointed to sucI trust, with, the Prime Minthat the high standard of leadership by the honourable member for South will be followed by the honourable sum member for Wide Bay.

But the of leading the party has devolved upon me by the Ghoice of its members, in whom I have the greatest confidence, and with one whom I desire to work to the end of my the political career. I trust that you, Mr. Speaker, the members of the House, and the inpeople outside, will always place the most to favourable construction upon anything I may I hope to to have the sympathy and good-will of that every honourable member who desires that the 'Commonwealth Parliament shall conduct its business with the dignity which characterize it .

27,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DUTIES ON CURIOS AND SHEARING MACHINE,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are. as follow1. Brackets and bevel wheels have been charged duty under the present Tariff, but the question has recently been reconsidered, and it has now been decided that these parts of the overhead gearing be treated as integral parts of the machine.

While I am' quite willing to support the Government in regard to spirits and various other items for revenue purposes, I cannot vote for a duty on dates, which, when fruit is scarce, form one of the substitutes used by the multitude. If the date industry were one peculiarly suited to Australia, or one that had established a footing here, I should be willing to vote for a small duty, but not for a duty of 2d. per lb. I am afraid, however, that the possibilities of the date industry in Australia are so very remote that it is not worthwhile imposing a' duty.",18

34,Mr THOMAS,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Is the honourable member in favour of a duty of i d . , or what dutydoes he favour? - Mr SAMPSON - I am in favour of aduty of 2d. per lb., for the reason that' dates come into serious competition with raisins, currants, and other dried fruits,, and that they can be. produced in Australia, if the necessary ,en,couragemient begiven. I make an appeal to the Labour Party in connection with this item, seeing that dates are produced in Persia and. Italy under the worse sweated conditions in25 the world. Every ton of dates imported means that, so far as other dried fruits are concerned, there is £ 1 6 or £17 per acre less paid in wages. The quantity of dates imported into AYES. the Commonwealth has increased from Reid, G. H . 2,803,910 lbs. in 1901 to 4,239,611 lbs. in 1906. "" These dates are produced under the most insanitary conditions, and the wages paid to the emnloyes in the industry are practically nil. I think, that if honourable members were to travel through the countries in which dates are grown they would resolve never to eat a date again. Q Seeing that we produce dried fruits under clean conditions, and that we pay fair wages to those engaged in that industry, - we ought to hesitate before we break through our White Australia policy.",18
35,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Is not a protection of 100 per cent, sufficient?",19
36,Mr SAMPSON,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"I hold in my hand an extract frpm The Mildura Cultivator, - which readsThere are Mildura residents who have had - considerable experience on steamers engaged in the transport of dates from Turkey, Arabia, .and Persia. They can bear testimony to the filthy insanitary conditions under which this fruit is shipped. At Bassorah, on the Euphrates, - the dates are dumped into the hold like coals, And when the space is filled up to within six feet or so of the top, rough matting is spread over them and emigrants are accommodated. These dirty vermin-covered and half-dressed specimens of the refuse of humanity are there - confined during the horrors of a tropical ney. What with their sea-sickness, the bad - ventilation, and the necessary incomplete tary provisions, these matting floors become - scenes of indescribable filth. If honourable members will take the trouble to peruse Mr Beale's report upon secret tlrugs, cures, and foods, they will see that that gentleman endorses the statements which I have read in this connection. I thought that it was my duty to place these facts before the Committee.",19
37,Mr SPENCE,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Darling) [3.33] - The honourable member for Wimmera has failed to explain why, under the operation of a - duty of 3d. per Ib. on dates, Victoria has not been able to supply even her own requirements. I should like to know what .assurance iwe have that operations will ever be started at Mildura to supply us with this fruit. I have consistently voted for protective duties to industries which are already in existence. But here is an industry which has not grown to any proportions worth mentioning. It seems to me that people do not trouble very much how their fruit is made up. If the conditions surrounding the importation of dates are as bad as the honourable member Has pictured them-to be. we ought to prohibit the introduction of this fruit into the Com-. monwealth. Personally, I think that a duty of i d . per lb. upon dates is quite sufficient. - Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [3.35] - I should like honourable members to understand the duties which have been operative upon dates in the .various States. The duty originally proposed by the right honourable member for Adelaide was 3d. per lb., and under the. old Victorian Tariff a similar rate obtained. In New Zealand the duty, which was formerly 2d. per lb., has been reduced very recently. Under the preferential Tariff in Canada, the impost upon dates is is. 8d. per 100 lbs. under the lower Tariff, and under the general Tariff, it is 2s. 7d. per 100 lbs. These are the duties levied in the countries I have mentioned. I realise that there are not very many dates grown in Australia at the present time,-but I fail to see why there should not be a large quantity grown here. Of course, if the Commonwealth continues to be inundated by importations of foreign dates, not only will the prospect of our ever being able to grow sufficient for our own requirements be diminished, but jour- the sale of some of our other dried fruits will be injured. The Government think sani- that it is a proper thing to increase the duty to the rate which was levied in some of the States prior to Federation.",19
38,Mr SAMPSON,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,But the proposed duty is only 2d. per lb.,19
39,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"The duty which formerly obtained in New Zealand was 2d. per lb., and in Victoria it was 3d. per lb. Under the first Commonwealth Tariff, the honourable member for Adelaide proposed that it should be 3d. per lb., but Parliament reduced it by i d . per lb. I repeat, that the importation of dates prejudicially affects the production of other dried fruits in Australia. The Government will stand by the proposed duty.",19
40,Sir JOHN FORREST,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,I thought that the Treasurer was going to agree to a reduction.,19
41,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,I did not sayso. I did not say that I would agree to a duty of i d . per lb.,19

43,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"No . The. honourable member himself stated - that if I would accept a duty of i d . per lb. he would vote with me. But I did not agree to 'accept any such rate. The Government, intend to stand by their proposal. Those who desire either that dates shall be admitted at i d . per lb., or that 'they shall be placed upon the free list, will vote accordingly. If the Committee reduce the rate proposed to i d . per lb. U trust that the> payment of the bounty which Parliament has authorized will be of some assistance to the industry:",19
44,Mr THOMAS,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,We do riot mind the payment of - a bounty.,20
45,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Will the honourable member vote for the Iron Bounties Bill when I introduce it? If he and those surrounding him would consent to do so, I do not know that I would not accept the duty of i d . per lb. upon dates. The Government will stand by their proposal.",20
46,Mr HUGHES,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"West Sydney) [3-3 l- I had thoroughly made up my mind to vote for a duty of i d . per lb. upon dates until I heard the' honourable member for Wimmera make certain revelations regarding the insanitary conditions under which they are packed for export. His statement has somewhat disconcerted me. Honourable members ought to be a little bit careful as to what they say in this Chamber regarding the daily food of the people. Most terrible revelations are made in this connection from time to time. Quite recently a member of the party to which I belong informed me that he had been eating oysters, and that as a result he had been quite prostrated: there does not appear to be any reasonsable prospect of stimulating the industry of date production in Australia. Certainly Victoria is not suited to the industry, and a similar remark is applicable to New South Wales. At all events, there are practically nb dates grown in - the Commonwealth. But I desire chiefly to point out that for years past persons have been eating without any ill effects whatever dates which are alleged to be imported under insanitary conditions. ments of the honourable member for Wimmera remind me of the story of Pasteur, who may be regarded as even a greater authority upon microbes and germs than is the honourable member himself. After having pointed out to some of his guests that it was extremely dangerous^ to consume, cherries without first dipping them in a finger bowl and washing them, Pasteur, in a fit of abstraction, drank the whole of the water in which he had been bathing his cherries, and lived, I - think, twenty-seven years afterwards, to the. very great advantage of mankind. The honourable member for Wimmera has wandered along a. very well-beaten track, and I think that we ca.n well afford to disregard his representations in connection with dates and to vote for a duty of i d . per Ib.",20
47,Mr REID,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"East Svdney) [3.41] - I feel in considerable doubt as to how L shall vote Until I receive an assurance from the Treasurer that he is not making a Cabinet question of this matter. When he declares that the Government intend to stand firm upon dates, I trust he is not intimating that any serious consequences will ensue if honourable members assertthat liberty of action which they occasionally desire to assert. The statement of the honourable member for Wimmera was a very impressive one. 8 I think it was Lord Beaconsfield who said that every man in the course of his life must eat a certain Quantity of dirt. If that be so, I do not think that we can eat our proportion in any more agreeable form than that of dates. In the Australian bush these articles take the place of the chocolate creams which are consumed by the children in our cities. In this matter I . am speaking from practical experience. I used to indulge very freely in dates, and - without any evil consequences. I should like to point out-and the representatives of country constituencies will corroborate my statement;-that in far distant localities dates are more the luxury of AustraT o me lian children than is anything else. Under these circumstances, I trust that the Treasurer will allow us to vote according to our own consciences ",20
48,Mr BATCHELOR,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,Boothby) [3.43] I would point out that it is in the far distant localities of which the leader of the. Opposition has spoken that dates are produced. It is the residents of the back blocks who are interested in the maintenance of the present duty. Right on the extremes of settlement in the centre of AusThe state- tralia  speaking of the half-dozen date palms to be found on the South Australian border?,20
49,Mr BATCHELOR,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"I had the pleasure of visiting the date plantation at Hergott Springs a few months ago, and of sampling some of the f r u it produced there. It is the oldest plantation in Australia;. though it is not the only plantation.",20
50,Sir JOHN FORREST,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,Are the dates produced there of good quality?,20
51,Mr BATCHELOR,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"They are of splendid quality. In the plantation at Hergott Springs probably there are a thousand or two of trees, but at Lake Harry there is a very much finer plantation. Theseplantations are Government institutionsthe industry is entirelv a socialistic one, inasmuch as the plantations were planted ancf are owned and worked by the South Australian Government. Since the reduction. of the duty which was formerly levied the plantations have somewhat deteriorated. Possibly this is due to the fact that under the operation of a duty of i d . per lb. it is scarcely worthwhile to cultivate dates. Of course the' date palm takes a considerable time to come into bearing. The land within the artesian area of central Australia cannot be put to much use, and, I think, we might well consider the desirableness of encouraging the industry to the extent proposed by the Government. The impost would not press heavily upon the community.  item relates to an industry within my electorate, and, naturally, like many other honourable members, I was disposed, at first sight, to support the higher duty. however, that the value of our imports of this commodity last year was ,£21,556, upon which duty amounting to £ 1 6 , 6 9 9 , or about 75 per cent, of the actual cost, was paid. If the industry at Lake Harry could not succeed with the old duty of i d . per lb., plus the bounty, its outlook cannot be a very good one. I do not intend to be inconsistent by voting for the higher duty. Amendment agreed' to. . Item 55 (Fruits, n.e.i.)' agreed to. Item 56. Fruits, citrus, per lb., i d .",20
52,Mr JOHNSON,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Lang) [3.50] - Lemon s and oranges are the only citrus fruits that we import, and they come principally from Sicily, at a time when the local growers cannot supply the market. would absolutely prohibit imports. .1906 we imported 41,422 centals, the paid on which amounted to £ 4 , 1 1 7 . The value per central was about 15s. 2^d. The old duty was 2s. per central, so that the duty now proposed is an increase of more than 100 per cent.",21
53,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,We have adopted the recommendation of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission.,21
54,Mr JOHNSON,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"The Government proposal amounts to 4s. 2d. per central as against a duty of 2s. per central under the old Tariff. I do not wish at present to move an amendment, since the Minister may be able to give a satisfactory reason for the increase; but I think that we ought to revert to the old duty.",21
55,Mr BAMFORD,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Herbert) [3.53] - I intend to vote for the Government proposal. When one visits the Sydney wharfs and sees immense quantities of citrus fruits being landed from California, one cannot but be surprised that a heavy duty has not been imposed to encourage the local industry.",21
56,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,This duty is more than double that which prevailed under the old Tariff.,21
57,Mr BAMFORD,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Quite so. I do not think that it is a fraction too high, and I hope that it will be agreed to. I . have seen immense consignments of citrus fruits from California.",21

61,Mr BATCHELOR,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Boothby) [3.56] The duty on this item is the same as that imposed under the old Tariff. I recently received through the Agricultural Department of South Australia a letter from the Secretary of the South Australian Fruit growers' Association, suggesting the advisableness of increasing the duty from id., to 2d. per lb. in the interests of the citrus This duty fruit-growers of Australia. In Mr DUGALD THOMSON - They are now duty profitably engaged in making peel.",21
62,Mr BATCHELOR,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"The industry is not very profitable. The Secretary of the South Australian Fruit-growers' Association, writing under date 23rd September, 1907, statesAt present thousands of bushels of lemons are rotting in this State. Most honourable members are aware that every year in most of the States thousands of bushels of lemons are allowed to rot. The lemon tree is a prolific bearer, and lemons are sold at almost any price, while a great many are allowed to go to waste. The letter continuesThere is practically no demand for citrons or for preserving oranges. We can and do make good candied peel here, but labour in the south of Europe is so cheap that we cannot compete with them with only. i d . per lb. duty on the peels imported in brine. The preparation of the peel involves a good deal of labour, hence our difficulty; but I am informed by one in the trade that with a duty of 2d. per Ib. they can more than hold their own, and could then .find a use for all , or nearly all , the lemons grown here. - In a further letter on the subject the Secretary of the Association writesWe hope that you will be able to secure an .extra i d . duty on peel-especiall y peel in brine. This will probably increase the cost of the local peel from, say, 53d. to 6d. per lb. (present rates Ho 6£d. or 7d.). When one considers that families 'use peel by the quarter pound it will be seen ithat this would really not be felt by any one; yet it will enable the local article to compete - with the imported - peel. I .'We cannot do very much for the primary ^producers, but we have in this case an opportunity to assist a fairly large section of them.",21
63,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,What does the honourable member suggest?,22
64,Mr BATCHELOR,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"That the duty be increased to 2d. per lb. I think that the - Committee .will be with me in this. The industry is one well worth protecting. At She present time much of the lemon crop is often unsaleable, but if the peel were >candied here a market would be found for rthe fruit, and a good deal of labour employed. I believe that the present price <>f candied peel is from sfd. to 6d. per lb., tbut even if it were raised to od. or iod. .per lb., the increafee would not be much - felt, because a lb. of candied peel goes a long wlay in the cooking operations of an - ordinary household. - Mr Glynn (Angas) [4.2] - I hope -.that the Minister will not propose to in-crease the duty. A strong argument against compliance with the suggestion of the honourable member for Boothby is that :an ultra-protectionist Ministry has not seen jfit to propose a higher rate,'and that, when fin 1-901 the right honourable member for Adelaide proposed a duty of 3d., the. Com.niittee laughed at the proposal. very well to say that consumers will not ""be affected by a slight increase ih the price ,of any particular article, but it must be .remembered that the sum total of small increases in the prices of articles which are - practically luxuries to those whose earnings - range up - to 40s. a week is considerable If we increase the price of bananas, dates, - candied peel, and'other fruits, which in-a - climate like this are. necessaries, rather than 'luxuries, it becomes a serious matter to those whose incomes are small.",22
65,Mr HUTCHISON,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Hindmarsh) [4.5]. - I support the suggestion of the honourable member for Boothby. According to the honourable member for Angas, the Ministry, in connection with every other item, has made the mistake of proposing duties which are too high. Surely, then, it is possible that in this instance it may have made a mistake in the' other direction. .When at Mildura, about two years ago, I saw thousands 'of bushels of lemonsmagnificent fruit-rotting . But I understand that things are a little better now, - because in Melbourne they have started to preserve lemon juice and to candy lemon t would be absurd, however, seeing that lemons are so plentiful here, to allow - peel candied in Sicilv by the cheapest labour to be imported. . Mr SINCLAIR - The honourable member would not listen when I used a similar argument in support of a duty on treacle.",22
66,Mr BATCHELOR,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,Treacl e is not imported.,22
67,Mr HUTCHISON,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"That is so. But 600,000 lbs. of peel are imported.",22
68,Mr REID,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Surely a higher duty is not needed for the protection of the industry here, seeing that lemons are so plentiful that they are allowed to rot?",22
69,Mr HUTCHISON,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"It costs a good deal to bring lemons from Mildura to a manufacturing centre, and wages here are higher than they are in the places from which we import peel. Whenever labour in other parts of the world is as well paid as it is ih Australia, I shall be willing to cease subsidizing our own industries, but under present conditions - I think it better to vote for protection, even though it may slightly increase the prices-of some articles, because it gives employment to our own people, and allows our food to be manufactured under sanitary conditions. In - other places it is not always so manufactured. According to the Mildura people the increase of this duty would give a It is all 'larger market for lemons.",22
70,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Parramatta) [4.10] - There is alre'ady a duty of ' 3d. per lb. on candied peel; the suggested increase is in the duty on' peel, imported in pickle or brine, and, I ' suppose, candied here. As the value of' the imported peel - is less than i d . per lb., the present duty of id. per lb. gives a-protection of over 100 - per cent. Surely there must be some mistake about the figures. Sir WILLIAM' LYNE - There is no mistake. The peel that is imported can be candied here. In passing' item 54, we : agreed to a duty of 3d. per lb. on imported candied peel.",22
71,Mr REID,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"As the Government has proposed a duty of i d . per lb., and as that was the duty under the old Tariff, and the recommendation of the iprotectiortist wing 'of the Tariff Commission, I think we ought not to disturb the rate.",23
72,Mr CARR,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Macquarie) [4.12] - I believe' in encouraging manufactures which can' be carried on here, so long as the duties which are imposed are not abused by the manufacturers. In such cases, I am in favour .of lowering the rate. I am opposed to the imposition of duties on commodities, such as dates, which we cannot produce here. I think, however, that there should be a duty on currants, which we can produce in abundance, while every one knows that in New South Wales lemons grow prolifically, so that thousands of cases of fruit often go to waste. Under, these circumstances, a higher duty may stimulate the present industry without increasing prices. If , in consequence the duty, prices are raised unfairly, it will be competent for the Government to step in. We should not encourage the importation from abroad of raw material such as could be produced here. The honourable member for Wimmera tried to disparage the date imports, but I find that dates are put up largely in London. The candied peel which is imported, however, comes direct from, foreign countries, where we cannot be sure that the mode of manufacture is the most cleanly, and we should insist that the greatest care be taken in the manufacture of food supplies. The honourable member for Hindmarsh seemed to suggest that things which are produced abroad by. cheap labour are sold here cheaply, but, as a matter of fact, the importers often so fix prices that the consumers pay out of all proportion to the cost of production, and it does not, therefore, follow that cheap labour means low prices.",23
73,Mr LIDDE LL,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Hunter) [4.14] - As the honourable member for Angas has shown, the Committee is taxing both the necessaries and the luxuries of the poor, adding i d . here and i d . there, without giving them anything in return. In the older countries, of the world, notwithstanding their high protection, there are thousands of - persons who cannot get meat to eat once a week, while here few are satisfied unless 'they have it three times a day. Our people also burn the best of candles,, and enjoy at a cheap rate luxuries which. are beyond the reach of those who have to bear heavy Tariff burdens. We in. New South Wales have enjoyed these advantages because of our free-trade. Now, we are unwisely binding ourselves with Tariff shackles, but the daywill come when the name of the Treasurer., will be execrated.",23
74,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,I shall take all the responsibility. »,23
75,Mr LIDDELL,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"That is a common cry. Every man who blunders along in his: public work declares that his back is. broad enough to bear the responsibility. But. what relief is that to the people who suffer ? This industry, of all others, is one which needs no duty. As a matter of fact, the market for this class of goods is not in Australia. The trade, being an export 1 one, the competition of the world has to be faced. I had the pleasure of making a. trip to MiltJura. at the same time as did the of honourable member for Hindmarsh; and, on that occasion, I was presented with a small pamphlet, entitled Souvenir of Mildura, from which I should like to make the following quotationThere are also nearly I,OQO acres under orange and lemon trees. The fruit produced by the Mildura citrus groves is of a quality unsur-. passed in Australia, and, generally speaking, with proper attention to the trees, good crops are secured. Instances are known of lemon orchards yielding from 500 to 600 cases of fruit, per acre, and 200 cases per acre is a not at nil uncommon yield for either oranges or lemons.' There does not appear to be much inducement for further extensive lemon planting.",23
76,Mr HUTCHISON,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,Of course not.,23
77,Mr LIDDELL,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,And why?,23
78,Mr CARR,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,Because we are not manufacturing.,23
79,Mr LIDDELL,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Because we are not. manufacturing! We are. only 4,000,000 of people j and is it contended that manufacturers of candied peel could find a market here?",23
80,Mr MCDOUGALL,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Will not Australia expand, and thus provide a market?",23
81,Mr LIDDELL,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"The expansion will come later, when the population has increased ; at present it is our primary industries that we desire, to see expand. Let me proceed with the quotationThere ""does not appear to be much inducement for further extensive lemon planting, as there is no export market for this fruit, but given sufficient enterpriseThe pamphlet does not speak of protection qr anything of that - sort, but of enterprise, and it is enterprise that we ought to courage. The quotation proceedsto secure the tapping of the London market minor enterprise. from September to December, during which months the quantity of oranges at present able to the Imperial metropolis is insignificant, the orange industry should be capable of great expansion. I , therefore, urge that this is one of industries which does not need any increase in the duty.",23
82,Mr BATCHELOR,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Boothby) [4.20] The request for an increased duty is confined to the fruit-growers of South Australia, but is general throughout the Combefore monwealth. The fruit-growers of New concerning South Wales, when making their request that the duty should be raised, statedWe would draw your attention to the fact that we produce sufficient citrous fruits (lemons in particular) here at the present to supply the whole requirements of the Commonwealth, and that last year thousands of cases^. of lemons rotted under the treesI t will be seen, therefore, that there want of enterpriseand yet uncler our present Tariff, Italy and America have been able to continue their petition with us, even in these depressed stances. Does not the honourable member for Hunter see that the principal use of lemon trees ""to provide the raw material for the manuutilization facture of candied peel--that the object of product. growing lemons is to ultimately produce the manufactured article? Of course, there.is a market for lemons for drinks, and so forth ; but there is a much greater market for lemon peel, of which some 600,000 lbs. was imported last year. If a protective duty were imposed, and some handicap placed on the Italian and American manuby facturers, Australian lemons would be used for the making of peel. That would mean a better price for the grower, though not know whether the price would be raised to the consumer; that might, or might be an effect.",24
83,Mr LIDDELL,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"If lemons are rotting on the ground, why cannot we compete, if there is not a want of enterprise ?",24
84,Mr BATCHELOR,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"What is the use moveof the honourable member taking that view? The lemons are rotting on the simply because there is no use for them so long as the candied peel is imported. If a duty be imposed, such as has been suggested, the local lemons will be turned ceived:into peel. If ever a protective duty were justified, it is in such a case as this; and Dear Sir, I am rather surprised at the attitude of the Government and of honourable members, of enafter the action we have taken in regard to dates, which represent comparatively a The request of the growers all over Australia has, apparently, availbeen neglected or overlooked; and I appeal to the Treasurer to show that he has the interests of horticulturists at heart. I thinlk the Treasurer must admit that a duty the such as I have suggested would be of infinitely more assistance than other duties which have been proposed. In the Progress Report, signed by both sides of the not Commission, there is the following: Only one of the fruit merchants who appeared your Commission gave any information this article. He said that the jam and candy peel manufacturers imported very large quantities of peel in brine from Sicily. . . . The preference shown for the imported peel was not due to damaged local lemons being turned into peel in brine. It was impossible to turn-a damaged lemon into peel; it was only fit for pulp. An extra duty would impose a handicap upon manufacturers. is no An extra 'duty certainly would impose a handicap on manufacturers who desire to use only the imported article. I urge that comthis is a fair case for an increased duty; circumand I should like to know whether the Treasurer proposes to take any action. An extra duty would mean the employment of is a considerable amount of labour, and the of what is at present a waste",24
85,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Hume-Trea surer) [4.27] - I do not desire, unless under very exceptional circumstances, to alter any of the proposals I have submitted. The honourable member will recognise that it is a serious matter to propose an increase of duty. This, question has been considered the Department in its relation to the other items to which I have referred, and on which a duty of 3d. is charged; and, I do under the circumstances, I do not think that the Government can support an innot, crease.

86,Mr JOHNSON,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Lang) [4.28] - I That the words "" and on and after 31st Octoground ber, 1907, free,"" be added. Perhaps the shortest way of giving my reasons for this amendment would be to read the following letter which I have reSydney, 2nd August, 1907. In view of the - importance of the recent visit the Colonial Secretary of F i j i , the Hon. A. W. Mah'affy, M . L . C , to the Federal Minister of Trade and Customs, and the representations then made by him on behalf of his Government in favour of establishing reciprocal relations in regard to the export and import of commodities between Australia and F i j i , I have the honour by direction of an important meeting of mersurer) chants and others associated with the Fijian trade, held at New Zealand Chambers, Georgewill street, Sydney, on Friday, 2nd August, to before you what the meeting considers to cogent reasons why the specific request by the Hon.' Mr Mahaffy for the removal of the duties now imposed upon bananas particularly, and other fruits and produce Australia from F i j i , should receive serious consideration by you when the Tariff is being revised in the Federal Parliament :(a) Bananas particularly sbould be exempt from taxation for the reason that are more than a luxury, they tially a food product, and of almost universal consumption throughout the Commonwealth, and particularly of the poorer classes of the community. (#) The Hon. Mr Mahaffy promises on behalf of his Government reciprocal treatment in regard to imports of goods coming into F i j i from the ports of the Commonwealth. (c) The trade between Australia and F i j i is increasing in volume and rapidly-consequentl y all unnecessary restrictions should be removed without . Sir WILLIAM LYNE - They do. - delay. (d) Australia rightly claims to dominate the important island groups of Western and Southern Pacific, great bulk of the trade rightly to Australia, every legitimate therefore should be employed to establish that domination. (e) At present a very large proportion the manufactured gcods imported into F i j i come from Europe, India, and America. Australia could supply two-thirds of the goods required F i j i , consequently it is to the age of the Commonwealth that procal relations should be with F i j i . I earnestly commend the foregoing to .your earnest consideration. Establish a great with F i j i and it will also gradually grow bulk and extend in the groups of the Now that the Government has been approached by the Fijian Administration the opportunity should be seized to extend our trade and influence more. throughout the Islands of the Pacific, and particularly with F i j i . I beg to remain, - Yours faithfully , Of course I recognise that I must speak with bated breath upon the subject of bananas in the presence of some of the representatives of Queensland, but I would point out that this industry is really not a white man's industry, and that it chiefly affords employment to Chinese, who are said to have formed' a combine. the protection which it is proposed to extend to it is a protection to the employment of Asiatics, who in Northern Queensland possess a monopoly of the banana industry.",24
87,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,Hume-Trea [4.32] - I trust that the Conunittee not agree to the amendment. The price place of bananas at the present time is a very be low one. Good bananas can be purchased made for about 4d. to 6d. per dozen.,25
88,Mr FOSTER,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,They are being retailed at coming to is. a dozen in Sydney.,25
89,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,I purchased them very recently for 4d. and 5d. per dozen. # The statement of the honourable they member for Lang that the industry is a are essencheap labour one is utter nonsense.,25
90,Mr JOHNSON,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,It is a Chinese industry.,25

94,Mr JOHNSON,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Why do they not do it? In Queensland the bulk of the bananas are the grown by white labour. The plant has simthe ply to be planted and looked after in the belongs same way as has an apple tree. I trust means that the Committee will not agree to the reduction of the duty. The Government of have not proposed any increase in the old rate. They have adopted the recommendation of the A section of the Tariff Commisby sion, and there is really no reason why proadvanttection should not be accorded to the banana reciindustry in Queensland and in any other established tropical part of Australia.",25
95,Mr FISHER,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,Wide Bay) [4.35] - The trade reasons advanced by the honourable member in for Lang in favour of a reduction of the Pacific. proposed duty are not sufficient.,25
96,Mr JOHNSON,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,I could advance a few,25
97,Mr FISHER,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"The honourable member might advance arguments all day, and even then they might not be sufficient from the stand-point of being convincing. His prinTHOMAS JESSEP. cipal point was that a reciprocal treaty should be arranged between F i j i and the Commonwealth.",25
98,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,That may come afterwards.,25
99,Mr FISHER,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,I merely wish to point out that if we abolish the duty upon bananas it will be impossible to arrange for Consequently reciprocity in connection with this item. The honourable member might therefore allow the duty to remain as it stands with a view to subsequently arranging for reciprocal ment.,25
100,Mr GLYNN,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Angas) [4.36] - I shall certainly support the amendment of the honourable member for Lang. As we had a big fight upon this matter some five or six ; years ago I think that we ought to compress our remarks into the smallest possible compass. In 1901 Fiji did exhibit a great of discontent owing to the taxation imposed upon her exports. In a cablegram which appeared in the Argus it was pointed out that the trade - between Fiji and Australia was a growing one. Surely those islands are not such formidable competitors that we ought to attempt to fight them upon the principle of retaliation. It was also pointed out that the fruits that we ought to consume largely, such, as peanuts, figs, and bananas, were the principal exports from Fiji. As a matter of fact, I . hold that bananas should be admitted free, because of .the' very low place ' which they f occupy in the. scale of. food products. Viewed from the stand-point of their nutritious properties, peanuts head the whereas bananas occupy only a middle place. An ordinary child, to obtain a reasonable amount of nourishment from bananas, would require to consume about a. dozen. . As a matter of fact, no man could possibly carry within ""his hold a sufficient quantity of bananas to keep him alive.",26
101,Mr FOSTER,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"New England) [4.39] Having recently visited the northern portion of Queensland, I know the conditions under which bananas are produced there, and I know that white men can grow them. But I wish specially to point out that during last winter Sydney residents were - called upon to pay as much as is. 6d. per dozen, for extra choice bananas. A shilling per dozen had to be naid for fruit of an average quality, and 9d. a dozen for what - was practically rubbish. These high prices were not due to the operation of the Tariff. - The fact is that there is a Chinese combine in bananas. I should like the Queensland representatives to give us a little formation concerning that combine. The fact that such a combine exists does not - say much for our White Australia policy. I want to know if it is not possible to smash this combine, and to hand the industry over to white labour? - Colonel FOXTON (Brisbane) [4.40] I view with scepticism the statement of the lionorable member for New England that a Chinese combine exists which regulates treat- the trade in bananas.",26
102,Mr HUTCHISON,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,There is no doubt that it does regulate the trade from Queensland to South Australia.,26
103,Colonel FOXTON,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"I doubt that statement, and I will tell the honourable member why. The bulk of the bananas which come from Queensland are not grown by d*;al Chinamen. South of Mackay, one can scarcely find a Chinaman who grows bananas. How, then, can the trade be under thecontrol of the Chinese sufficiently to permit of them dominating the market?",26
104,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,The Fiji bananas probably do that.,26
105,Colonel FOXTON,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"In Queensland, bananas are chiefly grown in the neighbourhood of the Logan River, and principally by Germans. If a combine does exist, it is probable that it is a combine amongst the fruiterers rather than amongst the Chinese. I understand that a combine exists amongst the Greek and Italian fruiterers.",26
106,Mr FOSTER,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"There is a combine list,- amongst them in the matter of fish and fruit.",26
107,Colonel FOXTON,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"I cannot understand how the trade in a fruit, which is largely grown by Europeans and principally by Germans, can be so manipulated by Chinese as to permit of them controlling the market, when, as far as I am' able to judge, they have no means of securing a monopoly.",26
108,Mr FOSTER,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,They might purchase the bananas wholesale.,26
109,Colonel FOXTON,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"The growers would have nothing to do with that. Of course, the Chinese might form a combine in that way, just as well as .the Greeks. But there is no reason to suppose that there is a combine amongst the Chinese which is responsible for the increased price of bananas.",26
110,Mr FOSTER,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Then , how does the honourable member account for the extraordinary price?",26
111,Colonel FOXTON,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"The off-season will in- account for it. The honourable member cannot expect to the able to purchase bananasall the year round at the same price. The prices of other fruits besides bananas are subject tofluctuationsconsequent upon their being out of season. I rose chiefly to combat the statement of the honourable member for' Lang that the bulk of the bananas grown in Queensland are produced by Chinese - Undoubtedly, in theFar North a good many Chinese do grow this particular fruit , and I suppose that it is not possible to arrive at any certain conclusion as to the proportion which is grown by Europeans and by Chinese respectively. At the same time, I imagine that, in Queensland, the greater quantity is produced foy European labour.",26
112,Mr TUDOR,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Yarra) [4.43] - I shall certainly vote for the proposed duty of is. per central upon bananas, and I hope that the Government, in framing their Excise proposals, will provide that unless this f r u it is grown by white labour, the growers shall be required to pay an Excise of is. per central. Why should not the Chinese growers in Northern Queensland be subjected to precisely similar conditions to those imposed upon the blacks who are producing bananas in the Pacific Islands? I trust that the Government will act in the way I have suggested, and if they fail to do so, I hope that Parliament will taike the necessary action.",27
113,Mr THOMAS BROWN,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Calare) [4.44] - This question excited a good deal of attention in a previous Parliament when the first Commonwealth Tariff was under consideration. We were then assured that by the imposition of a duty upon bananas we should develop the industry to a sufficient extent to insure an abundant and cheap supply. Yet the fact remains that we still have to import a considerable quantity of bananas. The honourable member for New England has very justly complained of the high prices which) obtain in Sydney for this frui t during portion of the year. When the Tariff of 1902 was under consideration, we were assured that there was not a great deal of genuine competition between Queensland and Fijian bananas, for the reason that the seasons differ in the two countries. We were informed that the Fijian bananas were introduced at a time when the Queensland banana was not on .the market. ..",27
114,Colonel FOXTON,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,Who made that statement ?,27
115,Mr THOMASBROWN,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"It was made steps by several honourable members, who seemed to be fully seized of the facts relating to the industry, and was referred to as a possible reason for, the very high prices obtaining in Sydney and Melbourne during portion of the year. Last year 146,250 centals of bananas were imported, on which duty, amounting to £-'.319 was paid. In the circumstances, therefore, I think we should reduce the duty, - so. as to .cheapen.) the price of this product at a time wheni the Queensland banana cannot be placed on the local market, or at all events cannot besold at a reasonable rate. There is another: aspect of this question which strongly appeals to me. The Commonwealth is, o r should be, in very close touch with the South Sea Islands, including F i j i and the New Hebrides. Large importations and ,1 close commercial relations which obtain between F i j i , the New Hebrides, and the southern parts of the Commonwealth, however, have been disturbed by the imposition of this duty. If we can do so without injuring a local industry, we should endeavour to encourage these trading relations with the islands, rather than - allow them to be cultivated by other peoples who are possibly hostile to Australia and the Empire generally.. I hope that the Committee will agree to this item being placed"" on the free list, or at all events to a reduction of the duty.",27
116,Mr HUTCHISON,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Hindmarsh) [4.48L - Since the honourable member for Brisbane appears to doubt the existence of a combine in connection with the distribution of bananas in the Commonwealth, I would* point out that there is not a white man inSouth Australia or Victoria who can sell a bunch of. bananas that has not passed"" through the hands of a Chinese:",27
117,Colonel FOXTON,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,Not a Greek nor an> Italian?,27
118,Mr HUTCHISON,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Neithe r an Italiannor any other white man ini Victoria or South Australia can sell a bunch of bananas which has not been passed through the hands of a Chinese. I have gathered this information not only in Adelaide and Melbourne, but also in Queensland. I understand that the; whole trade, from Brisbane northwards, is in the hands of Chinese.",27
119,Colonel FOXTON,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,That is not so.,27
120,Mr HUTCHISON,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"I am speaking not of the growing, but of the distribution of bananas, and I think that in imposing a. duty we should endeavour to ascertain if cannot be taken to break: up this ring of .coloured men. I should prefer the Commonwealth to draw the whole of its supplies of bananas from' Queensland, and I hope that if this duty be imposed .for the protection of the local industry, the Minister of Trade and Customs will take steps, if possible, to exclude the Chinese from the 1 trade. I have proof that there is a com-, bine of coloured men in .connection with thedistribution..of bananas... Qur. policy should be to encourage not only the white producer, but the white distributor, and I hope that the honourable member for Brisbane and others will support any effort that may be made in that direction.",27
121,Mr EDWARD S,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Oxley) [4.51] - The question of the desirableness of imposing a duty on bananas was completely threshed out in this House some five or six years ago, when the first Federal Tariff was under consideration. That being so, I do not propose to occupy the attention of the Committee for more than two or three minutes. I rose principally to confirm the statement made by the honourable member for Brisbane, that the cultivation of bananas south of Mackay is wholly in the hands of Europeans. It is true fhat on the Johnstone River in North Queensland, as well as in the Cairns district, a large number of Chinese' are to be found, and I should be glad if the Parliament would take the step which I suggested when the Pacific Island Labourers Bill was under consideration, and legislate for the deportation of Chinese, Japanese, and other Asiatics. I wish to impress upon honourable members the fact that not many Chinese are employed in cultivating bananas in Queensland. Certainly no Chinese are so engaged in Southern Queensland, and there are very few, if any, south of Mackay. I do not think that the duty of is. per central seriously affects the selling price of bananas. It has been said that there is a difference between the seasons in Queensland and F i j i , but I am under the impression that when bananas are plentiful in the one place they are plentiful in the other. If there be such a combine as has been suggested, I am inclined to.think that it has nothing to do with Australian grown bananas.",28
122,Mr FOSTER,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,It has.,28
123,Mr EDWARDS,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"I hope that is not so. A very large quantity of bananas is grown in' the northern parts of New South Wales, so that representatives of that State should be interested in the desire to preserve the industry.  ing in Northern New South Wales. I believe that efforts to cultivate the banana near Brisbane have failed.",28
124,Mr EDWARDS,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Banana s are grown from Brisbane down to the Tweed River. The honourable member for Moreton will confirm that statement. When I was travelling through the electorate of Moreton some time ago I saw large areas of land under bananas, and I feel confident that the. Committee will agree to this item.",28
125,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Parramatta) [4-55]-- I would suggest to the Committee the advisableness of allowing thisitem to go for the present. I understand that the Prime Minister has definitely promised to make a declaration of the future policy of Australia in regard tb the whole of the surrounding islands, and particularly with respect to the New Hebrides. Naturally all kinds of trade with the islands, including the trade in bananas, will, when the declaration is made, come under review, so that I think we might very well defer the consideration of this item until the proposals in question are submitted to the House.",28
126,Mr BOWDEN,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,Nepean) [4.57] - I favour the reduction proposed by the honourable member for Lang. Since the imposition of this duty about five years ago the price of bananas in New South Wales has been practically doubled. Bananas that we used to get for about sd. per dozen now cost cd.,28
127,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,They can still be bought for 5d. and 6d. per dozen.,28
128,Mr BOWDEN,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"They cannot be obtained at the present time for 5d. or 6d. per dozen in any shop in Sydney. Firstclass bananas now cost from is. to is. 6d. per dozen. To my mind the Fijian bananas are superior to the Queensland production, and the duty has caused an increase in price of the higher-class article. Prices have advanced from 50 to 100 per cent, since the imposition of the duty. The consideration mentioned by the honourable member for Calare also strongly appeals to me. We should endeavour to promote the trade between Australia and F i j i ; but New Zealand is hankering after it and trying to divert it to her ports. We desire tq do all we can to bring the Commonwealth into close touch with the South Sea islands,, and if we are to have a definite policy in relation to the islands we must be careful not to do anything that will hamper our trade with them.",28
129,Mr JOHNSON,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Lang) [4-59]-- I wish to read two or three lines of the evidence given on this subject before the Tariff Commission. At page 830 of the Minutes of Evidence it will be found that Mr Lancelot Lewis Earl saidWithout such importations at certain seasons of the year it would be impossible to continue the distributing business.. In answer to question 25,600 the witness, 'dealing with the duty on bananas, saidThe duty on fruit is actually appears to be.

I believe that the rate proposed is quite high enough, in the interests of both producers and consumers.",29
143,Mr HUGHES,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,West Sydney) [5.14]. - I am opposed to this duty; but the attitude of the honourable member for Wilmot in regard to it astonishes me. He was an enthusiastic opponent of the duties on currantsand raisins.,30
144,Mr ATKINSON,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,I was not in the Chamber when those duties were being discussed.,30
145,Mr HUGHES,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Some cataclysm may have overturned the cherished convictions of years, so that the pyramid no longer stands uponits base, but upon its apex, tottering to its f all ; but I know of nothing which will account for his conversion. In times gone by we have known members to be free-traders in regard to all things but salt, and the honourable member for Wilmot has made a similar fall. I representa - densely populated district, where the price of food is of great importance. Potatoes are a, very important part of the daily diet of the greater portion of the people of the country; and I emphatically protest against the notoriously and obviously selfish conduct of such honourable members as the honourable member for Wilmot. I can understand, appreciate, and even admire men who, from conviction, are in favour of a protective .policy; but I utterly fail to either appreciate or admire the action of the honourable member. I remember when, a few weeks ago, I intimated my intention not to vote for the taxation of food products, the honourable member, who was sitting near, said that he would stand by me in that attitude. This was the Horatius who elected to hold the bridge with me. Now, however, without any apology or explanation, he proposes to impose a tax on a primary article of consumption. The honourable member says that this is "" part of the bargain.""",30
146,Mr ATKINSON,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,So it is.,30
147,Mr HUGHES,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"The honourable member holds that it is part of the bargain that primary products shall be protected; and this while his words are scarcely cold in which he spoke in faivour of removingthe duty from currants and raisins. Happy is the lot of the primary producer when he is represented by such a convenient, advocate as the honourable member 1 His idea is that the primary producer shall have all his commodities free, while on all he sellsthere shall be a thumping duty.",30
148,Mr ATKINSON,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,Can the honourable member show that a duty of is. has ever increased the price of potatoes to his suffering constituents?,30
149,Mr HUGHES,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"The honourable member has entered into a discussion of the merits of which' he knows absolutely nothing. The price of potatoes is now £ 6 or £ 7 a ton, and is rapidly rising. There is every prospect of a drought throughout the land, and the value of all kinds of foodstuffs is being enhanced; and yet this free-trader comes forward with his trumpery proposal for a tax on - potatoes, on the ground that it is ""part of .the bargain."" It was never part of the bargain that an honourable man should betray his principles; and I do not hesitate to say very seriously that, if there is - one thing we ought not to be asked to do, it is to tax the basic food products of the people. That I shall never do; and surely the people of Tasmania will not reecho the sentiments of the honourable member for Wilmot. I do not think that the people of Tasmania desire to make money in such a way at the expense of the people of Australia. I much grieve at the attitude of the honourable member for Bass, but evil example contaminates the best, and it was certainly owing to the honourable member for Wilmot that the honourable member for Bass fell. I call upon the honourable member for Wilmot to do what he promised some weeks ago, and stand by me in order to guard the bridge, which is fast disappearing under the thunderous blows of the protectionist party. I hope later on to be able to give the honourable member another chance to distinguish himself in regard to food products. Per : sonally, my attitude in regard to this item shall be as hitherto; I shall not vote for any increase in the duty on potatoes or other food products. I shall, so far asfood products are concerned, vote for a removal of duties, or for the lowest duties compatible with, obtaining revenue for the carrying on of-the business of the country >.",30
150,Mr WILKS,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Dalley) [5.22] - The honourable member for West Sydney contendsthat the honourable member for Wilmot is not the ""clean potato,"" .so far as the item before us is concerned, and would have usbelieve that he himself is the only ""clean> potato "" in regard to all food products. But if we take the trouble to look at his own column we can see that it is broken in several places. On many occasions I .have, with the brutal selfishness of a - free trader, voted for the lowest duties on food supplies, and have openly said that, when protection affects my own electorate, I shall be a bit of a. protectionist; and I have sustained that attitude consistently throughout. The honourable member for ""Wilmot has told lis that Federation .would not ""have been accomplished without' protection for the potato industry-withou t protection for the primary industries. I think the honourable member is in error., because I do not remember that the acceptance or rejection of the: Constitution was said to depend on any such understanding. There is not the slightest doubt that the drought is increasing prices; and,- under the circumstances, I clo not see why we should - impose a duty of this character. The Treasurer for once has told us the naked truth - that he will accept the recommendation of both sections of the Tariff Commission. But it is remarkable that the honourable gentleman should accept the recommendation of the Tariff Commission in this respect, and reject those of their recommendations which affect many other commodities in general consumption. I shall vote for the proposal of the honourable member for - Maranoa. I can see no reason why the potato industry should be encouraged,, in view of the fact that it is an industry natural to the country. If a drought should come, we must get our supplies from New Zealand, or anywhere else we - can; and it is only in time of drought . that a duty of this kind can operate.",30

The 'honourable member has had the audacity to lecture another member of the Committee for .inconsistency. B it if we observe the votes given by the honourable member for West Sydney, we shall not be able to find greater inconsistency exhibited in this Parliament. The honourable member has just now told us that he has determined not to vote for duties on food products-that he has not done so, and is not going to do so. But from the division-list last night, I see that, the honourable member voted against a proposed reduction of duty in the case of what is certainly a food, - namely, dried or preserved fish.",31
153,The CHAIRMAN,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,Order !,31
154,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"I allude to that division only incidentally, because the honourable member for West Sydneyspoke of inconsistency ",31
155,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,That is only a secondary kind of food.,31
156,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"I should regard it as a primary and necessary # kind of food, especially when meat is dear. However, if we refer to the votes of the honourable member for West Sydney on this Tariff, and on the previous Tariff, it will be seen how utterly inconsistent he has been. Yet he ventures to lecture another member of the Committee who, in one instance, has departed from what the honourable member for West Sydney chooses to assume is the policy of that honourable member. I think we have had quite enough of this. We desire more consistency and fewer comparisons made by those who are inconsistent. I understand that the honourable member for West Sydney, during the late elections, assured his constituents that, while the Tariff is, in"" his opinion, high in some respects, he Zealand is not responsible for that fact ; but that his responsibility would be to reduce the excessive duties as far as. he could. I have looked .in vain for his fulfilment of that promise. Certainly, as regards has statement that he has not voted for. duties on foodstuffs, I refer honourable members to his vote last night; and, in regard to other articles, which, though foods, may not be . considered, so necessary as fish, he has also voted for higher duties. Under these circumstances, he should be the last to claim consistency, or to attack another on the ground of inconsistency. ' .",31
157,Mr FOST ER,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"New - England) [5.30]. - I hope that .theCommittee will agree to the proposed duty, which, viewed trom the stand-point of our small importations, has proved fairly effective. Further, potato growing is one of the industries into which small holders can enter. I know of many instances in which persons are growing potatoes upon 10-acre farms. I do not think that the imposition of a small duty upon potatoes will have the effect of increasing their price. Experience has shown that the very reverse is the case. . Amendment negatived.

Yet the Government now propose to levy an increased duty upon an article which is not made locally, and is not likely to be. Both sections of the Tariff Commission recommend the imposition of a duty of Jd. per lb.",32
173,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Are we to be tied always to the recommendations of the Commission, even if good reason can be shown for departing from them?",33
174,Mr LIDDELL,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"The members of that Commission acted in a judicial capacity, and, after taking voluminous evidence upon the various items of the Tariff, have given us the benefit of their deliberate judgment. This the Treasurer, upon the statement of one officer only, the Comptroller-General of the Customs Department, wishes us to set aside. I think that he owes the Committee an explanation as to why this duty should be increased to 2d. per lb. I hold in my hand a letter which I have received from a gentleman in the trade, who saysUnder the old Tariff the duty was £d. and this, with transfer charges, & c , amounted an impost of about 83 per cent.

Any reasonable man would hesitate before advocating an increase upon the old rate.",33
175,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Robertson) [5.44] - Unde r the old Tariff, potato flour was imported as starch, which, in reality, is. It is being used by confectionery facturers, who declare that its use is not at all injurious to their - workmen. But I would point out that where it is used the the Commission. conditions which obtain resemble. those of a flour mill. To my mind, nothing is more prejudicial to the"" health of the operatives than the conditions which prevail in a flour mill. The honourable member for Hunter will find, by reference to statistics, that lives of employees in flour mills are very much shorter than those of employees in most industries. The manufacture potato flour is carried on under that are very similar to those obtaining ' Mr DUGALD in ordinary flour .mills, although they not quite so injurious to health. would be an anomaly to impose a duty difficulty of only Jd. per lb. on potato flour, [189] is really a starch, whereas starch made from other products has to bear a duty of 2d. per lb. I approve of the object which the Government have in view:, but I think that the duty of 2d. per lb. on ordinary starch is too high. When the first Federal Tariff was under consideration the honourable member for Mernda said that he did not desire such a duty, but it was forced upon him. This potato flour can be mixed with ordinary starch, and I think that we should have on starch an all-round duty of Jd. per lb.",33
176,Mr HARPER,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,Mernda) [5.48] - I wish to offer a few remarks,33
177,Mr LIDDELL,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,Is potato flour a starch?,33
178,Mr HARPER,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"It is a starch produced from potatoes, and is used in Australia chiefly for moulding, as well as for other confectionery purposes. The quantity imported is very small. . It can be and has been made in Australia, but the local consumption is so trifling that its production is not profitable. I have just been informed by the Treasurer that the reason why the duty has been, raised is that per lb., the Department have found very great to difficulty in differentiating between starch dutiable at 2d. per lb. and a starch flour Ausdutiable at Jd. per lb., which can be used a duty to adulterate it. The item is not worth Even if the said duty proposed by the Government be manupassed, it will not have any appreciable effect on any industry using potato flour, whereas if the duty-be reduced to _d. per lb. the door will be opened to its substitution for an article on which a duty of 2d. per lb. must be paid. It has been said that the Government proposal is the it result of a recommendation made by the manuComptroller-General of Customs.",33
179,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,At the instance of,33
180,Mr HARPER,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"I have no doubt that it is a purely departmental matter. Germany produces an enormous quantity of potato starch, and since we grow potatoes to perfection there is no reason why by the and-by the industry in Australia should not be a large one. In good seasons, when we have a bountiful crop of potatoes, a of large quantity could be manufactured into conditions flour for export.

Mr DUGALD THOMSON duty .on starch, from countries other than the United Kingdom, is 2^d. per lb., and I think that in connection with this item we have some light thrown on the construction of the Tariff. Evidently, when the Tariff was being prepared, it was proposed to impose a duty of 2d. per lb. on starch. The Comptroller-General of Customs then desired that in order to overcome the difficulty to which reference has been made, potato flour should be raised to the same level. Apparently that was done, but subsequently the duty on starch was raised to 2$d. per lb.",34

195,Mr FAIRBAIRN,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"I am surprised to hear a free-trader from Tasmania speaking in that way. If I thought that the in the creased, duty wouldassist the farmer, I should be the first to agree to it , but I do not think it will, and I consider that we - might well revert to the old duty.",34
196,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Hume-Trea to surer) [6.0] - I hope that the Committee will not agree to the proposal of the honourable member for Fawkner. When I was in Sydney the other day, a gentleman who grows a great deal of barley, and intends to plant a great deal more in the New England district, told me that the present rate is absolutely necessary, and will bring about a large increase in the crop. Barley should be grown more extensively than it is, especially in Tasmania. It has not been grown more largely, because it is subject to attacks by caterpillars, and is easily destroyed; but it is a good crop, and we should grow other things besides wheat and oats. Honourable members have spoken in high terms of the Tariff Commission, and I would point out that this duty was recommended by it. A great deal has been said about the need for-doing something for the manufacturers, but here we have an opportunity of doing something for the farmers.",34
197,Mr KNOX,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Kooyong) [6.3] - I would point out that the proposed duty is higher than the rate which has been in force for several years under the Kingston Tariff, and if it is agreed to, a corresponding alteration should be made in the duty on malt. I am not an advocate for the consumption of malt, and have no interest in the brewing industry; but it seems to me that the proposal to increase this duty needs justifying.",35
198,Mr FOSTER,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,The importation of barley is its justification.,35
199,Mr KNOX,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"That importation is not very large. Last year it amounted to only 105,000 centals. I shall support the amendment.",35
200,Mr STORRER,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Bass) [6.5] - I am surprised at the want of consistency displayed by the members of the Opposition corner party. They have professed an interest in those on the land, and were very anxious that rabbit-proof wire netting should be imported as cheaply as possible; but in this instance, they are showing no consideration for the agriculturist. Some time ago, they stated that they would adhere strictly to the recommendations of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission, but they have voted for rates 30 and 40 per cent, higher than were recommended, and now they are going to vote for a lower rate. I think that we should give the farmers some, encouragement; we should not concern ourselves only with the manufacturers of Melbourne. I do 'not think that barley is grown in my district, and I am not interested in the production of beer; but the Tariff should be fair, in treating all the producers of Australia alike. Having protected manufacturers, we should give the farmers protection. [189]- 2",35
201,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Robertson) [6.7] - The proposal of the members of the Opposition corner party seems to me a barefaced piece of business. As barleygrowing is an industry which is established in Tasmania, gentlemen who are interested in brewing stocks in Melbourne see that if the brewers have, to pay more for their barley, the dividends will be lower. If barley were grown in Victoria, these honourable members would be so sensitive to the criticism of the Age that they would vote for an even higher rate, or, indeed, any rate that might be proposed. ' The Committee should resent an attitude of this kind. It seems to me that these honourable members have cornered themselves. They are in a rat-trap. Although the Minister says that the proposed rate was recommended by the Tariff Commission, he omitted to tell the Committee that their recommendation was that of the protectionist section only, the free-trade section wishing to continue the old rate which was imposed at the instance of the right honourable member for Adelaide and Sir George Turner. I shall support the reduction of the duty to is. 6d.  there was a brewers' question, this is one. To reduce the proposed duty would suit a small combine of brewers, who have treated the barley farmers of Australia most shamefully. I have had a lot of experience in connection with this matter. There are very few buyers of barley, and they are chiefly maltsters, who give such prices as they choose. If for no other reason, I shall vote for the proposed duty to prevent the farmers from being at their mercy.",35
202,Mr FOSTER,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"New England) [6.12I I apologise for speaking so often on these items, but I am a representative of a country constituency, in which there are agricultural districts, and having loyally voted for the protection of manufacturers, I wish to urge the Committee to give similar treatment to the primary industries. It is a disgrace to a country like Australia, which can grow a thousand times more barley than it needs, that' we import so much. In supporting the proposed duty. I am thinking, not so much of the interests of my own constituents, although in parts of New England barley grows to perfection, as of those of Tasmania. The other day, in voting for the paraffine wax duty which the Tasmanians wished to see reduced, I suggested that the people of Tasmania should go in more for primary industries, 'and therefore I feel that we should protect the farmers who grow barley there.",35
203,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Franklin) [6.14] The barley growers have had an exceedingly bad time in the past, having for years had to contend against a brewers' combine. After a man has grown barley, perhaps at the request of a brewing company, he has been told that it is not quite up to sample, and he has had to take is. a bushel less for it than he expected to get. In no industry have the producers had to fight a more uphill battle, and, as it is a question of protecting the barley-grower against the brewer, I shall vote for the duty. Item agreed to. Item 66.

205,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"It comes within paragraph B, wheaten flour.",36
206,Mr THOMAS BROWN,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Calare) [6.17] - In times of drought quantities of maize, oats and so forth are imported; and I should like to know under which item these commodities are included. Under ordinary circumstances there is very little importation, but during the drought of 1902-3 large quantities were brought in, with the result that the revenue under this head was increased from something like ,£20,000 to about .£500,000.",36
207,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,That item is passed.,36
208,Mr THOMAS BROWN,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,I do not think that the Committee understood that was so.,36
209,Mr JOHNSON,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Lang) [6.19] - I move That after the figure ""2d.,"" paragraph C, the words "" aud on and after 31st October, 1907, per lb., i d . , "" be inserted. My amendment, . if carried, will impose the duty which was fixed on cornflour in the old Tariff. The proposed new dutymeans an increase of 400 per is equivalent to an increase of about 100 per cent, on the invoiced price. In 1906 the total imports were 1,857,937 lbs.., of the value of ^20,092. Of this 1,557,463 lbs., of the value of £16,986, were from the United Kingdom, the balance being almost entirely from the United States. Here is another instance in which a duty is largely increased mainly against British imports. This is essentially a white labour and higK-wage industry; because, I think, nobody will contend that the wages in the United Kingdom and the United States can be objected to from an Australian stand-point. Australia is a natural country for the manufacture of cornflour, because we have all the advantages of soil, climate, and labour conditions; and there is no necessity whatever for the degree of protection proposed. The local production immensely exceeds is. the importations, the former amounting to about 5,500,000 lbs. per annum. This expansion took place under the old duty of | d . per lb., and this proves that, not only was the protection ""then extended quite sufficient, but that no protection at all was needed. I gather that the local production is not equal to the local consumption, and this probably accounts for the imports I have mentioned. If imported cornflour be excluded, as I presume it would be under the excessive duty proposed by the Government, there would be no check against any increase of prices by the local manufacturers. So far as I can see, there are two leading manufacturers in Australia who will be principally benefited by any protection that may be afforded; and, in view of the local production,. I should like the Treasurer to give some justification for the increase in the duty. When we are first asked to impose protective duties we are always told that they are intended to give industries a start and some assistance until they are strong enough to stand alone; but bur experience has ever been that the more protection is given the more is asked for-that the stronger industries grow the greedier they become. The monster of protection in Victoria is becoming absolutely insatiable; and it is about time to ask ourselves when these demands are to stop. I have heard the Treasurer himself on the platform on severail occasions urge that protection is required only for the purpose of encouraging the establishment of industries.",36
210,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"And to assist in cent., and carrying industries on.",36
211,Mr JOHNSON,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Nothin g was said on those occasions about assistance being required for the carrying on of industries. All that was asked was protection to the extent of perhaps 10 per cent, until the industries were strong enough to do without assistance of the kind. But such industries apparently never grow strong, and .duties have gradually risen to 20 per cent., then to 40 per cent., and now we have increases proposed up to 400 per cent, upon existing protective duties, as in the case of the item under discussion. is becoming nothing short of a public scandal that certain people should be permitted to dip 'their hands into the public Treasury, not for the purpose of assisting them in establishing industries, which would be bad enough, but simply for the purpose of still further inflating their immense profits. This, I think, is an item in regard to which we ought to make strong resistance, seeing that cornflour is, perhaps, more than any other flour, used as a food for infants and invalids. Particular attention has been directed to this matter by the Child Study Association and other institutions, which have for their object the care of the sick and the young.",37
212,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,What did Mr. Beale say about cornflour?,37
213,Mr JOHNSON,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"I have not Mr. Beale's' report before me, but I have the report of the Tariff Commission and the old Tariff, under which I find this industry made very good progress. In 1906 there were .exported from Australia 51,913 lbs., valued at £485, and I may add that the price charged' for the exported produce is only 2jd. per lb., as compared with 3d. charged for the product consumed locally. Sitting suspended 'from 6.30 to J.45 p.m.",37
214,Mr JOHNSON,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"I merely wish to emphasize the fact that as a food product, cornflour really ought to be placed in the same category as sago and tapioca. It is used by the poorer sections of the community more largely than the articles which I have mentioned because' it is cheaper. Yet, whilst sago and tapioca are dutiable at _d. per lb., it is proposed to levy a tax of 2d. per lb. upon cornfloura very anomalous condition of affairs. I would also point out that macaroni and vermicelli, cognate articles, are dutiable at i d . per lb., and they are imported mainly from Italy, whereas cornflour is imported principally from Great Britain. Thus, whilst the duty upon articles of foreign origin is i d . per lb., that upon the product of the United Kingdom is 2d. per lb. Cornflour, I need scarcely remind honourable members, is very largely . used by confectioners who find that the additional supplies which they obtain chiefly from Great Britain come in very opportunely when the local supply is not equal to the demand. That is another argument against the increase of the duty. Only a few days ago the Committee exhibited great sympathy with the confecIt tionery industry, yet it is now seriously proposed to heavily tax an article which forms one of the main bases of confectionery. Under the old Tariff the persons engaged in this industry did remarkably well, and consequently there is not the shadow of an excuse for the proposed increase of duty.",37
215,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,Hume-Trea surer) [7.48] - The Government proposal simply gives effect to the recommendation of the Tariff Commission.,37
216,Mr JOHNSON,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,Onl y to the recommendation of a section of it.,37
217,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"The A section of that body has recommended the increased duty proposed. There is no doubt that the manufacture of cornflour is an industry which can be established in Australia, and which ought to be protected. Probably I should not have proposed an increase in the old rate but for the recommendation of the A section of the Commission.",37
218,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,Robertson) [7.49] - The Treasurer Has stated that it was not necessary to impose an increased duty upon this article.,37
219,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,I .did not say that.,37
220,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,the honourable gentleman said that if it had not been for the recommendation of the A section of the Tariff Commission he would not have proposed an increased duty.,37
221,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,Because my attention would not have been directed to the matter.,37
222,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"The Treasurer has proposed an increase of 300 per cent, upon the old rate. Whilst he is following the recommendation of - the A section of the Tariff Commission, he should not ignore the fact that the B section of that body recommended the retention of the old duty, namely, Jd. per lb. The members of that section did not frame their recommendation as free traders, but as members of the Gommission. This is an industry which stands almost alone. Corn can be grown all over Australia, and corn meal is produced within the Commonwealth to the extent of 5,000,000 lbs. annually.",37
223,Mr HARPER,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,Cor n meal is an entirely different commodity from cornflour.,38
224,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"In Australia we are able to obtain various kinds of corn food for the breakfast table. I know that there are several qualities of this product. There is no end to the supply of maize in Australia, and, consequently, the industry has been well established. Cornflour is imported because it is necessary to meet the heeds of those persons who cannot digest the ordinary corn meal.",38
225,Mr JOHN THOMSON,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Cornflou r used as a porridge, but merely for infant preparations.",38
226,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"It is a flour which passes into general consumption. Even if it were subjected to double the duty which it has hitherto borne, there would still be a large importation of this cornflour. At the present time about 2,000,000 lbs. are imported annually, which, at Jd. per lb., would yield a revenue of £4,000. At 2d. per lb., the revenue collected under this heading would be £ 1 6 , 0 0 0 .",38
227,Mr SAMPSON,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,But we shall not collect any duty whatever if we manufacture all the cornflour necessary for our own requirements.,38
228,Mr HENRY WILLIS,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"It is absurd to impose an increased duty of 300 per cent, upon this article. I would suggest to the Treasurer that he might agree to a fair compromise, by making the duty i d . per lb. At a later stage, I shall move in that direction, expecting that he will agree to the proposal.",38
229,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Hume-Trea surer) [7.58] - In the progress report of the A"" section of the Tariff Commission - pag e 20- I find the followingA Queensland manufacturer of cornflour, who said that he had spent ^3,000 on his factory, built in 1897, and established to supply mands of his State, without reference to Inter-State markets, informed your. Commissioners that as a result of the Tariff he had not been able since Federation to work more than six months in the year. When his factory was built the import duty was 2d. per lb -, and the selling price per lb. When the duty was altered to i d . per lb. the foreign manufacturers reduced their prices to 2fd. per lb., apparently with a view lo preventing the manufacture of cornflour within the Commonwealth.",38
230,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"North Sydney) [7.59] - The Treasurer has frequently alluded to the original proposals submitted in connection with the first Commonwealth Tariff as a justification for the Tariff proposals of the present Government.. But I find that, under the old Tariff, the duty originally proposed upon cornflour was i d . per lb., that in New South Wales, South Australia, and Western Australia the article had previously ibeen upon the free list, that in Victoria and Queensland it had been dutiable at 2d. per lb., that in Tasmania it had been subjected to a duty of i d . per lb., and that in Canada it was dutiable at 20 per cent., or something less than i d . is not per lb. The fact that New South Wales produced and still produces more cornflour than does any other State is, no doubt, due to the fact that larger quantities of maize are grown there. I can see no reason for this increase of 300 per cent., which must necessarily mean an increased price to the consumer. It has already had that effect. I have here an invoice showing that since the introduction of this Tariff the price has increased by \6\. per lb., and I am told that there has since been a further advance of _6. per lb.",38
231,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,That is not the result of the Tariff. The honourable member might just as well .say that the increase in the price of wheat is due to the Tariff.,38
232,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Whether it is or is not, can it be said that this duty is necessary, having regard to the' fact that we are already producing in Australia four-fifths of the cornflour consumed ? Surely that is an indication of the sufficiency of the duty, and that the industry which lived under free-trade conditions in New South Wales is a natural one, capable of holding its own against foreign competition, at all events with the assistance of a very low rfuty. There are sure to be some import* 'ions irrespective the de- of what duty may be imposed. We know that there are preferences for certain brands. An imported, or a locally manufactured article is often preferred, perhaps not because of its superiority, but because the people have become accustomed to it.",38
233,Mr BAMFORD,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"If Australian cornflour is not good enough for them let ithem pay for the imported article. : Mr DUGALD THOMSON - The people generally will have to pay more in ione or two ways. This duty will have the effect of raising the price of the imported cornflour, while it will also give 'local manufacturers an opportunity to increase their prices. There should be some limit to these increases. In this case we 'have a duty increased by 300 per cent, - for no apparent reason. The industry apparently was carried on satisfactorily in New South Wales under free-trade, and a duty of _d. per lb., which represents - a high percentage on the value of the article, ought to be sufficient. The Committee should not desire to impose a - higher duty, which is sure to lead eventually to higher imposts on the people. I do not suggest that we can always attribute the rising or falling of prices to a Tariff. The question of supply has to be - considered. Occasionally when the Australian maize crop is poor, some manufacturers of cornflour are glad to import cornflour in bulk for their packet trade, and in the circumstances I think that the Treasurer might very well agree to the duty being reduced to i d , , if not to Jd. per lb. A duty of _d. should be sufficient. Having regard to the cost of labour, the manufacturers would be well protected - under it.",39
234,Mr EDWARDS,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Oxley) [8.9] - I hope that the Treasurer will not accept the amendment. The very fact that the honourable member for Lang has proposed to reduce the duty from 2d. to _d. is, to me, a plain indication that he has no expectation of its being carried.",39
235,Mr FULLER,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,That was the old duty.,39
236,Mr EDWARDS,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"The old duty was not sufficient to enable the industry to carried on successfully. A few weeks ago I presented to the House a petition from manufacturers of cornflour in the Pimpama district of Queensland, who pointed out that they were just able to make ends meet, that they were paying the highest rates of wages ruling in the district, ancl that, during the last twelve months, wages hacl increased to a considerable extent, owing to the demand for labour for the sugar-fields of North Queensland. They felt justified in asking the House to give them a little additional protection.",39
237,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,Do they want an increase of 300 per cent. ?,39
238,Mr EDWARDS,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"I do not say that; butthey want a little more protection than a duty of _d. per lb. would afford. These men, who are establishing a valuable industry deserve every coushleration. It is well known that maize, which is the raw material of this commodity, is grown in all the States, and I trust that the Committee will give the manufacturers of cornflour in Australia reasonable protection to enable them tq carry on the industry with some degree of success.",39
239,Mr TUDOR,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Yarra) [8.11] - I hope that the Treasurer will stand by the Government proposal. Nearly 2,000,000 lbs. of cornflour were imported last year, and every representative of a farming district should support this duty! The honourable member for Lang has said that about 5,500,000 Lbs. of cornflour is annually produced in Australia. I have often endeavoured to obtain statistics as to the local production of various articles, and have not been able to do so, except in respect of goods to which an Excise duty applies. I realise we need a Bureau of Statistics, from which such information could be obtained. I have been unable to ascertain the extent of the local production of cornflour, and I think it possible that the figures quoted by the honourable member are exaggerated.",39
240,Mr JOHNSON,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,I have been informed that the output is what I stated.,39
241,Mr TUDOR,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"As we can probably make cornflour under better conditions than obtain elsewhere, I hope that the Minister will stand by the duty in the schedule.",39
242,Mr WILKS,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Dalley) [8.13] - Since the honourable member for Oxley urged that be we should grant reasonable protection to manufacturers of cornflour, I think it necessary to point out that the duty of 2d. per lb. proposed by the Government is equal to 100 per cent, on the invoice value of this commodity. When the protectionists are able to show that an article affected by an item in the Tariff is being largely imported, they may have some ground for asking for' increased duty. I find, however, that whereas under a'duty of Jd. per lb. on cornflour we had an importation of 1,800,000 lbs., no less than 5,500,000 lbs. were locally produced. Surely that is evidence that the industry is doing well. At present we have practically only two large factories producing cornflour. I refer to the establishments of Harper and Company and Parsons.",39
243,Mr TUDOR,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,What - about Wade's?,40
244,Mr WILKS,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"I am speaking of the large factories. These two firms have already increased their price from 2^d. to 3d. per lb., and other firms have stated that there is to be an increase in their price. I desire that the food of the people shall be made as cheap as possible. have fixed the duty on sago and tapioca at _d. per lb. These are articles which are consumed chiefly by those who are fairly well-to-do. Why, then, should we put a - duty of 2d. per lb. on cornflour, which is used mostly by the poorest classes? have heard a good deal of the dear old Mother Country-no t recently. I admitbecausewhen honourable members opposite come to items affecting commodities which are largely imported from Great Britain, they are silent on the question of preference. Our importations of cornflour come largely from the United Kingdom, but it is not suggested that she shall receive preferential treatment. Why is it proposed to place a higher duty on. cornflour than on commodities such as vermicilli and macaroni ?",40
245,Mr HARPER,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,They are nearly all made in Australia now.,40
246,Mr WILKS,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"If they can be made in Australia with a lower protective duty, why is a duty of 2d. needed to protect the manufacturers of cornflour? Maize is grown abundantly in Australia. The honourable member for Oxley has shown that the local production is over 5,500,000 lbs. I shall vote for the amendment.",40
247,Mr SOLMON,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Laanecoorie) [8.18] - I realise that a great deal of what the honourable member says is true, and that the use of cornflour should be encouraged rather than discouraged by an increase in its price. I accept the statement that the local manufacturers have increased their prices.",40
248,Mr WILKS,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,Some of them have done so; not all.,40
249,Mr HARPER,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,The price of maize has increased from 2s. 6d. to 4s.,40
250,Mr SALMON,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"I am willing to consider the reasons governing increases; but in voting on the amendment I shall be guided by what I believe to be a much higher principle. The use of cornflour should be. encouraged, because it is more easilv digested than are many similar foods. If it used for certain purposes instead of wheaten flour, there would be fewer cases of dyspepsia, which brings in its train so much unhappiness, and interferes so much with the temper, at times, even of honourable members. Personally, I have derived much benefit by substituting cornflour for wheaten flour. As a protectionist, I am guided more by a consideration of the benefits likely to follow the adoption of that fiscal policy than by mere geographical prejudices. There'is too mucli We of the personal element in our discussions. I am prepared to vote to assist anv industry, whether it exists in Carpentaria/ or in Tasmania. I shall never support an industry merely because it is Victorian or is in my own electorate. It is because my. We protectionist principles are founded on a sure basis that I am going to support the Government proposals in this matter.",40
251,Mr HUGHES,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"West Sydney) [8.23] I rise to correct the totally erroneous impression which may have been caused by the speeches of the honourable members for Dalley and Laanecoorie. The former said that the poorest classes live on cornflour, while the latter made the astounding, but contradictory, statement that, if they did, they would be much better. If the honourable member for Laanecoorie could induce his opponents to adopt the cornflour diet for a period of seven days, they would never trouble him again. He appears to have not the slightest idea of what the commodity under discussion is. It is not flour, the product of maize, but the inside of the maize when the husk and all but the starch has been taken away.",40
252,Mr HARPER,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,It is pure starch.,40
253,Mr HUGHES,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Yes . We make very good maizena in this country, and I see no reason why we should not thus encourage the growing of maize. I desire that the people shall get cheap food, but I would cheerfully vote for a duty of 2d. or 3d. on cornflour. On one very unhappy occasion a number of men and myself had to live on cornflour' for three days, at the end of which period we could not walk a hundred yards. The magnificent physical condition of the honourable member for Laanecoorie is a plain and palpable contradiction of his statement as to the value of cornflour as a food. Did I not know him for what he is. I should shrewdly suspect him of being connected with the cornflour industry -'",40
254,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Parramatta) were [8.25] - As to the dietetic value of cornflour, I prefer the advice of the honourable member for Laanecoorie to that of the honourable member for West Sydney. The Jatter could with advantage take a little cornflour, if it would have the same effect on him' as it has had on the honourable member for Laanecoorie. A little while ago he was chiding the honourable member for Wilmot for voting for a small duty on potatoes, the food of the people, as he called it ; but now he himself is prepared to vote for a duty of 2d. per lb. on cornflour, which is unquestionably the food of the poorer classes.",40
255,Mr HUGHES,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,I would as soon live on plaster of paris.,41
256,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Then the honourable.member is beyond the reach'of argument. It seems to me that the honourable member for Laanecoorie is not consistent in this matter. He began by urging that cornflour should be as available as possible to the poorer classes, an admirable sentiment in which I concurred; but he went on to say that he would vote for a duty of 2d. per lib., and that in the face of the fact that the local manufacturers, who are doing well, are increasing - their prices. I cannot understand how honourable members, who profess to have so tender a regard for the poor, can be willing to increase by 300 or 400 per cent, the duty on a necessary of life.",41
257,Mr WATSON,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,Will the duty increase the price?,41
258,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,The price has increased.,41
259,Mr WATSON,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"The dry weather on the coast has made maize dearer, and that natura.llv affects the price of cornflour.",41
260,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"I do not think that the rise in the price of maize can have affected the price of cornflour to the extent of i d . per lb. The local production of cornflour is between 5,000,000 and 6,000,000 libs., while the importation is only about 1,750,000 lbs., so that the local manufacturers hold the field. Therefore, the industry cannot be said to be strangled, or to need this special treatment. We have been told that in Queensland it has not done so well; and on this point the honourable member for Oxley made a statement about it which I did not understand. I should think there must be some local or personal reasons which prevent the Queensland producers from making the progress which others have made in the southern parts of the Commonwealth. In the face of a production of nearly 6,000,000 lbs. per annum in parts of Australia where maize does not grow so prolifically as in Queensland, we must seek for some other reason than the absence of a duty.",41
261,Mr EDWARDS,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,The Royal Commission recommend a duty of 2d.,41
262,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,Yes ; and the singular fact is that there is very little evidence on which to base such a recommendation.',41
263,Mr FULLER,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,There is none at all.,41
264,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"I suppose it was considered that as the bulk of the cornflour consumed is already made in Australia, it was desirable to erect an absolutely prohibitive barrier. That, however, is not my idea of protection, because I take it that those who desire to effectively protect Australian industries do not aim at shutting out the possibility of reasonable and fair competition. In view of all the facts, there seems to be no reason whatever for this exorbitant duty on a food of the poorer classes of the community. It is a thousand pities that we .have not here any member of the Tariff Commission who recommended the duty of 2d.; and the Minister can give no reason for the proposed duty except that it is recommended by the Commission. In cases where the Commission recommend the lowering of the duty, the Treasurer refuses to recognise the recommendation, but the moment a high duty is suggested, he, without any further inquiry, immediately adopts it. The honourable gentleman proposes the highest duty in every case without affording any explanation to the Committee. All the facts show that a more moderate duty would provide all the protection needed to make the industry prosper; and I hope the Committee will see their way to cut down the proposed duty by at least half, if they do not agree to the proposed amendment.",41
265,Mr SINCLAIR,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Moreton) [8 34] The honourable member for Parramatta has told us that there is no demand for this duty; but I find, according to the report of the Tariff Commission, that - Mr. Francis, a Queensland manufacturer, stated in the course of his evidence that in 1897, when there was a duty of 2d. on cornflour, he spent £3,000 on plant.  carry on business?",41
266,Mr SINCLAIR,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"I do not know; but the protectionist section of the Commission base their recommendation on his evidence. I happen to know something about this industry; and some time ago the honourable member for Oxley was kind enough to present a petition on my behalf from the growers of arrowroot and cornflour in the Albert District. The petitioners set out1. That your petitioners are engaged in the growth, cultivation, and manufacture of arrowroot, and also in the manufacture of cornflour, the latter being manufactured from maize. 2. That the arrowroot and cornflour so manufactured are of a quality equal to, if not to, the best imported article, and are absolutely pure and unadulterated, and free from any foreign or deleterious substitute. I do not know how the honourable member for West Sydney can compare an article of that description to plaster of paris. The petition proceeds. 3. That it is possible to supply the whole of the Commonwealth with arrowroot and cornflour from the raw produce grown within the State Queensland. 4. That for many years the growth the manufacture of the two finished products has been a staple industry, and has afforded livelihood to persons both engaged in the ing and in the manufacture of the said products - Mr FULLER - Wit h the honourable 5. That standard wages have always been paid to those employed in the growth of and in the manufacture ' of the finished article, and that further latterly, owing to the dearth of field and other labour, such wages have increased approximately some 20 per cent. 6. That a' large quantity of arrowroot and cornflour, owing tb the small import duty, aTe being imported from America, where the wages of those employed in the industry, so your petitioners have reasons to believe, are lower, and conditions inferior to those finding place in the State of Queensland. 7. That your petitioners respectfully consider that the duty of one halfpenny per pound does not afTord them a sufficient or adequate protection against, the cheaper grown and manufactured imported article. S. That your petitioners would respectfully point out that if relief is' not afforded to the home industry it will result in the abandonment of the growth of and manufacture of such products to the serious loss and damage of those who are engaged in the industry. 9. Your petitioners, therefore,' respectfully request that, whilst revising the Tariff, you will take into your favourable consideration the prayer for relief of your petitioners, and, if you should so see fit, increase the import duty upon the said products, ancl thereby save from extinction the before-mentioned industry.",42
267,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,They do not sugthink gest any particular duty.,42
268,Mr SINCLAIR,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"No ; but this . petiwhich tion is signed by quite a number who areorable engaged in this industry. I certainly ami at a loss to understand why the Treasurer proposes a difference of i d. per lb. in the duties as between cornflour and airowroot; but we have now an opportunity to> assist the primary producers, not only in Queensland, but in many parts of the Commonwealth. It is rather amusing tonotice the smile that comes to the facesof honourable members in the Labour corner whenever we speak of trying to protect or help the primary producers; but I sincerely trust and believe that the Committee will afford - reasonable protection tosuperior an industry which really needs it.",42
269,Mr FULLER,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,Illawarra) [8.40] - I had not the opportunity of hearing the remarks of the Treasurer in connection with* this item.,42
270,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,The Treasurer has. not made any remarks.,42
271,Mr FULLER,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"I understand that the Treasurer bases the proposed duty on the of recommendation of the protectionist secof and tion of the Commission. Sir WILLIAM LYNE. - And on the necesgrowsity-for the protection of this industry. member for Parramatta, I regret exceedingly that the Chairman of. the Tariff' Commission is not able to be in his place 1 during these discussions; and I feel sure that every honourable member regrets the circumstances which have led to his absence. I ask the Treasurer whether, indie whole of the evidence given before the Commission, there is any justification for the proposed increase .of duty.",42
272,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,I am not questioning the recommendation of the' Tariff Commission.,42
273,Mr FULLER,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Eve n if the Treasurer does not question the recommendation of the Tariff Commission, he ought, before heproposes this increase of duty, to give theCommittee some reasons.",42
274,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,I have given a. very good reason.,42
275,Mr FULLER,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"I understand that the sole reason that the Treasurer has given is that the protectionist section of the Com-' mission recommend the increase; and I it is only right that honourable members should know the whole of the evidence' was given on this point. The honmember for Moreton stated that theapplicant for the increased duty had spent ,£3,000 on his establishment; but the honourable member had to admit that he does not know where the establishment is. The applicant was Mr Walter Francis, of Messrs. Francis and Sons, cornflour manufacturers, of Lawnton, Queensland, and he gave evidence before the Commission at Brisbane.",42
276,Mr WILKS,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,Was . he the only witness in regard to cornflour?,43
277,Mr FULLER,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Yes ; according to his evidence, the total quantity of maize consumed by him is 4,000 bushels per annum; and in the manufacture of cornflour he employs six people, consisting of four men and two girls. The big manufacturers in the Commonwealth did not think it necessary to appear before the Tariff Commission and to ask for an increased measure of protection. The fact is that fhey are doing so well that they do not require it. The Treasurer has based his proposal upon the recommendation of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission, who relied solely upon the evidence of one small manufacturer in Brisbane. As a matter of fact, our big manufacturers are making four-fifths of the cornflour consumed in the Commonwealth today. Under these circumstances the Committee will be inflicting a gross injustice upon the poorer classes of the community if it sanctions the indreased duty proposed.",43
278,Mr CARR,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Macquarie) [8.47] - If I thought that the effect of levying the proposed duty of 2d. per lb. upon this article would be to increase its price to the consumer I should not vote for it. But the assumption of the honourable member for North Sydney and of the honourable member for Illawarra does not appear to me to be based upon any logical reasoning. At the present time we are producing an abundance of corn, and under such circumstances there is bound to be sufficient competition to regulate prices. Even if a combination were formed amongst the big manufacturers, that would not prevent the establishment of small factories, which would act as a healthy corrective. Surely we are not going to sacrifice all our industries because of any evil results which may accrue from granting them increased protection. But the Ministry have promised to introduce legislation to deal with any abuses that may arise, and I am prepared to accept"" their assurance upon that point. If they do not give effect to their pledge, I shall be quite willing to assist in displacing them from office. I fail to see any justification for a reduction in the duty proposed. At ' the present time we are importing nearly 2,000,000 Ibs. of cornflour annually which ought to be made ih the Commonwealth. I do not think that the imposition of the proposed duty will increase the price of this article to the consumer. The enhanced price about which honourable members of the Opposition rave so much has been chiefly due to a shortage of supply. Of course, I recognise that they are'merely playing to the gallery in desiring to attribute to their political opponents results which are directly attributable to natural causes. That is a very old game.",43
279,Mr BOWDEN,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Nepean) [8.49] - If the manufacture of cornflour were a languishing industry, there might be something in the statements of the honourable member for Macquarie. But seeing that we already manufacture four-fifths of the cornflour consumed within the Commonwealth, the proposal, to increase the duty upon that article from Jd. per lb. to 2d. per lb. is tantamount .to imposing an absolute prohibition upon its importation.",43
280,Mr TUDOR,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,Where does the honourable member get his figures?,43
281,Mr BOWDEN,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"The honourable member for Oxley told us a rather pitiful tale about some Queensland manufacturers. Their failure was probably due, not so much to foreign competition, as to the fact that upon the imposition of a uniform Tariff the fiscal barriers between the States were abolished and interState free-trade was established. The small Brisbane manufacturers were thus called upon to face the competition of large Melbourne and Sydney firms. In my judgment, we have already extended ample protection to this industry, and I should very much regret to see a prohibitive duty imposed upon this article.

282,Mr WYNNE,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Balaclava) [9.11] - I wish to make a personal explanation regarding the vote which I gave on the last division. When the honourable member for Lang moved that the duty be reduced to Jd. per lb., I said that I should be prepared to support a proposition to reduce the duty to i d . per lb., and I voted for the amendment that the duty be reduced to that extent. But I voted against the further proposition that the duty be reduced to i j d . per lib. on the ground that it was a mere waste of time to submit such a proposal. I thought that the proposition that the duty be reduced to i d . per lb. enabled us to fairly test the feeling of the Committee.",45
283,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Parramatta) [9.12] - I am sure that the honourable member's explanation will commend itself to any reasonable individual. From the honourable member's point of view, a reduction of the duty to i£d. per lb. would be frivolous, whereas a duty of i d . per lb. would be reasonable. I congratulate him upon his idea of propriety.",45
284,Mr FOSTER,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"New England) [9.14]-I should like to point out to the honourable member for Parramatta, who has referred to the absurdity of the position taken up by the honourable member for Balaclava, that the proposition he has just submitted is absolutely ridiculous, since it is well known that miaize cannot be grown in Great Britain. That being so, a proposal to grant a preference to Great Britain in respect of cornflour is simply farcical.",45

288,Mr THOMAS BROWN,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Calare) [0.25] - It is proposed to increase the duty on grain and pulse, n.e.i., including phosphorised wheat, from 2s. 6d. to 4s. 2d. per central. In my opinion, we should vote for the old rate, and I therefore move That the words "" and on and after 31st October, 1907, per central, 2s. 6d.,"" be added. According to the information prepared for us, the importations under this heading last year were 1,500,326 lbs. the old duty producing a revenue of £3,226. I should like, therefore, to know to what preparations .the rate is applicable.",46
289,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Trea surer) [9.26] - The duty applies to phosphorized wheat, ground oats, millet, and a number of other preparations imported under different names. Mr BOWDEN ' (Nepean) [9.27] - I understand that under grain and pulse, n.e.i., are included many of the so-called breakfast foods, preparations of oatmeal, and other meals. We should congratulate ourselves that upon the breakfast tables of Australia at the present time such a large variety of these foods appears. one, shall not vote to increase a duty when it may have the effect of lessening this variety. The old rate seems to have been sufficient to protect the local manufacturer, so much so, that I understand fhat the Scotch oatmeal has been almost driven out of this market, which is not to be regretted seeing that the local article is so good. But if we increase the duty, we shall give the local manufacturers an opportunity of which they are always ready to avail themselves to raise their prices. Porridge and similar foods, which help so greatly to build up our young people, should be made as cheap as possible. . Therefore, I shall support the proposal of the honourable member for Calare. Amendment negatived. Item agreed to. Item 67 (Animal Foods, n.e.i.) agreed to. Item 68. Hay and Chaff, per cwt., is.",46
290,Mr THOMAS BROWN,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Calare) [9.33], - Under ordinary circumstances very little revenue is derived from this item, the amount last year being only £ 3 9 . As a matter of fact, this duty comes into operation only in times of very general drought, such as we experienced in 1002-3, when the total revenue collected was about £500,000. This shows what large importations become compulsory under drought conditions; and in that year the estimate of the revenue ,was exceeded by a considerable sum, which the then Treasurer, Sir George Turner, attributed largely to the importation rendered necessary by the shortage of fodder. Of course that revenue included the duties on cereals as well as on hay and chaff; but all the' importations were for food purposes, in order to preserve stock arid tide over a serious period. This duty does not in any way benefit the farmer, but, on the other hand, is an additional burden on him, seeing that in times of drought, he has to buy imported fodder at enhanced prices.",46
291,Mr ATKINSON,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,Thos e prices are not owing to the duty.,46
292,Mr THOMAS BROWN,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Not altogether, but they are partly due to the duty, which operates in the direction of preventing general importation, and confines ^:he market to a few importers, who are thereby enabled to charge almost prohibitive rates. Hav and chaff, which, under normal conditions, sell at ,£3 to £ 4 I , for per ton, were at that time retailed at about £ 1 0 per ton; but I may say thar the Government of New South Wales made an endeavour to meet the circumstances by carrying this fodder for starving stock over the railways at only a nominal rate. According to the present outlook in New South Wales, and,. I regret to say, in most of the other States, the conditions approximate, more nearly to those which obtained in 1902-3 than have the conditions of any of the intervening seasons. Unless the present rains be general, and of a character to produce grass, though late in the year, very serious times are in front of stock-owners; and the crops, even under the most favourable conditions, cannot now be half as great as they otherwise would have been. In the State of New South Wales, where there does happen to be some green food, the country is being devastated by a grasshopper pest so serious that .it is interfering with the railway traffic. In view of the fact that it may be necessary to import fodder in order to keep stock alive, it is unreasonable to impose a heavy duty. Nothing tended more to discredit protectionist principles in 1902-3 than the unnecessary tax on fodder.",46
293,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,If that be so the honourable member should riot object.,46
294,Mr THOMAS BROWN,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"The honourable member quite misjudges me if he thinks that, for the sake of a principle, I should be found ready to punish a multitude of people. As those fodder duties discredited protectionist principles in 1902-3, so will the duties on wire netting in the present year. I am not so hostile to the present Government as not to offer any suggestion which appears to me to be reasonable; and I think that the Government, and particularly protectionist members of the Labour Party, would be well advised if they devised some means by which, in times of drought, the duties on fodder may be suspended for a stated period, by resolution of Parliament or otherwise. If that suggestion adopted, the great producing community would be much relieved. I do not see much hope of abolishing this duty, because, I suppose, protectionist members desire to be able to go before their farmer constituents and tell them that they have not been neglected in connection with the Tariff. Some farmers are so short sighted as to fancy that they are helped by duties of this k in d ; but, in my opinion, it would be much tetter for all concerned if this proposed duty were struck out. The graziers, and those who combine agriculture and grazing, are the backbone of the Commonwealth; and, under such extreme conditions as I have indicated, they ought to receive every consideration. In order to.test the question, I move That the words ""and on and after 31st October, ioo;, free,"" be added.",47
295,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,Hume-Trea surer) [9.38] - I hope that honourable members will accept the item as it appears in the Tariff. I haye listened very attentively to the honourable member for Calare; but I may tell him that there is not.a drought in 'every part of Australia.,47
296,Mr THOMAS BROWN,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,The drought extends hearlv all over the. Commonwealth.,47
297,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"That is not_ so. In South Australia, Western Austra-"" lia, and Tasmania this is the best season for many years, and it will be a fair season over the southern portion of Victoria. I do not think that it is wise to legislate hysterically; we ought to frame a Tariff to last, and not for exceptional seasons. The honourable member for Calare suggested that some provision should be made for suspending this duty in times of drought; but the power to suspend the operation of a duty is a very dangerous one, and, in any case, such power should not be given in the Tariff, but must be conferred by an amendment of the Customs Act.",47
298,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"Powe r has already been taken to suspend the Tariff in regard to some items, for instance in Division VIA . , which deals with certain metals and machinery.",47
299,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"But any provision of this kind should be made by an amendment of the Customs Act, and not by means of the T a r if f ; arid, in any case, such power should be taken only in very extreme circumstances. Australia is so extensive a country that there is never a were drought in every part,; and, as I say, there is no drought now in two or three of the States. The condition is bad in some parts, but I hope that the present rains are extending. It is most Unwise to make any hysterical provision, of the kind suggested, seeing that it might prove prejudicial if applied in an improper way. I have had placet; in my hands a return of the imports for 1903, when the conditions were severe. I have not the figures for 1902. I find that in 1503 the imports of hay and chaff into New South Wales from other States totalled 2,365,955 c w t , whilst those of foreign origin aggregated 16,776 cwt.",47
300,Mr CHANTER,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,Thos e figures include cereals also?,47
301,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,Yes .,47
302,Mr THOMAS,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,But can the Treasurer tell us the revenue which was collected under this heading during that year ?,47
303,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"I have not the figures before me. In 1903, the imports' into the Commonwealth of hay and chaff of foreign origin may be thus summarized: - Unite d Kingdom, 6 cwt.; New Zealand. T-1 -573 cwt.; Straits Settlements, .11 cwt.: Argentine, 2,180 cwt; Chili, 498 cwt.; United States, 76 cwt.; a total of 17,344 cwt. In the following year, the imports' from the United Kingdom represented only 62 cwt., 'those from New Zealand 975 cwt., from Ceylon 3 cwt., or a total of 1,040 cwt. In 1903, the Victorian imports of Australian origin were 67,531 cwt., and those from foreign sources 3.801 cwt. During 1903, the importations into Queensland were 243,446 cwt. of Austra-' lian origin, and only 12 cwt. from foreicrn sources. During the same year, only 100 cwt. of Australian origin were imported into South'Australia. At the present time; it is not likely that we shall expetience a similar drought to that which prevailed in 1901-2.

South Wales, the same story has to be told. The dairymen all over the country are selling their stock because they cannot afford to keep them alive..

It is all very well for the honourable gentleman to say that the Commonwealth is so extensive that a drought is never anything more than local. But surely he must be aware that the present drought is co-terminous with New South Wales, Queensland, and Victoria, and that until recently it had invaded South Australia. I know positively that today the condition of things over the greater portion of New South Wales is, at lea&t, as serious as it was during the memorable drought-of 1902.",49

I have in my possession a letter from a man who has been engaged in the business for many years, and he informs me that prices are as high now as they were during the great drought, and that they are increasing. There is no immediate prospect of such fodder supplies coming from Tasmania, South Australia, and Western Australia as will reduce prices. Under these circumstances it is idle for the Treasurer to say that we are capable of supplying our own requirements. We are not. If fodder increases in price, it will be absolutely impossible for nine out of every ten men upon the land to maintain their stock. It has already been pointed out-and the fact does not - need to be emphasized-that the duty upon hay and chaff is operative only during times of great distress. At the best . it simply offers a premium to a few fortunate individuals to reap a reward at the expense of the greater portion of the Commonwealth.",49

328,Mr HUGHES,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"The vast majority of stock-owners are, so to speak, living from hand to mouth, and if the drought is not soon broken up our position will be more serious than it has ever been. Food for both man and beast in New South Wales has never been so high as it is today, and I dare say that the same remark will apply to Victoria. The day before yesterday the Master Bakers' Association decided to still further increase the price of bread, pointing out that they would be justified in raising it to 7^d. or 8d. per 4-lb. loaf, having regard to the rise in the price of flour. They state that it is only because they have large stocks of flour in hand that they are able to sell at the present rate. In Sydney, meals which for the last twenty years to my knowledge have been obtainable at 6d. each, are now 7d. That imposes an additional expense .of is. 9d. per week on In every working man who lives at a sixpenny restaurant. Then, again, every family has now to pay something like is., 2d. per week more for milk than was necessary a little while ago. The price of .milk depends upon the price of fodder, and I think that the Treasurer will show some little consideration for the welfare of the whole community by remitting this duty. During the last drought he refused to do anything for the farmer, and if he were to grant this reduction he would not lose much revenue. A great deal has been said about granting bonuses to this man and to that, but in this case we have a proposal which wili involve every squatter, dairyman, and stock-owner in an addi-. fional expenditure of from is. to 5s. per head per week in order to keep his stock in fair condition.

Had he travelled through any of the farming districts he would know that artificial feeding is not being resorted to in many parts of the Commonwealth. On the occasion of the last drought the cost of artificial feeding was greater than the value of the stock so saved, and rather than resort to that system stock-owners are now paying a higher rate than ever they paid before for the rental of grass areas. Only in a few cases are stud sheep being supplied with artificial food.",49

341,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"A great many of them are leasing grass lands instead of resorting to artificial feeding! I wish to the impress upon the Committee the fact that unless we insert in an Act of Parliament a provision empowering the Minister to suspend duties-and honourable members of the Opposition have asserted before today that that is a dangerous provision-the situation cannot be met. It would be wrong, in order to meet a state of affairs which might disappear in a day, to abolish duties ' which, perhaps, - could not be re-"" imposed for many years. We have been protecting the manufacturers in the cities, and we have now an opportunity to grant some protection to the farmers. I cer-' tainly hope that we shall not have a. serious drought; but I hold that the Commonwealth should be better prepared to cope with such a contingency than it is today. Owners of large properties have only themselves to blame for the trouble by which they are assailed. It is the suddenness with which the drought has come upon them that has landed them in difficulties, since many of the large holdings are overstocked. Whilst I should like to help them, I think that we have 'something more to do than consider the effects of a drought which may disappear tomorrow morning.",50

The Treasurer seems to absolutely-ignore the fact that this dutycan be of no service whilst we enjoy good seasons. Last year, we derived from it a revenue of only about £39Under normal conditions we can supply all our requirements in this respect, but in a time of drought, such as we are at present experiencing, the duty presses heavily upon stock-owners. Whilst the States Governments 'are seeking to help them to avert a national calamity, this Government is pre-' pared to do nothing: The States always assist the farmers by means of cheap railway freights, but at a time when millions of our stock were dying-whe n the herds and flocks of New South Wales were reduced by more than one-half-the Commonwealth Government was collecting hundreds of thousands of pounds of revenue in the shape of a duty on what was an absolute necessity to stock-owners. I object to this duty because it falls upon the people at a time when they are least able to bear it. There might be some argument in its favour if it had to be met in seasons of prosperity, but honourable members must recognise that it will add to the financial difficulties of many people who now have to purchase fodder in order to keep their stock alive. The picture of the dire effects of the drought has not been overdrawn. Although the Treasurer makes light of it , the distress is very real, the present drought affecting the dairy farmers of the coastal districts of New South Wales even more than did the last one. time Parliament should do what it can to help those who are in trouble. ister says that ' it is their own fault, that they should have made provision against drought. I wish he had said how it is to be done. Ensilage can be made in certain favoured districts; but there are hundreds of thousands of acres in the western districts of New South Wales in which it has been impossible to store food for the live stock. In many cases an abundance of water has been conserved, but the country is destitute of feed. . 1 , therefore, plead with the Committee to help those who need assistance, and to take off a duty which so much oppresses them.",50

The duty has been objected to from various h points of view, and I shall simply mention the one or two which have hitherto not been presented. One is that a duty of this kind is continually varying in its ad valorem incidence; at one time the incidence is and at another it is exceedingly light, which indicates a great weakness in any duty. It cannot really operate for the purpose of protecting; that is, for the purpose of inducing growth. Whether we are is no to have corn or hay depends on the elements, and, to some extent, on the world's price for wheat, and not on the existence of any protective duty. We remember the turmoil right through Australia when there was a talk of suspending the duties some years ago. Telegrams were received from all parts, some begffing that the duty should be retained, and others that it should be taken of f ; and the proposal led not to a great deal of trouble, which will no doubt be. again experienced if power be to suspend the duty. Any suspenof the kind would interfere with con; and it is unfair that contract prices be upset by the exercise of such a power. If there is a regular duty, people know what they are doing. Farmers and t the general public are prepared for the possibility of a duty being struck off when Although a Tariff is under consideration, but they are not prepared for the possibility of a Minister suddenly exercising an extraordito nary power at the bidding, it may be, of the majority of a particular section. There is a provision in regard to contracts in section 152 of the Customs Act, but it applies to sales as between importers and local purchasers, ancl not to such circumstances wil l as we are now considering. That provision does not give any cover to local sellers the and purchasers whose contracts would be affected by the suspension of the duty. For those reasons I hope the duty will be struck out, although I believe that about' two-thirds of the district I represent, where there has been an abundant harvest-par ticularly in regard to hay-woul d be f the moment benefited by its retention more than, perhaps, any other portion of South Australia.",52

If this were a protective duty in the true sense of the word, and if it were effective in all years, and under every conditioa-if it had the effect of protecting our farmersI could understand honourable members adhering to it. But, as a matter of fact, it is not an effective protective proposal at all, because it operates only when the necessities of the people are keenest, and when adversity is upon them. In times of national prosperity no fodder is imported. During the drought of 1902 I was constantly in correspondence with people who'were on the verge of ruin, and some of whom were hurled over the brink. Only those who have had the misfortune to go through a drought can understand the gravity of the situation. I had personal experience in a district which suffered more than did any other district from the drought of 1902. When a national adversity overtakes a community, there is no law, no system, no principle, which should be permitted to shut out of it that which is essential to the salvation of a large section of its citizens, and the preservation of that live stock which is required in the interests of the general welfare. Our position was bad enough in 1902, but what is it today? If the drought continues, the situation will be ten times worse than it was in that year, when the system had not been developed which is going to ruin the pastoralists and graziers in New South Wales. I allude to the creation of a ring in leases which should be available to men when their own pastures give out. In 1902, any man who sought to secure a lease of land where there was grass or water could do so, because there was no combine operating against his interests. But, today, the growth of a gigantic commercial cancer in our midst places power in the hands of individuals who, as a combine, levy blackmail upon the necessities of men, and take up every lease which it is possible to secure whenever the occurrence of a drought is anticipated. Such makes the position of the pastoralists and graziers ten times worse than it was in 1902. Then they could always travel their stock to places where grass ""and water could be obtained, but today they are shut out from land with grass and water, except at blackmail prices, and yet it is proposed to prevent them from getting fodder. If by the suspension of this duty fodder sufficient to sustain our flocks could be imported from New Zealand, we, as patriots, should not hesitate to take that course.",54
387,Mr ATKINSON,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,There is nothing to prevent New Zealand fodder from coming in when prices go up.,54
388,Mr WEBSTER,CADETS AND MINIATUR E RIFLE,"I am not dealing with the question of potatoes, but with the question of fodder for starving stock. I ask the Minister, not to abandon the imposition of the duty, as such would be an injustice to the farmers of the Commonwealth, but to suspend its collection for six months; or while the drought lasts, and thus relieve those who are now face to face with serious trouble. Progress reported. NA PRESERVATION BILL. Bill received from the Senate, and (on motion by Mr GROOM) read a first time. House adjourned at 10.55 P m",54
