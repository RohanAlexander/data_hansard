1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Leo MCLeay) took the chair at 10 a.m., and read prayers. NA NA Second Reading Debate resumed from 5 November, on  That the Bill be now read a second time. upon which Mr Howard had moved by way of amendment: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House deplores the Government's failure to acknowledge Commonwealth employees' freedom to associate, and the Government's failure to capture the productivity improvements to be had from enterprise bargaining within the federal Public Service by: (a) proscribing compulsory membership of trade unions; (b) proscribing preference for trade unionists in awards and federal legislation; (c) abolishing automatic deduction of union dues within Commonwealth departments and authorities; and by (d) giving the chief executive officers of Commonwealth departments and statutory authorities the same responsibility as their vate sector counterparts in deciding the size, composition, deployment, pay and conditions of employees, subject only to a budget constraint"".",12
2,Mr LES SCOTT,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I did not intend speaking on the Prime Minister and Cabinet Legislation Amendment Bill until I heard some of the very misleading comments that were made here last night. I think this is a great opportunity for us to explain to those opposite just what our industrial relations policy is all about compared with theirs. I am sure that all the public servants in Australia, if they had listened to any of the comments last night, would be extremely concerned about what their futures would be if the dreadful situation arose that those opposite occupied the treasury bench again. The Bill before us is the Prime Minister and Cabinet Legislation Amendment Bill 1991. I would like particularly to direct my remarks to the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). He has gone on about unionism and what unionism is all about. It is interesting when-particularly at this time in Australia's history-we 1991 think about what unionism has actually done for Australia that those opposite find it necessary to attack unionism. There is little doubt that, particularly over theJast 100 years, the trade union movement has shown the way in a lot of cases and really protected the rights of individuals. That is what unionism is all about-protecting the rights of individuals. Those opposite would take that away. Mr Atkinson-Come off it.",12
3,Mr LES SCOTT,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,They would take it away. Why would they want to take that away unless it were for their own greed? Mr Bradford-Tell us about the Cooke inquiry. You should know all about that.,12
4,Mr SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,The honourable member for MCPherson will cease interjecting.,12
5,Mr LES SCOTT,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"If the honourable member for MCPherson wants to start talking about crooks in Queensland, we can deal with that at another time. He wants to talk about certain other areas. I want to talk about the amendment proposed by the Opposition. We have had a very wide ranging debate on pri- the issues. I know that a lot of examples were given by those opposite about how things work and how things can work. But we really need to talk about what enterprise agreements are all about. Honourable members opposite talk about enterprise bargaining. There is a difference. When they talk about enterprise bargaining they are talking about individuals dealing directly with their employers one at a time. What really happens to the individuals in the end is that they finish up the lowest common denominator. That is what has happened in other countries in the world that have not had such an effective trade union movement as we have had in this country. There are many other cases that demonstrate that even today we need stronger legislation to protect the rights of individuals. We need more industrial officers going out and ensuring that employees are being aptly paid under the terms of their awards. It is not happening at the present time. I can cite cases time and time again of young people in particular being exploited in the very serious situations we have now. I can also cite cases involving women. A woman in my electorate had been out of the work force for 10 or 12 years raising a family, something which we all support. She wanted to get back into the work force but had extreme difficulty in doing so. Eventually, just to get back into the work forceMr Nehl-Along with a million others.",12
6,Mr LES SCOTT,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"This happened, not during the term of this Government, but prior to that-about eight or 10 years ago. Things have not changed much. Women are still exploited in a lot of areas. This is obviously something that needs to be continually addressed. In this case, the woman eventually got a job working all day on Saturday, being paid the equivalent of about half the award rate for a clerk. She had no lunch break or any conditions such as""that. She worked from eight to five with no recognised breaks whatsoever. They are the sorts of things that actually go on. That is why we need protection. That is why we just cannot have the enterprise bargaining that the Opposition would have. There are many young people who want to get jobs. However, the situation at the moment is very unfortunate. We on this side of the House are doing everything we can to address the problem. Mr Neh)-That's not much.",13
7,Mr SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,The honourable member for Cowper will cease interjecting. Mr Wright-There is a fellow in Rockhampton who employed a set of twins and paid them one wage.,13
8,Mr SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,The honourable member for Capricornia might assist the Chair as well.,13
9,Mr LES SCOTT,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I would not doubt that. I thank the honourable member for Capricornia for his interjection. That is the sort of that does go on. We need to tighten legislation to prevent that from happening. It is unfortunate that my good friend the honourable member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay) is not in the chamber at the moment. I often refer to the Sunshine Coast award. I am sure that the honourable member for MCPhersonhe spoke earlier and was here interjecting a moment ago-has a similar award on the Gold Coast. What happens with these awards is the employers actually exploit the unemployed by paying them some cash in handof course, under the table-and the unemployed do not declare this when claiming unemployment benefits. We still have people on unemployment benefits who should not be on them and the employers are ripping the system off. There needs to be more policing to ensure that that does not happen. I went into a club on the Sunshine Coast with my father to have a cold drink on a hot day, and the chap across the bar talked to us about the Sunshine Coast award. He explained to us how it works. It is extremely interesting how it works The honourable member for MCPherson referred last night to Power Brewing. I certainly would not want to be associated with Power Brewing in any way. It is still going on with its battle for the simple reason that it wants to exploit the situation. Let us get into the banking industry. Let us start looking at Metway Bank. It is involved in a real interesting case. The case is still being dealt with by the Industrial Relations Commission. Metway has lost the case but it is still going to fight on. I can speak with some experience of agreements that have operated with individuals in the banking industry. I give both the industry and the unions a pat on the back because they have moved forward in a very progressive manner. It was only just recently that I saw a major article in one of the newspapers stating that the Commonwealth Bank and the Commonwealth Bank Officers Association had led the way in certain areas of enterprise agreements. The ABEU had been doing that for some time as well. So those two banking unions-the ABEU is now of cour&e referred to as a finance sector rort union-have been progressing for some time. When I was still in the banking industry we actually struck agreements with all the three major banks-the ANZ, National and Westpac-which really moved ahead very quickly. But the thing that we did keep was the basic award. That was the important part because the award protected the rights and conditions of individuals-basic things such as the hours they work, whether they get a lunch break or not. These are basic things that a lot of us just take for granted. We need basic awards to protect those sorts of things. We can do that and still have enterprise agreements on top. The banking unions struck agreements with their respective employers. They came up with proposals that have been extremely acceptable to both the employers and employees. There have been some adjustments. Some people had to progress to overcome a lot of difficulties. Some people were paid on their age instead of on the work they did. That was addressed. It was important that it was addressed. Some people had to mark time, others had to progress more quickly; but the career structure was stilI there, and that was the important part. Talking of career structure, I come back to the Public Service. We have many public servants in the various departments in Australia. They are needed. Most are good hard working people. If there were a different agreement with each department, what career progression would there be for people to move from one department to another? Imagine the complexities that would result. It would be extremely difficult for people to move from one department to another. On each occasion someone would have to sit down and work out another agreement with them. It would be a nightmare if we went to the ultimate situation of having an agreement between each employer and each individual. It would be extremely difficult and extremely inefficient. An award gives the opportunity to the workers' representatives-that is, the trade unions-to represent the majority of their members in the particular industry. That is the proven way for us to move in the area of industrial relations. I refer again to the banking industry to demonstrate the benefits of those enterprise agreements. They are actually agreements between individual employers and the trade union movement. Honourable members know that over the past five or six years there have been big changes in the trade union movement, and that is probably why there is an inquiry under way at the present time. One of the things that I noticed recently is that the operating cost of the banking industry, which is generally made up of staff costs, has actually decreased between 1980 and 1985 from 3.9 per cent of overall costs to 3.2 per cent, a reduction of 0.7 per cent. On the other hand, the bad debt provision has gone from 0.2 per cent to 0.5 per cent. That comes down to a management problem, which is another issue that we need to look at. Industrial relations has been a cornerstone of this Government. It has played an important part in bringing down the wages policy, and we have had an extremely effective wages policy that has provided some stability. Last night, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) referred to the situation in New South Wales, which is only going to get worse. If honourable members look at what the Greiner Government is doing in New South Wales, they can see what would happen if honourable members opposite were ever returned to the treasury bench. Their policies would cause industrial chaos. We would not need a Minister for Industrial Relations. When we talk about the relations side of industrial relations, we should be talking about good relations. The Opposition would need a Minister for industrial chaos, because that is what this nation would finish up with. Why do Opposition members wish to stop people being members of trade unions? That is what this is all about. They talk about doing away with compulsory unionism. Mr Nehl-Freedom of choice.",13
10,Mr LES SCOTT,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"That is interesting, because it goes both ways. If people want to be members of trade unions and receive the protection of an award, they should pay their way. That is what it comes down to.",14
11,Mr HOWARD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,Everybody who votes Liberal ought to be forced to join the Liberal Party-is that what you say? You are saying that everybody who votes Labor should be forced to join the Labor Party.,14
12,Mr LES SCOTT,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"That would be a good move. We would support that view. The point is that anyone who wishes to have the benefit of an organisation-and those opposite are members of their respective parties and they get the benefits, if there are any benefits, of being members of those organisations-has to be a paid-up member. Last night, the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) referred to an organisation to which he belonged. He reckoned that he receives some benefits from being in that organisation. I do not doubt that he does. However, he pays his dues, so he gets those benefits. If a person wishes to be a member of a sporting club or any other organisation, he must pay his way. That is what it comes down to. People pay their membership and receive the benefits and protection that go with it. Those people who join trade unions realise the benefits. Many times people have come to me with their problems, particularly when their employer exploits them. On many occasions I ask them, 'Have you been to your trade union?'. Most of them have been members of their trade union, and they go to their union and have the matter sorted out from there. Members opposite would have us deal with each individual case. Can honourable members imagine the chaos and the inefficiency that will occur when each employee with a problem has to run along to the court? That is where the employees would have to go, because there would not be an industrial court to protect the rights of individuals. Part of the amendment moved by the honourable member for Bennelong proposes abolishing the automatic deduction of union fees within Commonwealth departments and authorities. Why do away with that? There are automatic deductions from salaries in other areas; most employees in this country have that done. Those deductions might be for an insurance premium, or a whole range of premiums. In the case of honourable members opposite, that probably even happens with their political party membership as well. This deduction facility is available to many people. The Opposition is trying to deny the public servants of this country the opportunity to have their union subscriptions deducted from their pay each fortnight. Mr Riggall-Rubbish, and you know it.",15
13,Mr LES SCOTT,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"That is what the amendment says. It says 'abolishing automatic deduction of union fees within Commonwealth departments and authorities'. It is there in black and white. It is in the Opposition's amendment. That is what the Opposition is trying to do. The whole amendment of the honourable member for Bennelong is a straight-out attack on the trade union movement. That is what we heard in this place last night. I am surprised at how Opposition members could possibly tie this matter in, and particularly attack the public servants. They are saying that public servants should not have the right to have their subscriptions automatically deducted.",15
14,Mr HOWARD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,No.,15
15,Mr LES SCOTT,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"That is what it says. Why stop them doing that? In the end, people will not be able to be members of trade unions. AU honourable members know of cases where people are discriminated against in this country because they are members of trade unions. It happens too frequently. They should have the right to belong to a trade union if they wish-and they will have that right, as far as I am concerned. We need better policing in many cases. Honourable members need to understand that this Opposition amendment is nothing short of what I said before-a blatant attack on the trade union movement. Members on this side of the House are extremely proud to be able to stand in this place and say that we support the trade union movement. I will stand up and fight forever and a day for the rights of people to be members of trade unions and the rights of trade unions to operate in this country. Recently I had the opportunity to go overseas. Unfortunately, none of my opposition colleagues who accompanied me are present at the moment. It was quite interesting to see how the trade unions operate in Europe and the good relations between employers and employees. For instance, in Austria-the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) was with me-it was quite interesting to see how the trade unions operate. People from all sides, the Government, the employers and the trade unions, no matter what their persuasion, worked together effectively. Of course, there are fewer unions in Europe. The thrust of the honourable member for Bennelong's speech last night was that he wants to have a union in each individual workplace; if there were two or three people working together, they would form a union. Can honourable members imagine the inefficiency of that system? We need to move to larger and more effective trade unions, and that is the way that this Government is moving. It has been effective in the European scene and will continue to be effective. It needs to be looked at here in Australia. It was very interesting to see how the system operates in Europe. Until such time as members opposite start to work with the Government and the trade union movement, and the employers as well, right across the board, in the common interest of this country, they are not going to get anywhere. They are not working in the best interests of this country. We need cooperation right across the board, whether it be the trade unions, the employers, the Government or the Opposition. We do not have that in this country. Until such time as the philosophies of the Liberal Party and the National Party change and until they sit down and negotiate with the workers' representatives-that is, the trade union movement-Australia will not become more productive. There is too much hatred from those opposite. That is what it is-a hatred of the trade union movement. They only hate the trade unions because the unions have been effective and they have seen how effective the unions can be, particularly while we have had the accord. It has been an effective wages policy and it will continue to be an effective wages policy. Opposition members do not have a wages policy, and they never will have, because they seem to think that it is possible to negotiate one to one all the time. If we have that situation, we will have the problems that arise in a lot of other countries. I am sure that the Opposition did not put forward this amendment in a genuine manner, expecting to change anything. The simple fact is that it is all about enterprise bargaining and attacking the trade union movement. It will do the Opposition no good, because the workers in this country are awake to it. This Opposition would attack their working conditions, they would finish up with less in their pockets, and then the Opposition would hit them with a goods and services tax. Really! When the Opposition has got them down, it is really going to kick them. That is the type of people Opposition members are. They have no respect for the rights of individuals in this country, and they never have had. The great strength of this nation is its workers, and it always will be. It will not be the bosses. If we look at what has happened while we have undergone this whole award restructuring process, we see that it is the workers who have carried the can, not the top management. Top management has not played its part, and it is about time that it did. Those in top management should start addressing the question of paying themselves a realistic wage instead of taking advantage of the situation. Referring back to those figures that I cited before, in the banking industry alone operating costs have gone down. At the same time, bad management-that is all it comes down to-has put its bad debts up. Those opposite can blame all the other things that they like, but it only comes down to that simple factor, that is, until such time as the management side of things starts to address the real question of giving workers a fair go, the main cornerstones that we have to protect in this country is the rights of individuals to belong to trade unions and the rights of individuals to always have that opportunity to elect to be a member of the trade union movement. Opposition members would never give the people that right; they would try to destroy it. The half-baked amendment that the Opposition has put forward is a straight-out attack on the public servants of Australia. The honourable member for Bennelong should write to every public servant in Australia and tell them exactly what he wants to do to them. That should make sure that he will never get back.",15
16,Mr ATKINSON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I must confess that, when I came into this chamber this morning, I really had no intention of participating in this debate. But having heard the contribution of the last speaker, the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), I feel that there is a need to address some of the comments that he made. From the way that he has spoken about the exploitation of workers, it seems to me that he has a hatred, if you like, of business. I would be the first to concede that in every society there will be the odd person who will do the wrong thing by employees. I hope that he would concede that there would be the odd person in the union movement who would do the wrong thing by employers. Mr Reid interjecting",17
17,Mr ATKINSON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"In fact, I think there are a number of odd people in the union movement, as the honourable member for Bendigo has indicated, who would do the wrong thing by employers. We need to have a look at a change to the system that operates in this country today. Considering our level of unemployment and how the accord system has worked, we have to reassess the way that we do things in this country. That is what the Opposition has been on about in all of the programs that it is putting together. In a fairly short time, the results of those programs and the way that we are addressing the need for change in this country will be seen. One of the things that concerns me most about the comments of the honourable member for Oxley with respect to the union movement and union membership is that he fails to realise that it is not really the union movement that is going to make the system work better: it is the way that we do our business; it is the way that the employer and the employee can get along together to develop a better association and a better system. To come into the chamber and talk about the need to increase our policing, I think, is totally opposed to what we need to do to lift the standards and the understanding between people in this country. He talked about the Opposition having a hatred for unions. I do not believe that that is the case. There might be the odd person who is unimpressed. But I have come out of a manufacturing area and I have good relationships with the work force. I think part of the reason for that is that we have been able to talk and negotiate between ourselves on the workshop floor. This is really what we are on about. We are not talking about individuals and the whole of the might of the organisation working together. We are talking about the work force on the workshop floor in a particular enterprise working and negotiating with the management in that same enterprise. One of the difficulties that we are faced with at the moment is that there is a break between these groups; there is an antagonism that is built into the system. In the process we are considering we are looking at getting rid of that antagonism. There will be the option for people, if they want to stay with the system as it is at the moment, to do exactly that. They can stick with it, but over a period of time they will recognise, by having the . opportunity to look at the alternative that we are suggesting, that they will be better off. That process of enterprise bargaining that we propose to introduce will give the opportunity for management to sit down with its workers and negotiate a package that is beneficial to both parties. Mr Riggall-Freedom to join the union movement.",17
18,Mr ATKINSON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"That is exactly right. As the honourable member for MCMillan has said, one cannot get that freedom under the structured system that the union movement is forcing upon these organisations at the moment. I would be the first to concede that there is a communication difficulty. But the problem is that that communication difficulty is being created by the way that our industrial relations system is working at the moment. There are a number of examples around this country at the moment where employers and employ- have both gained: the business has made more profit and the employee has gained more money, simply by putting a package together and being able to work together. Recently, I had occasion to go out with a back bench committee and talk to some businesses. A business owner said to me, 'I was delighted. We had some real problems in being able to pay the wages with people working five days a week and we were going to have to put some employees off. I sat down with the people in my workshop because I did not know which one to put off. They all had family difficulties; they all looked as though they would have trouble keeping their house going or keeping their kids at school. So we sat down and talked about it'. In that process of sitting down and talking about the problem, the employees said to him, 'What if we all cut back a day a week and we work four days a week until we get some additional orders in?'. The employer said to me, 'I really did not think that I could develop that sort of relationship with the people on the workshop floor. I was concerned about being able to develop that'. Would honourable members on the other side of the chamber have accepted that, with the sort of system that they want with this additional policing? The simple answer is no. We want to get away from this hard, rigid and fixed process whereby there is a wage increase whether or not there is increased production. Mr Les Scott-There are companies going broke in the whole restructuring process.",17
19,Mr ATKINSON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"It is all right to talk about the whole restructuring process. I listened with interest to the honourable member trying to put a new meaning on the words 'enterprise bargaining' - a meaning very different from what we are talking about. The whole process is based on a system that is not working. The Government is grappling with ideas to change it, but is still sticking to same base system. We have a democratic country with freedom of choice. I think that freedom of choice has to extend to whether people want to be able to operate on the factory floor with the sort of system that we are offering or whether they want to operate in the way that the Government wants. We are giving people the opportunity to work within the system that the Government has in place. The fact of the matter is that the Government needs to recognise that there is democracy in this countrythat those freedoms of choice need to be made available to everybody. That includes the businesses that want to see their operation succeed and their employees continue to be employed. The sort of system that the Government is talking about ensures that the current divisions cannot be overcome. The system which allows the employer whom I was talking about a little earlier to have his people work a four-day week in an effort to save jobs gives the opportunity for both sides to work together. Those employers will remember the way in which those employees 'have done the right thing. The fact of the matter is that, at the end of the day, they all had work over that period of time, nobody was out of work, and the system functioned as effectively as it could have. What the Government needs to recognise in this whole process is that making successes in this country is not a matter of destroying those with wealth and getting them out of the system or destroying those who run the businesses. If it does that, it is not going to provide the sorts of benefits that it talks about for the workers. It is all very well to champion this system of the accord, wage increases and whatever, but it is a catch-Up process; and nobody is gaining out of this catch-up process. If the wages are increased, the costs of the goods are increased, which in tum flows on to the prices on the shelves, which in turn means that the person who goes to the shop to buy his goods cannot afford them, so he applies for another wage increase-and so it continues. The only way that that situation is that going to be improved is by improving productivity. The Government's system is not offering the improvements in productivity that are necessary. It has talked about productivity in some areas, but it is a mickey mouse exercise. The fact of the matter is that, when the employers sit down and try to work it out with the employees as part of that industrial system, the employers are really giving in on many of these issues and are not getting true productivity increases. If, on that workshop floor, a means can be provided by which people can see some rewards at the end of the line for increased productivity, then we are starting to achieve our goal. In relation to the collection of union fees, many people do not particularly want to be members of a union, but because of the system in place they are virtually obliged to be. It gets back to freedom of choice. If someone wants to be a member of a union, there is no argument from our side; he is entitled to do so. What we are really saying is that people must be given that choice. Many Government members are totally off the track. They are totally overcome when they realise that the system they have been pushing for so many years is not functioning. The facts can only be camouflaged for so long. I encourage them to think very carefully about the proposals with regard to industrial relations that have been put forward by the Opposition. I believe that, in the long run, unless the Government is prepared to make some adjustments in this area we will continue to see this country go downhill in the way it has since the Labor Government came to power. We will continue to see a rise in the unemployment figure in this country. I have looked at the industrial areas in my electorate, particularly the Moorabbin estate, and have noted that businesses are keeping their doors open because they cannot afford to pay the redundancy packages. At Christmas time they will not be able to afford to pay the leave loading on the holiday payor the taxation that will be involved at that time. The Government is saying to those businesses, 'This is the rigid system that we wiU work with. This is the process we will put in place for our wage increases'. It really needs to think about the people on the workshop floors who are going to be out of work simply because of the rigid system that is in place. We in this House need to do a lot more collective thinking about the way these things are handled. Quite frankly, I think that we are too isolated from the real world and from what is happening on the factory floor. When we say that there has been some dislocation in the work force, what we really mean is that many people will be put out of work, many families will lose their homes and many families will not be able to give their children a proper education. So when we talk about dislocation, it really means a lot more than that. We need to recognise collectively that there are different ways of doing things. If people want to have the rigid system that the Government is talking about, that is fair enough, that is their choice, but we want to offer them an alternative. Over time, that alternative will provide people with a better way of doing things. That will be proven by the fact that people will progressively change over to that system because they can see the benefits. It is high time that we gave people that opportunity in this country. That is what the coalition is about. The coalition is not about businesses trying to hurt workers or imposing under-award wages on them. It wants to make sure that people get a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. If they want to work harder, then by negotiating with their employer they can get a better deal for themselves and for their families and, in the long term, for this country. I had not intended to speak today, but in closing I would say that the Government's whole approach to industrial relations needs a rethink. Before Government members continue along their path, I urge them to look very closely at what the Opposition is trying to do for people by way of the reforms which I have canvassed this morning.",18
20,Mr COURTICE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Hinkler) (10.35 a.m.)The Prime Minister and Cabinet Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 contains amendments to a number of Acts administered within the portfolio of the Prime Minister (Mf Hawke) and to Acts containing provisions relating to Public Service matters. The Acts are: the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981, the Governor General Act 1974, the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act 19,86, the Maternity Leave (Commonwealth'Employees) Act 1973, the Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) Act 1984, the Ombudsman Act 1976, the Public Service Act 1922, the Public Service Reform Act 1984, statutory authority legislation and the Resource Assessment Commission Act 1989. The previous speakers have broadly covered these small amendments. There is a second reading amendment to the Bill. I want to direct my speech to the amendment, the previous speeches made by those on the other side of the House and the attack on the trade union movement. It is strange that in 1991 we, on this side of the House, still stand up and defend the trade union movement. Nothing has changed in 100 years. It is ironic, because this year we celebrate the centenary of our Party, which was formed under a tree at Barcaldine. The reason for that was that 100 years ago people were oppressed by a drought and a recession, which was worse than the recession we have now. The 1890 depression was much worse than 1932 but it has been forgotten because the people who went through those tough times are not alive. The arguments from the other side of the House about individual bargaining and breaking down award conditions, were the arguments that were used in 1891. To enforce the law in that time-a law that supported greed and privilege-the Queensland Government sent 600 troopers with Gatling guns to Barcaldine and surrounded the shearers' camp. They bought a magistrate in Rockhampton. Things did not change-magistrates were bought by the government in Queensland up until 1989. So nothing changed much. The real point I want to make is that people do not change; human nature does not change. That is why the words of Ben Chifley in 1949 still apply, 'Labor stands for the people. Labor stands firmly against all who would take advantage of the people'. The basic platform of the Labor Party is to support the working men and women of this country, and it always will be. There is no doubt whatsoever that even today, in 1991, when members of the Opposition want to abolish compulsory unionism and attack the trade union movement, what they are talking about is privilege. We have heard these arguments over the last 100 years and nothing has changed. It is a matter of whether organised labour or privilege is being represented. I am very proud to stand up today and defend the trade union movement and to defend the working men and women of this country. Ten years ago I did not think I would have to do it because I thought we had matured a bit, but we have not. My grandfather said, 'A Tory is a Tory. It does not matter whether he has a pin striped suit on or not, nothing has changed', and that still applies. It is ironic that four speakers who have contributed in this debate are all Queenslanders. The reason that we are passionate about this is that we have lived through 32 years of conservative Government in Queensland and we have seen people divided; we have seen a philosophy thrown onto the people who died in a burnt out bunker in 1945; we have seen 600 workers in the electrical industry thrown out onto the street, their superannuation torn up in their faces; and we saw the hypocrisy the other week where a handful of people were crying about BjelkePetersen's legal costs. They were not out there crying about the 600 workers who were thrown out onto the street a couple of years before, and they forgot about the late Kev Hooper, a man who died for his principles and a man who died poor. In this Bill we are opposing the proposition that there be individual bargaining in the workplace, because it has never worked. We have heard about productivity: this Government is about productivity. The real difference is whether it is bargaining or agreements. We are not against enterprise agreements; we are for them. We have seen enterprise agreements work with the trade union movement, and with employers. But what we are against, and what I am against, is going into a sawmill and saying to 10 sawmill workers, 'We are in a recession, two of you have got to go or you all have to take a $50 a week cut in pay'. What do honourable members think they would do? They have got no choice; they have got to take a cut in pay. That is what this philosophy of those on the other side of the House is all about. How can a sawmill worker increase his productivity? Does he run quicker to pick a log to put through a saw? Or does the employer put in better, computerised equipwe ment? Productivity is relevant to the type enterprise that one is working in, and requires cooperation between the work and the employers. In 1983, for the first the Government demonstrated a willingness to work with employers and employees across this country. We have heard criticism of the accord. us see what the accord has done. We have seen a reduction of about 10 per cent farm unit labour costs since 1983. The Australian workers have shouldered their fair share of restraint. They have seen a reduction in wages as a contribution to becoming more competitive country, and they have done it without industrial disputation. We now the lowest level of industrial disputation the 1960s. Bearing in mind that we now nearly twice the participation rate, there is massive difference. ill other have the best industrial relations record in Australia's history, because we are working together. The Opposition's amendment would tear that up and pit one group against the other. We saw the wages blow-out in the last 12 months of the Fraser years. We saw the 'them against us' attitude. We saw, as I have said, what happened in Queensland under the conservatives. We cannot afford that luxury of division, we cannot afford to have privilege against organised labour; we have to work together. That is why it is important that organised labour have a role to play. If we are going to go down the track attacking compulsory membership, let us attack the AMA and the solicitors-they are closed shops. Let us attack accountants. Let us attack those groups. But even so, we must be game enough to stand up and attack the Queensland Cane Growers Association-it is a compulsory organisation. I am very proud to support the compUlsory organisation called the Queensland Cane Growers, where the compulsory membership participates.",19
21,Mr SOMLYAY,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,Why?,21
22,Mr COURTICE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Why? Because the up strength of the canegrowers in Queensland has been that unity, that total membership. When hear about the award rate, let us not forget of that in any bargaining base the award rate will it be the top rate from which employers will force bargain-not the bottom rate-and down it time, will come. As I have said, how is a sawmill worker or council worker going to become more productive if it is not done through the employers themselves? They cannot become more productive. A council worker who is Let working with a pick and shovel can only become more productive when the engineer, in nonthe town planner and the foreman have enough material to use so that he can be productive. The best way that we can become productive is to amalgamate some of the a councils-particularly in Queensland. The quicker EARC gets through and we get rid of have some of the councils and get some more since micro-economic reform at the top end of the have scale the better. So the argument about a productivity is relative to the enterprise that words, we now one is involved in. I will talk about' the positive side of the coin for a minute: how it does work. In Gladstone, in my electorate, we have workers and employers, the infrastructure, working together. We have a task force, which was formed in 1987, that is working to get jobs in industry, We have the trade union movement, we have the two local authorities-the Calliope and Gladstone councils-the Gladstone Port Authority, small business, and the Metal Trades Industry Association all on this task force. We can guarantee, subsequent to common sense, strike-free construction. We can guarantee total cooperation with the comof munity. That is why ICI and Minproc came to Gladstone, and that is why Queensland Metals is going to build a magnesium pilot plant in Gladstone, and a smelter some time down the track. That is why we are going to get a steel mill, and that is why we are going to see a rejuvenation of industrial development in our State-through cooperation. If there is one message I would like to put across to the Opposition in this debate it is this: for goodness sake, put aside the class differenbes and privilege of the past, and let us work together. But it has to be on a mutual respect basis. That will not happen if the Opposition is going to attack organised labour. It will not happen if it, wants to tear down the very fabric of society that has defended and created a structure that has given people a little pride. The speaker to follow me, the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Wright), represents coal mining areas. I am proud to talk about the amount of work, effort and dedication that the coalminers and the mining unions have put into this country and the commitment they have made to this country in developing a great industry. It is an industry that through my port of Gladstone exports some 20 million tonnes of coal every year. Tragically, many lives are lost in that industry. I do not believe one can pay underground coalminers enough. I do not care how much they get; they do not get enough. The reason that that industry has been so good is the commitment of the union movement within that industry. The safety conditions that have come about over time have come about only because of the union movement, not because of the benevolence of the owners of coal mines. My great grandfather was a coal miner in England last century, He went down the pits when he was seven years of agesomething that we would not tolerate now. It was tolerated then because there was not a union movement that was active and strong. I am equally convinced after listening to speakers on the other side of the House, not only in this debate but in every debate involving industrial relations, that if they are going to tear down the fabric that exists today, we would go back to that. Not all employers would do it, but self-interest is the best horse in every race. Obviously, with greed and competition, the same thing would come through, because it is only 100 years ago in our history of civilisation of two million years that these practices existed. In the United States, it is less than that. Only 30, 40 or 50 years ago the practices in Kentucky and the other southern States were an absolute disgrace to what was supposed to be the greatest nation on earth.l is only a little more than 130 years ago that the United States got rid of slavery. So do not let us fool ourselves that we have come that far out of the cave. In many ways, we are sophisticated cavemen. That is what the trade union movement is about. That is why we are protective' of it and are proud on this side of the House to defend it-because of the changes it has bought about. As I have said, four speakers on this side of the House representing Queensland are speaking on this Bill for this very reason. How did we get the basic fabric of society--health, housing and education? It came through the trade union movement's political arm-the Labor Party-with the election of the T.J. Ryan Government in Queensland in 1915. The free hospital system-including the Royal Brisbane Children's Hospital, the greatest children's hospital in the Southern Hemisphere-was the envy of the world. It was one that both of my sons went to. When they were both flown to Brisbaneone at four hours of age and the other at 11 months of age-the doctor said they would not come back. It was only because of that hospital that they did. That hospital was established by the Labor Government-by the political arm of the trade union movement. In the days before that, there was no health structure for the poor. There was no health support for working families whatsoever. I think we often forget, even now, the universal health cover that we have in this country. We can be proud of it-both sides of the House can be proud of it-when we compare it with the United States, a country that can wipe out the Arabs in 10 minutes and has the technology that can land rockets on the moon, but does not have a universal health system. We all know that if we travel overseas we have to have health insurance because if we break an arm in America it will cost us our house to get it fixed. But here in Australia, it does not. If one is a pensioner, blind or disabled or if one is a millionaire, one can get affordable health cover. That only came about through the political arm of the trade union movement-the Labor Party. That is something we can be proud of. I think that often in the mad race and debate of politics, we on this side are gUilty of not telling people enough about the things we have done. Only recently an elderly lady-a lovely lady and a friend of mine-wrote to me and asked, 'Why hasn't your Government done enough to help the working class?'. I wrote back to her and listed the things that we have done since 1983. She wrote back and apologised. She said, 'I guess that after you had climbed Mount Everest I wanted you to go to the moon'. It has been this side of the House that has introduced the family allowance supplement, the family allowance, home and community care and Medicare-the whole structure.",21
23,Mr SOMLYAY,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,And unemployment.,23
24,Mr COURTICE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Let us not forget that there are now one million people employed who in 1983 did not have jobs. I concede that unemployment is the biggest issue we have to face, as does the United States and Europe. I was in Ireland recently. It has 20 per cent unemployment. We are in a world recession. We could not avoid it any more than the Titanic could have avoided that iceberg. We have no choice because it is a world recession. We have not been able to avoid a drought and a crash in commodity prices. We are the innocent victims of a trade war that we have not participated in. Of course that has affected our economy. But we are very much aware of unemployment and we are addressing it. I am sure all honourable members heard yesterday's announcement-I am very proud of it-that a magnesium industry will start in Queensland. By the middle of this decade it will create 500 permanent jobs and give us the world corner on the magnesium industry. They are the sorts of structural changes that we need. Let us move on and talk about the real issue of unemployment. How does a country become efficient? A country becomes efficient by structural adjustment and by making tough decisions. Every time we have made tough decisions, such as cutting tariffs to be efficient, coalition members-not necessarily the Liberal Party-have dragged the chain. In a recession it is very easy to simply say, 'It is your fault'. It is much harder to make tough decisions. That is what we have done and what we will continue to do. But the answer is not in pushing down wages, and in destroying the very fabric of working men and women's lives. To say that because we are in a recession it is okay to kick the working people of this country does not add up. It did not in 1890 and it does not now. That is why I am very proud-although surprised at having to do so-to stand up in this House and defend organised labour. I really did not think that I would have to do that. I thought that we had progressed a little bit in the last 100 years, but we have not. I guess that we never will because there will always be those who want to take advantage of the working people, and that shows on the other side of the House. I support the Government on this. I certainly oppose the Opposition's amendment. In modern society there is simply no place for that view. On top of that, as the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) said, the Opposition is hypocritical because it wants not only to kick the working men and women but also to throw a consumption tax on them-consumption at the retail level on everything people purchase. It is interesting that we have still not heard an announcement about the GST. Waiting for the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) to announce the GST is like waiting for Elizabeth Taylor to announce her next engagement-it is always going to happen. I can understand why those opposite are a bit nervous about the GST. The pensioners will not wear it. The farmers certainly will not wear it because this year most of them will not have an income. Yet they will have to cop the tax at the retail level on all the necessities of life. The Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) said that this would be great for them. I do not know whether he has spoken to them, but in the last few weeks I have been talking to farmers who are struggling to survive and the last thing they want is a tax at the retail level on everything they pUfchasy. Those opposite can play games with input costs or whatever else, but people will still have to pay a tax on the necessities of life. When we come to the next election there will be two issues. Of course, the GST is getting a lot of coverage, but the basic issue that divides us is not the GST, it is industrial relations-as it always has been and as it always will be. I will finish with these words: we stand for the people and we stand opposed to those who would take advantage of the people. (Time expired)",23
25,Mr COWAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I agree with the previous speaker, the honourable member for Hinkler e Mr Courtice): the issue confronting Australia today is certainly industrial relations. My name is not on the list of speakers for the Prime Minister and Cabinet Legislation Amendment Bill, but I support the Opposition's amendment. The fact is that the GST will not be the issue at the next election; the issue will be industrial relations. I say that for many reasons. I was spurred on to speak today because I represent many people concerned that the unions are not representing them. The Government has reached the stage where it is representing a very small group of Australians in the ACTU. It is completely tied to the unions and it cannot depart on any policies or on any ventures it wishes to undertake. It cannot do these things because the unions will not agree. The Government would have introduced a goods and services tax years ago except that the ACTU stopped it. The then Prime Minister and the then Treasurer wanted to bring in a goods and services tax in 1985. We all remember the discussions held at the Lakeside late in the evening when it was decided that the Government must not do this. It was told it could not do this by the ACTU. I speak today for one clear reason only: the Government certainly represents those who belong to the unions but it does not represent those one million workers who are out of work and who require work. The Government has turned its back on these people who are so important to Australia. Those million people requiring jobs have now realised that the Labor Government and the unions that represent the working people are not working in their interests. I am concerned with the hardships and the health problems-they have been mentioned here today-that these unemployed people face. They come to my electorate office every day. They are like the aged people, who have complications with the assets test. Their health and well-being are affected. After having worked a lifetime they want a pleasant retirement but they are concerned with complicated limitations, restrictions and regulations imposed by all governments in this country, but particularly by this Government. Look at the average family person today with one, two, three or four children. They are anxious to see those children reared as Australians should be. They want to give them a proper home and send them to a proper school of their choice. But many of these people are out of work, and those who are working are over taxed. That is why we need an overall change with the GST. The issue at the next election will be our industrial relations problems. I represent an area in which tourism is strong. I am sure that the shadow Minister for industrial relations, employment and training, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), who is at the table, recognises that because he often goes there for a holiday-and we are pleased to see him. The penalty awards imposed by the Labor governments are helping to kill the tourism industry. We have five-day weeks-Monday to Friday-and on weekends people get double pay and time-and-a-half and whatever is involved. Today there is no incentive for people-small businessmen owning a hotel or a motel, industry or whatever-to employ additional staff. Employers in industry and business have cut their staff to a minimum simply because they are afraid of the awards and the problems boosting their costs of production and sending them into debt and bankruptcy. I speak today because we have never had so much bankruptcy in this country as we now have. I can remember that when I was a young fellow working on the farm and not receiving a pay at all, farmers in my area, including my own father, were employing people at 10 and 15 shillings a week. That used to hurt me, and it hurts me to this very day. I praise the unions for what they have done in safety matters. Unions are necessary in this country. But this land of ours has changed immensely. The greatest changes in employment in this country have been made by a Liberal-National Party government-not by the Labor Party. Over the years it has been a coalition government that has changed the Acts and provided freedom and safeguards to the workers of this country. The Labor Party is terribly hypocritical. I can remember some of the Labor Party members in the New South Wales Parliament criticising the Liberal-National Party Government over Mr Kerry Packer and the Packer family because they owned the Daily Telegraph, saying, 'They should be thrown out of Australia'. We should look at what this Government is doing today in respect of the Fairfax group. I know some Government members are very concerned about it. They should talk to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke); they should make sure that no arrangements are being made that might not be in the interests of future publications in this country. This Government has brought about many drastic changes. For example, it has privatised many of the public services that it said it never would privatise. The Government's problem is that it is down in the burrow with the ACTU and it cannot get out. Its base is becoming smaller and smaller. That is the reason why today fewer people belong to political parties. The independents and pressure groups are picking up within the community and will continue to do so while the Government narrows its base. Of course, we will broaden ours. We will continue to look after those people who we believe ought to receive assistance. I joined in this debate because, like you, Deputy Speaker, I represent people who want to see some freedom within the work force and employer-employee agreements on the factory floor. What people are looking for today is change. We are missing out on markets all around the world. The reasons why some of the industries of this country are moving offshore are that restrictions and high costs are imposed upon them in Australia. Government members should not be proud of themselves because they have reduced tariffs on clothing, footwear and the like. It would be a beautiful thing if we could reduce the tariffs, but we cannot afford to do so. At present the economy is so bad that, by reducing tariffs, the Government will force industries out of this country. Mr Wright interjecting",24
26,Mr COWAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The honourable member for Capricornia has such industries in his electorate. They are in Queensland. No wonder Queenslanders are talking today; industries in their State are moving offshore, and will cor tinue to do so while high costs and restrictions are being imposed upon them by this Government. So it is that this country is missing out on great progress-a country with the resources in minerals and soil but people who are unable to go ahead because the Government will not allow major works in the timber and the mining industries to occur. What about the Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport? As many as 60,000 people would have a job if the Government allowed that extra runway at the Sydney Airport. Government members are being held up in their planes, in the same way as I am being held up in mine. But the Government will not let the project go ahead, when every Australian knows that it should go ahead for the future of this country. The Government will not let it go ahead because it is tied down by its union bosses. It cannot afford to be. It knows that as well as I do. The Government has narrowed its representation to a very small base of Australian people, and it is failing to represent unemployed people. Some Government members are starting to wake up. They are putting pressure on the Prime Minister now, saying, Mr 'We have to do something about unemployment in Australia'. Of course they have to do it. The temporary measures of the past--the RED scheme and others-are not the answer to the problems that we have. We must change the base of the problem, which is the industrial relations concerns that have grown over a period of time. The New South Wales Government has just brought in such legislation. The unions cried-but the people rejoiced, because that is what they had elected the Greiner-Murray Government to do. I assure the House that, when we are elected to government at the next election, the same type of legislation will go through this place to take the handcuffs off the people of Australia. Mr Snowdon-Ohl",25
27,Mr COWAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The honourable member for the Northern Territory may laugh, but the average Australian will not laugh. If this country is to survive, and if our standards of living are to be maintained, we have to take off the shackles that are now in place, otherwise this country will become a Third World country-if it is not one at present. Our shipping has gone offshore. A major shipbuilder in my electorate, Carrington, has closed up. All around Australia, industries are either moving offshore or closing up. This country should not have this situation. As the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) said in the House yesterday, we should be processing our resources. We send all our coal, iron ore and uranium overseas. Of course we have to export those products; but let us process what we can in this country instead of importing steel and other products and commodities as we do. These things should not be occurring, and we know that. We should be ashamed. At times I am ashamed of being an Australian, and that is why I could not remain in my seat today and not rise to say something about this issue. I repeat that the issue at the next election will be industrial relations-not a goods and services tax, immigration or anything else. The issue in this country at this time has to be Australia? industrial relations. This issue has to be to free up this nation so that if people want to work and want to join a union, they can. We will not stop anybody joining a union. But the freedom will be there; it will not be compulsory. The freedom will be there for people to say, 'Yes, we want to join a union', or, 'No, we do not want to join a union'. Look at Britain's progress since Margaret Thatcher brought that it in. Mr Snowdon-New Zealand?",26
28,Mr COWAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The honourable member may laugh. Britain has come back; and it was down. This country is down under this Government, in the same way as Britain was down. Britain made a change, and we will make a change here, because the Australian people have the fortitude and the common sense to know that this can come. So I strongly support the amendment that has been moved by the Opposition.",26
29,Mr WRIGHT,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Capricornia) (11.09 a.m.)The honourable member for Lyne (Mr Cowan) is known in this place as a really nice guy, but I suggest that people who have listened, or who ultimately will read his speech, ought to write to him and ask him to go into some detail. If ever I have heard baloney in this House, I have just heard some 12 minutes of it. It would go well in the heartland of the National Party, and it would go well with people who do not think, but I suggest to the honourable member for Lyne that it is time he caught up with today's world. He finished his speech by talking about how Thatcherism was good for England. I will send him the material provided by this Parliamentary Library on all the commentaries about Thatcherism-what it has done to the people of Britain and how it has destroyed the economy of their country. It was an unbelievable statement by the honourable member for Lyne, demonstrating that he does not understand what has really taken place. I am pleased that the honourable member for Lyne has placed his position on the record. I believe he is espousing the position of the Liberals and Nationals-that they want Thatcherism in Australian. Is that what he is saying, that he wants Thatcherism in Mr Cowan-I am saying that she brought back",26
30,Mr WRIGHT,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"No, that is what he has said. Let us go a little bit further. The honourable member is also saying that he wants to see some change. I will ask him and he can answer, because I am sure that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, will not mind a little bit of response in this way. In order to sort out the tourist industry and other industries he went to, does he want to cut wages? Is that what he is saying? Mr Cowan-I am not talking about cutting wages.",26
31,Mr WRIGHT,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,He does not want to cut wages; but he has just said that he wants there to be freedom for people to work for what they like. Does he want to remove penalty rates? Mr Cowan-Yes.,27
32,Mr WRIGHT,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"He does. So he is saying that people ought to be able to be brought into work for one hour. Is that what he is saying? Mr Cowan-Why not, if they want to?",27
33,Mr WRIGHT,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"All right. So what he is saying is that a person ought to be able to be brought into work just for one hour. That is what he is saying. Let us place it on the record. He is saying, therefore, that there should be no payment for overtime, no additional payment for overtime. Mr Cowan-No, I am not saying that.",27
34,Mr WRIGHT,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Oh, he is not? I thought he said, 'Get rid of all penalty rates'.",27
35,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,Order!,27
36,Mr WRIGHT,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Through you, Mr Deputy Speaker.",27
37,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,The honourable member will remain silent. MI' WRIGHT-I will direct my questions through you.,27
38,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"If the honourable gentleman wants to conduct a conversation, he can go out into the members' hall and do so. If he wants to take part in the debate, he will do so.",27
39,Mr WRIGHT,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I say this through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, because I would expect that you would want truth and honesty in this House; you would want integrity. You sat there and listened to the honourable member for Lyne go on with all that baloney, and I am surprised that you would not want to see some sort of repartee in this debate.",27
40,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,Order!,27
41,Mr WRIGHT,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"So I put the question through you, Mr Deputy Speaker.",27
42,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,Order! The honourable gentleman will not reflect on the Chair. It is not what is said in the debate that the Chair is interested in; it is how it is said and whether it complies with the rules.,27
43,Mr WRIGHT,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I am putting it through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, because the honourable member for Lyne has just advocated a cut in wages; a removal of all penalty rates; a shift on all overtime-no payment, no additional compensation or remuneration or any sort of payment for oVeltime; and he wants, as he said, Thatcherism in Australia. It is amazing that that is now the stated position of the National Party and the coalition in this country. The honourable member has now left the chamber, which is a pity because I wanted to check with him whether he still believed in basic prices for rural producers; whether he still advocated orderly marketing. On the one hand he is saying, 'Take away the rights of the worker for basic award wages' but on the other, when it comes to his broad constituency, be they farmers or whatever, he wants them to have a guaranteed price. Honourable members will see that there is a hypocrisy here. That is the sort of hypocrisy we constantly get-the sort of hypocrisy that was picked up before by the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) when he took on the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) in talking about compulsory unionism. The honourable member for Bennelong argues that there should be no such thing as compulsory unionism for the ordinary worker, be he or she a miner or a worker in a hospital or anywhere else in the marketplace; but when it comes to solicitors, doctors, accountants and other professionals, it is a different matter. This debate is really an attack on the trade unions, but it is also more than that. It is an attack on every individual Australian worker. I believe that the amendment put forward by the honourable member for Bennelong has a very special objective: to continue to tear at the safety net protection of basic award wages for workers. That is what it is about. Honourable members opposite want to pursue this ideology they have-an ideology of some huge pool of unemployed or low paid wage earners who can be drawn upon at competiworkers tive prices by any employer at his price. it is also an aim to undermine the quality life of employees. People have to understand that, when the trade union movement attacked, they themselves are being attacked. I am not defending the excesses; I am not defending the trade unions when they go over the top with some of the ridiculous duplicated rules. But people have to understand that it has been the trade union movement and parpeople. liaments throughout this country that have built up a quality of life, that have built the protection, that have built up a standard of living, for all Australians. As I said, this amendment is also part Liberal-National Party's hidden agenda to promote its law of the jungle mentality in workplace. I am amazed at the honourable member for Bennelong, who, when he was Leader of the Oppositiorl, tended to have some pretty balanced views on these issues but who now, as part of the Hewson group, is running hard to cause this industrial conflict, to try to get some sort of turmoil out there in the workplace. I also believe that whole issue of productivity mentioned by opposite espouse. other honourable members on the other side is really a camouflage; it is a cover-up. are not really about productivity; they about trying to reduce wages and costs employers. It is really part of what the honmight ourable member for Lyne was talking aboutover part of the Thatcherism mentality. I see the honourable member for MCMillan (Mr Riggall) smiling. He knows I am right. That is what honourable members opposite ween them. are about. The very thing that Margaret Thatcher pursued in England, the very thing that Reagan pursued in America, is what honourable members opposite are about. What they do not accept and what the Australian people still believe-even though they do get confused about what some unions do and by the propaganda we constantly hear in this place against unions-is that people deserve a basic standard of living, and unions have worked to achieve that. People have a right to demand a basic income, and unions and others have worked to achieve that. Unions believe, and I believe most Australians believe, that should not just be at the mercy of the But boss. Unions are protection against that of boss-the boss, for instance, who will not employ a person if he or she is a member of is a union. I will give honourable members some examples in a moment of bosses who have just been, to use that term again, 'over the top'. But unionism is protection. Unionism is the maintenance of work standards. Unionism is about the basic quality of life for Let me come to the example of a person up who is totally opposed to my own political position-and I accept that. He was managing the Savoy Hotel in Rockhampton only months of the ago-not a decade ago, not years and years ago, but now at this time. His name is Henry the Marshall; his nickname is Harry; his other nickname is 'Diamond' Harry Marshall, allegedly because he wore a diamond in his tooth. I spoke to the present proprietor today. He said he had never seen the. diamond, but that was common knowledge. Let me talk about 'Diamond' Harry Marshall in recent times, in 1991, and of what he did, using the philosothis phy and ideology that honourable members He employed two young women who were They twins, but he paid them one wage between are them. He even put that in the newspapers. to That shows how flamboyant he was, one say, but it also shows how unbelievably the top, again, he was. He was prepared to employ these twin women. They were not able to get jobs, they worked for him as bar attendants, and they got paid one wage bet'Diamond' Harry Marshall employed a 15year-old girl-and I spoke to the girl, her sister and her mother-at the night club at night-time. She worked for at least three hours and she was paid $5 per hour. She used to start work at 11 o'clock at night. It cost her $12 to get to and from the hotel when her parents could not pick her up. She was getting $15 for the three hours and outlaying $12. And the honourable member for Lyne says, 'No overtime and no penalty rates'. That is the outcome-a I5-year-old girl who should not have been working there anyway getting paid $5 an hour. There is the example of another young bar attendant-and in fact there are a number of them ultimately. This fellow introduced what he called 'stand-by time': if people wanted to work at the Savoy Hotel, they turned up two hours before their starting time to be on stand-by. If there was a rush, they workedbut they got no pay for it. They got no pay until their allotted time began, but they were on stand-by. And those opposite in the Liberal and National parties believe that is fair. They believe they are the sorts of negotiations that ought to take place. I say that the people of Australia will not cop it. I say that the parents of Australia will not cop it. Those opposite say that cases like this will not happen. I say that they are happening right now. There are cases and cases and cases. When we went to the industrial inspectors about these cases, they said they could do nothing about them. And why? Because those employees are not in a union and there are no awards. That was the key: they were not in unions; there were no awards; nothing could be done about those problems. And those opposite are saying they want this to be the position for every Australian. Shame on them! I cite another case-one that I took to the Social Security office hoping that we would get exemption for prosecution of these people, but we could not, so we had to drop the case against the employer. This employer was encouraging unemployed people and people on compo to work at that hotel in shocking conditions and under unsafe practices. Thenand this is on record; I have a tape recording of it-employees said that, once they started work, they were threatened that if they said anything they would be dobbed in. He then paid them a pittance to work extremely long hours. That is the sort of thing honourable members opposite are advocating. Another person was employed as a kitchen hand. That person was given free board and $50 per week. Unbelievable situations have arisen. There has been one instance of a person working over 100 hours in the week for $200. When I say 'working', I mean being on call, being available, there, doing the things called upon to do, called out of the 10 by nine room, for $200 a week for overall 100 hours. That is what honourable members opposite want; that is what they are saying. This occurs not only in the hotel industry. Two years ago I came across a case of a farmer who employed a young person for $50 a week with board and lodging. The idea was that the kid was to get a calf every branding. After 18 months, and allegedly having seven or eight calves which were supposed to be his, he was kicked off the property because there was a dispute with the boss. Nothing could be done. Why? He was not in a union and there were no awards. A restaurateur was paying grown women-adult, mature women-$5 per hour and they paid their own tax. Is that what the Liberal and National parties want? Is that enterprise bargaining as they see it? That is what they are advocating. A handicapped person working on a building site was paid $40 per week. The other workers said, 'Look, fair enough; if it means this guy will get back into the normal stream of life let him come on the site and he can help clean up'. But he did not just sweep around; he did not just pick up a bit of rubbish. He got into the main work stream and was paid $40 a week. When the boss was taken on he reckoned the unions were stopping this guy from getting a job-and he was paying $40 a week. We found an illegal immigrant in a Chinese restaurant. He was found by Commonwealth officers living in the storeroom. That person was fed, he slept on a mattress in a storeroom and he was paid $60 a week. Those opposite reckon that is enterprise bargaining. That is what they are advocating. Ethnic workers employed at a club for $6 an hour pay their own tax, work no set hours and there is no overtime. There is nothing we can do about it. Why? They do not belong to a trade union and there are no awards. What does the honourable member for Bennelong say? He says: get rid of the awards, get rid of the unions. There is another employer who forced employees to sign a blank pay sheet showing the net amount they earned. But that was all-no hours were set down; no rate, no tax, no information. There is nothing we could do. Why? The person was not in a union and there were no awards. I suggest that these are just a few of the thousands upon thousands of examples that can be found right across this country, even now when we have a Labor government which pursues trade unionism and which wants basic standards and work conditions. It is still happening. Imagine what the outcome would be if the likes of the honourable member-for Lyne, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), the honourable member for Benne10ng and all these others ever got their way. God help this country if they ever do. I acknowledge that Australia needs to compete, but not at the expense of the ordinary employee. We do not want to be like America. I have been there and I have seen it. Workers survive not on wages but on the tips they get. I had the chance to go to one of the airports and sit down with some of the porters there who were members of the Teamsters Union. They talked about the wages they were getting and how they survived only on the tips they were given. That is the sort of thing which will result from what those opposite are saying. I talked to waitresses over there who also survive on the tips they get. In fact, it is so bad that when you go into a restaurant they put the tip on the bill regardless of whether you want to pay it. I know there are some difficulties. There is real conflict and contrast in terms of wages here and elsewhere. In my own area we have pineapple farmers paying between $8 and $9 an hour who are competing with pineapple product coming in from Thailand where the people get paid $1 a day. There is worse than that. I was in Vietnam a year or so ago. Before I went a person from the area of the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) rang me about some cyclic bags he produces. He pays $9 an hour. In Vietnam they were being paid $US 1 a month to make the same bags. So we do have those difficulties. But we will not overcome those difficulties by destroying the very fabric of the system we have in this country, by casting out the awards and the basic wages. We do not want to go back to the old days in the mining industry when the miner bought his own light, supplied his own tools, even bought his own explosives, and worked long, dangerous hours. This applies to the TWU in the same way. If it were not for the unions today we would have unsafe vehicles everywhere. Our trains could be unsafe. The unions have maintained the standards, particularly the TWU, for instance, because I have been involved in the petroleum inquiry. ",27
44,Mr WRIGHT,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Shipping is the same. We are advocating that all fuel in this country be shifted by TWU drivers. Let me point out that this view has been backed by APADA, the distributors organisation in this country. Why? Because it means that TWU drivers carry dangerous goods certificates. They will drive only safe vehicles. What Australian wants to be at a service station when some idiot who does not know how to handle the truck roars in with 30,000 litres on board in an unsafe vehicle? Who wants to be heading down the highway with some idiot driving· down the road carrying 30,000 litres of inflammable fuel? Who wants that? Who wants them to go into refineries? No-one. The unions are saying it, we say it, the consumer movement says it, the oil refineries say it: use TWU drivers because they will be safe; they set the standards. We find that today in the petroleum and transport industries. It is true across the board, be it in health, food manufacturing or any of these different areas-and honourable members opposite want to tear it apart. Let us not forget it was the building unions which took on the asbestos issue. Honourable members opposite and their employers and all their expert health people said there was no problem with asbestos. Today it has all changed. Why? Because the building unions said no. The building unions in Queensland started it with their special health committee at the Trades Hall in Brisbane. They took up the fight and today they say, 'No more asbestos'. Yet honourable members opposite keep attacking the trade union movement. They have no understanding of the past· they have no understanding of what has bee- done. I make the point, and I accept, that unions can go over the top, and in the past I believe they have-but the vast majority of times the unions are a barrier against exploitation and we in this country should never forget it.",30
45,Mr RIGGALL,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I apologise because I am not on the speakers list, but I now wish to contribute to this debate on the Prime Minister and Cabinet Legislation Amendment Bill. Mter listening to the last two or three speakers from the other side, I am moved to put a bit of balance into the debate. It seems to me that the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Wright) has come up with some rather unfortunate cases where employers have not done the right thing. He has based his whole case on a number of isolated instances which justify having a closed union shop. I wish he would come back and listen to this because . IS. Important. It . We are talking about an amendment moved by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) which talks about freedom-freedom of - h-ice. - t does not talk about getting rid of uruomsm; It talks about the freedom to decide whether one wants to be involved in it. Why are members of the Government so passionate about keepin- a closed union shop? Why are they all standm- up and saying, 'This is it; if we do not have It we will have slavery in this country', as the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) said? It is crazy; it is not true. They are so passionate about it because it is their electoral college; it is where their support and their finances come from-union dues compulsorily put into Labor Party coffers. That is something that none of them - ould deny. That is why they are so pasSIOnate about compulsory unionism in the workplace; they are worried about their power base. They are not worried about the individual workers in the workplace, and there are many examples of that. It is something they should hang their heads in shame over. They do not understand that we are proposing freedom of choice, that if one wants to be in a union one can be; if one wants to go under what the union gets for one in the award, one can do so. But if someone has a few brains and wants to use his skills and expertise, and wants to work a little bit harder and get a little bit more pay and have a win-win situation where the boss wins with increased productivity and the employee wins with more money in his pocket, that is what free enterprise bargaining is all about. That is what a voluntary employment agreement is all about. That system is working well; there are examples of it around this country right now. Coming from Victoria, I see the fellow travellers of these people opposite. Let me list a couple of them. There is Wally Curran-a man who wants a closed shop in the meat industry. Why? So he can continue his destructive path through that industry in Victoria where the industrial relations are so bad that livestock is transported to Queensland to be slaughtered. That is how inefficient the union has made the Victorian abattoirs. ' Norm Gallagher is a name that often comes up. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) was so proud of him that during his economic summit he brought him right into the Parliament. What did Norm Gallagher do with the BLF? Large industrial sites were raped; the union movement was raping what was happening on those sites in Victoria. The Housing Association is one of the most efficient industries building houses in Australia. Side by side in the same industry when we get to large high rise flats and buildings, where the BLF and other unions have control, there is gross inefficiency and gross corruption. John Halfpenny is another name that comes up. He is a great man to be proud of. The Government nearly made him a senator it was so proud of him. What did he do? His record is endless; he has created unnecessary strikes and unnecessary hardship in the workplace. He wants a closed shop so that he can control the workers who are under him, his power base. He is frightened to give them the freedom of choice because if he does he will not have a union movement; they will throw him out. A closed shop suits his power game, and that is what it is all about. The ultiplate name in the union leadership was a fellow who led the ACTU a few years ago, a bloke by the name of Hawke. He is the one who has got this country into debt to the tune of $130 billion, and there are one million people unemployed at the moment. When he tried to become a boss with Bourke's ACTU store and Solo, what happened to those organisations? They went broke because he did not have the management skills; he used union principles to try to run free enterprise. It did not work and his own members would not support him. Just recently we have had the case of SPC in Victoria, a classic example of a company that was getting itself into financial difficulties. It had troubles with exports and troubles with work practices-they were not efficient. The management and the employees got together and said, 'Can we do it better to save this enterprise?'. What did they do? They lifted their productivity by 50 per cent because they got together and worked smarter. Halfpenny's answer to that was, 'You can't do it; we won't let you shift those imposts, those demarcation disputes that we have put in place'. He did not want it because it broke down his power base, not because it saved their jobs or because that company is now viable and paying better than award wages. He did not want to lose his power base. That is the fundamental argument that keeps coming through from the Government members; they do not want to lose their power base or their money. In my own electorate the Neerim South Soldiers Memorial Hospital, a bush nursing hospital, has been running for many years. The Victorian Government's and this Government's well-managed economy threw it to the wall: it is not allowed to get payment from Medicare and it now operates as a 14-bed private hospital in a small community. It recently got into financial trouble because of the trouble the broader community was experiencing. Many people were not carrying private health insurance and could not afford to go to that little hospital. The staff in that hospital said, 'We love our job, we love this hospital; it is part of the community and it is part of our lives. We are prepared to take a 5 per cent cut in pay'. It was a modest cut in pay, but a very important one. The union movement said, 'No, you can't do that, you cannot save your own jobs. You will take full pay. We'll fight you in the industrial relations court, which will cost the hospital management more than you will save'. That was its answer. It was a case of industrial muscle and industrial bully tactics. The nurses took their full pay and paid tax on it. The hospital paid all its tax and overheads and then gave the 5 per cent back. It is a nonsense system. It wasted money that could have so easily been used there. The classic example of demarcation disputes in my electorate is the SEC. Before I comment on the SEC and what happened with demarcation disputes, I point out that it happened some years back and, in spite of the closed shop, great progress has been made towards increased productivity with the union movement. I congratulate the SEC on that; it is excellent. It has not gone far enough yet and there are still too many unnatural imposts on the productivity of that organisation but, even so, it is moving in the right direction. Let me say where the union movement is coming from in regard to the low base. At one particular stage a sman electric motor had broken down and it had to be shifted into the workshop. The first guy who came along was an electrician. What did he do? He turned it off and unplugged it. The next fellow who came along was a welder and he cut a bracket that was holding the electric motor. The next fellow who came along was a fitter and turner and he unbolted some bolts from the other side of the motor. The next chap who came along was a rigger and he had to sling the motor. A fork-lift and a fork-lift driver were then brought out. As well as that, the tradesmen all had trades assistants. There were approximately eight people lifting this small electric motor off the shop floor into the workshop. Any farmer in the district would have come along and unplugged it, unbolted it, cut the bracket and had it in the workshop within half an hour. But it took these people 11/2 days to shift this small electric motor into the workshop because of nonsense demarcation disputes. That is just not good enough. While this situation has improved, demarcation disputes still exist in many areas and create massive inefficiency for industries. When I go to my electorate and talk to these people on the shop floor they say one thing quite clearly to me; that is, they want management to improve their structure so that they can get on with the job and get the authority to get the job well and truly done. They want the union movement off their backs for the same reason-so that they can work in teams to get the job done properly and efficiently. Why? Because they are decent Australians who want to get on. They like the place where they work but are frustrated by the system that is imposed on them. There is another case involving Rocklea Spinning Mills, which has had trouble over a number of years. Unfortunately two or three years ago there was a fire and the place was burnt down. This was a great tragedy and people immediately lost their jobs. The safety net of social security came into place. An organisation called the Latrobe Regional Commission was able to help it fast track by offering some finances to get the place rebuilt. The local council worked very hard and eventually this mill was put back together. It did not take all that long. When this mill was put back together, there were two fundamental changes: firstly, it was able to re-employ those employees who were fair dinkum and wanted to work; and, secondly, it brought in the latest technology. The change in that mill-from a mill that was struggling to sell its produce because of price to what it is capable of today-is shown by the fact that it has taken on board world best standards. It is paying its people well and it is expanding. It is selling everything it can produce and it is expanding to put two more spinning machines in. It is fabulous to see that occurring. It was able to do that because of a tragedy which broke the nonsense of a closed workshop and got rid of the inefficient practices, as well as bringing in the latest technology. We are talking about a partnership between management and the workers. That is what voluntary employment is about-getting the best out of it so that it is a win-win situation. Those things are fundamentally important; they represent freedom. That is something that the members of the Government should take on board very seriously. They should also think about world best practices because, until . this nation adopts world best practices, it will be in trouble forever and a day. Victorian Railways at the moment is losing something like $1.3 billion per annum. I tell people who visit this magnificent building that that amount is about the cost of this building. The inefficiency of the Victorian Railways, caused by union domination and bad management practices, is very much dragging that State down. Let me give another example of the sort of nonsense that is carried on in that State. One organisation in my electorate was able to hold its costs back to a 1 per cent increase in the last 12 months. Its suppliers did exactly the same thing. The organisation had a budgeted saving of $5m. State and Federal government charges increased by 11 per cent and cost it $6m, so it was down $lm. While it made all the improvements in efficiency, governments did not. What do we find in governments? We find a closed union shop in the workplace and work practices which are not acceptable and which made it difficult for that company, which is in the export game, to survive. For the first time in its 50-year history it closed down for a week this year to try to save funds. Yet the Government is thrusting on that company its 11 per cent increase in costs. I refer to the Herald-Sun of last Monday. There is an article there entitled 'Death of the unions'. Honourable members on the other side of the House ought to read that article because it makes very interesting reading.",31
46,Mr HOWARD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"There is a good one above it, too.",33
47,Mr RIGGALL,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"There is an excellent one above it as well, but we will stick to 'Death of the unions' at this stage. Unions reached their peak in numbers in 1953, when 63 per cent of the work force was in the union movement. Why has the percentage dropped since 1953? The answer is quite simple. Now something like 40 per cent of workers are in unions, and it is freely predicted in union circles, according to this article, that membership will, drop to about 25 per cent by the tum of the century. So the union movement itself is predicting that membership will drop to 25 per cent. Why is this? It is because the union movement is not relevant to the family man or to the individual on the shop floor; who is finding it a burden. No longer do workers need draconian domination by the union movement. That does not say that the union movement cannot and should not become a viable option in the workplace, but it has got to change from its current position where it does not believe in freedom. I put it to honourable members opposite that I will stand up for the right of a worker to join the union movement, but I challenge those opposite to stand up for the right of that same worker not to join the union movement. There should be freedom of choice. The option of those opposite is: 'Join the union or don't work'. That is no option at all. That is what those opposite are all about. To show how out of touch the union movement is and how the left wing has got control of it, I quote from this article: Overall in Australian unionism, the influence the extreme Left has declined in recent years. But their legacy still colors union activities and titudes. A good example of this was the reaction the union movement to the Gulf crisis. No union, with the exception of the Federated Iron workers' Association (FIA)and I congratulate itdeclared support for the Hawke Government, the right. United Nations and the allied powers in the Gulf conflict. Does that say something to the Australian population? It says just how out of touch the union movement is with Australians generally. In this debate it is pleasing for me to stand to support the honourable member for Benbecause nelong in his proposed changes to this Bill because they make common sense. They are about freedom and they are in the ANZAC tradition.",33
48,Mr BEVIS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"This debate is notable for a couple of reasons. It is notable for the fact that so many people entered the debate without having intended to do so before the commencement of the some proceedings earlier today. I think that demonber strates a few things. Firstly, it demonstrates that the subject of industrial relations viewed as being important by this Parliament and the people in it. It is important not just because it has significant economic effects, as it clearly does, but because it is fundamental to the human rights of the people of Australia. It also demonstrates the enormous gulf that exists between the Opposition Liberal and National parties in this place and the Labor Government on the important fundamental questions concerning industrial relations and individual rights. I am pleased to enter this debate. I am very pleased also to follow some of my Queensland colleagues-the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) and the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Wright). As the honourable member for Hinkler correctly pointed out, it may be that a number of Queensland members have been moved to enter this debate because, unlike others in this country, we have experienced the ravages of unfettered voluntary employment agreements savagely inflicted on the workers of Queensof land by the Bjelke-Petersen National Party atGovernment. My recollection is that the Fedof eral Opposition did not support the voluntary employment agreements as they were proposed by the Bjelke-Petersen Government.",34
49,Mr HOWARD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Yes, we did. There were other things I did not support, but he got that",34
50,Mr BEVIS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I stand corrected. I am informed by the Opposition spokesperson, the honourable member for Bennelong, that the Opposition did support the initiatives of the Queensland National Party Government. That up makes my task a little easier as I go on I was going to credit the Opposition with not having supported the Bjelke-Petersen Government at that time and to wonder at its later change of view. But now that I know that the Opposition supported voluntary agreements it makes my task so much easier. Before I go to some of the comments that have the honourable member for Bennelong made as Opposition spokesperson, I want to refer to of the things that the honourable memfor MCMillan (Mr Riggall) referred to. He made some reference at the outset to concerns is that we might have on this side about the question of union donations to the Labor Party. He somehow tried to link that to our contributions in this debate. Let us make it clear and put it finnly on the record that it is this Labor Government that has introduced legislation to require full disclosure of all donations to all political parties. We have nothing to hide about the sources of our funding. Quite frankly, it was only because of the position which the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) found himself in, embarrassingly, that the Liberal and National parties changed their view on disclosureafter we had announced our intentiort to introduce legislation. The fact of the matter is that this GovernBourke's ment and this Party have been at the forefront of requiring public disclosure of donations. is the Opposition parties that have opposed As as recently as last month, before the Queensland EARC inquiry, the Liberal Party and the National Party in Queensland put ward submissions opposing full disclosure of donations to State political parties. So no-one from the National Party or the Liberal should talk to us about disclosure of funds political parties, because right now the policy of those parties in Queensland is to oppose disclosure. That was the official view put the EARC inquiry in Queensland last month. It is the Labor Party that has represented interests not only of workers but also of open government. There were a couple of other matters raised by the honourable member for MCMillan that deserve a response. He referred to Norm Gallagher and to our involvement some how with him. I have never met Norm Gallagher, and I have no great desire to; but I think record will show that Norm Gallagher built his power under the patronage and support of a State Liberal Government. It was during the period of a State Labor Government and Federal Labor Government that Norm Galin lagher and his cronies were brought to acseeks count. Indeed, the ACTU itself took Norm Gallagher and his union. It was the State Labor Government in Victoria and the Federal Labor Government here in Canberra that took action. It was the Labor Government that deregistered that union. The Liberals have sat there piously and spoken about it. They created the big bogy and in fact did nothing. If the truth be known, it was during a period of Liberal stewardship in Victoria that Gallagher got his power. I would like to comment on a couple of other matters, including the matter of Bourke's store. The facts of life are that, had it not been for Bourke's store, resale price maintenance would have continued. The great success of Bourke's store and the initiative which the trade union movement took at that time-many people have forgotten this; some may not have known it at the time-is that store was the only retail outlet in the country that took on the big manufacturers It and said, 'We will sell your product to our it. customers at less than what you tell us we have to sell it for'. In those days that could not be done, because if a retailer said, as for Bourke's did to Kodak and Dunlop, 'We will sell your products cheaper than you tell us we should', they simply stopped supplying. The Party retailer could not get any more Dunlop to products or any more Kodak products. The reason, and no other, why the backbone of resale price maintenance was broken is that to the ACTU went directly into retailing. It may be because some honourable members opthe posite did not take a great interest in those matters at that time that they are not aware of it, but that is in fact the case. So far as demarcation disputes are concerned, I just comment that the trade union movement internally has done more to address demarcation disputes than anything that the Opposition or the employer groups have the attempted to do over the last 20 years. When up we compare ourselves with similar countries, we realise that to have 300-plus unions in our country is a nonsense. In the last five years, a the ACTU has gone further than at any time the last century to address that problem and to reduce that 300 to something like 50 and, in the process, eliminate virtually all action against demarcation disputes. I find it passing strange that the Opposition's policy would increase the number of unions from the 300-odd that we have now to enterprise units which, if we use the sorts of enterprise calculations that have been done with the consumption tax, would number something like three-quarters of a million trade unions in the country. The final point I make in respect of the comments of the honourable member for McMillan relate to the question of conscientious objection. He may not be aware of the provisions in various pieces of legislation for conscientious objectors. There is every opportunity for a person who does not want to be in a union not to join and to register as a conscientious objector. Every union in this land respects that decision and in no way impedes a person who has that firm view. As a person who was a union official enforcing those matters, I can attest to that quite clearly. I would like to be able to comment on some of the things that the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Cowan) said, but I fear I will run out of time. I will leave that until later to see whether time permits me to come back to some of the points that he endeavoured to make. There has been much said by Opposition members about what their policy is. I wish they had read for themselves what their policy is. I wish they had read the statements of their shadow spokesperson, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). I commend to the House, and in particular those Liberal spokespersons who have entered this debate, an article by the honourable member for Bennelong in the Current Affairs Bulletin of June of this year. I want to refer to some of the things that he said because, quite frankly, he has put the official statement there under the very well identified heading 'Industrial Relations in Australia-a Liberal view'. This is what their shadow spokesman has said is the Liberal view. I will quote directly from his article: What is needed to minimise the risk of a wages break-out in normal economic circumstances is an optional alternative system of enterprise bargaining that would allow firms to opt out of the existing industrial relations jurisdiction and formulate own YEAs in the ordinary common law jurisdiction. So he has put up front very clearly the desire to have an alternative system which in no way relates to an industrial tribunal under the normal processes that we have known of since 1904 in this country. He went on: . First, we shall legislate to allow employers and employees to bargain directly, and to formulate an agreement that can be ratified and have the force of an industrial award without the intervention of third parties ... Then he lists who the third parties might be: The tribunals, the unions, the employers' associations or governments. He has eliminated the umpire. He has eliminated the industrial tribunal, as well as the advocates for both the employers and the employees, and he has eliminated the Government from the process. There is no yardstick against which those agreements will be measured. There is no tribunal to which parties can go to have a dispute arbitrated. There is no tribunal to which they can go to determine whether or not the standards are in fact comparable, just and fair. He went on: ... our VEAswhich is a term I am very familiar with in Queensland, and I think the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Wright) enunciated very well the sorts of end products one gets from VEAswill need only to provide a minimum wage consistent with the existing minimum wage in the equivalent award and comply with existing health and safety regulations. That is all workers will be entitled to. Anything above that, and they will have to go and argue for themselves. I put it to the honourable member for Bennelong: what does he propose be done with standard hours, with sick leave, with annual leave, with long service leave, with maternity leave, overtime, penalty rates, annual leave loadings? None of those things will be guaranteed to any worker in this land under his proposal-not one of them. We will go back to the days when for a female employee who fell pregnant there was no such thing as maternity leave. She lost her job. She their was not a productive little unit in the enterprise, and it was out the door for her. That did not happen just in the so-called nasty, small section of the employer group that we hear about. That was also the official policy of some State governments until about 20 years ago. If a woman who worked for a State government-and public servants had conditions better than most-fell pregnant, that was it. There was no leave and no job. She was out the door. That was 20 years ago. It is not a long time ago. That is just one of the conditions. Leave loading, out the door; annual leave, out the door; standard hours, out the door. I have spoken before in this place about the view of the honourable member for Bennelong on standard hours. He is on the record as supporting a 40-hour week. He believes that we should immediately introduce a 40-hour week. I am pleased to note and record again that the Confederation of Australian Industry and the Business Council of Australia, soon after he made that call, rejected it. They at least had the good sense in February of this year not to go along with the honourable member for Bennelong in his call for a 40-hour week.",34
51,Mr HOWARD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,They got it wrong.,37
52,Mr BEVIS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,Has the honourable member for Bennelong convinced them now? Are they in support of a 40-hour week?,37
53,Mr HOWARD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,They are still invincibly ignorant on that.,37
54,Mr BEVIS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"It is comforting to hear that the Confederation of Australian Industry is still at odds with him at least over that point. I want to return to a couple of other comments in the article in the Current Affairs Bulletin to which I referred. The honourable member for Bennelong went on to say: Whatever else is in the VEA is up to the employers and the employees themselves. So the worker receives a statement of his wages and he gets the minimum conditions, whatever the law of the land says for safety, and that is it. Everything else is up for negotiation, not with the union, not before a tribunal and not with an umpire, but by the workers, John and Mary Citizen, sitting down with their boss in his board room, to try to negotiate their holidays, whether they are going to have three weeks, four weeks or none. If we look at America, which has a quasi system of this sort, it depends on which State they work in whether they receive one week's annual leave or two or three. It is rare in America to get four weeks annual leave. Even within the one State, it varies from company to company and from occupation to occupation. That is the sort of position we are talking about-reducing not just rates of pay but also annual leave; increasing hours of work. The honourable member for Bennelong wants them to go up immediately. He said: Employees may choose to bargain through a union, although only a shop union or an individual employee would be parties to the VEA. We are going to have three-quarters of a million unions in this country, one for every enterprise, because only a shop union, not an enterprise, can negotiate the agreement.",37
55,Mr HOWARD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,I didn't say that.,37
56,Mr BEVIS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,lam afraid that is the direct quote.,37
57,Mr HOWARD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"No, no. You contradicted yourself. You quoted it correctly at first. I said that a union would be able to negotiate on behalf of people, but the legal obligation will be from the individual employees.",37
58,Mr BEVIS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"No. I have not taken anything out between those two sentences. The exact quote is: Whatever else is in the VEA is up to the employers and the employees themselves. Employees may choose to bargain through a union, although only a shop union or an individual employee would be parties to the VEA. There will have to be a union entity in that shop to sign the agreement. We will talk about it later. He said, 'We shall legislate to eliminate compulsory unionism'. I am always entertained by this debate over compUlsory unionism, because it does not exist. There is no award, no law, in this land that enforces, requires or enables compulsory unionism to exist. Within the jurisdiction of the Commission, there is an opportunity to afford preference of employment to unionists, which is something that I support. It is a preference subject to conditions and it is inserted in awards not because unions just go and ask for it. The union has to, in fact, present a case to the umpire, the Commission, and convince the Commission that it should be inserted. Only then is preference inserted. Preference is not compulsory unionism. That is a very clear situation which I have had personal dealings with. Finally, the honourable member for Bennelong said in this argument that 'the abolition of compulsory unionism could also be expected to weaken the existing award system and promote voluntary employment agreements'. The hope, the desire and the plan is to eliminate unions, to eliminate awards, to go to voluntary agreements-to go to the lowest common denominator. That is what it is all about. It sounds very reminiscent of what we have seen in the UK, where unemployment has gone up every month over the last 16 months. It sounds very similar to what we have seen in New Zealand, where there is what is called a new employment contract. There is a very interesting article that I commend to those opposite called 'Deregulating Labour LawNew Zealand's Employment Contracts Act 1991'. It is written by Gordon Anderson, who is the senior lecturer in the Commercial Law Group at the University of Wellington. It is a very informative article. He refers to a couple of things in the Act which are worth noting. In Australia, we are witnessing a transformation to the far right of those opposite to adopt these sorts of views. We have already had expressed here today a commitment to the Thatcherite views on industrial relations. This is the New Zealand conservative view of industrial relations: While the employer must recognise the authority of an employee representativeand that sounds a bit similar to what the honourable member for Bennelong had to saythere is no obligation to actually negotiate with person. The Act goes further than recognising individual freedom of choice. The words 'freedom of choice' are great words and I wish that I had the time to talk a bit more about that, but I do not. To continue: It places obstacles in the way of workers wishing to organise collectively by making many of the conditions necessary for such organisation dependent upon employer goodwill. Here is the crunch: For example, unions have no right to enter an employer's premises for organisational purposes and there is no requirement for an employer to recognise or bargain, let alone bargain in good faith, with a union even if it enjoys majority support amongst the members concerned. In a voluntary employment situation proposed by the Opposition and in practice today in New Zealand, the individual employees or their representative, if in fact they are able to get a union into the workplace to negotiate, have no right to meaningful negotiations. Nothing in law compels the employer to sit down and negotiate. In that sort of conflict situation, as it occurs today, there is recourse to the Tribunal-go to the umpire and get a result. The Opposition's proposal would deliberately eliminate the Tribunal, the umpire, from the process and give to that employer the unfettered opportunity to bludgeon the work force as time and circumstance permit. Let there be no mistake-this is an independent assessment. This is the assessment of the senior lecturer at the University of Wellington of what it has done in New Zealand and what it would do here: It is difficult to see how the introduction of such legislation in a depressed economy can be anything other than an attempt to de-unionise much of the New Zealand workforce and to allow employers to 'negotiate'that is in inverted commas because there is no genuine negotiationreduced wages and conditions. The agenda is all about reduced wages and conditions; it is not negotiation in a real sense. At least in America there is a requirement of law that meaningful negotiation must occur. I have not heard that once from that the people on the Opposition benches here and it certainly has not applied in New Zealand. The Opposition is not even going to provide the protection that the slack American system affords unions, which system at least guarantees the opportunity for meaningful negotiation. Why has all this transpired at this time? I must confess that I am a bit confused as to why the Opposition should froth aUhe mouth about these issues at this time. Industrial disputation is at record lows. It is a quarter of what it was when those opposite were in government. Unit labour costs have fallen to levels below what they were in 1981-82. So unit labour costs are down. Reform in the workplace is occurring at a faster rate than at any time in our history. Again, I do not have time to go through them, but there are a number of articles on waterfront reform, often referred to as a litmus test by Opposition members, which identify the enormous strides that have occurred in waterfront reform. There has been an 80 per cent lift in wharf efficiency-full marks on the waterfront. I do not have time to go through it, but it is clear that microeconomic reform is occurring and is working. Productivity is increasing; strikes are down; unit labour costs are down. And out of the blue, the Opposition decides that it wants to bludgeon the trade union movement and the workers of this country even more. If the Opposition proceeds with its voluntary employment agreements, it will get the reaction in the Australian community that it got in Queensland. I look forward to this debate as it unfolds in the next 18 months to two years. And I look forward to the next election.  tary to the Prime Minister) (12.06 p.m.)-I would like to thank all honourable members who participated in what turned out to be a fairly wide-ranging debate. I have my suspicions as to the cause of that but, nevertheless, I sincerely thank all honourable members for contributing. On the Government side, we had the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes), the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice), the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Wright) and the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis). On the Opposition side, we had the shadow Minister for Industrial Relations, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford), the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Atkinson), the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Cowan) and the honourable member for MCMillan (Mr Riggall). I thank the shadow Minister for his general support of the legislation although, as he has indicated, he has already moved an amendment. I thought that the honourable member for Bendigo made a particularly thoughtful contribution on aspects of the Prime Minister and Cabinet Legislation Amendment Bill. He specifically raised some issues which I would like to respond to. He made some comments about the proposed amendment to section 9(4)(a) and its effect on the client-lawyer relationship of confidentiality and trust. The amendment will place beyond doubt the ability of the Ombudsman, in the course of investigations, to require documents that are subject to legal professional privilege to be given to him. Legal advice is that the Ombudsman does have this power at present. However, the Government, perhaps out of an excess of caution, considers it desirable to place this point beyond doubt. As the honourable member for Bendigo said, the amendment simply expresses what is already implied. This places information of this nature on the same basis as other information which the Ombudsman may need to obtain to undertake inquiries. This needs to be placed in the context of the trust that is placed in the office and person of the Ombudsman-that he is a person of probity and honesty. One needs to accept that the Ombudsman, by virtue of his functions, will from time to time need to be in possession of material of varying degrees of sensitivity. If it was otherwise, he could not undertake his important tasks. In undertaking those tasks, great care is taken by him to have regard to the sensitivity of the information in his possession. In addition, the House should note that sections 35 and 35A of the Ombudsman Act prevent communication of information acquired under the Act otherwise than for the purposes of the Ombudsman performing his functions under the Act. I should also point out that the situation - rose from a practical problem of a Commonwealth department providing legal advice to another department and has been enacted to overcome that problem. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie felt that the exclusion of Norfolk Island from the Resource Assessment Commission Act 1989 in fact did not go far enough. Whilst he made a very colourful contribution and his views about conservation are well known, I cannot share his view that the Bill does not go far enough. It is fair to say that there was a great deal of discussion during the debate about the amendment and, in particular, the industrial relations implications of the amendment, as well as detailed views on both sides of the House about enterprise bargaining. Indeed, I think the fact that additional honourable members came into the debate is a reflection of a keen interest in that. I point out to the House that in the Industrial Relations Commission's decision to allow enterprise bargaining, which the shadow Minister indicated he supported but which, he said, did not go far enough, there were requirements on the parties: that the requirements under the established structural efficiency principle have bccn met; that agreed wage increases are to be based on measures to achieve real gains in productivity; that agreements are to be for a fixed term and involve no further wage or salary increases beyond that term; and that agreements are not to involve a reduction in ordinary time earnings or departures from established standards of hours of work and paid annual leave and long service leave. In what at times was a passionate debate there was general agreement on some issues. Honourable members on both sides would like to see productivity increases; there seemed to be uniform support for the elimination of demarcation disputes; and both the Government and Opposition saw great benefit in closer cooperation between workers and management. I think that was about the extent of the agreement. The shadow spokesman said that his proposed changes were not intended to destroy trade unions. Obviously, we on the Government side saw that as one of his outcomes, and a number of honourable members spoke about outcomes. I make a few comments in relation to specific parts of the amendment. It seems ironic that at a time wh-n we are arguing that union membership has slipped to 41 per cent, Opposition members are still arguing about the enormous power exercised by trade unions in this country. The issue of compulsory membership of trade unions was raised but, as a number of Government speakers pointed out in their contributions to the debate, the Opposition never seems to raise the issue of people being compulsorily prevented from joining a union as part of the price of having a job. The honourable member for Capricornia outlined some of the consequences suffered by ordinary people when they do not have the protection of trade unions. Comments were also made about the abolition of automatic deductions for union dues for people within Commonwealth departments and authorities. I have worked under that system and under a system without automatic deductions. Under Fraser, the system of automatic deductions was abolished and then reintroduced. Whilst it is a sort of irritant measure, it shows the extent to which the Opposition will go to oppose trade unions. A number of examples were given where Opposition members felt that the only way improvements in productivity, work practices and cooperation could be achieved was by breaking down union· power. Whilst I would not dispute that, there are, equally, a number of examples where there has been good cooperation between the trade unions, management .and workers-and sometimes even the Government-in achieving outstanding changes. For example, through a process of negotiation, and with equality between the parties, we recently had changes on the waterfront which are resulting in dramatic increases in productivity. That is something that for too long has been given up as being too difficult, but we are working on that. In private enterprise examples of what can be achieved include Williamstown dockyard and the changes that are occurring in the car industry. I welcome particularly Toyota's decision to spend another $450m in capital investment on achieving productivity changes and improvements and the elimination of demarcation disputes that honourable members have talked about. The Government can indicate quite a number of examples where a system that we favour, a system which recognises the position of ordinary workers and recognises that the position of ordinary workers is not equal with employers, can achieve the same, if not greater, change. Like the honourable member for Brisbane, I welcome the opportunity to argue in the future about the best approach to industrial relations. The honourable member for MCMillan mentioned world best practice. We ought to give credit to the Government. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) has already introduced a scheme with the objective of encouraging companies which are already adopting world best practice and allowing the benefits of their knowledge and experience to be distilled to other countries. The Opposition made claims about the power of the trade unions and blamed the trade unions for the problems in industrial relations. We on the Government side remind the honourable member for La Trobe and the honourable member for Isaacs of an experience in Tasmania. I think it best sums up the Government's attitude. We were looking at the impact of award restructuring in a pulp mill. We asked one of the union delegates, 'How would you describe the difference between the process before award restructuring and the process that you are involved in now?' I think both the honourable member for La Trobe, the deputy chairman of the committee concerned, and the honourable member for Isaacs would recall that that person said, 'Well, when I turned up at 8 a.m.', or whatever time it was, 'I was expected to bundy on and leave my brains behind; today, as part of the process of award restructuring, my input is valued. I am expec- Scott, L. J. ted to make it and there are a lot of benefits to be gained'. In the industrial relations area there was some agreement about what outcomes we were looking for, but there was passionate disagreement about the best method of achieving that. We will have to wait until the next election to see who is right or wrong. I thank the House and I thank all honourable members for their contributions.

59,Mr JULL,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"The Transport and Communications Legislation NOES Amendment Bill 1991 is a mishmash of amendments to a number of Bills dealing with bodies ranging from the Federal Airports Corporation and the Civil Aviation Authority through to Australian National Railways and even including the Parliamentary Proceedings Broadcasting Act. Today I would like to confine my comments on the Bill to the areas that directly concern my shadow portfolio responsibilities in tourism. There are a number of amendments to the Civil Aviation Act 1988 along the same lines as those applying to the Australian National Railways section of the Bill. I will leave it to my colleague the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) to give an analysis of Reith, P. K. that section of the Bill as it applies to both the Civil Aviation Authority and the Australian National Railways. The amendments mainly concern confirmation of the power of a government business enterprise to enter into financial management risks or hedging transactions. As well, the Bill clarifies earlier PAIRS amendments: both the Civil Aviation Authority and the Federal Airports Corporation are liable to pay income tax. The amendments also remove any legal doubt about the Civil Aviation Authority'S power to delegate safety functions, under the civil aviation regulations, to industry bodies. However, I believe a couple of aspects of the Bill require some closer examination. In terms of the Civil Aviation Act, there is a major change of emphasis in the regulation of Australian aviation. This arises from certain recommendations of the Air Safety Regulation Review Task Force, with some matters now being administered by regulations physically placed in the Act rather than being administered by pure regulation. Nobody would deny the importance of the priority that should be placed on air safety, and certainly the Opposition does not do so. Not only will some of the new rules be placed in the Act, but also they will attract higher financial penalties and, in some circumstances, penalties of up to two years imprisonment. These include flying an unregistered aircraft for which no certificate of airworthiness is in force or flying an aircraft if a maintenance order is not in force. It also includes flying an aircraft without an appropriate licence; it prohibits the issuing of a licence unless a person is authorised to do so. However, the imposition of a two-year prison term could be seen as a fairly draconian move. One would wonder under what circumstances this penalty would be imposed. While it is true that under some circumstances a prison sentence can be imposed for driving a car without a licence, the fine for first offenders is usually about $130. It is true that in some circumstances a prison sentence can be imposed for driving a car without a licence, but the fine for first offenders is usually about $130. I checked with local police. They tell me they cannot recall a case where a prison sentence has ever been awarded by the courts even for repeat offences involving driving without a licence. While there are some appeal mechanisms in this Bill, there is a sense of nervousness by some sections of the aviation industry about this provision. Earlier this year during debate on the Transport Legislation Amendment Bill 1991, I raised the concern of the industry and indeed a number of honourable members on this side of the House about not only the increased powers of the CAA investigators but also the attitude that some investigators were allegedly taking in the administration of those powers. At the time, the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) acknowledged that concern. Since then complaints, to me at least, have declined. My colleague Senator MACGIBBON in the other place, a widely recognised and distinguished aviator in Queensland, shares my concern. We are getting some legal opinions as to these new provisions. In the Senate he may be looking to inserting a minor amendment to clarify the situation in regard to the imposition of a gaol sentence, if we think that may be needed. I tum to the second part in the Bill relating to my portfolio responsibilities, and that is the provisions concerning the Federal Airports Corporation. A number of moves are being made in this amendment Bill that really do clarify the future of airport development. Clause 20 of the Bill, which relates to the divesting of land, seeks to amend section 28 of the principal Act, which vests Commonwealth land forming a Federal airport or part of a Federal airport in the FAC by adding three new subsections which will essentially repeat the existing requirements in respect of Federal airport development sites. The Opposition does not have any difficulties with that. But it is rather salient at the moment as the acquisition of land is going on for the proposed future airport development at Badgerys Creek west of Sydney in New South Wales. I understand, too, that there is a further provision within this amendment Bill to give the Federal Airports Corporation the capacity to dispose of airports. At the moment a battle royal is going on in some sections of the Victorian community as to the future of Essendon Airport. It would be a very bad move at this stage were the Government to off-load Essendon Airport. It is a most useful facility in Victoria. While the battle goes on about the construction of the third runway at Sydney International Airport, we must keep in mind the fact that some very hard decisions must be made in the not too distant future about what will happen at Badgerys Creek. At the moment we are all being subjected to the most incredible tirade from certain vested interests within the community of New South Wales and, indeed, in this place as to what should happen with Badgerys Creek. I put on the record the Opposition's commitment to going ahead with that third runway and the commitment to give any support that we possibly can to the Government to make that decision as soon as it possibly can. We acknowledge that the development of the third runway at Sydney airport is one of the most urgent micro-economic reforms that must be taken in Australia. Quite frankly, I have been amazed at some of the editorial content that has appeared in recent days, especially in the Australian Financial Review, as to the future development at Badgerys Creek. One of the accusations that has been made is simply that the Government will waste money in building the third runway. It should be pointed out, in the context of this Bill, that in fact the Federal Government, as I understand it, will not be making a contribution of one solitary cent to the construction of the third runway; that in fact the financing of that third runway will be undertaken by the Federal Airports Corporation. Those in the press and those in the public who are arguing about the alleged cost savings that could be made by going to Badgerys Creek must understand this: on my best calculations, to build Badgerys Creek at the moment-to get that project up and running, and from go to whoa-would require, in today's dollar terms, an outlay of about $6.2 billion dollars. It would also require the most incredible investment for infrastructure from the New South Wales Government. All the studies have proved time and time again that Badgerys Creek at this stage is not a viable proposition. I do not believe that the Federal Airports Corporation, as it is presently structured, would have the capacity to raise the sort of money required to build Badgerys Creek. I hope that, in the heat of the debate that is going on about the new airport requirements for Sydney, those facts are recognised because they have been proven. They have been put up time and time again as reasons why the third runway is absolutely essential. But still many people are not getting the message and a great deal of misinformation is going through. I just repeat the commitment of the Opposition parties to back the Government to the hilt in that decision as to the construction of the third runway, which I understand must be made within the next few weeks. It means 40,000 jobs for New South Wales. It means hundreds of millions of dollars for Australia by virtue of the increased business that is going through and the increases in tourism that can result from the more efficient airport facilities. The number of jobs in the physical construction industry in New South Wales at a time of this depressed economic situation will not be insignificant either. We hope that that decision will be made very soon. Once that decision is made, we can look towards the future development of Badgerys Creek as a second facility. There is no doubt that we will see massive increases in air traffic in and out of Australia over the next 10 to 15 years. On the latest reports from the World Tourism Organisation, it is estimated that by the year 2000, 100 million people from Asian countries will be travelling overseas for a holiday. One would hope that Australia, being in the middle of the Asia-Pacific Rim, ideally located to be able to take some of this holiday market, would have the physical infrastructure to do it. A great number of hard decisions will have to be made in the next few years about how that infrastructure will be provided, especially in terms of airports. We are talking not only about the difficulties at Sydney and the need to look towards the future development of Badgerys Creek as a second airport facility but also about Melbourne, about which hard decisions have to be made. Some hard decisions have to be made about the future of Brisbane Airport. We have to look at opening up some of those new areas of Australia such as the north-west of Western Australia and, indeed, the Northern Territory. Mr Snowdon-New airports?",42
60,Mr JULL,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"The Parliamentary Secretary interjects that we might need new airports. In fact, the real growth in tourism in Australia over this next decade will be in an area from Cairns to Sydney and across the north. Areas such as north Queensland, the Northern Territory and the north-west of Western Australia will be the real development points. Whether it be the Federal Airports Corporation or the locally owned airports that are going to have to look at massive expansion, those decisions are going to have to be made very quickly. This particular Bill will give the Federal Airports Corporation the opportunity to make acquisition of sites for some of that new airport development and infrastructure. The Opposition will not oppose this Bill, but we warn the Government that, if we get legal advice and we are not completely satisfied with that provision in the Civil Aviation Authority Act for the imposition of a two-year gaol sentence, we may move an amendment in the Senate.",44
61,Mr HOLLIS,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"As has been pointed out, the Transport and Communications Amendment Bill is an omnibus Bill amending seven .\cts administered either wholly or partly within the Transport and Communications portfolio. Part 2 of this Bill amends the Australian National Railways Commission Act to ensure that the Commission has the power to enter into a number of financial management risks or hedging transactions. My colleague the honourable member for Grey (Mr O'Neil) will comment more fully on that. I listened with interest to what the able member for Fadden (Mr Jull) said about airports. The principal purpose of this amendment is to enable the Commonwealth to transfer to the Federal Airports Corporation undeveloped sites which have been acquired for airport development and to empower the Corporation to construct airports at these sites. This is achieved by introducing into the Act the concept of a Federal airport development site which may be declared prior to its establishment as a Federal airport. I do not think there is much argument about the need for the third runway at Sydney Airport, but I believe we do need both airports, for the very reason outlined by the honourable member for Fadden-to cater for the growth in tourism which will occur over the next few years. I have never seen the third runway and Badgerys Creek as an either/or proposition. I believe that they are both very important. This Bill is a technical amendment which in no way takes away from the Commonend wealth primary responsibility for the national planning of airports, including the invesmaining tigation of the need for additional Federal airports in their location. The Bill also clarifies an earlier amendment that an airport authority is liable to pay income tax. Last week it was my great pleasure to visit Darwin's new airport. I see that the honourable member for the Northern Territory and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Snowdon) is at the table, and I remind him that the bridges that he uses should be called the Hollis-Taylor aerobridges because, as Chairtrain man of the Joint Standing Committee on Pubthe lie Works, which wholeheartedly endorsed them, no-one argued more forcefully for those aerobridges than I and the Deputy Chairman of that Committee, the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor). When the airport proposition first came to our Committee it did not include any aerobridges. When visitors to Darwin left the aircraft they would either get sunstroke or be drenched by rain. We put this to the Corporation, which told us that there was no way it could put in an aerobridge. Lo and behold, the airport now has three aerobridges. The honourhonourable member for Groom and I were proud to be photographed under those aerobridges. As someone who has been somewhat critical of the Federal Airports Corporation in days past, I am most impressed with what has been achieved in Darwin. I look forward to attending the opening of that airport, and also to being present when the Parliamentary Secretary, who is at the table, opens the Alice Springs Airport on 7 December. I think the Corporation has done an excellent job at both airports. This is an omnibus Bill dealing with seven Acts and I will deal at some length with the shipping aspect of it. Since coming into office, the Hawke Government has consistently demonstrated its commitment to developing an efficient, competitive Australian shipping industry. The Government's latest shipping reform program is proceeding on schedule and will be completed by 30 June 1991. Recrewing of existing ships is well advanced. At the of October nearly 540 officers and ratings had been removed from existing ships. Reratings and electricians will leave Crawford ships as the ships return to Australia. The removal of radio operator berths is almost completed on coastal ships, with those on international ships to be removed when the global maritime distress and safety system is operational internationally. Agreement has recently been reached on rationalisation of catering staff, which will result in further crew reductions. On 30 June aero1991 the average crew size of an Australian trading ship was just over 22. Measures in wW reduce this to 21 in 1992, matching crew levels of OECD countries. This compares with an average of 33 in 1983-a 36 per cent reduction under this Government. New ships have been introduced with crews of 17 or 18. These improvements in efficiency and productivity are being achieved in an atmosphere of industrial harmony, with the full cooperation of unions and shipowners.

If the Premiers and Chief Ministers were to put unanimously to the Prime Minister the view that a national income tax based on tax sharing would be the only viable option, where the States agreed not to vary their share of the revenue for three years and where the Commonwealth could preserve its overall financial management, would he reconsider his position of yesterday that tax sharing is not on the agenda for the Special Premiers Conference?",46
64,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I recommend to the Leader of the Opposition that he read the answer that I gave yesterday, and he will find in that the answer to his hypothetical question. Interest Rates",46
65,Mr MARTIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Could the Treasurer explain to the House the basis for the not unexpected announcement today by the Reserve Bank of Australia of a one percentage point reduction in interest rates?,46
66,Mr KERIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Following the meeting of the Reserve Bank board yesterday, the Government and the Reserve Bank agreed to a further one per cent reduction in cash rates to around 8.5 per cent. This is the tenth reduction in interest rates since January 1990 and, as a consequence of this reduction, cash rates will be around 8.5 per cent-that is less than half the level of January 1990. The Government expects that today's reduction will be reflected quickly in other short term rates, such as business overdraft levels. In fact, members of the House will know that bank bill rates have already fallen in anticipation. The Government agreed to a reduction in interest rates because of the further evidence of the decline in the rate of inflation and inflationary expectations. CPI inflation, the underlying rate of inflation and inflation expectations have all fallen to levels not seen in the past 20 years. In short, the progress made on inflation and inflationary expectations provides the basis for this easing of monetary policy. Members, of course, will know that the effects of interest rate reductions have not yet fully worked through the economy; thus the long lags associated with the operation of monetary policy will continue to assist recovery into the future. This means that Australia is, importantly, positioned for a period of growth, without the shadow of burgeoning inflation and out of control price increases, and that is good news for the people of Australia. It means that we will see, consistent with the Budget estimates, job growth improving in the latter half of 199192. NA",46
67,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"Order! Before I call the Leader of the Opposition, I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon members of the parliaments of Nauru, Niue and Tonga, who are visiting Canberra as part of a Commonwealth Parliamentary Association study tour. On behalf of the House I extend to our colleagues a very warm welcome. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Commonwealth-State Financial Relations",46
68,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again directed to the Prime Minister. I ask the Prime Minister whether he has seen a document, a draft proposal, from the Premiers and Chief Ministers of the States and Territories in the Australian Federation dated 4 November 1991 which puts the view that a national income tax based on tax sharing would be the only viable option, where the States would agree not to vary their share of the revenue for three years and where the Commonwealth could preserve its financial management. I ask the Prime Minister: has he seen that document? If so, what is his view on that proposal?",46
69,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The answer is no to the first part of the question. I have already given the answer to the second part of the question. Labour Productivity Growth,47
70,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Is the Minister for Transport and Communications aware of claims that productivity growth in Australia has been held back by the performance of public enterprises with high levels of union membership? What level of productivity growth has been achieved in the transport and communications sector, and is union membership correlated with that productivity growth?",47
71,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, I have seen quotes along the lines suggested by the honourable member. They were in the same magnificent speech that the Treasurer had occasion to refer to yesterday, when the Leader of the Opposition managed to determine that a 15 per cent improvement in the nation's competitiveness was in fact a decline of 15 per cent in the same. In the same Gestalt, employing the Billy MCMahon school of figures, the Opposition Leader also managed to say: It is no accident that the power base of the union movement, today is in the public sector and public sector business enterprise. All those heavily union dominated public sector problems like power and telecommunications and other areas like waterfront; aviation; electricity generation-they are major cost disadvantages. According to the latest ABS statistics, labour productivity growth in Australia's transport and communications sector was 2.9 per cent per year over the six-year period 1983-84 to 1989-90. Only two industry sectors had higher productivity growth. The highest, with 7.1 per cent per year, was electricity, gas and watera sector comprising mainly public enterprises and with higher union membership than transport and communications. The second highest, with 5.2 per cent per year was mining-a sector with private enterprise but with union membership roughly of the same proportion as transport and communications. The industries with lower union membership than transport and communications all had lower productivity growth. The lowest productivity growth of all was the recreation, entertainment and hospitality sector-a sector with virtually no public enterprises and with union membership at 25 per cent.",47
72,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You do not like this, do you? Mr Downer-You are finished.",47
73,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,47
74,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the Leader of the Opposition wants to roJI into this place with a set of statistics which, he claims, justifies the sorts of crazed propositions that he is touting about the Australian electorate at the moment, he might at least have the decency to check those sorts of figures. Of course, members of the press have been inquiring of his office who was responsible for a 30 per cent worth of misleading by the Leader of the Opposition in the speech that he managed to make the other day. They have been told that it is a chap who has headed away on honeymoon. The advice that has been given to me on that matter is that it is all his own work. One cannot read that little gem of a speech and go through it in detail without believing that that is the case. It is not possible for a staff member to have produced something so idiomatically within the framework of the manner of speech of the Leader of the Opposition that we have got used to in this place. So we are left to wonder-indeed, wonder in great detail, as we will when the time comes in a couple of weeks-whether the figures that he has managed to cobble together for his consumption tax will be as reliable as the figures that he has managed to get together on the issue of our international competitiveness and, of course, on the issue of the productivity of our people. He went on to say in his speech: Why a lot of genuine reform whether it is on the waterfront; or in telecommunications; or in aviation; or in electricity generation; or anywhere else you can see why it hasn't got off the ground. That is all empty rhetoric. It ignores the facts. I went through the waterfront reform process yesterday. I will not do it again. On telecommunications we have introduced major reformsMr Sharp-They were false figures.",47
75,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member should get up and ask me a few questions if he thinks I am using false figures. On aviation, it was the Hawke Government that ended the two-airline agreement. On electricity generation, it is the Hawke Government that has taken major new initiatives through the Special Premiers Conference process. The fact of the matter is that we go down the road of hard, unspectacular but solid work - there is no other way of doing it-in achieving micro-economic reform in this country. We have gone through with the union movement a process which has produced, in those highly unionised sectors of industry, major productivity gains by any set of statistics, by the relevant set of statistics here which Leader of the Opposition managed to ignore. We go through that process in the face of the claptrap that comes from the Opposition-a whole series of unspecified charges. A barrage of camouflage is put up, and that substitutes for analysis in his speech. The Leader of the Opposition cannot get facts like that wrong and then go and blame his staff members; he cannot assume that he can make statements to the business community or anyone else in this country with any form of credibility, because we will deal with him in this place. So that he may be educated on this matter further, so that he does not make mistakes and errors in this area again, I table the figures for labour productivity growth for 1983-84 to 1989-90 and union membership by industry, and he will see a direct correlation between high productivity growth and high levels of union membership. Commonwealth-State Financial Relations",48
76,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Has he agreed to meet Premiers Bannon and Greiner formally on Friday after the EPAC meeting; and is it a fact that the purpose of that meeting is to enable Premiers Bannon and Greiner, who have been deputated by the other State and Territory leaders, to discuss with him their proposal for tax sharing between the Commonwealth and the States?",48
77,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do not know whether they have been deputated or not but, if they have been deputated, I will have to ask them what it means. It sounds fearsome to me. I have never been deputated in my life.",48

86,Ms CRAWFORD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Can he inform the House of the implications of the national wage case decision last week; and what are the Government's intentions on this matter in the light of this decision?,48
87,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The decision of the Industrial Relations Commission last week to allow enterprise bargaining is a historic decision, and it is very interesting that it was almost universally welcomed. It was welcomed by the ACTU; it was welcomed by the Confederation of Australian Industry; it was welcomed by the Business Council of Australia; it was welcomed by the Metal Trades Industry Association; and, just for good measure, it was also welcomed by the Australian Chamber of Manufactures. But, while it seemed to be good news for just about everyone in Australia, it was not welcomed by the Leader of the Opposition. What did he do? His pattern of behaviour is becoming very predictable. Mr Snowdon-Did he deputate?",48
88,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, he did not deputate. But just as he lashed out at ACOSS the other day, he decided to lash out against the decision. In fact, it is fascinating. It was the next morning that he made the speech to CEDA which my colleagues-yesterday the Treasurer and today the Minister for Transport and Communications-have had such fun with. In that speech, the Leader of the Opposition made a simply incredible attack not just on the union movement and the accord but also on the employers and the Industrial Relations Commission. Putting that to one side, perhaps the most amazing thing about this amazing speechand I do recommend it as compulsory reading for all who are interested in the political process-is the factual errors which it is riddled with; factual errors which completely destroy the Leader of the Opposition's argument. In this remarkable speech, he says there have been at least three major failures of the accord process in the 1980s. So let us analyse those three failures. He says the first reason is: It has failed .in economic terms. The basis of his argument and his contention that it had failed in economic terms was that 'we became less competitive'. Mr Speaker, let me simply say: wrong, Professor. Yesterday the Treasurer revealed that the Leader of the Opposition, a professor of economics, simply has not got the capacity to read a competitiveness table. He could not tell the difference between a plus and a minus. He was 30 per cent wrong. So his first economic argument is foundationally flawed and wrong. Mr Downer-Foundationally? What does 'foundationally' mean?",49

90,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Members opposite should not make their little interruptions; they should get up and defend themselves.,49
91,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The House will come to order!,49
92,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The second reason why the accord supposedly failed is: It has failed to look after the interests of workers and to give them any incentive to raise their productivity ... Let me simply say: wrong again, Professor. Mr Speaker, per capitaMI' SPEAKER-Order! The Prime Minister should refer to the Leader of the Opposition by his title.",49
93,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Sorry, the Leader of the Opposition. Wrong again, Leader of the Opposition. The fact is that per capita real household disposable income is over 10 per cent higher now than it was in June of 1983. That is the fact and I believe that even if the Leader of the Opposition, perhaps with some assistance, were to look at the tables, he would understand that the real increase in per capita income over this period is plus 10 per cent, not minus 10 per cent or minus any other figure. So he is wrong on the second count. The third reason why, according to the Leader of the Opposition, the accord has failed is that it has blocked most essential parts of reform. My colleague the Minister for Transport and Communications has just effectively demolished that argument in factual terms. So, as we have said, we have delivered in the area of the waterfront, aviation, telecommunications and electricity generation. Let me say finally that the only statement in the speech of the Leader of the Opposition which gelled in any way was his opening comment, which was: I must admit, when I woke up this morning I didn't know where I was. He is right, and may I say that things did not get any better as the day wore on. The fact is, of course, that the accord has not failed.",49

95,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The House will come to order! Members on my left will cease interjecting!,49
96,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"May I remind those chortlers behind the Leader of the Opposition that I have no better authority on this matter of the success of the accord than the Leader of the Opposition himself, because I remind the House of what I had to say earlier and I put this against the statement which the Leader of the Opposition made in his speech in Brisbane the other day. I remind honourable members that he said: There have been at least three major failures of the Accord process in the 1980s. Who was it, as I asked this House some weeks ago, who praised the accord and who recommended it to the coalition? These are the words in the 1980s of the Leader of the OppositionDr Bob Woods-Which year, Bob? How long ago was it?",49
97,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The last one I give will be 1989, and I would think the Leader of the Opposition would agree that that comes within the 1980s. I think it does. I know the Leader of the Opposition has difficulty reading a table, but I think even he would agree that 1984 and 1989 do come within the 1980s. The Leader of the Opposition, firstly in 1984, had this to say: ... the Liberals really need to recognise the wages area as their achilles heel and to come up with an alternative. You will remember what he said, Mr Speaker. He went on: At the risk of being accused of heresy, might I suggest that it may be desirable for them to accept the concept of an accord-type agreement ... Now there is the assessment of the Leader of the Opposition well into the 1980s. In 1984 and in 1989, this is his assessment of its impact in regard to employment. I quote him from 23 August 1989: We have achieved some wage restraint in Australia in recent years and this has contributed to a strong growth in employment and a fall in unemployment. There is the assessment of the Leader of the Opposition throughout the 1980s of the worthwhileness of the accord, recommending it to the Opposition and saying, at the end of the 1980s, what its positive achievements have been. The Professor got it right on that occasion; he got it abundantly wrong when he spoke in Brisbane and said that he did not know where he had woken up that morning. Mr Tuckey interjecting",50

99,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is good to see my speeches having such an impact on the Government. I ask the Prime Minister: is it a fact that the head of his Department has been phoning around the States today saying that the Cabinet does not have a view on the matter of tax sharing, and why did he cancel the three-day meeting of officials which was scheduled for next week to draft a communique and move it to the two days immediately prior to the Premiers Conference, by which time he apparently said the Cabinet would have a view?",50

113,Mr LINDSAY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Has the Treasurer's attention been drawn to claims that living standards have been cut dramatically due to the reduction in real wages which has occurred since 1983? I ask the Treasurer: are these claims accurate and is it expected that real wages will increase by 7 or 8 per cent during the economic downturn?,51
114,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Standing order 146 says that a question fully answered cannot be renewed. The Prime Minister has already answered that question in a previous reply.",51
115,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I am sure the Treasurer has some matters he can inform the House on.,51
116,Mr KERIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Obviously the honourable member for Herbert has been triggered into action by the last comment of the Leader of the Opposition that he is very glad that his speeches are having an impact on the Government. They certainly are. We will start going through them with a fine tooth comb from now on.,51
117,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,51
118,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,51
119,Mr KERIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In this famous speech, written by a man on his honeymoon-the Leader of the Opposition-he claimed that real wages have fallen by 8, 9 or 10 per cent since this Government came to office. Real wages as measured by the national accounts average earnings have fallen by 4.4 per cent since the March quarter 1983, not by 8, 9 or 10 per cent, and real unit labour costs have fallen 10.3 per cent over the same time. Importantly, while real wages are forecast to rise in 199192, real unit labour costs are forecast to again by a further 2 per cent. So let us think about what this decline in real unit labour costs means. It means that it is more attractive to employ labour in Australia than it was when we came to office. In fact, this reduction in real unit labour costs, to which the fall in real wages contributed, was a major factor in the 1.45 million new jobs that have been created since this Government has been in office. Let us just take- Mr Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition is chattering away here again-the Professor's claim that under this Government community living standards have fallen. Look at the facts. Real household disposable income has increased by over 20 per cent, while real household disposable income per capita, the figure the Prime Minister just used, has increased by over 10 per cent. Living standards have, therefore, increased and, what is more, real household disposable income is forecast to rise by another 1112 per cent in 1991-92. I do not need to go into the cause of this improvement. Everyone, except the Leader of the Opposition, knows the benefits of Medicare, the improved family allowance, tax reform and the superannuation reforms implemented by the Government. Rather than claiming that the accord has harmed average Australians, the Leader of the Opposition should accept the truth-it has been of great benefit. So where does this leave the Opposition? The Leader of the Opposition is in real trouble because he even has his claims about real wages in the recession totally wrong. To my friends on the Opposition back bench I say to just remember that this is the Leader of the Opposition who is doing the sums on the GST which we are waiting for. All I can say is, 'God save the Opposition' because, on the Professor's recent performance, nothing will save the GST. Unemployment",51
120,Dr BEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I simply ask the Prime Minister a straightforward question. If the accord process has been so successful, why by are nearly one million Australians unemployed?",51
121,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I repeat, by way of answer fall to the question: why was it that the Leader of the! OppositionOpposition members-Answer the question!",51
122,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am answering the question. The form of my answer is to start off by asking rhetorically the question of the Leader of the Opposition: why did the Leader of the Opposition in 1989 say what he did about the accord, that is, that it had the effect of increasing employment and reducing unemployment? I did not put the words in the mouth of the Leader of the Opposition in August 1989. It was the Leader of the Opposition in 1989 who, on his assessment of the operation of the accord throughout the whole period of the 1980s, made the assessment that the accord had increased employment and reduced unemployment because it had produced a restraint in wages. And for once, on a matter economic, the Leader of the Opposition got it right. Just in case the Leader of the Opposition does not understand, I point out that the reason why there is a position now of increased unemployment is that-as I explained, as the previous Treasurer explained and as the present Treasurer has explained-action had to be taken by the Government to address a situation in which we had, in this country, expenditure increasing at twice the rate of production. To deal with that situation we had to slow the economy down. But the answer to the Leader of the tion's question is provided by his own statement in August 1989 when he said to the people of Australia, 'The reason why you have had an increase in employment and a reduction in unemployment is because of the wage restraint associated with the accord'. He got it right then. Why does he not read that speech, which at least got something right in the economic area? Education: TAFE Colleges",52
123,Mr FITZGIBBON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Has the Minister for Employment, Education and Training seen reports which suggest that there will be a shortage of some 300,000 places in TAFE colleges next year? It is reported that there will be a shortage of some 90,000 places in TAFE colleges in New South Wales alone. Will the Minister explain to the House what the Government is doing to enable people to gain vocational skills?",52
124,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have drawn attention to the fact that there is a large unmet demand for places within the TAFE sector. We estimated that that might be 145,000 in 1992. That estimate appears to be somewhat conservative, bearing in mind that the unmet demand in New South Wales alone for 1992 now appears to be of the order of 90,000 places. This is a matter of very great concern to the Government and to all Australians. Whilst there has been a very substantial increase in participation in schools and universities, there has been virtually no increase in participation in the TAFE area; indeed, in the last few years there has been an actual decline. This is, in part, because TAFE around the country simply has not been provided with the resources to expand and provide those opportunities for a growing number of schoolleavers who are looking for opportunities within the vocational education area. In order to do something about this, the Commonwealth, in the context of the current review of Commonwealth and State financial responsibilities, has offered to assume financial responsibility for the whole of the education and training system beyond the level of year 12 or its equivalent within the TAFE system. This is not, as it has been characterised by some, a Commonwealth takeover Opposi- of the TAFE system. The TAFE system would continue to be administered and owned by the States and Territories, but we would provide the",52
125,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I rise on a point of order, Mr Speaker. I draw your attention to the Notice Paper and to the fact that the Orders of the Day include the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Amendment Bill. I have listened to the Minister for some time now and believe that he is restating remarks that should be made in that debate, and the House could be saved considerable time if they were.",52
126,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! There is no point of order. I remind the honourable member for O'Connor, as I have reminded him and at least one of his colleagues before, that if one had a very literal interpretation of that rule it would mean that his colleagues on the front bench would be very constrained in asking many of the questions they ask at Question Time that relate to public affairs. In particular, they would be constrained from asking many of the questions they ask at Question Time relating to an MPI that is to be debated later on the same day. It has never been my intention as SpeakerI doubt whether it was my colleagues' intention in the past-to see that rule used to stifle debate. I will not rule in the way the honourable member for O'Connor has suggested I should. I think the House would agree that it would be very foolish for the Speaker to rule in that way.",52
127,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I know that I should not refer to interjections or points of order, but I make the point that we are now over halfway through this parliamentary tenn. Whilst the Government has been intent on addressing itself to the real problems that confront this country, we are yet to hear anything from the Opposition about trying to provide opportunities for young people. Well may the honourable member for O'Connor have something to say about this, because he is one of the 10 or 12 from the Opposition who have been given the opportunity over the last few years to come up with policies in the education and training area; yet we still wait. Nearly a decade has passed with the Liberal and National parties being in opposition. During the whole of that time we have not had from them any semblance of a comprehensive approach to dealing with the problems of young people as they move from school into the work force. The honourable member for O'Connor would be well advised to listen intently to what I have to say about this matter, as I and my colleagues are the only ones making any sensible contribution to this debate, which is a matter of very great concern not only to young Australians but also to employers and the parents of those young people. As I said, this review of Commonwealth State financial relations has given us the opportunity to think creatively about how we ought to provide better opportunities for young people. We have also been assisted by the excellent work of the committee chaired by Brian Finn of IBM, who has said that the current level of 30 per cent participation by 15to 19-year-olds in the vocational skills area should be increased to 50 per cent by the tum of the decade, not only to provide opportunities for young people but also to provide the kinds of skills that Australian industry is likely to need now and in the future. We have put this proposal forward. I am delighted to say that many outside this Parliament and outside government have welcomed the approach that the Commonwealth has taken. The Business Council of Australia, the Confederation of Australian Industry, the ACTU, the Metal Trades Industry Association, the Teachers Union and the students have all said that they welcome the approach that the Commonwealth is taking. They see it as being a positive step towards dealing with a very crucial issue of concern to the entire education and training system. There will be a meeting of Commonwealth and State Ministers responsible for education and training on Friday, which will again have a look at this question. We will be assisted in that task by the work of a committee set up at our last meeting two weeks ago and chaired by Dr Ramsey from New South Wales. In that report we will find some very important principles being recommended to us as to how TAFE should be funded in the future. This is, in a sense, an historic opportunity for Commonwealth and State governments to deal with a question which is important for Australia's future. I very sincerely hope that our work on Friday, leading towards the meeting of the Prime Minister and the Premiers on 20 November, will be approached in a constructive way, a way which is devoid of the kind of rancour that has sometimes characterised Commonwealth-State relations in the past. This is a positive attempt on the part of the Commonwealth to sensibly resolve a financial issue, an issue which has now emerged as a financial crisis for TAFE. Honourable members should just think of the 150,000 or more young Australians keen to get a place in TAFE next year who will be denied that opportunity because the doors will be slammed in their face unless something is done to create those opportunities for them. Interest Rates",53
128,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My queStion is directed to the Prime Minister. At the time of the previous interest rate reduction, the Treasurer put great store in a procedure he called 'due process', which included no pressure by the Government on the Reserve Bank to achieve a desired result. I ask the Prime Minister: how does he explain his own recent forecasts and those of the Minister for Finance, then Acting Treasurer, which culminated in today's interest rate cut?",54
129,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is a fascinating logic in this: if someone says something on monetary policy and it is followed by an official decision, that is a process of culmination. Does the shadow Treasurer believe that it would be appropriate for the Prime Minister and the Treasurer to say nothing-to become Trappist-in the area of monetary policy in between meetings of the board of the Reserve Bank? One only has to ask the question to see how stupid is the 'logic' of what the shadow Treasurer is putting. While we have responsibility-as we will continue to have for many years-for the conduct of the economic policy of this country, I as Prime Minister, the Treasurer and Ministers in their relevant areas will make statements in regard to public policy. What we will never do is what the Leader of the Opposition has elevated to an art form-that is, to publicly attack the integrity of people like the Governor of the Reserve Bank. The hypocrisy of the shadow Treasurer getting up and raising questions about the Prime Minister or the Treasurer talking about monetary policy and due process! Those opposite should hang their heads in shame when it comes to the question of public statements in the area of monetary policy. All they can do is impugn the integrity of fine-I use the word in its broader senseand great public servants like Bernie Fraser, who has given a lifetime of service within the Commonwealth Public Service proper and then in his position as Governor of the Reserve Bank; and all he gets from the Opposition for his pains, his commitment and integrity is this public impugning of his integrity. The Deputy Leader should not ask a question in this area. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi",54
130,Dr THEOPHANOUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. The Minister will be aware that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has been awarded the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize for her courageous work to establish democracy in Burma. Can he advise honourable members what the Government is doing about the reports that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi is seriously ill following a hunger strike? Is the Government attempting to secure her release? What efforts are being made by Australia and the international community to bring democracy to Burma?,54
131,Dr BLEWETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Government has asked our ambassadors in Bangkok and in Rangoon to investigate the press reports and rumours suggesting that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi is on a hunger strike and that she is seriously ill as a result of this action. It is very difficult to verify such information as she is held incommunicado under house arrest, but recent information from the embassy's contacts in Rangoon was that she was fit and well. Our assessment, based on all available sources of information, is that it is unlikely that there has been any dramatic deterioration in Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's health. There is no definite evidence that she has begun a hunger strike, although there are rumours to that effect in Rangoon. We are continuing our efforts to establish the nature of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's state of health as soon as possible. The Government is gravely concerned about the well-being of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and will review seriously any information which confirms that there was substance to these press reports. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has initiated contact with other governments to shape our concern about Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's health and to propose joint representations on her situation to the Burmese regime. I expect that these representations will take place shortly. On the more general question that the honourable member raised, we are actively engaged at the United Nation's General Assembly in efforts to secure the widest possible support for the resolution on Burma which was deferred from last year's General Assembly. We will again co-sponsor that resolution. In common with the United States and with the European communities which have arms embargoes against Burma, Australia will not export defence related goods to Burma until democratic reform is implemented and human rights abuses are ended. We have also continued to keep the issue of international economic sanctions under review but, to be effective, such sanctions would require the support of Burma's major trading partners. Regrettably, the situation in Burma has not yet generated sufficient international consensus and concern on this issue. Further, I am advised that Senator Evans met the new Burmese Ambassador to Australia this morning when he made his introductory call. During the course of that meeting Senator Evans expressed his strong concern, and that of the Government, about the plight of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and about the situation in Burma generally. Solicitor-General  the Attorney-General. I refer him to the extraordinary deal that he has done, with the Government's consent, with the Solicitor General, which will allow the Solicitor General to take a year's leave of absence without pay while he actually engages in private practice. I ask: why the deal? Mr Connolly-With pay.  private practice, with pay. I ask the Attorneytwo General: why the deal? What clear precedents are there for such a deal? Mr Hand-Take the smile off your face, Andrew; get angry.",54
132,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The Minister for Immigration! t  get pretty angry with those opposite if they are endorsing this deal. How much in total is it going to cost the Australian taxpayers? What other deals has the Government done, or sought to do, with the Solicitor-General since he took office in 1984? If the Solicitor General is so hard up for money, is this money being made available to him either so that he can maintain his house in Melbourne or, perhaps, to help him maintain his house in Canberra-or perhaps it might be used to add another wing to the house he owns in the south of France?",55
133,Mr DUFFY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Kooyong for his question. I am pleased that ultimately he got it right as to whether the Solicitor-General was on leave with or without pay. It is with pay. Dr Griffith was granted leave of absence for one year commencing on 1 January 1992. The period of leave will be taken from his current leave entitlements. Mr Tim Fischer-Oh, big deal.",55
134,Mr DUFFY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Those opposite are all big on deals, it appears. I will get to that in a moment. With the Opposition's obsessive attitude to this matter, it is interesting to note the shadow Attorney-General's press release this morning. He says: No amount of hyperbole can disguise the fact that an unprecedented deal without justification has been done. It is deplorable and must not proceed. I do not quite know what the honourable member for Kooyong is on about. The Solicitor-General has an entitlement to leave. He applied to take that leave, and the application was granted. Then, in addition to that, under the relevant legislation, section 9 of the Law Officers Act, he applied to me to engage in private practice as a barrister during the period of approved leave. I granted him that request under that section. There are only things relevant here. The first is: did he apply for leave? The answer is yes, and he was granted it. He was entitled to it. Mr MCGauran-Twelve months leave. Is that right? Mr DUFFY..2... Yes. Twelve months leave. I will go through the details of why, if those opposite would like that. He is entitled to 12 months leave. Under the relevant legislation, the Law Officers Act, he then requested the right of private practice while he was on leave and the'request was granted. There is nothing about deals or anything else. The fact of the matter is that he requested two things and, after consideration, I granted them. As to the last part of the question from the shadow Attorney-General, I have no knowledge of what houses the Solicitor-General and/or his spouse or any other member of the family may own. I suggest that those opposite direct that question to the Solicitor-General and not to me because it is in absolutely appallingly bad taste.  ney-General to table the documents to which he referred and from which he was about to quote additional material.",55
135,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Is the Attorney-General reading from a document?,56
136,Mr DUFFY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When there was an interjection about how the leave was arrived at, the notes that I had were my own notes, which were in my pocket.",56
137,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Is the Attorney-General saying he is quoting from notes, and not a document?",56
138,Mr DUFFY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes. That is right. Mr Fife- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Because of the noise coming from the Government benches, it was hard to hear what the Attorney-General said in response. Will he or will he not table the document that he referred to containing information which he was prepared to give to the House?",56
139,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Hume will resume his seat. I asked the Attorney-General whether he was quoting from a document. He said he was quoting from notes. Mr Beale-They were in his pocket.,56
140,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The Attorneytion, 'Is General said he was quoting from notes. If he replies was not quoting from a document then he is to not required to table it, under the Standing Orders.  Speaker, as you are aware, notes or docuThe ments, unless the Attorney-General says they document. are classified, have got to be tabled. Would you ask him to table them?",56
141,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I know that the shadow Attorney-General has a long knowledge of the Standing Orders of this Parliament but sometimes in the heat of the moment he gets them a little wrong. On this issue I am right and he is not.,56
142,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I draw your attention-this is verified in Hansard-to the fact that the Attorney General said his notes, which he then tried to indicate was what he was reading from, were in his pocket and that the documents he opened were quite different. The point is made. Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, on a further point of order: standing order 321 states: A document relating to public affairs quoted from by a Minister or an Assistant Minister, unless stated to be of a confidential natureas referred to by the honourable member for Kooyong. . . shall, if required by any Member, be laid on the Table. I draw that to your attention.",56
143,Mr SCHOLES,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a further point of order on this matter.",56
144,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I ask the honourable member for Corio to resume his seat and I will deal with this matter first. The honourable member for O'Connor and the Leader of the National Party have actually caused me, from time to time, to look up the House of Representatives Practice because they are very keen on this particular issue. I will read to them what the House of Representatives Practice says so that they know I am right and they are not: The Chair will ask the question, 'Has the Minister read from the document?' If the answer is 'no', the Chair accepts the Minister's word. If the answer is 'yes', then the Chair will further quesit a confidential document?' If the Minister that it is confidential, then it is not required be tabled. If it is not a confidential document and the Minister has read from it, he or she is required to table the document. The Speaker has also said that if a Minister states that he is only to notes, then that is the end of the matter. Chair would not require the tabling of the That was in 1976. I think the honourable member for Kooyong's learned friend Sir Billy Mackie Snedden was the Chairman then. The honourable member often draws him to my attention as being a paragon of virtue in these things. I think the Minister gave the answer that the Minister probably knew he was supposed to give. He is in order and the honourable member for St George has the call. Mr Fife- Mr Speaker, I raise a further point of order on the same subject. We were all watching very carefully as well as listening very carefully to the Attorney-General. The Attorney-General quoted from leave documents concerning",56
145,Mr DUFFY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I did not. Mr Fife-He referred to a document, not the notes that he subsequently took out of his pocket. It is the document that we all saw him quote from that we want to see tabled in this House.",57
146,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! I asked the Attorney-General whether he was quoting from a document. He said that he was quoting from notes. The Attorney-General may have had a number of notes; indeed, the document that the honourable member thought might have been a document may have been notes. These are all hypothetical issues. Mr Smith-You can see. You've got a better view than anyone.",57
147,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Mr Smith-You can see what is going on.,57
148,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the honourable member for Bass. The fact is that the Attorney-General has said that he was quoting from notes. That ends the matter. Aviation Agreement with Hong Kong,57
149,Mr DUBOIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Can the Minister for Transport and Communications inform the House of the outcome of negotiations on the new air agreement with Hong Kong? Will Qantas benefit from that agreement?,57
150,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. The only press releases that I enjoy reading are not my own but the press releases of the three Opposition members who shadow me on that side of the House. They sit there as a sort of little coven with a pot in front of them. Every now and then one of them manages to get to their scrapers to ask me a question. I am glad that I do not have to hold my breath between those particular events or I would never get a chance to say anything in this House and I would definitely be dead. There is a new agreement, which would be welcome to all honourable members in this House, particularly the better travelled among them. The negotiation with Hong Kong gives Qantas and Cathay substantial new traffic rights and capacity entitlements. The outcome culminates about six years of very difficult negotiations. It will enable Qantas to expand its operations in Asia by linking Hong Kong to its two major hubs, Singapore and Bangkok, and other countries in Asia. Over the longer term, from 1994 it will b able to serve Europe with a one-stop flight via Hong Kong. Cathay, which already flies to Sydney, Melbourne and Perth, gains rights to fly to Adelaide and Cairns. Both airlines will be able to double their capacity between Australia and Hong Kong by 1995, with a 30 per cent increase immediately. Special provision has also been made for all cargo flights, which will enable Cathay to increase its current once weekly B7 47 freighter service to Australia and allow the Hong Kong carrier, Air Hong Kong, to introduce scheduled services. Qantas, which does not have a freighter aircraft, can operate leased freighters on the route or convert its cargo entitlements into passenger capacity. As well as being a key hub for aviation operations in Asia, Hong Kong is a popular destination for Australian travellers and a growing source of tourists for Australia. It is also a major importer of Australian food products. The Australian consumer, the tourist industry, our exporters and Qantas will all benefit from these new arrangements. More impOltant than any of this is that Qantas will have an enhanced profile in the Asian region, which will have a significant impact and bearing on its long term prospects and comes as the airline is gearing up for the sale of 49 per cent of it. The fact of the matter is that, if Qantas is going to be a successful carrier in the future, it has to have that capacity to develop a complex of regional routes throughout our immediate region. It will be important in integrating this country further into that region economically. Of all the sorts of agreements that have been negotiated over the last few years-and there have been many successful ones-it is probably the most significant of those that we have managed to do for that reason alone.",57

152,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I desire to askyou a question.

159,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,58
160,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! In response to the question from the Leader of the National Party, I think it is a matter for the House to decide from time to time whether it wishes to hear addresses from visiting dignitaries to Australia. As I understand it, the House had informally agreed that it would sponsor an occasion for President Bush to address both the House of Representatives and the Senate in this chamber. There had been preliminary arrangements arrived at to cause that to occur but they have now been put in abeyance because of the defennent of the visit. I think it is up to the House to weigh up individual visits as to whether the House wishes to hear an address or not. The Prime Minister made it clear when he originally raised the matter that they would be people of particular significance and that this would be an honour that would not be bestowed upon everybody willy-nilly. I think it is a matter for the House to decide in the individual circumstances. Tabling of Documents  through on the matters we raised in regard to the documents or notes that the AttomeyGeneral had either on the dispatch box or in his pocket, I wonder whether you would be kind enough to take up this matter with the Attorney-General. If there is nothing to hide, would he rethink the matter and perhaps table the details of the leave that has actually been taken by Dr Griffith or the leave accumulated?",58
161,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! That is not a matter for the Speaker to take up with the Attorney-General. If the honourable member for Kooyong or some other member wishes to take it up with him, that is a matter for him, taking place, will not for me. Mr 'lUckey- Mr Speaker, I seek your indulgence to raise a point of order regarding your mling on standing order 144 during Question Time, which states: Questions cannot refer to(a) debates in the current session; Your response was that that should be deliberated on in a fairly general or wide manner. I would like to ask you, sir, to reconsider that decision on the grounds of why that particular standing order exists. Question Time is a time for giving information to the Parliament which is not otherwise available through ministerial statements-I am sure that is why the reference to policy is in the Standing Orders-and, of course, through general parliamentary debates. My point of order today was purely to give members the maximum opportunity to question the Government. I believe that Ministers who take the opportunity to debate matters at Question Time when they have other opportunities to do so during parliamentary debate, should not be allowed to do so by you. I do not believe that questions of a general nature that might, in some way, lead into the matter of public importance are really in the same category. The point that I am making to you, Mr Speaker, is that Ministers in particular have numerous opportunities laid down in the Standing Orders for the purpose of giving information to the Parliament, and the Standing Orders have recognised this for a long time. Finally, I would like to say quences would be if it is your opinion that an MPI should not have questions associated with it. I do not think this is funny, Mr Speaker. It is all to do with the management of this Parliament. As such, it should be of great concern to you, Mr Speaker.",58
162,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member for O'Connor has asked me a question. I think the question has been a rather long one. I am always willing to listen to the honourable member for O'Connor, but I do not share his view that we should allow the anticipation rule to be used to stifle honourable members' questions. That would be the outcome of what the honourable member for O'Connor is suggesting to me. I do not intend to let that rule be used to stifle questions from honourable members on either side of the House. If the honourable member 0' Connor thought through his position, he will see that it would be a very foolish position for the Opposition, let alone members of the Government back bench, to take. Tabling of Documents",59
163,Mr SINCLAIR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I have a slightly different problem with respect to Dr Gavan Griffith. I know that you are custodian of many things, but I am not too sure whether you are custodian of public morality or whether that is even the field that concerns me.",59
164,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Maybe the right honourable member for New England and I should discuss this privately.,59
165,Mr SINCLAIR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I know you are prepared to accept responsibility in many orders.

168,Mr SINCLAIR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I am asking you whether there is an authority other than yourself or whether you are the authority to ensure that, during the period that the Solicitor-General is on leave with pay, he in no way accepts a brief which contradicts his responsibility to the Australian public or to Australian individuals.",59
169,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That has absolutely nothing to do with me, as the right honourable member for New England would surely know. Asia-Pacific Parliamentarians Forum",59
170,Mr CONNOLLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, you will recall that yesterday I asked you a question about estqblishing of a joint parliamentary working group in regard to the establishment of the Asia-Pacific Parliamentarians Forum and you replied: I do not think the President and I have any need for any group to help us do our job. Could you explain to me and to the House what the great distinction is between the CPA, which has an executive committee, the IPU, which has an executive committee, and the proposed APPF, which does not yet exist but which may well exist in the near future? Australia, as the host to the inaugural meeting, may well be an position to have a major impact on that organisation but you are preventing honourable members of this House from playing any part at all in developing that structure.",59
171,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I say to the honourable member for Bradfield, who has taken an inordinate interest in this matter in attempting to assist the President and me in our dutiesas I have said to him privately, as I have said to him in a telephone hook-up I had with him and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, and as I said to him in the House yesterday-the President and I may not need anyone. I say to him absolutely unequivocally now that I do not need him to help me with this issue. I think I have made that fairly clear to him. If he wants to understand what the difference is between the numerous organisations that hold meetings that members of parliament go to as delegates and the organisations which this Parliament are parts of then I am quite happy to write to him at length or discuss this with him in my office. To put it rather succinctly, we are members of the CPA and the IPU. We also sent delegations to the European Parliament, to the OECD debate, to AIPO and to numerous other regional bodies. The President and I do not ask the honourable member for Bradfield or his colleagues or colleagues on the other side of the House to help us with the running of the external relations of the Parliament. I do not foresee in the near or distant future any further need for the assistance of the honourable member for Bradfield, even though he is willing to assist and quite frankly and forcefully puts forward his view of wishing to assist. I will say' that to him publicly if he would like me to; I will say it to him privately. We are getting on with the job of affiliating Australia with the Asia-Pacific Parliamentary Forum if it gets off the ground. If it gets off the ground, the inaugural meeting may be in Australia. Australia and the Australian Parliament are offering assistance. We are not attempting to take it over and I think that any further assistance that we might have from the honourable member for Bradfield in this area might only just muddy the waters. I do not think there is much more that I can say on that issue. NA",60

173,Mr HAWKE,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"by leave-I report to the House on the outcome of the visit I made to Zimbabwe between 14 and 24 October. My visit had four main components: a meeting of the High-Level Appraisal Group on the future of the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting itself, a short bilateral visit to Zimbabwe at the invitation of President Robert Mugabe, and my separate bilateral discussions with a number of heads of government of countries important to Australia. In all its elements, my visit significantly advanced important Australian foreign and international economic policy interests. The High-Level Appraisal Group on the future of the Commonwealth was established by the 1989 Commonwealth Heads of Government in Kuala Lumpur to examine Commonwealth priorities for the 1990s and beyond, and to consider the adequacy of Commonwealth institutions to meet these priorities. It was the first review of the Commonwealth's priorities to be undertaken by heads of government. Ten Commonwealth leaders took part, under the chairmanship of Prime Minister Mahathir of Malaysia. Our meeting on 15 October considered preparatory documents prepared by a special group of senior officials and by the Commonwealth Secretary-General. The main result of our deliberations was the draft Harare Declaration on the future of the Commonwealth, which was later endorsed by all Commonwealth heads of government. My colleagues on the High-Level Appraisal Group agreed that the Commonwealth should seek to make a distinctive contribution in particular areas where it has a comparative advantage and proven expertise, and where its efforts complement, rather than compete with, larger or more specialised multilateral agencies. A particular priority which we identified for the Commonwealth is the protection and promotion of the fundamental political values enshrined in the Commonwealth's Singapore Declaration of 1971. These values include democracy, democratic processes and institutions, the rule of law, just and honest government and fundamental human rights. The steady spread of these values around the world has been one of the most heartening international developments of the past few years, and I was struck by the degree of commitment to them which I found among my colleagues in Harare. But we all recognised that the Commonwealth countries are not perfect in this regard. . At Harare it was agreed that Commonwealth members should help one another to do better by developing institutions of democratic government. We recognised that in these areas the Commonwealth's unique strengths of a shared heritage and common language can contribute to a pragmatic and cooperative approach to solving problems. We are already seeing that happen. The Commonwealth's role in election monitoring, guidelines for which were approved by the High-Level Appraisal Group, is one important area of assistance. The President of the Senate, Senator Sibraa, and the honoUrable member for Mackellar (Me Carlton) have been involved in just such a monitoring exercise in Zambia in the past week. The peaceful and orderly transition of power in Zambia over the weekend is, I believe, a sign of hope that the democratic principles of the Commonwealth will at last take deep root and flourish in Africa. I have sent messages both to Zambia's new President, Mr Chiluba, and to his predecessor, my old Commonwealth colleague Kenneth Kaunda, congratulating them on what is a truly historic achievement. Other priorities which we identified for the Commonwealth include the promotion of sustainable development; further help to bring about a free, democratic, non-racial and prosperous South Africa; action to combat drug trafficking and abuse; and help with the particular economic and security problems of small Commonwealth states, many of which are in our own region. The full Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting was held between 16 and 21 October. Forty-seven countries were represented, 43 of them by their Heads of State or Prime Ministers, and, of course, President Mugabe of Zimbabwe chaired the meeting. Issues on the agenda for the meeting included global trends and prospects, South Africa, the world economic situation, environmental issues and, very importantly, Commonwealth functional cooperation. On South Africa, the principal issue facing CHOGM this year was to determine the Commonwealth's response to the fundamental process of reform which had been initiated during t.he two years since Commonwealth heads of government last met. The major steps which have been taken in South Africa to dismantle apartheid and to commence the work of building a non-racial constitution were symbolised for us in Harare in a very dramatic way by the presence amongst us of Nelson Mandela, because two years ago when CHOGM met in Kuala Lumpur Mandela was still a prisoner in a South African gaol. The change of heart in the South African Government symbolised by the release of Nelson Mandela and by the dismantling of the legislative pillars of apartheid has been a spectacular vindication of the principled stance and practical measures that the Commonwealth, often at Australia's urging, has adopted on South Africa in recent years. But equally the massive progress in South Africa is a challenge to the Commonwealth to move with the times. It must respond to that progress in an imaginative and forward-looking way which will ensure that the Commonwealth continues, to lead in-ernational opinion in working for the well-being of all the peoples of South Africa. This is a challenge which the Commonwealth heads of government took up with alacrity. Even before CHOGM proper began, at the High-Level Appraisal Group meeting on 15 October my Commonwealth colleagues showed their determination to ensure that the Commonwealth remained both relevant and constructive. They were determined in particular to establish a direct and vigorous dialogue with the principal parties to the reform process in South Africa, so that the Commonwealth could learn directly from those involved how it could best contribute to that process .. CHOGM decided to dispatch the Commonwealth Secretary-General, Chief Anyaoku, to South Africa. This week he will explore with the principal parties how the Commonwealth might assist in lending momentum to the process of negotiating a new constitution. Australia strongly supports this forward-looking step. The same spirit was evident in the discussions on the future of Commonwealth sanctions on South Africa. The meeting recognised the significance which sanctions undoubtedly had in bringing the Government of South Africa to the negotiating table, which I have at all times emphasised as being the primary purpose of the imposition of sanctions. Of course, the Commonwealth colleagues recognise that as long as the process of reform continued to be frustrated and obstructed by acts of bad faith, sanctions would be important to maintaining the momentum of negotiations. But equally they recognised, as Nelson Mandela himself said, that sanctions are doing serious damage to South Africa's economy and to the welfare of ordinary South Africans. For that reason, sanctions should not be kept in place any longer than necessary. In the light of these considerations, CHOGM decided to adopt the recommendations of the Commonwealth Committee of Foreign Ministers on South Africa, CFMSA, for a phased approach to the lifting of sanctions. The CFMSA's recommendations strongly reflected Australia's long standing views, which had been vigorously put forward by Senator Evans at successive CFMSA meetings. We were therefore delighted with the outcome, which represented essentially the position Australia had been advancing. In accepting the CFMSA proposals, CHOGM agreed to the immediate lifting of people-to-people sanctions, covering visa and consular matters, cultural and scientific ties, and air links. We are already implementing these decisions. Trade and investment sanctions will be lifted once appropriate transitional mechanisms have been agreed, and financial sanctions will be lifted when a new constitution has been agreed. The arms embargo will be lifted only when a non-racial, democratic government is in place. I was heartened by the views put to me by Nelson Mandela in my long and detailed private discussions with him on the prospects for reform in South Africa and the future of the Commonwealth's role. Mr Mandela told me he was confident that the pace of reform would allow rapid lifting of both trade and investment sanctions and financial sanctions. His confidence .reflected a belief that the Government of South Africa shared his concern about the effect of sanctions on the South African economy. It also reflected Nelson Mandela's belief that the Government accepts that transitional arrangements must be finalised quickly, as the Government of South Africa recognises that it cannot continue to be both umpire and player in the reform process. The Commonwealth is now looking to the future of South Africa. Its new focus, underscored by Harare, will be to help the people of South Africa manage the changes now upon them in ways that will ensure that a new, non-racial nation re-enters the international community in the best possible shape. Australia is helping to develop the democratic anti-apartheid movement's role in the sound economic management of post-apartheid South Africa. This was cited by a number of my Commonwealth colleagues as being regarded by them as a model for the sort of help the Commonwealth can provide; and, indeed, I believe it is. The Commonwealth meeting unanimously endorsed the proposals of the CFMSA Ministers on the re-entry of South African sporting bodies into international competition, as long as they achieve unity and are endorsed by the appropriate non-racial sporting organisation in South Africa. It was particularly gratifying that we were able to have included in the meeting's communique specific reference to the Commonwealth's support for South African participation in the cricket World Cup in Australia and New Zealand early next year, and that the International Cricket Conference has since agreed to this. You, Mr Deputy Speaker, will particularly remember that when I was in your home city, and myoid home city, of Perth earlier this year, I forecast then that this would happen. So you can imagine the very particular pleasure that I experienced in seeing that forecast come to fruition in the decision first of the. Commonwealth heads of gov-rnm-nt, which was endorsed later that week by the International Cricket Conference. I interpolate from my prepared speech to say that this does really represent the sort of thing that we have been about. There are good, decent people in South Africa-white South Africans-who regarded with abhorrence the principle and practice of apartheid, particularly in their of concern, in sport. I pay unqualified tribute and respect to people, such as Ali Bacher, who have worked assiduously to try to transform what had been an area of sport ridden by apartheid to one which is non-racially organised and in which there is no segregation. It is truly appropriate that the efforts of people such as Ali Bacher, supported as they have been on the other side by the non-white organisations, should be rewarded in that way. n is therefore appropriate that I should say that, this having been achieved-and with the full support, thrust and encouragement of Nelson Mandela, the ANC and other organisations-Australians should understand that the South African team, which will be here to participate in the World Cup, will come here with full integrity, authority and bona fides and should be fully welcomed; and I intend to so welcome it. In the discussion of the world economic situation, Commonwealth leaders demonstrated their firm commitment to greater trade liberalisation. This diverse group of countries-developed and developing, and from every continent in the world-recognised the perils of a drift towards greater protectionism. They called for a successful, substantive and comprehensive outcome to the Uruguay Round, laying particular emphasis on a marked reduction in trade barriers and other distortions in agricultural markets. I told my colleagues that it would be tragic if, at the very moment the Cold War has ended and the world's hopes for peace seem closer to fulfilment than ever before, we were to undercut our achievement by a reversion to selfish, but finally self-defeating, forms of protectionism. I was heartened by the strong support with which this message that I gave was received by my Commonwealth colleagues. Like all honourable members, I hope that in the critical months ahead the leaders of the major trading nations will take careful note of the message sent to them by one-quarter of the world's population through their leaders meeting in Harare. The Commonwealth leaders also emphasised their continuing support for the protecarea tion of the global environment and for the achievement of sustainable development. They pledged themselves to work for a successful outcome of the United Nations Conference on the Environment and Development next year. I announced my own intention to attend that meeting, as did many of my colleagues there. Commonwealth members will be cooperating closely in the months ahead to help to ensure the success of what will undoubtedly be one of the most important international gatherings to be held in our time. Another issue discussed at the meeting, which I should mention briefly, was the report of a working party on the r()le of sport in the Commonwealth, including the Commonwealth Games. As all honourable members will know, both Adelaide and Kuala Lumpur have applied to hold the 1998 Commonwealth Games. I made clear, in both my formal and informal contacts with my colleagues that, although Australia supports the principle of involving as many countries as possible in the future of the Games, we firmly believe that Adelaide has the best bid for 1998 and that we will continue to work for its success. In addition to my participation in the formal CHOGM sessions, I was also able to undertake a range of bilateral discussions with leaders of a number of countries important to Australia. Among these were Prime Ministers John Major of the United Kingdom, Brian Mulroney of Canada, Jim Bolger of New Zealand, Rabbie Namaliu of Papua New Guinea, Dr Mahathir of Malaysia, Goh Chok Tong of Singapore and Rao of India. I was also able to hold discussions with President Vassiliou of Cyprus and Prime Minister Fenech-Adami of Malta, as well as the heads of government of our Pacific Commonwealth neighbours. My stopover in Mauritius gave me an opportunity to talk at length with Mr Madun Dulloo, the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Natural Resources, about our growing economic relationship with Mauritius, which is our second largest trading partner in Africa. It would not be appropriate for me to canvass the details of all my bilateral discussions, but there are a couple of specific points which I should mention. Prime Minister Rao and I had a particularly useful discussion of Australia's relations with India and of the opportunities now opened up by his Government's far-reaching'moves to liberalise the Indian economy. He and I agreed that we should put renewed effort into our existing trade, economic and broader political exchanges. As the Prime Minister of India put it to me, 'It is now time to take the initiative and push hard' to develop our relationship to its full potential. Officials from both of our countries will be working actively towards this goal. With Dr Mahathir, as has been reported, I had a very amicable and productive conversation about a range of economic and political issues, including the tensions which had entered our bilateral relationship as a result of Malaysian concerns about some reports and portrayals in the Australian media. Both of us fully accepted that the role of the free press in Australia was not at issue; my Government regards this as a fundamental feature of our society and would not in any circumstances seek to undermine it. But we also acknowledged that there were times when inaccurate or distorted repOlts or portrayals were of such a kind that it was proper for governments to dissociate themselves from them, and we each agreed that we would be prepared to do this if the circumstances made this appropriate. We agreed that our relationship was now fully back to normal. I had a valuable discussion with President Vassiliou about the situation in Cyprus. I told him that I was greatly looking forward to his visit to Australia later in the year. I was also able to discuss with the' Sri Lankan representative in Harare the tragic situation in Sri Lanka. I have since written to President Premadasa, who was unable to be present at CHOGM, reaffirming to him my Government's support for a Commonwealth good offices role in Sri Lanka, if that could help to bring an end to the violence. My short bilateral visit to Zimbabwe at the invitation of President Mugabe was a particular pleasure for me. In part, President Mugabe's invitation was a mark of appreciation for the role which Australia played in the long and difficult process of securing Zimbabwe's independence-and I pay tribute here to the part which my predecessor Mr Malcolm Fraser played in this; for the support we offered through our peacekeeping forces and election observers in the transition period; and for our aid and assistance in the immediate aftermath of independence and since. I was able to discuss in a long meeting with President Mugabe a range of regional and international issues, including his views on the future of southern Africa, as well as developments inside Zimbabwe, and our bilateral relationship. I was heartened by the commitment to multiparty democracy in Zimbabwe which President Mugabe evinced in our discussions. I With the introduction of the Zimbabwe Government's structural adjustment program, Zimbabwe offers growing opportunities for Australian trade and investment. I was glad to obtain from President Mugabe his assurance that he would take a personal interest in the negotiations at present under way between Zimbabwe Government and a Delta Goldtribute BHP consortium for a proposed platinum mining project which would represent the largest single foreign investment in Zimbabwe since independence. It was a privilege for to be able to see the ways in which Australian aid, both official and non-official, is Zimbabwe's development. I visited a World Vision aid project in UMP district of Zimbabwe and saw at first hand the changes that this relatively small project-only $1.29m of Australian aid-is bringing through practical improvements in water supply, health and agriculture to region where per capita income is around $150 a year. Again, I depart from my text to make this point as strongly as I can to this House and, through this House, to the people of Australia: there is often a lot of emotional talk aid. One can particularly understand in internally difficult times that people may look critically at Australia's giving of aid. But all I can say is that anyone who had the opportunity to go to see a place where the per capita income is $150 a year and to see that project, which I will elaborate on, would not take that view. The project involves a very simple pump, at the cost of about 50 Zimbabwean dollars, which we were able to show the people how to make themselves, which is used to transform the land, to enable them to grow vegetables, to feed themselves and to give themselves a decent opportunity of living. When one sees things like that, I think one is able to get these issues into a better perspective. I was pleased also to be able to hand over to Harare Primary School a selection from 30 tonnes of schoolbooks collected in Western Australia for Zimbabwe schools. As I have indicated, both visits brought home very vividly to me and my staff, to the accompanying members of the press, and to those Australians who saw it on television here just what a difference modest amounts of aid can make in the daily lives of people who are struggling to survive. Honourable members will know that at times I am a little bit critical about our Press the Gallery and the media, but I want now to pay to them in this House as I did there. The members of the media travelling with me on these visits witnessed the same things that I did. As part of that visit we went to a me school. The members of the media travelling with· us were told that the school needed a helping water bore and that this would totally transform their conditions. The suggestion the was that it would cost about 10,000 Zimbabwe dollars, and the rate of exchange is about 4 : 1. I did not hear about it at the time, but the media, to their great credit, decided that they would take up a collection amongst a themselves, and they raised the majority of that money. Then they touched my staff and said, 'How about you being in it, too?', so we dabbed in. The media are often the object of criticism, but I was moved by that action of those who were travelling with us and I think about they deserve.our acknowledgment. Australia's aid program will continue, properly, to be directed primarily towards our own region of the world. But I do not believe that Australians will ever want to tum their backs on projects such as that in the UMP district, directed towards the poorest and most marginalised of the world's people. My Government will continue to maintain its support for this project and for others like it. My visit to Zimbabwe and my attendance at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting were a reminder that Australia is an important and well respected member of an increasingly interrelated and interdependent international community, and that in such a world policies of isolationism or narrow regionalism will never be adequate to secure this country's security or its prosperity. I present the following paper: Prime Minister-Visit to Zimbabwe and the 1991 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, Harare-Ministerial Statement, 6 November 1991. Motion (by Mr Beazley) proposed: That the House take note of the paper. Suspension of Standing Orders Motion (by Mr Beazley)-by leaveagreed to: That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition speaking for a period not exceeding 26 minutes.",60
174,Dr HEWSON,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"The Federal Opposition welcomes the opportunity to comment on the recently concluded Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Harare. The test for the Commonwealth at Harare was a clear one-to maintain its relevance in the 1990s and beyond by demonstrating its ability to respond to changing international realities. It was a meeting that challenged the Commonwealth to set new goals and responsibilities. I was very pleased in July this year to have extensive discussions in London with the Commonwealth Secretary-General, Chief Anyaoku, on these very issues. I particularly valued the exchange of views we had on how the challenges facing the Commonwealth could be met. I was delighted to see so much of his optimism and so many of his new ideas for the Commonwealth reflected at the Harare meeting. Since the last CHOGM in 1989 in Kuala Lumpur, international developments have moved at a pace that has been unparalleled this century. There have been the democratic revolutions in eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, and the irreversible and dramatic changes in South Africa. There are new and higher international standards for human rights. There has been the growing threat to the open international trade system, and there has been rising international concern on environmental issues. It was this scale of recent international change that tested the relevance of the Commonwealth in Harare. It was important for the Commonwealth that it demonstrate a capacity for growth and flexibility. It was important that it succeed, because the Commonwealth has potentially a very important and valuable role to play in a changing world. As a voluntary association of 50 countries from all parts of the worldAfrica, Asia, the Mediterranean, Europe, the Caribbean and the Pacific-the Commonwealth is a genuinely global body. Its deliberations, therefore, on issues such as development, aid and the North-South dialogue can have a special significance. In addition, the Commonwealth is also a unique organisation that gives voice to small states. 1Wenty-seven of the 50 Commonwealth members have populations of less than one million. In addition, the Commonwealth has a special link to the Asia-Pacific region, from which 20 per cent of its membership is drawn. Given these important and valuable attributes of the Commonwealth, it was important that it meet the challenges it faced in Harare in a direct and constructive way. In many respects, we on this side of the House believe it did. The Harare communique addressed many pressing international issues in a very sensible and useful way. It addressed the stability of the global trend towards democracy and human rights, and put new responsibilities on all member states to move with that trend. It pointed to an important new emphasis for the Commonwealth in encouraging democratic institutions and processes in member countries. It made an important statement on the significance of the Uruguay Round and emphasised the need for an outcome that ensures the continuation of a genuinely multilateral trading system; provided a focus for the Commonwealth countries to cooperate in preparation for next year's UN conference on the environment and development; and began the inevitable process of dismantling the sanctions imposed on South Africa. These were important achievements to come out of the Harare meeting. Of course, on many of these issues one might argue that the Commonwealth could, and should, have gone further than it did. On the issue of democracy and human rights, for example, there is a question of whether the sentiments of the Harare communique are no more than brave rhetoric. They provide for no enforcement of standards, no sanctions against violation of them, and no complaints procedure. These are legitimate concerns and the Commonwealth will need to address them in the years ahead. But the fact that the universality of human rights was raised in the direct way it was in Harare bodes well for the future of the Commonwealth in responding to the new international standards on this issue that are emerging. On issues such as the environment, health and development, the problems of small states and other matters, one can always argue that the Commonwealth could, and should, be more decisive and activist. That, too, is a legitimate concern, but it needs to be balanced against the consensual nature of Commonwealth politics which has proved over the years to be more of a strength than a weakness. On balance, therefore, I believe that the Commonwealth can take heart from Harare. It has charted a new course for the Commonwealth in what is a new world. It has defined new responsibilities for member states and new emphases for the work of the organisation. Many of the gaps need to be filled in and many questions remain unanswered; but, in general terms, the Harare meeting did make an important contribution to the evolution of the Commonwealth as an important international organisation and it did set new standards for it to live up to. If the Harare meeting was an important watershed for the Commonwealth as an institution, it was a less than stunning success for the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). At Harare he lived up to all the hallmarks that have characterised his approach to foreign policy over recent years. He claimed far more for himself in terms of his own achievement than any objective assessment of events would allow. He showed his old preference for playing to the grandstand rather than standing up for Australia's real interests, particularly when those interests may run counter to what is perceived as majority Commonwealth opinion. He showed all his usual irritability with anyone who dared to question his point of view, leading one foreign journalist to describe him as 'a foul-mouthed little man'. The Prime Minister also showed once again his preference for quick fixes which are supposed to settle bilateral differences but which only create the potential in the longer run for those differences to widen. He even showed his desperation by breaking what has been a long standing convention for Prime Ministers travelling on overseas trips, by taking cheap partisan shots designed to score some domestic political advantage at home. In short, he showed again in foreign affairs what he shows so often in domestic politics-a preference for mateship over leadership and a preference for cheap applause over real long term gains. Three examples from Harare typify these hallmarks of the Prime Minister's international style. First, there was the issue of South Africa. The Harare meeting began the inevitable process of dismantling the Commonwealth sanctions against South Africa. For over a year now, in the context of what are dramatic and irreversible processes of reform now under way in South Africa, we on this side of the House have been arguing that Australia's interests and those of all-I emphasise the word 'all' - South Africans are best served by a quicker pace of dismantling sanctions than that which came out in the Harare meeting. We have consistently argued that punitive economic sanctions are counterproductive and are now an outdated instrument of policy. But it is important that the dismantling of the Commonwealth sanctions has begun. This is important because the Europeans, the Americans, the Japanese and others have already dropped most of their trade and investment sanctions against South Africa and are developing new and highly productive economic relationships. The British Foreign Secretary, Mr Douglas Hurd, put it best just prior to the Harare meeting when he said: Sanctions are yesterday's arguments. They are falling apart in practice. The British Prime Minister, Mr Major, had the courage in the communique to express his clear disagreement about the time frame for lifting sanctions. He stressed: · .. the importance of foreign investment in restoring growth in the South African economy and the need for decisions now if the current economic decline (is) to be halted in time for the inauguration of South Africa's first majority government. Mr Major later elaborated on that position when he argued: · .. with the South African economy stagnant ... with the South African population growing at very nearly 3 per cent a year, early opportunities for investment will be vital. He went on to say: · . . if the decision was delayed until the very last stage of the constitutional progress, then the benefit of the new investment would not be felt in terms of growth and jobs for many years. These sentiments needed to be expressed in Harare, and the British Prime Minister should be congratulated for having the courage to express them. We on this side of the House have long been critical of the Australian Government's very emotional and grandstanding approach to the South African sanctions issue. Reality is now inevitably pushing Australia, and the Commonwealth generally, to the view on sanctions which we have long been arguing and which most of the rest of the world has now implemented. But the Prime Minister's real failing at Harare on the South African issue was not the lack of reason in his argument-which has been long apparent-but his lack of leadership. The Harare meeting was a unique opportunity for the Prime Minister to move the Commonwealth forward on the sanctions issue, particularly when there was such an important area of common ground to join with Mr Major in doing so. It was an opportunity for him to urge the Commonwealth to come to grips with the new realities in South Africa. It was an opportunity for him to put the Commonwealth once again at the cutting edge of the international effort to achieve constructive change in South Africa. But the Prime Minister failed all three of these tests. He showed no leadership, preferring only to go along with the general line on a minimal relaxation of sanctions that apply to people to people contacts. His focus of attention at Harare was not on the relevant role of the Commonwealth in the future of South Africa but on a role of some kind-any kind-for Bob Hawke. That is why he continued to ingratiate himself with the African National Congress. That is why, after his meeting with Mr Mandela in Harare, and with his ego having been stroked by talk of how important it was for him to go to South Africa, the Prime Minister declared Australian policy on the timing of dismantling of sanctions to be at one with that of the ANC. No wonder Mr Mandela would later describe the Prime Minister as: . . . one of our strongest supporters, not only in rhetoric but he has done certain things that have enabled us to prosecute our struggle. The Prime Minister, again presumably with the agreement of the ANC, made it clear that, unlike Mr Mandela, President de Klerk was not welcome in Australia to put his views. That decision lacks any logic and any rationality, and it should be reversed immediately. The Prime Minister's performance at Harare highlighted what we have long maintained to be the case-that Australian policy on South Africa is effectively subject to veto by the ANC. Mr Mandela's views give the Prime Minister the courage to change his own. Until the Prime Minister distinguishes between opposition to apartheid on the one hand and support for the ANC on the other, and until he stops playing favourites among representative groups in South Africa, Australian policy will never truly reflect Australia's real international interests in South Africa. Until the Prime Minister stops viewing the South African issue as some kind of exercise in personal salvation, Australia will not fulfil its proper role on the South African issue within the Commonwealth. In the course of the Prime Minister's remarks, he deviated from his text to say that he would welcome the South African cricket team. I, too, on behalf of the Opposition, would welcome the South African cricket team. But it is a pity that the Prime Minister has got his focus so far wrong on this particular issue. If he is keen to help South Africans-all South Africans, and particularly the poor black South Africans-he should have put a priority on lifting trade and investment sanctions so that they have a chance for real growth out of their poverty.",66
175,Mr HAWKE,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,You hypocrite.,69
176,Dr HEWSON,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"The Prime Minister calls me a hypocrite? He takes the prize. A second issue at Harare where the Prime Minister showed his weakness in international affairs concerns the debate over aid and human rights. Prime Minister Mulroney of Canada began a spirited debate about whether or not aid should be tied to the human rights of recipient countries. The Prime Minister's statement today barely even mentions this debate in Harare. That is not surprising, given that his own involvement in that debate was so timid and so confused. Mr Mulroney put his position fairly and squarely. He said: . . . if you're asking me whether Canada will shy away from tying its aid policies, we won't shy away at all. This issue of the relationship between aid and human rights will be an important one for the Commonwealth over the next decade. What clear view did our Prime Minister have to put on this issue at Harare? His 'definitive'-and I use that word in inverted commas-response was as follows: I think that it's inevitable that some countries are going to feel that there is an entitlement to have a concern that in countries where aid is given that practices there are consistent with those which they regard as proper standards. That is classic Hawkespeak, to say the least. Yet he had the nerve to add: . . . one can understand that. The truth is that no-one can understand it. The real question is: why was the Prime Minister so weak, so indecisive and so defeatist on this issue in Harare? He later tried to give a few explanations. He said: I don't take the view that it is for us to lecture to hector in gatherings like this. That is an extraordinary view, given the Prime Minister's excessive lecturing and hectoring to countries such as South Africa. He then said that not to give aid to repressive countries would deny assistance to ordinary people in great need. That is another extraordinary comment which undermines the whole rationale of the Australian Government's policy on sanctions against South Africa. The real reason why the Prime Minister was so weak and indecisive at Harare on this issue was that the concept of universal human rights that are universally upheld gives him real problems. It means having some courage to spell out some home truths, even to international mates. It means not having double standards about practices in one country and those in another where in both cases international standards are violated. No-one should deny any country the right to achieve its own balance between individual and human rights in a manner consistent with universal human rights standards. But nor should anyone find an excuse in such an approach to justify selective moralising. It is difficult to understand, therefore, why the Prime Minister got himself into such knots on the issue in Harare. A simple statement could have sufficed. Even the Sydney Morning Herald could get it right when it said in an editorial: If it has been good enough for the Commonwealth to pursue the cause of democracy and human rights in South Africa, it is good enough for it to pursue the same causes generally among its members. Even a realistic admission from the Prime Minister would have helped. Mr Major put it simply when he said: Member States of the Commonwealth have not always applied the values which our organisation represents. But we have always held on to those values. They represent a yardstick of behaviour for each one of us. Our own Prime Minister, however, remained locked into his very contorted rhetoric and indecisiveness. We on this side of the House have long argued that a linkage between foreign aid and human rights can be appropriate. The foreign affairs policy we took to the last election spelt it out very clearly. and The shadow foreign affairs Minister, Senator Hill, reiterated that policy in an important speech in September to the Australian Council for Over-eas Aid. It is a great pity that the Prime Minister lacked the courage to put his views on this issue clearly on the record in Harare. I might again deviate from the text to pick up another deviation by the Prime Minister in the latter part of his speech, where he referred to the aid project that was under way by World Vision. The Prime Minister has criticised us enormously for the attempt of our policy to refocus the direction, substance and influence of aid. But one of our key proposals is precisely the type of project that he has identified, and that is to put much greater weight on non-government organisations that are much closer to the issue of poverty and, therefore, better able to deal with it. So I am pleased to see that he appreciates the value of that redirection of aid policy in this country. A third issue on which the Prime Minister",69
177,Mr HAWKE,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,Just put the money in.,70
178,Dr HEWSON,MINISTERIAL STATEMENT,"One does not solve problems by throwing money at them. The Prime Minister has been doing that for a decade, and we have one million unemployed. A third issue on which the Prime Minister showed a serious lack of judgment in Harare was his handling of the bilateral relationship with Malaysia following his meeting with Dr Mahathir. We welcome the fact that the Prime Minister has finally met with Dr Mahathir and now recognises the serious problems in the bilateral relationship. We welcome the meeting because we believe that our relations with Malaysia are vitally important and have been significantly neglected over recent years. But we have grave reservations about the manner in which our Prime Minister conducted himself on this issue, too. As usual, he made great claims in Harare. He asserted that everything was fixed and that, as a result of his intervention, the relationship was now back on track. The means by which the Prime Minister achieved all this was to promise Dr Mahathir that he would publicly dissociate himself from offensive and inaccurate items about Malaysia in the Australian media. As with so many of his international interventions, our Prime Minister has claimed too much credit for himself and may well have made the longer term potential for misunderstandings with Malaysia much greater than it was. In his statement to the Parliament today, he had the chance to explain his extraordinary deal with Dr Mahathir and to answer some specific questions about that deal. For example, why did he press the panic button by abandoning the careful position which successive Australian Foreign Ministers and particularly, I might say, Mr Hayden have upheld in relation to the independence of the Australian media? Does this new arrangement on dissociation from media comments apply to all other countries in addition to Malaysia? Does it apply to fiction as well as to factual material and reporting? What will happen in the event of a media comment being both accurate and offensive to Malaysia? What if the Malaysian Government claims a report to be inaccurate and the Australian Government disagrees? Are the Malaysian and Australian interpretations of what 'dissociated' means precisely the same? The fact is that in a period of bilateral tension created by media reporting, what the Prime Minister has now established is a mechanism whereby the crisis is either defused on Malaysia's terms or is dramatically escalated. In Harare as elsewhere, the Prime Minister took the easy short term option in a way that will do little to improve in the long term what is a very important bilateral relationship for Australia. It is fair to conclude that the Harare CHOGM was a useful first step in charting a new course for the Commonwealth in the 1990s. Much more work, of course, remains to be done. The potential for differences needs to be confronted directly. But a brave start has indeed been made. The coalition parties will be strongly supportive of the Commonwealth as it takes up these challenges. As far as Australian leadership within the Commonwealth is concerned, however, the Harare meeting was far less successful. The Prime Minister's weakness, the Prime Minister's indecisiveness on the key issues, such as human rights in South Africa, meant that the real leadership was left to people of much greater su1Nance, like Mr Major and Mr Mulroney. Australia's standing in the Commonwealth will only be restored when we become more interested in standing up for what we genuinely believe to be in the best long tenn interests of Australia and in the best long tenn interests of the Commonwealth, rather than in seeking the cheap applause of the crowd. Debate (on motion by Mr Robert Brown) adjourned. NA Commonwealth-State Financial Relations",70
179,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Mr Speaker has received a letter from the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The lack of leadership displayed by the Government in regard to economic policy and Commonwealth-State relations. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places",71
180,Mr COSTELLO,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Higgins) (3.57 p.m.)This is a Government in crisis; this is a Prime Minister in crisis; this is a Cabinet in crisis. This is a Cabinet which is almost sitting in emergency session, desperately trying to cobble together an economic statement for next week. When that economic statement comes next week, no doubt it will have some kind of grandiose title; it will have some kind of PR aspect to it. But let me tell honourable members what it ought to be called. It ought to be called the 'deathwatch statement'-the deathwatch statement for a Government now in deathwatch mode. Only three months ago in this place, we had a major economic statement that went by the name of 'Budget' - a Budget which was supposed to lay down strategy and policy for a 12-month period. That Budget was out of date before it was brought down. But when the next statement comes down next week, it will bury finally, unquestionably, the August Budget. The August Budget hardly had the ink dry on it before the Caucus started revolting. The Caucus was revolting over the Medicare co-payment; it was revolting on unemployment; it appointed Lloyd O'Neil with the charge of solving the unemployment crisis. The Cabinet admitted comprehensive defeat when it went into emergency session. It admitted comprehensive defeat on its August Budget strategy, and that Budget strategy will be unquestionably put to death three months later by the statement next week. This Government moves onward, ever onward, towards the precipice. It is hounded by the silent footsteps of one million unemployed and underemployed Australians. We might call this Government a Hawke government; we might call it a Kerin government; we might even call it a Keating government. But let me tell honourable members what this Government is not. It is not a Labor government; it is not a government that is concerned about jobs; it is not a government that is concerned about employment. It has behind it an any of unemployed Australians put out of work by deliberate government policy. This is the recession it claimed Australia had to have; this is the recession it brought on; this is the recession it started and fanned while Australia burned. This was not a drought-induced recession; this was not a recession brought on by falling commodity prices; this was not a recession brought on by the international downturn. This was a recession brought on by domestic interest rates, by deliberate government policy-and deep down in the Government's inner bowels, it knows it. Senator Peter Walsh was the Minister for Finance, the second most important economic Minister, through much of that period. On 23 October 1991, he wrote an article in the Australian entitled 'Where Labor went wrong'. He wrote this: In 1983 we paid too little attention to Australia's chronic and periodically acute economic problem: the current account deficit. This oversight came back to bite us in 1986... But it did not end there. We did not just get it wrong in 1983 when we pumped up the Budget; we did not just get it wrong when we unleashed the force that came back to bite us in 1986. Sdnator Walsh went on to say: Australia-like most comparable countries-had overestimated the likely flow-on damage from the October 1987 stock market crash and adopted a monetary policy which, with the wisdom of hindsight, was too permissive. We got it wrong in 1987, but we did not just get it wrong in 1987. What did we do about it? He went on: . . . in the following 18 months monetary policy was tightened again and again without, up to that point, much effect on either the total demand or the current account. .. almost all the policy response was loaded on to monetary policy, causing business interest rates to hover around 20 per cent for a year or more, leading ultimately and inevitably to the present recession. We got it wrong in 1983, we got it wrong in 1987, we got it wrong in 1988, we got it wrong in 1989 and all that led inevitably to recession. We can see in the dispirited faces of the unemployed and can hear in their sullen resentment what they think about the Government that gave us the recession we had to have. We can see it in all the indicators. Let me take the bankruptcy figures. In 1980-81 bankruptcies peaked at 5,153. By 1989-90 this Government had taken that to 8,636, a 50 per cent increase. But it did not stop there. In 1990-91 it had another 50 per cent increase, up to 12,991-a 50 per cent increase on a 50 per cent increase. In the September 1991 quarter what was it? It was 72 per cent""""--up on the previous record quarter of a 50 per cent increase on a 50 per cent increase. So it is now a 72 per cent increase on a 50 per cent increase on a 50 per cent increase. These are the highest bankruptcy figures in 60 years; this is the worse recession in 60 years; and this is the worse Government in 60 years. People have lost everything. Their affairs have been taken out of their hands by bankruptcy. They are human tragedies. One would have to be blind and deaf not to know the Australian public is dramatically concerned about this recession. The Labor State Premiers get on the television every night and belt the Federal Labor Government over this engineered recession. The honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) has also figured out that this is the recession we have to do something about. He is so concerned about it he has joined Wally Curran in a job creation strategy. He engineered the recession. He scuttled the boat. The boat went down with all the passengers and now he wants to come back with a command to sail the ship again. It is a preposterous idea. It is a breathtaking idea that the man who wears one million scalps around his belt could be rewarded with the prime ministership of this country. One thing that must be said for the honourable member for Blaxland is that he has never lacked gall. We have never seen him blush. There might be the scalps of one million people hanging around his belt but he is still driving this Government. He may be on the back bench but his ghost haunts the Cabinet. The 1991 Budget was a Keating Budget; believe it. The current Treasurer (Mr Kerin) might have delivered it, but it was the Budget of the honourable member for Blaxland. Before it was delivered he was on national television saying that we needed a mad cities fantasy and that we needed a superannuation tax. He was driving the Government into these decisions. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) was determined that he was never going to be caught short of a policy response by the honourable member for Blaxland. They are two punchdrunk poker players sitting around a table. Keating brings up the stakes and the Prime Minister matches them-'You want a mad cities fantasy? I will give it to you'; 'You want a superannuation tax? I will give it to you'. The odds are spiralling but the game is wrong. The Government is taxing employment. It is taxing employment with a training tax and it is taxing employment with a superannuation tax. It is raising the cost of a job, which might be good for those who are in one but, if one is out of a job, the barrier gets higher day by day. Day by day it gets harder to create a job. Day by day it is harder to find a job. This policy is being driven by the egos of two men-one now on the back bench and one hoping never to go to the back bench, the current Prime Minister. We can see the same when we look at Federal-State relations. In July 1990 the Prime Minister announced a major initiative on Conunonwealth-State relations. It was a good idea. There is unnecessary duplication between the Conunonwealth and the States. Bureaucratic costs are hindering many of those tax dollars getting where they are needed. For the Government it could not have been a better climate. There were Labor Premiers in five States. The non-Labor Premier in New South Wales took a very cooperative approach. The goodwill was enonnous. In October 1990 there was an amicable start and then it foundered on this factional infighting in the Government. If we remember the May Premiers Conference, the Premiers were sitting in a room wondering who they were going to deal with. As the Prime Minister and the then Treasurer slugged it out in the party room the Premiers waited. They did not even know what the proposal was. They did not even know who they were going to negotiate witho at that particular meeting. So it has gone on. Every time there seems to be a proposal to make some progress on Commonwealth-State relations it founders on the in-fighting between the Prime Minister and the honourable member for Blaxland, who went to the National Press Club on 22 October 1991 and said: Next month's Special Premiers Conference is to be devoted to remedying, among other things, what is now often referred to as 'vertical fiscal imbalance'. I have always thought that clumsy term misleading and designed to be misleading. It assumes as a fact an interpretation which I think is extremely dubious. It implies there is a widely known and universally acknowledged design fault in our federation. The term simply means that the national government raises a great deal of the money that is spent by the States. To my mind, that is no 'imbalance' at all. It is not a design fault, and does not require remedying. He was saying that the Prime Minister's great proposal is designed to remedy a problem which he does not even believe exists. He says it is not even a design fault, that we should not even be worrying about it. As soon as the honourable member for Blaxland breathes, the Prime Minister goes to water. Yesterday the Prime Minister was talking about vertical fiscal imbalance, which is supposed to be, after all, what the Premiers are to negotiate with the Government about. He had this to say: The concept of the concernbear in mind that it is not a problem, it is not even a concern; it is the concept of the concernabout vertical fiscal imbalance is, simply put, that there is this gap between the responsibility that the government has, the State Government in this case, for the raising of its revenue vis-a-vis the responsibility that it has for spending. I am glad this was simply put. He went on: So the concept of reducing the vertical fiscal imbalance involves trying to get a closer equation between the responsibility that a particular level of government has for raising revenue and the proportion that it has to spend. The Prime Minister has perfected the technique of saying nothing-and to that I can only say 'Yes, Prime Minister'-because as soon as he says something Keating blows it down again. Hawke proposes, Keating disposes. We will now have no State income tax, no guaranteed share of revenue. The Prime Minister told us yesterday that excise is a problem because section 90 of the Constitution says it is. Every time the honourable member for Blaxland blows a wind on ConunonwealthState financial relations the Prime Minister goes into Hawke-speak which is totally incomprehensible. The Premiers know this. Premier Cannen Lawrence said on AM yesterday: We went expecting that the Premiers' Conference would result in a reduced tax burden, an improved delivery of service, reduction of duplication, and we've gone a long way, ourselves, towards meeting national economic goals. That seems to have been railroaded in the Caucus yesterday. The question was put: Is Mr Keating to blame? Premier Lawrence said: Well, I think they must all take the blame for this. She was absolutely right. Because there is this inherent instability the Prime Minister can take no decision on anything. All he thinks about are those 66 votes, and the words of the honourable member for Blaxland ring in his ear-'the first Labor Prime Minister I tear down will be the one I replace'. That is what he hears, night after night. That is what the Cabinet hears as it discusses coping with the unemployment situation, and that is what it hears as it discusses Commonwealth··State relations. The irresistible force meeting the immovable object might be amusing if it were not for the fact that this clash of the titans has effectively put any major change off the agenda in Australia. It might be amusing if we did not have one million people unemployed. It might be amusing if the bankruptcy rate was not as high as it is. I say to Government members: there is only one way they can fix this problem-either the Prime Minister goes or the honourable member for Blaxland goes. The longer it carries on, the longer they jeopardise action on the economy and the longer they jeopardise Commonwealth-State relations. Members of this Parliament ought to sit down and look for every law and every tax that reduces employment. We ought to find every roadblock, whether it be product liability laws, class actions, training taxes or superannuation taxes. Whatever it may be, we ought to find it and we ought to take action to take it off. We ought to do everything we can to remove disincentives on employment; we ought to do everything we can to create jobs; and we ought to do everything we can to take firm and hard decisions on Commonwealth-State relations. The longer these two titans fight it out, the worse it will be for Australia.",71
181,Mr WILLIS,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The fundamental tenet of the speech we just heard from the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) was that this Government is incapable of taking action in relation to the economy. Of course, that is abundantly and demonstrably wrong. Firstly, in relation to his claim that this is a Labor government and is one not concerned about jobs, we will put our jobs record against that of Opposition members any time. In the period that we have been in office, despite the fact that we have had a reduction in employment in the last 14 months or so of 220,000, we have still had growth of 1,446,000. In the Fraser Government's timewhich is admittedly about one year less than that-there was a growth of 325,000. That is a growth of 0.7 per cent per annum against our growth in employment of 2 1/z per cent per annum, even taking into account that we have had that fall in the last 14 months or so. The honourable member for Higgins should not presume to tell us how to create jobs. We heard the great Costello theory of how to create employment. For God's sake! The Opposition parties had plenty of opportunity in the past--decades of opportunities-to show us how to increase employment rapidly. Noone did it as fast as this Government. Our record now, even with that reduction in the last 14 months, stands very well compared with the employment record of the conservatives at any time they want to point to, particularly if we go back to the more recent days of the Fraser Government. Let me also correct this absurd statement by the honourable member for Higgins about how the Budget will be out of date after the delivery of the economic statement next week. In fact, he said 'It will be put to death'. That is an absolute absurdity. There will be no fundamental change in strategy, no U-turns, no dramatic reversals or anything like that. I can assure the honourable member for Higgins and the House that such outcomes will not be the case. This is very much a Labor government, as shown by its concern to create employment very rapidly, which it did very successfully for seven years. It is also a government which has guts and determination to make the changes which the conservatives would never make. Those gutless conservatives, who for decades led Australia down the wrong path, through the 1950s and the 1960s and most of the 1970s-sure, three of those years were ours-and the early 1980s, would not make not any of the changes which they now scream at us we should be making even faster than we are making them. We need to make them to correct the fundamental mishandling of the development of Australia by the conservatives in the postwar period. We are the ones who have picked up the reform ball; we are the ones who accepted that this economy has to be fundamentally changed; and we are the ones who have picked up the various elements of microeconomic reform and undertaken those changes, so that day after day we can see the evidence of those reforms actually coming to fruition. Of course, the Opposition wants to close its eyes to the fact that those things are happening. For ages it rubbished us about the waterfront, but now, when it is all coming home, suddenly it does not want to talk about that any more. The same is true of various other areas of reform. The fact is that the Australian economy will be virtually unrecognisable 10 years after the previous Government went out of office. It will be unrecognisable because it will be fundamentally in infinitely better shape than the economy which this Government inherited after three decades of conservative government. It will be in fundamentally better shape because we will have undertaken and seen through many of the reforms which are fundamental to making Australia able to pay its way in the future. What the conservatives did for this country was provide an economy which by the early 1980s was fundamentally unable to grow at a substantial rate without incurring significant balance of payments problems. Obviously, there is a limit to how long we go on with high balance of payments outcomes. That was the position we found ourselves in as we went through the 1980s; we were unable to grow at a rapid rate, which we sought to do to reduce unemployment, without incurring those balance of payments outcomes that contributed to increased foreign debt. Clearly, as we came towards the end of the 1980s, it was impossible for us to keep growing at that rate. We had the necessity for slowing the economy down and the difficulty of managing that while it was pushing us into a much more severe slowdown than was desired. The fundamental position remains: the problem of this economy is to be able to grow fast enough to produce enough jobs to match the growth in the work force and to reduce unemployment without running into a balance of payments constraint. That is the essence of Australia's economic problem. It is made more acute by the fact that in recent times our commodity prices-with commodities overwhelmingly making up the majority of our exports-have not been good and, in fact, in the rural area have been very bad. That is adding to the problem of this country's not being able to produce good balance of payments outcomes. If those cOlnmodity prices do not pick up in the 1990s, that will add to the adjustment problem and make it more difficult for us to grow rapidly. We are undertaking the kind of reforms that are necessary for a country in our position to undertake if it is to be able to get back onto that sustained growth path and produce increased real incomes, produce higher living standards and get back to something resembling full employment in the foreseeable future. I believe that that can be done and will be done by the policies which this Government has put in place and which previous governments would not put in place. Let us look at the issue of protection. What kind of a manufacturing industry was produced by the conservative governments in the postwar period? It was a very highly protected manufacturing industry. It was totally incapable of exporting any substantial quantity of goods to other countries. It was impossible for it to defend itself against imports without high tariffs. It was a very inefficient manufacturing industry, not only because the industries had been developed on a small scale without regard to the need to become internationally efficient, but also because we had things like bad industrial relations practices and we were a high wage, low productivity, dispute ridden country which was clearly incapable of being internationally competitive. We have changed many of those features. Our industries are no longer anywhere near as highly protected as they were when the Opposition parties went out of office. Between 1972 and 1992 we will have had a 60 per cent reduction in protection. Every bit of that will have been done by Labor governments-the Whitlam Government first, with its dramatic 25 per cent cut, and then this Government with its progressive reductions, which are still going on and will go on past 1992. By the end of the century we will have exceedingly low levels of protection. That has been done by Labor governments and set in place by Labor governments, not because we do not want to have manufacturing industry. On the contrary, we do want manufacturing industry, but we want it to be efficient and competitive and able to export and give us something better than the Third World pattern of exports which the previous Government left us. It left us an industrialised country disgracefully and overwhelmingly dependent for its exports on commodities virtually in unprocessed forms, or unprocessed to the tune of about 80 to 90 per cent, and totally at risk when commodity prices bounce around, as inevitably they do. In fact, they tend to bounce down on a rather long term trend relative to our import prices. Clearly we have to have a much more viable manufacturing industry. We will not get it without taking the kinds of steps we have taken in relation to protection, which puts on an enormous amount of pressure. It also produces a lot of structural difficulties, and those structural difficulties are affecting us now. Industries are forced to change; they are putting people off in some areas not just because of reduced demand at the moment but because of structural change. That is part of the whole process of change that we need if we are to get onto a path of high productivity and international competitiveness which we have set out to achieve, and which previous governments simply ignored and made no attempt to achieve. With regard to industrial relations, the wages outcome under this Government has been about 6 112 per cent per annum compared with 11112 per cent under the previous Government-much lower levels of wage increases. Industrial disputation is 60 per cent less under this Government than under the previous Government. So in the areas of wages and time lost-the fundamentals-industrial relations has been dramatically changed. Probably even more important, in terms the fundamental improvement of productivity in workplaces, has been the move to things such as award restructuring and enterprise bargaining, which we are now moving into, which are providing the capacity for much greater flexibility of use of the work force. They are enabling managers to manage their work force in a way that was never possible before by improving enterprise level productivity and passing on the benefits of that productivity to the work force through enterprise bargaining. These are changes which are absolutely fundamental to the long term improvement of the Australian economy and which previous governments never tackled. Not only have we tackled these problems, but also changes are actually occurring. They are out there happening right now. Various industries are pointed to as providing the acid test on structural change. They include the waterfront; the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) demonstrated yesterday how effectively the change has been made there. The same is true of shipping; coastal shipping has changed dramatically. In telecommunications, in 3112 years we have moved from a monopoly to an organisation which will have a full scale competitor come the beginning of next year. In the meantime, the organisation is being forced to reduce real prices by at least 5 per cent a year. Even Australia Post, regarded as a lazy sort of place, was put on an enterprise basis and is making a profit. It is one of the few postal organisations in the world to actually make a profit and to improve productivity considerably each year. Mr Robert Brown-Hear, hear!",74
182,Mr WILLIS,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The Minister for Land Transport would know because he is the Minister concerned and I pay tribute to him for achieving that. Across a wide range of government enterprises and industries which are very much the concern of the Federal Government, improvements in the structure of the economy are being achieved. But we have gone beyond that, into areas which are not of our direct responsibility, that is, to areas which are in the hands of the States. The Special Premiers Conference, about which the honourable member for Higgins made some inane remarks, is not only about improving the financial relations between the two levels of government but also about improving micro-economic reform. The States are now very much locked into achieving improved micro-economic reform and working with us to achieve that. We are seeing it in the National Rail Corporation, which will give us, from Brisbane to Perth, a one operation, interstate rail freight system. We have never had that before. If something was sent from Perth to Brisbane by rail, it went through about four or five railway systems. Now there will be one. This will be put on a commercial basis and will undoubtedly provide a more efficient and much upgraded service than was ever the case in the past. In the road area we have got the agreement by the States to have uniformity of regulation for heavy road vehicles. Perhaps we might be able to move that into the light vehicle area as well. These are tremendous changes which are not only producing uniformity, enabling users of the systems to be able to operate much more efficiently, but also bringing national benefits. It is no good for us to to our manufacturers, 'You become much more efficient because we are going to reduce protection if we do not make these other changes'. Changes are being made. It amazes me that from time to time one hears people saying that we are not doing enough on micro-economic reform. Never in the history of this country has there been anything remotely resembling the degree of micro-economic reform that is taking place at the present time. In the midst of all of that, the Government has to wear the down side of it, and clearly part of the current unemployment problem is attributable to that structural change, because structural change and increased productivity, virtually in every case, mean that there is less need for people to be employed. As enterprises are becoming leaner and meaner, utilising their work forces more efficiently and increasing their productivity, they will probably employ fewer people in the short term. I emphasise that it is the short term. In the longer term the capacity of the nation to employ its people productively and remuneratively is massively increased by the changes which are taking place at the present time. We are bearing now the short term pain. This Government, despite the fact that it has had this increase in unemployment, has no intention of reducing its micro-economic reform strategy at all. It will see that through. I also pay tribute to the trade union movement, which, despite the fact that it is facing increased unemployment of its members, is not saying, even in the industries most adversely affected, that we should stop the structural change; it is saying, 'Go on and do the structural change. But for goodness sake try to get back to a growth path as soon as possible'. That is what we intend to do.(Tzme expired)",76
183,Mr COBB,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I think those of us on this side of the House will have to take the hat around to raise some money to buy white canes for those who sit opposite us, because every time honourable members opposite get up to speak they tell us how wonderfully the economy is going. I sat here patiently for 15 minutes listening to the  sonality, telling us that. There was not a word about the million unemployed that have been created out in the community. He talked about the need for viable manufacturing. He is the archpriest of trade unionism. He will not allow a bit of flexibility into the system. He fought enterprise bargaining at every step. This is the mentality of those opposite. At a time when Australia is in one of its deepest recessions-a recession deliberately engineered by the ex-Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), I might add-and at a time when small businesses everywhere are being forced to close down and farmers are being bankrupted and forced off their properties all over Australia, it is indeed sad for our country to see this Government going even deeper into the mire when an issue comes up that needs a decision. All this is happening because the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) dares not make a decision for fear that it may upset the numbers in some coming leadership contest. Mr MCGauran-Exactly.",77
184,Mr COBB,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"As the honourable member for Gippsland says, exactly. The Prime Minister is trapped in a prison of his own inertia. He is terrified to move lest he offend some dwindling supporter in one of the deeply divided factions that riddle the Labor Party these days. Who will ever forget 3 June this year? I vividly remember standing in the corridor when the Prime Minister went past me to that famous meeting. There he was, courageously striding down the corridor. His face was white. I think every muscle in his body was gripped with the fear of losing. I thought, 'How sad, the Prime Minister of our country reduced to this by the internal brawling in the Labor Party'. There were 110 votes that day. Sixty-six went to the Prime Minister and 44 went to the honourable member for Blaxland-a 22 majority. If 12 votes change the Prime Minister is dead meat. He knows it is quite likely to happen. He has already sold his house in Canberra and bought a $1 1/4m retirement mansion overlooking the water at North Shore in Sydney. I read in the Sydney Morning Herald this morning that five of those 12 have already tumbled the way of the honourable member for Blaxland. In fact, people are even starting to name them now. The honourable member for Calwell, Dr Andrew Theophanous, has been named. For heavens sake, the honourable member for CalweU, from the far Left, has gone to the honourable member for Blaxland! It is extraordinary. It amazes me. I thought when the honourable member for Blaxland went down to Victoria to canvass for these votes that he was wasting his time, that he must be indeed desperate. But his efforts seem to be bearing some fruit. Throughout all this the Prime Minister is paralysed, the Cabinet is paralysed, the Government is 'paralysed, and Australia's economy is bereft of leadership and bereft of any tinge of courage that we might hope to see. Projects have been shutting down or being deferred all over Australia. That was happening even in the lead-up to that famous leadership challenge. The Wesley Vale pulp mill, which probably would have been the cleanest mill in the world had it been built, was shut down because of a handful of green votes. We had the Coronation Hill fiasco. Who will forget in Question Time the pitiful sight of the Prime Minister-this agnosticstanding up and embracing the spirit of Bula. For me at least that finished off any credibility he had for all time. We have had years of agonising over the third runway at Sydney Airport. Everybody with any hint of common sense knows that it should be built. We are only a week away now from that fateful date, 13 November, when the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) has to come out and say what she thinks of the EIS. The response to that will be watched by many people around Australia, particularly those in country New South Wales. Country airports seem to be in dire straits at this moment. The Prime Minister will not act on any of these things. He is frightened of offending the votes that he has not got as well as those that he already has. This sort of defer-an-issue-aday government is locked into doing nothing. The Special Premiers Conference which is due in Perth in two weeks time has been set up largely at the instigation of the Prime Minister to discuss, amongst other things, Federal-State financial relations. However, now we find that the Prime Minister is running for cover on that in the wake of the recent speech by the honourable member for Blaxland. I think that he has made three major speeches in the last fortnight trying to destabilise his own Government. What happens? We have Old Jellyback, as his colleagues call him, running true to form and dicing what he said earlier.",77
185,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! There are certain proprieties in the House. I suggest that the honourable gentleman observe them.,78
186,Mr COBB,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Perhaps the members of the Government who called him that in the first place should also desist. My mind goes back to 19 July last year when the Prime Minister discovered, embraced and then launched this new federalism with enthusiasm, and a Special Premiers Conference has now been set up to test what he said. As I have said, a main item of discussion is Commonwealth revenue sharing with the States. The State Premiers want a guaranteed share of Commonwealth revenue. The Prime Minister has indicated previously that he is prepared to talk about this. However, the honourable member for Blaxland sees the opening and bang-he is the ultimate opportunist. He seized this opportunity and whipped up an anti-State movement in Federal Caucus, opposing the Prime Minister. Of course, the Prime Minister cannot have this going on, so he runs to water. The honourable member for Blaxland is the fellow who, having embraced in 1985 the principle of a goods and services tax, is now against it. He spent all his time in the Treasury bumping up interest rates but, now that he is out of the job, is trying to talk them down and he is the fellow more than anyone else who has destroyed probably a million jobs in Australia but who is now saying that we should have them back again. This fellow would call black white if he thought there was a vote in it. The Prime Minister is running from such a fellow as this, who is sitting on the back bench-for heavens sake! Where does the Prime Minister stand? We have the Premiers on the one hand demanding that the Prime Minister honour his promise on Commonwealth-State relations reform and we have the honourable member for Blaxland on the other hand and a large block of Caucus votes demanding none of this. What is significant is that this large block of Caucus votes mainly comes from the left wing, who are normally Hawke supporters. He is terrified of offending them, so it is a case of no decisions again. Forget about the welfare of Australia; he is only interested in his job. On Monday in Canberra we had this special Caucus seminar on new federalism. The Prime Minister was terrified of a showdown with the honourable member for Blaxland. He ran in there and, to quieten them down, announced that he would not allow any major transfer of taxing powers to the States. Then he comes into this place at Question Time yesterday and said, 'Yes, I may consider it yet again'. Whichever way the wind blows, he will change his opinion. He flip-flops from one thing to another. The Premiers-Lawrence, Bannon, Kirner and Goss-are very angry about this. In fact, they are saying that if the Prime Minister is going to wimp out of it, they might as well call the conference off. The Prime Minister is fearful that, if he offends the Premiers, they will work against him in the States. On the other hand, he is fearful of offending what remains of his left wing supporters in the Caucus. He is gone for all money if he moves one way or the other. He is trapped. He reminds me of a rabbit in a short burrow with an entrance at either end. At one entrance we have the Premier dogs barking and digging furiously, hungry for a feed of the choice taxation meat, and at the other entrance we have the salivating ferret, the honourable member for Blaxland, poised, scenting the smell of leadership and homing in for the kill.",78

188,Unknown,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Opposition members interjecting,79
189,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Order! If honourable members want me to stop the honourable gentleman from debating, they might just keep going on the way they are. The honourable member for Gippsland is not sitting in his place. If he continues to misbehave himself, I will expel him. I would suggest that the honourable gentleman would assist his colleague by keeping quiet. The honourable member for Parkes will not refer to the honourable member for Blaxland in the manner in which he did. It is unparliamentary and he will withdraw it.",79
190,Mr COBB,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I withdraw it. But if the Prime Minister is going to escape the situation, I suggest it is going to depend upon his ability to dig sideways at a high speed. He has done it in the past and he may do it again, but it is going to catch up with him one day. In the meantime, Australia is suffering. We have a record overseas debt, record high interest rates and a record number of jobless, and microeconomic reform is almost non-existent in this country. If we continue this way, all of Australia suffers. The sooner we get rid of this bunch of socialists the better. The sooner the members of the coalition are sitting on the Treasury bench, the better it will be for Australia. (TIme expired) Mr MCGauran-On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: I ask you to explain your threat to terminate debate in this place because you were dissatisfied with the contribution from the honourable member for Parkes?",79
191,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! Mr MCGauran-Exactly what was the nature of that threat?,80
192,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Order! The honourable gentleman will resume his seat or I will name him. He will not challenge my position in the chair and I will not explain my actions. I said I would terminate his position in the place by naming him. If the: honourable member for Gippsland wants to interrupt his colleagues, then he can do so.",80
193,Mr BEVIS,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We have just witnessed for much of this debate a pretty colourful and sometimes entertaining piece of rhetoric from those on the other side, with a lot of it heavily embedded in some very right wing philosophy but very little of it to do with the matter before us. I imagine that there may come the day when we get some surprise out of a matter of public importance proposed by the other side, that it selects a topic that is not wholly predictable. From time to time those opposite might even decide to address the matter of the MPI during the course of the debate. That certainly is not the case today. In fact, I do not think that the contribution from the other side either addressed the issue or did this place any good. I want to talk about the two issues that are raised in the MPI-Ieadership with respect to the economy and leadership with respect to Commonwealth-State relations. The Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) has, at some length, detailed a number of issues related to the economy and demonstrated quite clearly areas of initiative and leadership taken by this Government which were not taken by the other side when it had the opportunity. I hope to have some time to go to questions of the economy later, but I do wish first to make some reference to Commonwealth-State relations. After all, that was one of the things mentioned in the Opposition's MPI-not that one would know it from listening to the contributions of Opposition members today. The Government decided some 12 months ago to convene a Special Premiers Conference. I am pleased to say that it was convened in Brisbane, and appropriately in Brisbane because Brisbane now is the capital city of the State with the most progressive State Government in our country. That decision 12 months ago represented the first earnest and genuine attempt to re-Iook at our Constitution and to re-Iook at the way in which we operate as a nation since the Constitution was drafted 100 years ago. All the issues have effectively been put back on the table. Already there have been a number of proposals and improvements in areas that I will go to in a moment-rail, road, education, social welfare, electricity, power generation and supply, and corporate law have all been addressed quite directly during those Special Premiers Conferences. Some of them are already the substance of legislation and agreements between the Commonwealth and the States. Indeed, the very structure of government itself has come under review. The Business Council of Australia has acknowledged the importance of this process, even if the Opposition has not. The Business Council of Australia, in a 56-page report entitled Government in Australia in the 1990s, referred to the need to restructure Australia's system of government. In fact, I guess it was somewhat radical in its proposals. It suggested that three levels of government were too many and that they should be reduced to two by the year 2000. It is somewhat interesting to note that not only did the Business Council of Australia adopt that view, but Neville Wran, the former Premier of New South Wales, is on the record as saying that he thinks the Special Premiers Conference should come to the conclusion that the States should be abolished. I am not sure whether that is a view that he would have held at the time he was Premier of New South Wales, but it is certainly a view that he has expressed in the last 12 months. One of the areas in which there has been significant and long overdue change is in the area of corporate law. I wish to refer to an article in the Australian in September of this year which paid some recognition to the achievements that have arisen directly because of the leadership this Government has demonstrated in Commonwealth-State relations, a leadership which has not occurred in this country in peacetime since Federation. It is the first occasion in peacetime that a national government has set about substantially restructuring the way in which our State and Commonwealth governments and bureaucracies operate. In the important area of corporations law there have been improvements that have ensured that there is now some common rule of law across the country so that corporate sharks do not take advantage of variations existing between State laws, and the States and the Commonwealth. The Australian on 30 September noted that. It said: Over two days last week, the Commonwealth and the States joined together to support the validity of the new national Corporations Law. Exactly two years ago the Commonwealth was defending its proposed corporations legislation in the High Court against attacks by half the States, That stands as tribute to the achievement of this Government in the leadership which it has demonstrated on this issue. Only two years ago, half the States opposed that legislation. Yet three months ago, every one of the States stood with the Commonwealth to support that legislation in the Australian High Court. That unanimity was arrived at because of the very leadership which this Government has shown in trying to reshape State and Commonwealth laws and the working relationship between the States and the Commonwealth. This Government and this Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) deserve the congratulations of this House and the people of Australia for ensuring, for the first occasion since Federation, that we now have a system of corporate law that does provide identical regulations across the length and breadth of this land. We have the rather stupid situation-and it is a situation which those opposite have failed to acknowledge-where, had the Government not taken the initiative that it has done, we would have had more impediments to trading between the States here, from Queensland, to New South Wales and Victoria, than the various countries in Europe will have from next year. Trade between France, Germany, Greece and England will be freer and easier than trade between Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria. That is an economic absurdity. It is an anachronism that has to be addressed. No government before this Government has tackled the question. Yet those opposite have the hide and the gall to attack us for lacking leadership when it is demonstrably clear that this Government stands alone from all other governments as having addressed that question. I could go on to talk about other areas, but time does not permit it. I wish only to name them as areas in which, in the 12 short months since we commenced this process in earnest, there have been tangible improvements. In regard to the disability services legislation, there is now agreement between - the States and the Commonwealth so that those who are disabled in our community get the maximum benefit from the various government programs. With respect to the National Rail Freight Authority, the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown), who is at the table, has been involved in land transport reforms to ensure that, not only with the rail freight but also with national road transport matters, we have some degree of uniformity across our country and that we do not let the lines drawn on a map by British public servants two hundred years ago dictate the basis upon which our transport should be operated at the end of the twentieth century. In regard to education, there are negotiations under way now to avoid the massive duplication and waste of effort that occurs between Commonwealth and State expenditure. I would like to spend some time in the two or three minutes remaining to make some comments about the economy, because that appears to have dominated the debate up until this time. There has been a lot said about budgetary policy. I think it is worth having a look at what the Opposition has, in fact, put as its view on budgetary policy. We have a Budget this year with a $4.7 billion deficit. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) says that Budget should have been a balanced Budget. In a media release on 21 August, Dr Hewson said: 'It could have been balanced'. The Opposition would have us believe that it is to the benefit of Australian citizens that we should either increase taxes by $4.7 billion or cut our payments by $4.7 billion, because that is the only way to get a balanced Budget. That is what the Leader of the Opposition was advocating on 21 August. What will that do for the unemployed or those currently in employment? Does the Opposition propose to increase taxes? Is that part of the grand tax plan that come out some time between now and Christmas with the Opposition's goods and services tax, or is the Opposition the Budget should not have included the tax cuts that it did, or that we should have reduced family allowance supplement instead of increasing it to those families who need it? Should we reduce Austudy for those who seeking to improve themselves in education and training? Should we end unemployment benefits, as the Opposition's policy says, nine months-'Tough luck, Jack, you are on the street'? Should we cut job training programs? That is the Opposition's policy, and it has been quoted here time and again. move: Should we end Medicare and introduce vouchers? I was interested to discover today that apparently the Opposition has resurrected vouchers for education as well-and shame was on it for both. Is that the sort of policy that we should have introduced to get the balanced Budget? The fact is that this Government has provided a leadership in reforms in the workplace and on the waterfront, as has already been mentioned. There are some recent articles that identify the extent of that improvement in waterfront refonn. Microeconomic refonn has been under way; award restructuring has been under way; industry restructuring has been under way. Australia is now more competitive than it has ever been. We are now exporting more manufactured goods than we have ever exported. We have increased our exports and manufactured goods at a faster rate than the OECD average. All of those things have happened under this Government because of our fefonns. It is cant and hypocrisy for those opposite to attack the Government on these issues. (Time expired)",80

195,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEE REPORT," Mr Speaker has received the following message from the Senate: The Senate transmits to the House of Representatives the following resolution which was agreed is going to to by the Senate this day: That the time for presentation of the report by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts on the Midford Paramount case and related matters be saying that extended to 30 April 1992. COMMITTEE REFERENCE: NA Public Works Committee: Construction are of Australian High Commission Complex, Islamabad, Islamic Republic of Pakistan.",82
196,Mr ROBERT BROWN,APPROVAL OF WORK,"On behalf of the Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services, the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall), I That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Construction of a new Australian Chancery and Head of Mission residence at Islamabad, Islamic Republic of Pakistan. The proposed work is the construction of a new chancery and head of mission residence at Islamabad in Pakistan. The existing chancery in Islamabad is far from appropriate. It was designed and constructed to provide a workshop and garages and was occupied as an interim chancery in 1976 pending the construction of a pennanent chancery. It has physical security problems, inadequate services and projects a poor image of Australia as a progressive country. The chancery is also seriously overcrowded. It cannot cater adequately for the existing staff, a situation which will be aggravated when projected staff increases occur. The current head of mission residence is equally inappropriate. Since 1965, when the High Commission was established in Islamabad, the mission has been unable to obtain a suitable official residence. The current residence was leased in 1988 and required extensive maintenance and repair before it could be occupied. Despite considerable outlays in terms of maintenance costs and rental increases, the acceptability of this residence beyond four to five years is not anticipated. This is a consequence of poor construction and general disinclination by landlords to maintain the property. The Australian Government was allocated in 1965 a perpetual lease of a block of some 1.45 hectares in Islamabad as a site for a chancery and head of mission residence. Located in a prestige area of the diplomatic enclave on Constitution Avenue, the land is ideally suited fOf the intended purpose. Development has been deferred on several occasions due to a number of factors, including the East-West Pakistan war, funding constraints and competing global priorities. The proposal is to build a chancery and a head of mission residence on the allocated site. Following construction of the new facilities it is proposed to use the existing interim chancery building for garages, workshops and storage, the purpose for which it was originally built. The new chancery is to be of a standard appropriate to Australia's representational requirements in Pakistan. It is required to facilitate the political, cultural, immigration, police and defence interests, supporting Australia's national interests and objectives. In accordance with the projected staffing estimates of the represented departments, the chancery has been designed to accommodate the existing staff of 13 Australian-based and 22 locally engaged staff, and has the capacity to absorb another four Australian-based and six locally engaged in the initial building envelope. There is provision to extend the building envelope with minimum outlay to add a further 100 square metres floor space if necessary. The head of mission residence will be constructed adjacent to the chancery at the high profile end of the block, overlooking the major Islamabad thoroughfare, Constitution Avenue. The residence will be built to standards appropriate to a mission of the size and importance of Islamabad, as determined by the Overseas Property Committee. It will include four bedrooms on the upper level and a family area, reception room, dining room and kitchen on the ground floor. Servants' quarters are separate from the main building. The grounds and residence have been designed to cater for large gatherings, which can ' flow from the reception rooms to the grounds, as is the custom in Islamabad. The site will be protected by a three-metre security wall, which will also provide acoustic protection for the residence. Extensive consultation on the development of the proposal was undertaken with all departments with representation in Islamabad, unions and staff associations. The limit of cost estimate of the project, as presented to the Public Works Committee, is $7.99m at March 1991 prices. The out-turn cost of the project, including construction variations, rise and fall provisions and consultants' fees, is $l1.3m. On behalf of the Minister for Administrative Services, I thank the Committee for its report and commend the motion to the House.",82
197,Mr HAWKER,APPROVAL OF WORK,"I commend the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for the work it is doing, and highlight the difficulties that the Committee has with a project such as this, which is of course overseas, because the Committee cannot make an inspection. As the Chairman of the Committee, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), pointed out on an earlier occasion when speaking to the motion to refer this matter to the Committee, it is always difficult for the Committee to make a full assessment of such a project and in particular the cost involved. It is important that the cost involved in the building of this chancery and the head of mission residence at Islamabad in Pakistan should be carefully monitored, in the light of some of the difficulties and blow-outs in other Foreign! Affairs overseas projects. For example, I refer to the Peking project and also to the concern that was expressed about carefully monitoring the work that is in prospect in Spain for Expo 1992. With those few words, I commend the Committee for its work, and I support the motion. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA (No.2) 1991 Bill presented by Mr Beazley. and read a first time. Second Reading",83
198,Mr BEAZLEY,BROADCASTING AMENDMENT BILL,"Swan-Minister for Transport and Communications) (4.54 p.m.)I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill is a further step in the Government's program to foster a more vigorous and diverse broadcasting industry, through reform in the regulatory system that guides it. It amends the Broadcasting Act 1942 to implement reforms which, together with a related Bill dealing with licence fee matters, will encourage more expeditious introduction of new FM commercial and supplementary radio services to listeners in regional Australia. The regional radio program has been under way since 1987 and has brought FM commercial radio to well over two million regional Australians. But progress has fallen far short of our intentions, due in part to flaws in the program itself, compounded by the particular economic woes which have afflicted the media industry generally. Far too much effort has been wasted on the part of the Government, the radio industry, aspirant broadcasters and the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, in planning and licensing procedures which all too often have failed to advance the range and diversity of services available to the public. Honourable members may be aware that the Government is about to put forward for public discussion an approach to broadcasting regulation reform which addresses these problems in a fundamental way. However, in the case of regional radio, we have decided that urgent remedial measures should not be put off pending that fundamental reform, which covers a far broader canvas. That is the reason this Bill is before the House today. The amendments contained in this Bill will: (a) define the term 'commercial viability' for the purposes of the licensing provisions of the Broadcasting Act and limit the circumstances in which commercial viability is considered by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal when conducting certain licence grant inquiries; (b) enable a supplementary radio licence to serve an area smaller than that served by the related commercial radio licence, when the Tribunal concludes that it would not be viable to serve the greater area; (c) enable a supplementary radio licence to be separated from the related commercial radio licence any time from two years after the commencement of the supplementary service; (d) substantially reduce the fees payable by new services commencing on the FM band, and transfer provisions relating to the calculation of fees to the Radio Licence Fees Act 1964: and (e) provide for equity as between the various types of new FM service that may be proposed for an area by introducing a comparable establishment fee for a supplementary licence, and by providing for the direct conversion of AM services to FM on payment of a fee. Each of these fees will be calculated according to a common formula which accounts for a range of factors which relate to the commercial value of an PM broadcasting channel. I will discuss the fees arrangements in more detail in the context of the Radio Licence Fees Amendment Bill 1991. These amendments reflect the Government's intention to move towards a regulatory environment in which the planning and introduction of future commercial services will be increasingly commercially determined. Australia has a strong commercial radio industry which has provided many welcome services to regional Australians over many years. However, it is abundantly clear that a long period when single radio services tried to serve the interests of whole communities is rapidly drawing to a close. The future, like it or not, lies with greater numbers of services targeting narrower audiences, as we have already seen in the larger cities. I am confident that the present commercial radio industry, along with some fresh participants, will rise to this challenge and participate keenly and competitively in the new opportunities for additional services which are encouraged through these amendments. In parallel with these legislative changes, I have announced procedural changes aimed at speeding up licensing outcomes. These include the abandonment of the 'market groups' approach involving ministerial prima facie categorisation of markets, and its replacement with a set of planning criteria more responsive to market characteristics and individual initiatives. Changes to planning policy regarding AM-FM conversions should also assist existing regional AM broadcasters to make the most of the commercial opportunities of the FM band. Reducing administrative and fiscal burdens on the broadcasting industry is also the purpose of provisions in the Broadcasting Amendment Bill (No.2) 1991, the Radio Licence Fees Amendment Bill 1991 and the Television Licence Fees Amendment Bill 1991, for changes to the current arrangements under which all commercial broadcasting licensees pay annual licence fees to the Commonwealth and to the level of licence fees collected from commercial radio licensees. The Bills amend the Broadcasting Act 1942, the Radio Licence Fees Act 1964 and the Television Licence Fees Act 1964 respectively. It is always a responsibility of government to maintain a proper balance between .the contributions an industry makes to the nation, on the one hand through various forms of taxation and on the other hand through meeting specific industry objectives. In bringing forward amendments to have the rate of licence fees for commercial radio, the Government reaffirms its objective of encouraging the development of a more diverse and competitive industry sector delivering audio services free to the public, but supported by commercial revenue. This industry will face considerable challenges over the next few years as more and different forms of services enter the media marketplace. But commercial radio will remain a major part of the mix of public mass media services and is assured of a significant future. The main features of the Bills are: (a) to amend the current licence fee scale for all commercial radio licensees, by simply halving the amount they currently pay as annual licence fees; (b) to provide for a common due date for the payment of annual licence fees for both commercial radio and television broadcasters; and (c) to require licensees to carry out their own assessment of the amount they are required to pay to the Commonwealth as licence fees. The Broadcasting Amendment Bill (No.2) also includes a minor amendment to the Broadcasting Act 1942 to enable public radio licensees in areas where there is no overlapping terrestrial commercial radio service to broadcast sponsorship announcements which promote products and services. I would now like to give some detailed attention to particular provisions of these amendments. Commercial Viability Experience has shown that much of the time taken in Broadcasting Tribunal inquiries into the introduction of regional commercial radio services stems from the current legislative requirements relating to the consideration of commercial viability. When making a decision to grant non-limited licences, the Tribunal must have regard to the need for the commercial viability of other services licensed to serve all or part of the same area. The Tribunal must also have regard to commercial viability in fulfilling some of its other statutory licensing obligations. The provisions concerned can involve· the Tribunal in wide ranging and exhaustive investigations on its own account or at the behest of parties opposed to the introduction of a new service. This Bill will reduce the Tribunal's current obligation to seek independent certainty in assessing commercial viability by inserting an interpretive rule which restricts the meaning of the term commercial viability for the purpose of the relevant provisions. The amendment provides that a service is commercially viable if, and only if, the Tribunal is satisfied that, on the balance of probabilities, the service will continue to be provided under the licence until its expiration. The Bill will also place limitations on the consideration of commercial viability in Tribunal inquiries. In the past too much emphasis has been placed on the commercial viability criterion at the expense of other equally important considerations such as the desirability of introducing more services which would give the public more listening choice. The Tribunal will now not consider the need for the commercial viability of the service of an overlapping non-limited licence unless the licensee satisfies the Tribunal that the service would not be commercially viable after the grant of the proposed licence. For the Tribunal to consider the need for commercial viability of overlapping services, the affected licensees will be required to establish that a real problem exists. It will no longer be a potential opening for filibustering and procedural delay. With these amendments, the Government confirms its view that, in the interests of encouraging diversity of media ownership, it is preferable that a competitive service be introduced where it is reasonably practicable to do so. The Act currently provides that, where an application for a supplementary licence has been lodged and the Minister has published a notice inviting applications for a commercial radio licence with an overlapping service area, the Tribunal can consider the applications simultaneously. There is no specific guidance in the Act to indicate a preference for an independent service over a supplementary service when the Tribunal is considering the two types of licences simultaneously. This Bill amends the relevant sections to give a clear preference for the commercial licence when the Tribunal is considering applications for a commercial radio licence in such circumstances and determines that the market can support only one additional licence. The application for the commercial radio licence would of course need to be found to satisfy the relevant criteria regarding suitability. In this same context it is intended that the Tribunal place more emphasis on the public interest consideration that it is desirable, where practicable, to increase the number of broadcasting services available to the general public. To achieve this an additional criterion has been included to require the Tribunal to have regard, when weighing the public interest in considering whether a commercial radio or supplementary radio licence should be granted, to the policy that the number of services available to the public should be increased. Supplementary Licences Section 82A of the Broadcasting Act enables applications to be made by holders of commercial AM radio licences for supplementary licences, and for such applications to be referred to the Tribunal for consideration. Once again, in the interests of encouraging additional services wherever possible, the Government believes there is merit in advancing supplementary licence applications where independent commercial radio services are not feasible. The Bill introduces streamlining measures for the grant of supplementary licences. In an inquiry where the only application being considered is for the grant of a supplementary radio licence, the Tribunal will not be required to determine whether a commercial radio licence serving the same area would be reasonably likely to be commercially viable during the period for which the supplementary radio licence would be in force. Similarly in such inquiries, the only overlapping services which the Tribunal should be required to consider in its deliberations on commercial viability are commercial radio services. The amendments will also provide the Tribunal with a discretion to grant supplementary licences that will serve an area less than that served by the related commercial radio licence in circumstances where a wider service would not be viable. Section 83F of the Broadcasting Act allows the Minister, at any time before the grant of a licence, to revoke the service specifications determined in relation to the licence and to determine new specifications. This section is amended to enable the Tribunal to recommend before the grant of a supplementary licence that the service area be smaller than, but wholly within the service area of, the related commercial licence and for the Minister to redetermine the service specifications accordingly. This amendment recognises that in some cases a supplementary licence may not be viable if it has to serve the whole service area of the related commercial licence, but it could be viable if it served only part of that area. In this way the chances of a second service being licensed are increased. The amendments to provide scope to separate a supplementary radio licence from the related commercial radio licence after a period of two years are consistent with the Government's preference for a diversity of media ownership and will also apply to existing supplementary licences. Section 89A(1O) requires the Tribunal to refuse to consent to the transfer of a commercial radio licence that is related to a supplementary radio licence unless the supplementary radio licence is transferred to the person at the same time. This is amended to enable the commercial radio licence and the supplementary licence to be transferred separately after a period of two years beginning on the day of commencement of the service under the supplementary licence. The supplementary licence would thereupon become a commercial licence in its own right for the balance of the original term of thesupplementary licence. It is intended that, for those existing supplementary licensees whose date of commencement precedes these amendments, the two-year period should also be calculated from their date of commencement of service. However, in those cases where the Tribunal has licensed a supplementary service which has a service area that is not substantially the same as the related commercial licence, this process of separation would not be available. Where such separation was sought, it would be necessary for the licensee to first seek to have the service area of the supplementary licence expanded to match that of the commercial licence. I will now address the provisions which deal with changes to the current licence fee assessment and collection arrangements. At the suggestion of the Tribunal, the Government has decided that the current licence fee collection scheme, for both radio and television licence fees, should be streamlined by introducing a self-assessment scheme, with all licence fees falling due on 31 December each year. As part of the introduction of the licence fee common due date, the Bill provides for the initial calculation of each licensee's licence fee to be canied out by the licensee. Under the present system this function is performed by the Tribunal. The Bill requires each licensee to calculate the amount owing to the Commonwealth as annual licence fees, and for penalties to apply if this amount is not lodged with the Tribunal on 31 December each year. The Bill empowers the Tribunal, upon receiving each licensee's financial information and self-assessed licence fee, to check each licensee's accounts and licence fee. The Tribunal will then issue any re-assessment notices of additional amounts payable to the Commonwealth in the event of a licensee undercalculating the licence fee owed, or refunds of overpayments owing. All Tribunal assessed additional payments are to be made by the licensee within a period of 21 days after the Tribunal's re-assessment notice. The Tribunal should also repay any amounts overpaid within this 21-day period. The Bill provides for a penalty of 20 per cent per annum of the amount of any unpaid licence fees, calculated from the date of issue of the Tribunal's re-assessment notice, to be due and payable after the 21-day period for the paylnent of additional assessments, and which accrues until licence fees are paid in full. The Bill also enables the Tribunal to determine whether a licensee has deliberately miscalculated the amount of licence fee payable, and for the penalty of 20 per cent per annum of unpaid licence fees to apply from 31 December and not 21 days from the date of issue of the notice. This provision has been included to deter licensees from deliberately miscalculating the amount of licence fee owed to the Commonwealth in order to gain an extension of time to pay. The Bill also provides for a penalty of 20 per cent per annum of unpaid licence fees, calculated from 31 December by the Tribunal, to be due and payable from 31 December, for those licensees who fail to pay their licence fees on that date. There are changes contained in this Bill which are related to amendments in both the Radio Licence Fees Amendment Bill 1991 and the Television Licency Fees Amendment Bill 1991 which require the payment of all commercial radio and television annual licence fees on 31 December each year. I will explain these amendments in detail when I deal with the Radio Licence Fees Amendment Bill 1991. For the moment, however, let me say that section 123 of the Broadcasting Act 1942 needs to be altered to keep in line with the amendments providirig for the new 31 December common due date, as contained in both the Radio Licence Fees Amendment Bill and the Television Licence Fees Amendment Bill. Section 123A of the Broadcasting Act dealing with penalties for unpaid licence fees has also been amended to line up with the new 31 December due date provisions. These amendments will simplify the administration and collection of commercial broadcasting licence fees for the Tribunal. I now tum to the minor amendment of section 119AB, relating to sponsorship announcements on public radio stations. The provisions relating to sponsorship announcements currently set out in section 119AB of the Broadcasting Act prohibit the broadcasting of any promotional material in a sponsorship announcement. The amendment allows public stations in areas with no terrestrial commercial radio services to broadcast promotional sponsorship announcements. The Tribunal will still have the power to impose standards on such announcements if it feels these are necessary. It may be queried why the Government is introducing this Bill when a draft Broadcasting Services Bill is to be soon tabled in the Parliament. In the case of the regional radio program, there is a need for transitional amendments to ensure progress toward the introduction of new services during the next 12 months, while at the same time keeping such amendments to a minimum and in line with the general thrust of the wider review of broadcasting. Financial Impact The changes to the statutory licensing criteria are not expected to have a significant impact on expenditure or revenue but should enable the Tribunal to make more efficient use of its resources. The broadcasting industry is a dynamic one undergoing rapid technical and economic changes. The amendments in this Bill are part of a resolute commitment on the patt of the Government that regulatory arrangements assist that process of change and do not retard it. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Smith) adjourned. NA BILL 1991 Bill presented by Mr Beazley, and read a first time. Second Reading",84
199,Mr BEAZLEY,RADIO LICENCE FEES AMENDMENT,"Swan-Minister for Transport and Communications) (5.10 p.m.)I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Radio Licence Fees Amendment Bill will implement reforms which will: (a) in relation to the annual licence fees arrangements for broadcasting services, implement measures announced in the Budget to have the current level of annual commercial, supplementary and remote radio licence fees and streamline the taxation arrangements for broadcasting licensees; and (b) in relation to the regional commercial radio program, abolish the current establishment and AM-FM conversion fees and replace them with an FM access fee to be paid by all commercial and supplementary non-metropolitan radio licensees before they commence a service on the FM band. I will now deal with the provisions of the Bill which have the rate of commercial radio licence fees. Major revisions to the rate at which commercial radio and television licence fees are levied have occurred since 1975-76. The licence fees scales were last amended in 1987, and the present formulae apply to licence fees collected in and after the 1987-88 financial year. These changes were made to reflect the broadcasting industry'S perceived capacity to pay, and were achieved through increasing the number of brackets at the upper end of the progressive fee scale, as well as increasing related percentage of gross earnings paid. However, bracket creep and inflation have meant that these changes have caused the increase in the level of commercial broadcasters' licence fees to exceed the increase in their gross earnings. This has resulted in increases in the level of commercial radio licence fees exceeding the increase in commercial radio gross earnings by an average of 8 per cent per annum over the lO-year period to the 1989-90 financial year. While licence fees paid by commercial television licensees have also increased over this time, the increase in these fees has been at a lower rate than for radio. While licence fees as a proportion of licensees' gross earnings have risen considerably for both radio and television licensees, the Government has decided to reduce the level of licence fees for commercial radio licensees only. It is time for us to start to think of radio and television as the two different and separate media that they are. Mr Smith-Hear, hear!",88
200,Mr BEAZLEY,RADIO LICENCE FEES AMENDMENT,"I am glad the Opposition has a bipartisan view on this; we can, therefore, expect expedition of the matter. This cut in the level of radio licence fees is the first step in the Government's move to separate the regulation of commercial radio from that of commercial television. In recent years the commercial radio industry has been coping with rapid technological change, while facing greatly increased competition. The regional commercial radio plan has seen 13 new radio services introduced into regional areas in Australia, and seven of the planned 10 new FM radio services under stage one of the national metropolitan radio plan have begun serving listeners in the capital cities. At the samf' time, licence fees for commercial radio licensees have been increasing. The Government believes the Australian public will be better served by commercial radio broadcasters if this extra drain on their cash flows is moderated. The Bill redresses the high level of licence fees for commercial radio licensees by reducing the current level of these fees by 50 the per cent. This reduction will be achieved by halving the constant and coefficient components of each of the formulae currently used to calculate the level of radio licence fees. This method of adjusting the licence fee regime will provide for the simple, direct and equitable treatment of all commercial radio licensees. The Radio Licence Fees Act 1964 is to be amended to reduce the fee, with these amendments taking effect from 1 January 1992. The reduction will be applicable to all annual commercial radio licence fees due on and from 1 January 1992, which includes licence fees for the 1990-91 financial year, thus providing radio licensees immediate licence fee relief. I will now address the new due date for the payment of all commercial broadcasting annual licence fees. Under the present system, licence fees for licensees whose anniversary date of service commencement is in the first half of \ the financial year fall due on 1 January; and licence fees for licensees whose anniversary date of service commencement occurs in the second half of the financial year fall due on that anniversary date. What this means is that licensees whose anniversary date falls between 1 January and 30 June have up to six months longer to pay their licence fees than other licensees. The Government considers that there are no reasons for the current staggered fee payment system to continue. This Bill, together with the Television Licence Fees Amendment Bill 1991, provides for a new licence fee due date, which will be the same for all commercial radio and television licensees, regardless of each licensee's anniversary date. The common due date will be 31 December in each year. This means that all commercial radio and television licensees will be required to pay their annual licence fees on 31 December each year, which is the same day they lodge their financial documents with the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. This new common due date will commence on 31 December 1992, encompassing licence fees for the 1991-92 financial year. The industry was infonned of this change in August 1991, and we believe that all licensees will have had enough time to plan for the common due date and to make the necessary arrangements for the payment of their 1991-92 licence fees on 31 December 1992. Financial Impact Halving the level of radio licence fees will reduce Commonwealth revenue from commercial radio licence fees by approximately $8m in the 1991-92 collection year, being for licence fees for 1990-91. It is estimated that for the following collection year the Commonwealth will forgo $8.5m. A proportion of these amounts will flow back to the Commonwealth in the fonn of increased company tax, to the extent that the licence fee reductions are reflected in increased profits. These estimates remain subject to any changes which may be made as part of the reviews being carried out by my Department, as I mentioned earlier. Changing the licence fee due date to 31 December is not expected to have an impact on the level of Commonwealth revenue collected. It means, however, that some Commonwealth revenue will be received up to six months earlier than under the present scheme. I now tum to the introduction of a new fee structure for the regional commercial radio program. The current fees structure has proved to have a number of failings: Its levels were set in 1988 and reflected speculative valuations on FM channels, rather than sustainable commercial values; it could not be applied to FM allocations other than new independent services and conversions where a new FM service entered the market; and its progressive scale relied on brackets which could produce inequities at the bracket margins and were naturally subject to inflationary bracket creep. In addition, the high level of fees discouraged applications for new licences and was a contributing factor to the difficulties a commercial radio licensee faces in establishing a new service in the current economic climate. In introducing a new FM access fee, the Government's aim is to provide a fee structure which is more effective in supporting the Government's objectives for regional commercial radio broadcasting. The title of the fee indicates that it is levied as a resource allocation fee for a valuable part of the electromagnetic spectrum, rather than an entry fee to a protected market. In fonn, it is intended to remove a degree of discriminatory burden on new independent services and provide for greater equity between different FM service providers, in that the new fee will also apply to supplementary services and AM-FM conversions. The calculation of the FM access fee takes into account the number of commercial radio services operating in a given service area and the relevant average gross earnings for these services. Responsibility for calculating and advising affected parties of fees payable will now rest with the Tribunal rather than with the Minister, as is currently the case. One key problem with the current establishment fee system is that the new licensee must outlay a substantial fee within a period of 60 days of the offer of the licence, but cannot commence service, and begin earning revenue, until the service has been physically established. This process may take up to six to 12 months from the date of the Tribunal's decision and often involves delays beyond the licensee's control. To redress this, the new FM access fee will be payable prior to commencement of the service, with commencement of service being conditional upon payment of the fee. The new fee structure will be effective on the commencement of this Amendment Act. With regard to Tribunal inquiries which are already in progress, transitional amendments have been included to ensure that where possible successful applicants will be able to take advantage of the new lower fees. Financial Impact These amendments are expected to have no significant impact on Commonwealth expenditure and revenue. Commonwealth revenue in the way of licence fees for individual new commercial services and AM-PM conversions will be reduced as a result of the introduction of the FM access fee to replace the current establishment fee and the AM - FM conversion fee. This reduction in revenue should be offset by new revenue obtained because the FM access fee applies to new non-metropolitan supplementary services and all non-metropolitan conversions. The current AM-PM conversion fee does not apply to all such conversions. The changes to the statutory licensing criteria are not expected to have a significant impact on expenditure or revenue, but should enable the Tribunal to make more efficient use of its resources. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Smith) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1991 Bill presented by Mr Beazley, and read a first time. Second Reading",89
201,Mr BEAZLEY,TELEVISION LICENCE FEES,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The amendments contained in the Television Licence Fees Amendment Bil11991 are concerned with the introduction of 31 December as the new due date for the payment of all commercial broadcasters' annual licence fees. These amendments are identical to those that I have just mentioned as part of the Radio Licence Fees Amendment Bill 1991 which deal with the 31 December common date for payment of annual broadcasting licence fees. Financial Impact Changing the licence fee due date to 31 December is not expected to have an impact on the level of Commonwealth revenue collected. It means, however, that some Commonwealth revenue will be received up to six months earlier than under the present scheme. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Smith) adjourned. VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No.2) 1991 Bill presented by Mr Humphreys, and read a first time. Second Reading",91
202,Mr HUMPHREYS,TELEVISION LICENCE FEES,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill proposes amendments to veterans' affairs and associated legislation to give effect to a number of measures included in the Government's 1991 Budget package which impact on veterans. These measures have been developed to improve the quality of life and health care for veterans and war widows and to generally improve the administration and delivery of these benefits. I must emphasise, however, that many of the 1991 Budget measures assisting veterans do not require legislation but are being implemented by other means. Some changes-such as the provision from 2 January 1992 of emergency short term home relief for veterans and war widows, the choice of in-home respite care and veteran support; networks, the expansion of the financial information service for pensioners, the extension, from 1 December 1991, of repatriation treatment benefits to Australian merchant mariners of World War I and World War II on the same basis that applies to Australian war veterans and the increase in the rate of mileage allowance for veterans who use their own vehicles from 12.28c to 18.5c per kilometre-are being implemented through administrative arrangements or delegated legislation. One other improvement to benefits announced in the Budget-the replacement of the telephone rental concession vouchers with the payment of a telephone allowance-will be included in legislation to be brought forward in the 1992 autumn sittings. This Bill also contains proposed changes to give effect to a number of non-Budget measures. These relate to changes in the arrangements for payment of advances for pharmaceutical allowances, indexation of pharmaceutical allowances and changes to the operational areas in schedule 2 to the Veterans' Entitlements Act to include the area of Iraq and Kuwait and to specify the periods during which certain areas are to be regarded as being operational. In particular, this Bill gives effect to the decision to extend the co-payment arrangements for pharmaceutical benefits under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme to the repatriation pharmaceutical benefits scheme from 1 January 1992. Some aspects of this decision do not require amendment of veterans' affairs legislation. The introduction of a patient contribution of $2.60 per prescription item requires an amendment to the repatriation pharmaceutical benefits scheme which is established in accordance with section 91 of the Veterans' Entitlements Act. I have already signed and arranged for the tabling of the instrument to effect this change to the scheme. That change will, of course, be dependent on the passage of this Bill. Legislative amendment is required, however, for the payment of a fortnightly pharmaceutical allowance to offset the patient contribution. The Bill provides for this. It also includes proposed amendments to the National Health Act to ensure that existing saf-ty net provisions will extend to repatriation pharmaceutical benefits scheme users. These changes are an extension of the patient contribution scheme introduced in 1990 in relation to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme to address some of the problems associated with over-prescribing and oversupply of medication and to encourage sensible drug use throughout the community. One other important change contained in the Bill is the provision for the maximum amount of earnings credit applicable to the ordinary income test, currently fixed at $1,000 per annum, to be indexed annually in line with movements in the consumer price index. Indexation of this amount will commence from 1 July 1992. The provisions of this Bill, together with those changes which are proceeding by other means, represent an important step forward in the provision of benefits to veterans and widows and in the administration of those benefits. The cost for indexation of the earnings credit account balance will be nil in 1992-3, $20,000 in 1993-94 and $20,000 in 1994-5. The extension of the co-payment arrangements to the repatriation pharmaceutical benefits scheme and the corresponding payment of the pharmaceutical allowance will cost $1.1m in 1991-92, with subsequent savings of $lO.5m in 1992-93, $l1.4m in 1993-94 and $12.2m in 1994-95. The extension of the system for payment of advance pharmaceutical allowance, including advance payments to persons eligible for repatriation phannaceutical benefits, will be $20,500 in 1991-92, $19,000 in 1992-93 and $8,500 in 1993-94. The changes to the indexation arrangements for pharmaceutical allowance, the concessional beneficiary charge and the general patient reduced charge are likely to result in net savings of more than $lm. The financial implications of the changes to the operational areas are negligible. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill.

203,Mr HUMPHREYS,REPATRIATION INSTITUTIONS,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Repatriation Institutions (Staff) Bill is the second of the two Bills in the legislative package which forms the basis of the transfer of the repatriation general hospitals to the States' health systems. The staff Bill has been drafted in accordance with assurances the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and I gave to safeguard the interests of staff who work in the hospitals and who will be affected by the integration of the hospitals into the State health systems. Keeping the hospitals running as viable institutions serving the community at large, as well as those veterans seeking to still use the hospitals, is the best way of guaranteeing jobs and the interests of staff. There are currently some 10,000 staff employed in repatriation general hospitals throughout Australia of which more than half are engaged in the medical, nursing and allied health professional fields. The remainder are employed in the administrative, computing, manual and technical fields. They are highly skilled and dedicated and have the capacity to assist the States to provide quality hospital services to those in need. To honour the promises given to these staff, the Commonwealth entered into extensive negotiations with the ACTU and veterans' affairs unions. These negotiations have resulted in an agreement which commits the Commonwealth to do its best to ensure that the maximum number of staff are offered a job with the States. The agreement also covers: income maintenance; recognition of Commonwealth leave entitlements; continuing membership in a Commonwealth superannuation scheme; and re-entry rights into Commonwealth employment. While the commitments to staff of the repatriation general hospitals are set out in the agreement between the Commonwealth and the unions, the staff Bill declares these commitments in the form of a legislative statement of Parliament's intentions. The Government expects that, as a result of the intentions stated in this Bill and the agreement negotiated with the unions, the overwhelming majority of repatriation general hospital staff will receive and accept job offers from the States. For those staff who accept a job offer or who are offered what is considered to be a 'comparable job' the Bill contains provisions to separate them from Commonwealth employment. This special legislation package is, then, a vital part of the commitment both I and the Prime Minister gave to staff that their interests would be safeguarded. The legislation has been developed in consultation with all the unions involved. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Ruddock) adjourned. VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS (PROVISION OF TREATMENT) AMENDMENT BILL 1991 Bill presented by Mr Humphreys, and read a first time. Second Reading",93
204,Mr HUMPHREYS,REPATRIATION INSTITUTIONS,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill and the Repatriation Institutions (Staff) Bill 1991 which accompanies it form the legislative package embodying the principles and guarantees to the ex-service community and Commonwealth employees in relation to the integration of the Repatriation General Hospitals into the States' health systems. I stress to this House that these Bills do not mean immediate and automatic transfer of the hospitals to the States. Negotiations with State governments on the terms for integrating the Repatriation General Hospitals are continuing. However, both the Bills establish the mechanisms by which the hospitals' staff may eventually be transferred to State employment and the conditions under which veterans and war widows will receive their treatment entitlements after integration. The aill represents the culmination of a very long process of investigation into the future of the Repatriation General Hospitals. Three of the earliest reports: the Senate Standing Committee on Health and Welfare, 1973; the Non-Parliamentary Inquiry into the Repatriation System, the Toose report, 1975; and the Bailey Task Force on Coordination of Welfare and Health Services, 1976 contained recommendations concerning eventual transfer of the Repatriation General Hospitals to the States. Following a 1984 Parliamentary Works Committee recommendation, the matter was eventually referred to the review of the Repatriation Hospital System Committee-the Brand Committee-which, in 1985 recommended that planning take place for the effective rationalisation and integration of the repatriation hospital system with the States' hospital systems. Faced with the increasing difficulty of access for an ageing veteran population to the repatriation hospitals in each State and the realisation that changes were needed in the Commonwealth-State structure of health care, the Federal Government accepted the Brand Committee's recommendations. In August 1988, I announced the proposal for integration of the Repatriation General Hospitals into the State health systems by 1995 or earlier. The Government was persuaded that this would lead to a greater range of hospital and specialist treatment closer to veterans' and war widows' homes and also enable the retention of the hospitals as viable institutions. Obviously, this was a decision of some sensitivity and one which has generated much emotional debate. To get to this point has required massive effort and consultation with a wide range of people-ex-servicemen and women, war widows, staff, State Government officials and medical professionals. The safeguarding of veterans' and war widows' rights has been a fundamental goal of the extensive negotiations which have taken place since 1988 with representatives of ex-service and kindred organisations. A major concern of ex-service organisations has been to ensure that transfer of the hospitals to the States' health systems would not diminish the level and quality of hospital and specialist treatment. They sought reassurance that the Government's guarantees on the standard and level of service would be maintained when the hospitals came under State control. This Bill responds to these concerns. I remind this House of the promise of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in April 1989 that 'no Repatriation General Hospital will be transferred to a State until a satisfactory agreement has been reached on matters such as priority of access and quality of health care for veterans and war widows'. The repatriation private patient principles attached to this Bill provide that assurance. I should emphasise that the term 'priority of access' does not embrace the proposition that veterans or war widows would get priority entry to a hospital over a patient with more urgent medical needs. This does not happen now and it never will. Such a situation would constitute a breach of medical ethics. However, the repatriation private patient principles ensure that veterans and war widows in need of hospitalisation get the necessary access through better use of the integrated repatriation hospitals, the public hospital system and private hospitals. The Bill has been prepared in close consultation with ex-service organisations. In accordance with their wishes, it has been drafted in such a way as to provide a solid legal framework which underpins the guarantees for continued access to hospital care and status as private patients following integration. The Veterans' Entitlements (Provision of Treatment) Amendment BiIl1991 proposes to amend section 84 of the Veterans' Entitlements Act to reinforce the guarantee that the Commonwealth Government will continue to be responsible for the health care of veterans after integration. Specifically, section 84 is to be amended to provide that the Commonwealth, not the States or Territories, is to take steps to ensure that treatment is provided for a person consistent with part V of the Act, which sets out the terms and conditions relating to the treatment rights of eligible veterans and war widows. In addition, the Bill, by the insertion of a new section 90A, provides for the establishment of the repatriation private patient principles which will set out guidelines and circumstances under which private patient treatment will be provided. Those guidelines will be subject to effective parliamentary scrutiny by being made a disallowable instrument thereby demonstrating the Government's determination to ensure the Parliament as a whole remains committed to the health care of entitled veterans and war widows. A copy of the draft repatriation private patient principles accompanies this Bill. Briefly, the principles will guarantee veterans, war widows and eligible dependants: a choice of doctors and specialists who agree to treat under Veterans' Affairs arrangements; direct access as private patients to shared accommodation in public hospitals; private hospital care where the public hospital system cannot meet the medical need within a reasonable time in a private hospital with which Veterans' Affairs has an agreement or other private hospitals where necessary; continued access to former Repatriation General Hospitals; the additional choice of a private hospital not contracted to Veterans' Affairs, provided they obtain financial authorisation. such cases accommodation and other charges will be met to a pre-detennined level with the veteran or war widow liable for the fees gap. As I mentioned, entitled veterans, war widows and eligible dependants will continue to have access to repatriation hospitals. In recognition of the special place of these hospitals in our society and to ensure that Australians never forget the sad circumstances under which they were established, a condition of transfer to any State will be that the word 'repatriation' is retained in the hospital's name. The negotiations on the repatriation private patient principles with the ex-service organisations, Legacy and the War Widows' Guild have resulted in the introduction of monitoring committees, including representatives of the ex-service organisations, to be established in each State and nationally to closely scrutinise these arrangements. I must emphasise that the purpose of the repatriation private patient principles is to out the conditions applying to the freedom of choice and repatriation private patient status under part V of the Veterans' Entitlements Act. They do not replace the detailed financial and administrative arrangements contained in the treatment principles. They add to the existing mechanisms and provide greater status for veterans' and war widows' treatment under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. The passage of this Bill will set in train one of the most significant changes to the administration of veterans' benefits in the history of repatriation in Australia. It is a change which has resulted from the need to ensure that, as the veteran population continues to age and the number of veterans and war widows declines, successive governments will be in a position to ensure that the promises made and the commitment to care and provide for veterans who served their country in time of war will continue to be honoured. This legislation gives to veterans and war widows the guarantees they require and deserve. The transfer of the Repatriation General Hospitals to the States will result in more efficient use of the hospital system nationally and the concurrent introduction of the repatIn riation private patient scheme will offer entitled veterans and war widows better hospital treatment options. It is not possible to quantify the financial implications arising from the introduction of the repatriation private patient scheme and the integration of the hospitals into the States' health systems. The reasons for this are that negotiations with the States are not complete; the number of veterans and war widows transferring from private health insurance or Medicare is unknown; some additional usage of private hospitals by veterans and war widows is anticipated, but it is not possible to quantify this at the present time; and details of changes to the Repatriation General Hospitals and consequential staff implications are not yet finalised, although the Commonwealth will have a continuing obligation towards transferred staff for a number of years. The formulation of this legislation could not have happened without the cooperation and support of representatives of the RSL, the set T &Pls, the Australian Veterans and Defence Services Council, the Repatriation Defence Forces Welfare Association, Legacy and the War Widows' Guild with whom consultations on the integration process have taken place over a long period and are still continuing. Accordingly, I call on all honourable members present to support the passage of the Bill through the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill and seek leave to table a draft of the repatriation private patient principles. Leave granted. Debate (on motion by Mr Tim Fischer) adjourned.

205,Mr SIMMONS,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,"Calare-Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories) (5.41 p.m.)I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to implement the Government's decision to pass to the Australian Capital Territory the power to control the Territory's electoral system. The Bill also gives effect to the related decisions to transfer to the Territory the power to determine by enactment the number of Ministers; and that the Territory no longer requires the Treasurer's approval to make certain guarantees. In June 1991 this Parliament passed the Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Amendment Act 1991, which effected certain refinements to the existing electoral system and provided for a referendum to be conducted in conjunction with the next election for the ACT Legislative Assembly. The purpose of the referendum is to determine the Territory electorate's preference between the two electoral systems, a single member electorate system based on the House of Representatives system, and a system of proportional representation modelled on the Tasmanian HareClark system. In my second reading speech on the Bill concerned, I stated: The Government believes that following the next ACT election the Assembly will be. at a stage where it is able to conduct its own electoral affairs. Accordingly I am pleased to announce the intention of this Government to hand over to the Territory the power to control the Territory electoral system after the next election, scheduled for February 1992. The current Bill gives effect to the Government's commitment by amending three pieces of legislation: the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988, the Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Act 1988 and the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. The Self-Government Act is of course the legislation which establishes the Territory as a body politic under the Crown, establishes the Legislative Assembly as the body exercising legislative power and, amongst other things, delineates the powers of the Assembly relative to the retained powers of the Commonwealth. In order to effect the hand over of the electoral power, the SelfGovernment Act is amended to provide that, following the next ACT general election, members of the Territory Assembly will be elected as provided by the Self-Government Act and by enactment of the Territory Assembly; but that until such enactment is passed members shall continue to be elected as provided by the Self-Government Act and the existing Commonwealth legislation, the Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Act 1988. The Electoral Act, which currently provides the Territory electoral system, will thus be repealed on the coming into force of effective Territory legislation. The Self-Government Act is further amended to provide that in future the Territory Assembly shall have the power to determine by enactment the number of Ministers and that, until such enactment comes into force, the number shall not exceed five. The existing provisions require that the number shall be three. In addition, the Territory will no longer be required to obtain the approval of the Treasurer before making guarantees for the discharge of certain obligations. These provisions again reflect the view that the Territory legislature should have greater responsibility for its own affairs. The Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Act is amended by the repeal of provisions relating to the qualifications of electors, such provisions having been incorporated into the Self-Government Act. At the same time the opportunity is taken to provide that certain parts of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, as applied by this Act, are subject to amendment by regulation; thus extending an existing provision. Finally, several consequential amendments are to be made to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, firstly, to repeal the provision whereby the Australian Electoral Commission is required to perform such functions as are conferred on it by any law of a Territory; secondly, to extend the Commission's powers to enable it to perform certain of its functions in conjunction with an Australian Capital Territory electoral authority; and, thirdly, to vary an existing provision to provide for joint action with an ACT electoral authority in respect of electoral rolls. I reiterate that it is the Government's view that the Australian Capital Territory legislature has reached the stage where it should be allowed to conduct its own electoral affairs following the next Territory election, scheduled for February 1992. This Bill provides for the hand over of powers to enable this to occur within the legislative framework of the Self-Government Act. I commend the Bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Ruddock) adjourned. NA NA AMENDMENT BILL 1991 Second Reading Debate resumed.",96
206,Mr HOLLIS,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"In continuing my remarks, I shall confine myself to the amendments to the Navigation Act 1912. I have spoken before about flag of convenience ships. The proliferation of flag of convenience ships in countries which do not apply proper standards shows disdain for seamen's lives. A more recent shipping trend has been second registries where the national flag is retained on a ship registered in some dominion, as in the case of France, which has 39 ships now on the books of Kerguelen Island. This is a French territory in Antarctica populated by penguins. This form of registry keeps the vessels in the national fleet and until recently would employ only officers and not ratings from the host country. However, the officers are now being replaced by unemployed officers from the Eastern bloc countries. In many ways this method of registration is no better than flag of convenience. In fact, the number of flag of convenience ships has remained constant. According to Lloyds register of shipping, the world fleet stands at about 423.6 million gross tonnage, with the flag of convenience share at about 34 per cent and accounting for 48 per cent of all casualties in 1990. I am sure it comes as no surprise to seamen that Panama, Liberia and Cyprus alone accounted for 39 per Clint of these casualties in 1990. But, most definitely, second registries are the new fad amongst the world's shipowners. Today neither the TVI nor the ITF has been able to retard the attacks on the seafaring community. Despite all the rhetoric, flag of convenience ships are still here and are accompanied now by second registries. As I have said before, the proliferation of flag of convenience ships in countries which do not apply proper standards shows a great disdain for seamen's lives. Maybe the owners and users of these ships do not care, but seafarers and their world organisations certainly do and we will continue the fight to expose and reject flag of convenience registries and substandard ships. As I speak, a Norwegian registered coal ship, the MY Bertina, is in Port Kembla harbour unfit to load. It has been correctly referred to as a rust bucket by the local Illawarra media. This vessel was built in Japan in 1973. Its port of registry is Grimstad, Norway, and the owners are K.S. Loren Investments, Norway. The crew of the ship is Filipino. This ship arrived at Port Kembla on 28 October 1991. It was surveyed by the port surveyor who, after inspecting the vessel, immediately ordered that the vessel not be loaded due to large cracks in the main decks and in between all the cargo hatches. As well, there were numerous other deficiencies and safety problems. In fact, many of the cracks were covered with tar paper. As is usually the case, I was telephoned at my home on Sunday night and asked to come down and inspect this ship. The Berlina is the fourth ship to be held at Port Kembla in the past 12 months because of the need for similar repairs. Over the last few months, many ships have gone down off the Australian coast. In fact, in 1990 alone over 200 seamen were drowned, killed or went missing from bulk carriers. 1Welve ships were lost, mainly through structural faults. In the first four months of 1991 a further six of these ships have gone missing, with additional loss of life. All of these ships were carrying iron ore and some of them sailed from Australian ports after loading ironstone in north-west Australia. The mining industry is most vocal about the need for the cheapest ships possible and says that the OECD standard is not valid for comparison with Australian shipping. The Mineral Diamond sailed from Western Australia with a crew of 27 and disappeared. All that was found was the discolouration of the sea where it was thought that the ship had gone down. There were no survivors. As well as the Mineral Diamond, the other bulk iron ore carriers that have foundered or sunk off the Western Australian coast since late last year are the Manilla Transporter, the Alexander P and the Malete. How much longer are these rust buckets going to be permitted to enter Australian ports? When people start talking about bans being put on ships, they are often criticised. When there is a ban on a ship in Port Kembla harbour I always make a point of going down there and personally inspecting the vessel. As I have said time and time again, most of them are just rust buckets. I would defy anyone, including members of this House, to go to sea in some of the ships that have been rightly banned in Port Kembla. They are really dreadful examples. I always invite Opposition members to come down to Port Kembla to inspect the ships with me, to talk to the workers and to actually see what is going on. When I was talking about these rust buckets to the Secretary of the Seamen's Union in Port Kembla on Sunday he informed me that they videotape every ship which has a ban on it. If members of the Opposition, or even members of the Government, cannot come down to Port Kembla, I will make those videos available to them so they can see the condition of these ships that the Seamen's Union has put bans on. No-one from the Opposition has accepted my invitation yet. There is a ship under a ban in Port Kembla and the invitation still stands. If they cannot come, I will bring the video of that ship to Canberra, show it to them and let them justify these ships going to sea. At this stage, it is not clear because of the lack of information just how many of the sunken vessels were lost due to unseaworthiness alone or as a result of inadequately trained crews or poor seamanship or, as I suspect, as a result of a combination of all these. Vessels in bad seas need well-qualified expert crews and attendants to handle them. There may be only one or two certified or qualified officers on board many of the flag of convenience vessels. There is often a language difficulty between the officers and the crew. The rest of the crew, who are being paid poverty wages, are effectively sea-going labourers. No tears are being shed by the trading nations of the world for those hundreds of Third World seamen who have disappeared without trace or who are known to have lost their lives at sea. It is clear that in recent years we have seen a re-emergence of the coffin ships of past centuries-that is why the amendments to the Navigation Act are so important-when ships were sent to sea in an unseaworthy condition or in a condition that was likely to result in their loss and the loss of their crews. The development of international maritime conventions and proper standards for the construction and maintenance of vessels, crewing, and training of crews arose out of these malpractices of centuries gone by. For years, seafarers of the world have been pointing to the deplorable condition of many of the vessels that operate as flag of convenience ships. For their efforts, they have generally been portrayed as people crying wolf, people who did not want to work, or people who were drawing undue attention to the safety aspects of ship operation. We are now seeing the result of the continued neglect of this major safety issue by the shipping nations of the world. The irony is that attention has now been drawn to this practice of using coffin ships not because of concern about the loss of lives at sea but because of concern about the marine and global environment. That environfor ment is a matter of major concern. However, I would have thought that priority would be given to the needless loss of lives of sailors at sea. We have a concern in this nation the risk posed to our coastal marine environand ment by oil spillages from poorly crewed vessels and from unseaworthy vessels in event of their being wrecked. Recently, near sinking of a Greek owned tanker off the Western Australian coast focused our attention on the risk to Australia's fishing conditions and to our coastal environment. As I have said, the marine environment is important all Australians, as are the lives of the farers who are forced to man these mst buckets. I support the Bill and the amendments, and commend the legislation to the House.",97
207,Mr HAWKER,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"I for would like to confine my remarks to part 2 the Transport and Communications Legispractice lation Amendment Bill 1991, which deals with the Australian National Railways ComAustralian mission. While the coalition parties will not be opposing this Bill, we do have some very strong reservations about the amendments to the Australian National Railways Commission Act 1983. While I am sure the sentiments are principal Act. in the right direction, the actual wording that has been put forward by the Government leaves some doubt as to whether the amendments will achieve the aims envisaged. Part 2 of this Bill amends the ANR Comthink mission Act, supposedly to ensure that the Commission has the power to enter into number of financial management risk or it. hedging transactions. That is the thrust of Bill. The Government claims that these amendments attempt to ensure that the Commission has the power to enter into these transactions, such as with interest rate swaps, fixed rate agreements, options and futures contracts. The coalition has some strong reservations about whether this will be achieved with the way the amendments are worded, as proposed by the Government. It is true that many government business enterprises, and of course private organisations, routinely make use of such transactions to minimise their exposure to adverse variations in future prices. It is nothing unusual Australian National to be involved in this type of transaction. However, the reason why the original Act is now seen to be deficient is evident in a recent judgment of the House of about Lords in what is known as the Hammersmith Fulham case. This case raised some doubts about the power of similar government the enterprises in the United Kingdom to enter the into this type of Act. Legal advice indicated that there is a possibility of this decision being followed by Australian courts. Therefore, Australian financial institutions were no longer happy to to enter into agreements with AN, in this parseaticular case, until AN had clear powers to allow it to get involved in this type of transaction. While the Government amendment is consistent with a more commercial outlook government business enterprises, and it of legalises what has clearly been established for many years, it is really only a half-hearted attempt at commercialisation for National. Furthermore, as I said, there is considerable doubt that it is going to achieve what it is supposed to do in allowing AN to continue in undertakings that, up until now, it has been able to engage in under its It is true that hedging can be viewed as a form of insurance policy whereby risk is minimised but, most importantly, it is still a speculative exercise since the hedger must that he or she will get a better deal by entering into that contract. It is an important a point to remember, and I will come back to Obviously for relatively small borrowings the it would be likely that Australian National would go to a broker and let the brokerwhich obviously has the expertise-do the hedging in what it believed to be the most commercial way. In that way the broker would bear any losses, and, of course, would get any of the benefits. But for larger capital raisings it is significantly cheaper for the organisation to go directly to the capital markets themselves. This is done by Telecom, by Australian Airlines and by other government business enterprises where the borrowings are significant. But the real concern about the proposed amendment is that it does not give Australian National clear powers to hedge and to manage its liability portfolio with financial market participants. Managing a position includes trying to minimise the cost of funds-this is the key point-and this is not necessarily synonymous with hedging that position. Having the power to manage a liability portfolio is obviously fundamental to all treasury operations, but this amendment does not necessarily make this available. In fact, there is strong reason to believe it would narrow Australian National's ability to act in a more commercial way. One might even go further and say that up until the recent House of Lords judgment Australian National was acting in a more commercial way than it would be able to with this amendment. I will give a couple of examples to illustrate what I mean. As I said, the amendment may give the power to hedge but it does not give the power to unhedge. In the last couple of years Australian National may have wished to swap from, say, fixed to floating interest rates or vice versa. With the Government's ability to push the interest rates through the roof and to bring them down in the rather tardy manner that has caused so much trouble, is it any wonder that there is considerable doubt in many people's minds as to which way they would operate? Nonetheless, there would be occasions when Australian National, or any other borrower locking into a fixed rate, would have been increasing its exposure to the cost of borrowing rather than reducing it. Clearly, for example, had AN locked into a fixed term rate of, say, 15 per cent, because that may have been cheaper than the current short term rate of the day, which might have been higher than 15 per cent, and - if AN had believed-correctly, as it would have proved - that to take the short term rate in the long term would have been better, because with the rates coming down it could have ridden the market down, then clearly it would have reduced the cost of its borrowings. But under the proposed amendments of the Government there is much doubt as to whether AN would be able to do that because, clearly, had it effectively hedged its borrowings by locking in, it would not have been able to unhedge, as is proposed by the Government amendment. The second example is that Australian National might want to borrow in a currency that is not quoted with direct reference to the Australian market. For example, if Australian National were to borrow in Japanese yenwhich is not unreasonable, considering it may wish to do business in Japan-it may at some later stage wish to swap from yen back to Australian dollars but, because the yen is not quoted with reference to the Australian dollar in the financial markets, it would have to swap yen for, say, American dollars and then go back through American dollars into Australian dollars. It appears that the proposed legislation, at least in theory, would not allow this to happen. Again, I think the proposed amendment has some deficiencies. I believe it is important that the Government look very carefully at these points because restricting AN in its commercial operations of its borrowings will not be in its best interests. As I have already pointed out, since AN had these powers until some doubt was cast on them by the judgment of the House of Lords, it does not make much sense for the Government now to restrict those powers, given that AN has established quite clearly that it is a responsible and capable operator. I think it is important that we realise why this amendment must be in a form that is acceptable not only to AN but also to those who are involved in the financial markets, and therefore to those who would be involved in lending to AN. If, following these amendments, the real position of AN is ambiguous, there is considerable concern that, while the Government's sentiments may be in the right direction, the legislation may not in fact carry out those sentiments. I go further. Financial market participants have strongly indicated that the proposed legislation does not address their concerns about Australian National's powers. Therefore, it could also be argued that the proposed amendments are contrary to the existing requirements under section 18(1) of the principal Act, the Australian National Railways Commission Act 1983, which requires the Commission to 'conduct its operations ... in a manner that accords with sound commercial practice'. Clearly, if these amendments deny AN that opportunity then they are contradicting part of the principal Act. Again, I think the Government should look very closely at the wording of its proposed amendments. If we look at the Bill overall, we can see that the Government has demonstrated that yet again it has very little knowledge of how to make its authorities-in this case, Australian National-more commercial. Whatever its sentiments may have been, the fact is that it has put forward amendments that are likely to deny Australian National the opportunity to be truly commercial in the operations of its borrowings. I think the Government ought to be very well aware that there are a number of legal opinions around that advise that the proposed amendments that have been put forward by the Government are not good enough and do not cover the concerns put forward by the financiers or achieve what they claim. The Government has been aware for many months of the concerns raised by the House of Lords judgment in relation to Australian National in particular. It would be of considerable concern if legislation which has been brought in was found to be deficient, because, if the Bill is passed by the Parliament, the Government will not have an opportunity to make a further amendment until well into next year. The Government ought to be aware that the coalition has very grave concerns about the amendments it proposes to section 2 of this Act as it affects the borrowing powers of Australian National. Were we to be the Government I think we would be moving to take steps to amend the principal Act to make sure that commercialisation of Australian National took place in a proper fashion. We would be moving to allow Australian National to have commercial powers with its borrowings more along the lines of, say, Telecom. Clearly, we would be amending section 3 by making a number of changes to give much clearer direction to the involvement of Australian National and its borrowing powers. We would also amend section 6(1) to bring it into line with Telecom, and there would be a number of consequential amendments that would follow from that. The Government has been given due warning of the concerns that we have that there are some deficiencies in its proposal. I urge the Minister to look very closely at those concerns before he goes any further. While we are talking about Australian National, I thought I might raise another matter that is related to its operations that is causing considerable heartache in part of its railways, namely, in Tasrail. What is causing considerable heartache is not only the fact that Australian National is proposing to reduce the number of people employed in Tasrail but, more importantly, the appalling way that the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) has handled this matter. It is truly appalling that he goes to Tasmania, wants to make a hero of himself, goes touring around the countryside, as he loves to do, saying what a good guy he is, and then goes to the employees of Tasrail and says, 'Don't worry, boys. There are 350 jobs that are going to go here, as has been pointed out by the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics, but they will go by the end of the decade. We don't have to worry. Nothing much is about to happen. You can rest easy. Obviously, voluntary redundancies are going to handle just about everything with this'. I say 'appalling' because the very next day after the Minister told those workers in Launceston that they did not have to worry, they were given the news by Australian National that 160 workers were about to lose their jobSt-compulsorily. It is utterly appalling that the Minister could have the gall to go and tell these people that they could rest easy-give them just one night to rest easywhen the next day they find out that something totally different was in the pipeline. The question really does arise: does the Minister mow what is going on in Australian National? He is supposedly responsible. If he does, why did he not tell those workers? Why did he not have the decency to tell them? Having flown out of Tasmania straight away, he then allowed Australian National to take a totally different approach from what he had been telling these workers. He has now left them in a quandary. There are still negotiations going forward. The unions have made it quite clear that they are not prepared to accept the redundancy packages that have been offered. They have even asked the Minister to have the decency to come back and tell them what is going on. As far as I mow, he still has not agreed to do that. Overall, it is an unbelievable state of affairs that a Federal Minister could treat people so appallingly. I might add that that is the view not only of the coalition parties; it is the view of the ACTU as well. In fact, so seriously did the ACTU view the appalling approach of the Minister that the President of the ACTU, Ferguson, took the trouble to write a very provisions terse letter to the Minister pointing out it all meant and giving him a very severe backhander for what was going on, clearly showing that he had very - little confidence the way the Minister was handling his members portfolio as it related to this part of the operations of Australian National. I think should be on the record that the way the Minister treated these people in Tasmania was truly appalling. Having spoken with personally, I am sure that their treatment is something that they are not likely to forget in a long, long time.",99
208,Mr SHARP,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"I rise to support my shadow ministerial colleagues the honourable member for Wannon (Mr which Hawker), who has just concluded his speech, and the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), who earlier represented the Opposition on this legislation under debate tonight. Being the shadow Minister for shipping and Barrier waterfront reform, I must say that my interest lies within the maritime area. This legislation affects the maritime area in a number of very interesting and different ways. The legislation is designed to overcome drafting errors that have been made in the initial introduction of some recent legislation. With hindsight, it also amends some unintended consequences that have occurred. It does things such as stiffen the licensing requirements for pilots-not airline pilots, of course, but ocean or sea pilots-those people responsible for steering a very safe passage through difficult waters, particularly bringing ships into harbours and ports. It also increases the penalties for people who breach the various requirements within the law. An interesting thing that it does is actually change the terminology of Greenwich Mean Time, which has been a long standing measurement of time, a universal standard for measuring time throughout the world. It is now to be called a coordinated universal time. Perhaps there is an interesting story behind the reasons for changing that, Greenwich Mean Time having been around for a long, long time. In the time available tonight, I would like Mr to discuss the amendments in the maritime of this Bill. I will go to the first of what them, which relates to the exemption of various vessels that would normally be required to carry a pilot whilst travelling in through the Great Barrier Reef. Honourable will recall that earlier this year we introduced some very good legislation, which it was supported by both sides of the House and which was designed to ensure that the environment of the Great Barrier Reef would be them protected to a much greater degree. We decided to have compulsory pilotage on board all vessels, I think in excess of 70 metres in length, that were travelling through the Great Barrier Reef. This was designed to ensure that we did not have accidents in inexperienced or unfamiliar navigators plying the waters through the Great Barrier Reef ran ships up onto the reef or crashed into something, sank their vessel and, in the process, spilt into the waters of the Great Reef some very harmful cargoes that would do great damage to the reef and also to the tourism trade that breeds from the reef. That compulsory pilotage was supported. However, there have been some concerns, which are borne out as a result of the implementation of the legislation. In fact, the Opposition drew those concerns to the attention of the Government at the time and highlighted the fact that we believed that there had not been adequate consultation with industry in the process of initially bringing this particular matter forward. The unintended consequences that have occurred, for example, did so with support vessels for fishing fleets. As we all know, fishermen were exempted from having compulsory pilotage on board their vessels whilst travelling through the Great Barrier Reef or fishing in Great Barrier Reef waters. However, we neglected to include fishing support vessels. These are vessels which provide fuel, food and other supplies to fishing vessels. They transport crew members backwards and forwards, and they act as storage vessels and transport fish that have been taken from the sea by those fishing vessels. These support vessels will now be exempted as a result of this amendment that we carry through the Parliament tonight, and that is a good thing. The Bill also exempts vessels that are under construction and will be carried through the Great Barrier Reef. I think that makes a lot of common sense. As a result of these amendments, we have seen common sense applying, ensuring that fishing support vessels are not required to have compulsory pilotage. This is obvious, because many of these vessels would have crew on board who would be more familiar with the area in which they are operating than even the pilots who are employed to provide safe passage. These vessels do not move around a lot. They operate within a pretty rigid area of operations and, of course, their crews and their masters are very familiar with the area in which they are operating. In addition to that, the legislation makes amendments in relation to the qualifications of masters, officers, seamen and pilots. These amendments are designed to ensure that we have proper regulations applying to the licences, particularly of pilots, who, of course, as we have just drawn to the attention of the House, are very important in the protection of the Great Barrier Reef. This will ensure that adequate provisions apply to the licensing of pilots. However, it does present the opportunity for us to mention briefly that a lot of us have a concern about the provision of pilotage services, particularly in the Torres Strait area and the Great Barrier Reef area. At the present time, these services are provided by a monopoly provider. There is no competition for pilotage services in this area, as is the case in many other ports and maritime areas around Australia. Others would argue, as I would, that the provision of some competition would ensure that the best possible services at the cheapest possible price are provided to the maritime industry to ensure that its costs are kept to the minimum possible. It is important for us to have some increased competition amongst our pilotage services to ensure that we can provide the minimum costs involved in the provision of pilots. As a consequence of this legislation, we also see increased support for that legislation which I mentioned a few moments ago about compulsory pilotage in the Great Barrier Reef. Since this came into the Parliament, many people have asked me why on earth we even allow ships to travel through the Great Barrier Reef. Surely, if we are concerned about the environment of the Great Barrier Reef and its safety, then we should insist that ships travel outside the Great Barrier Reef and go nowhere near it. Indeed, at first glance this might be a sensible option, except for the reality that, if we force ships to commute east of the Great Barrier Reef, we will be forcing them into waters which are more dangerous than those within the reef itself. Of course, the CUlTents and tides that prevail in that particular area will ensure that, if a ship does go down in an area to the east of the Great Barrier Reef, outside the reef itself, they will actually bring those dangerous cargoes, which can do so much environmental harm, back into the Great Barrier Reef. So we achieve nothing as a result of forcing ships to travel outside the Great Barrier Reef area itself. Another amendment deals with the alterations of ships and the cancellations of certificates. Obviously, this is another amendment designed to ensure that we have properly licensed vessels. If there is any damage or alteration to a hull or to the design of a ship that may affect its seaworthiness, the master and the owner of that ship must report those changes to the relevant authorities to ensure that the seaworthiness of that vessel is up to scratch. This, of course, also introduces a fine for non-compliance in that particular area. It also deals with offences in respect of subdivision load line marks on sides of vessels: we have all see them-they are like a flood level sign on the sides of the vessels. They must be properly maintained at all times. This legislation also provides penalties if they are not maintained. The legislation also makes amendments to the Trade Practices Act which deal with the shipping conference services. There is a lot of controversy about whether shipping conference services should be exempt from the Trade Practices Act. Of course, the amendments enable the shipping companies that become part of the shipping conference services to have exemption from the anticompetitive aspects of the Trade Practices Act. Of course, a lot of people say that we should not allow this to occur and that, if we are interested in competition in Australia, as I am sure all of us are, then surely we should not allow exemptions from the Trade Practices Commission and enable a number of shipping companies to pool together to provide what is seen to be an anti-competitive agreement or arrangement. However, that might be so if there were not other competitors who operated outside the shipping conference services. At the present time, as I understand it, shipping conference services have less than half of the market of shipping services into and out of Australia. They have a falling share of the market. There is the not so new Chinese line now operating into Australia and out of Australia, providing very competitive prices and grabbing much larger shares of that shipping market, which, of course, is putting the chill wind of competition into the shipping conference services. However, the shipping conferences services have a reasonably useful purpose. They provide a scheduled service between Australia and other parts of the world. This is important to a lot of Australian businesses because reliability of supply and having access to scheduled services is something that they are prepared to pay a premium for. This changes the legal opinion provided to the Government that members of the shipping conference service must register the freight rates for their services with the Trade Practices Commission. This is an interpretation that has been given to the Govenunent. Of course, it was not the intention of the Government to require the freight rates for shipping services to be registered with the Trade Practices Commission. There are, obviously, some very common sense reasons for that. Every time a shipping freight ratean agreement between a ship owner and a shipper-is altered, it has to be registered. This would create a tremendous administrative burden on the backs of the shipping companies and, indeed, the shippers themselves. Indeed, these shipping freight rates are publicly available anyway. So it is the view of the Government, which view is shared by the Opposition, that there should be an exemption of shipping freight rate charges from the requirement to be registered with the Trade Practices Commission. The Opposition has no difficulty with that. The exemption of those particular requirements will clear that area up and ensure that there is no added administrative burden and inconvenience to ship owners and shippers. The legislation also amends the title of something under the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Act 1990. It omits the Protection of the Sea Levy Act 1983 and substitutes the Protection of the Sea (Shipping Levy) Act 1981. That is obviously simply an error by those people who drafted the legislation in the first place. As I mentioned earlier, Greenwich mean time will now be changed to coordinated universal time. It begs the question as to why this is required. I know that the French have not complied with Greenwich mean time. Because Greenwich mean time is established in Britain and the French will have nothing to do with the British, they have established their own time and there have been two separate universal standards for the measurement of time. I hope that this will ensure that we go to a single standard for the measurement of time. The legislation goes on further to increase various fines and penalties that will be applied to those people who do not comply with the various requirements of the various Acts that are affected by these amendments. As far as the aspects that relate to my shadow ministerial portfolio are concerned, this legislation is something that the Opposition can support. It is something that highlights the need to have proper consultations with industry to ensure that we do not have to keep coming back on a fairly regular basis to amend legislation to inconvenience the Parliament and take up its time. With those comments, I indicate the Opposition's support for these aspects of the legislation. We see them as something that will add to the operation of the maritime industries in Australia.",102
209,Unknown,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,Sitting suspended from 6.28 to 8 p.m.,105
210,Mr SNOW,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,Eden-Monaro) (8.00 p.m.)The House is debating the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill. I am pleased to be able to speak on the subject of land transport. I remind the House and listeners of what this nation was landed with in 1983: road conditions were in a shocking state; in the electorates of Calare and Eden-MonaroMr O'Neil-And Grey.,105
211,Mr SNOW,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"And Grey, roads were an extremely bad social problem and people were unable to reach schools and hospitals; repair costs for vehicles were extremely high; and fuel consumption was high simply because road conditions were very bad. Huge losses were being experienced in the rail system. I know that on the east-west link the losses were not nearly as great; in fact, the east-west link in the rail systems of Australia has provided much needed profit. But on the north-south link, rail was getting nothing like the share of land transport it should have been getting. There was a huge increase in road contributions by the Federal Government in its first two years in office, firstly, through the bicentennial road development program introduced by the Fraser Government and maintained by the Hawke Government; secondly, the long drought that had been experienced meant that roads had not really had the damage and trauma that they otherwise might have had, so not a lot had been spent; and, finally, but very , importantly, there was an extremely healthy attitude to the need for road spending by the Federal Government. Today we see a misleading use of statistics, particularly by some State governments, by motorists associations and by Opposition members on how road funding has dropped since 1984. It is interesting that they used the year 1984, when road funding was dramatically increased. If we compare the first seven years of the Hawke Government with the first seven years of the Fraser Government, we find that road spending was much greater when the Hawke Government was in office. Some challenges on road transport issues came forward. The very fast train and the proposal to integrate it with other transport systems did not get off the ground because a number of tax concessions were sought and were not granted. The Business Council of Australia pointed out that, if the Federal Government was interested in micro-economic reform, it ought to look at the area where two-thirds of those micro-economic reforms could come from-land transport. The Business Council of Australia estimated that $6 billion could be available through microeconomic reform in land transport. It is interesting that in this House the emphasis on micro-economic reform has been away from that important area. We have talked about broadcasting, telecommunications and the waterfront, but most of the money can be made from land transport. It may well be that $6 billion cannot be found by government; in fact, governments feel that they can find possibly $3 billion or $4 billiott through government reforms. Of course, if we took the further advice of the Business Council of Australia and reduced the levels of government to two, then the savings would be even greater, but I guess that will be a long time coming. It may be that the Business Council expects a couple of billion dollars worth of reforms to come from within the industry itself, I do not know. It is important that we have some changes; it is important that we gain all the micro-economic reforms we can through land transport. We can do that in a number of ways. At the moment the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) and his colleagues in State and Territory governments are looking at uniformity of laws in each State and Territory. It is ridiculous to have people turning right illegally in front of someone turning left in one State but legally in another, and it is ridiculous that there is an enormous difference in the charging systems in the States and Territories. It is good that the State and Federal Ministers are all about getting uniformity in the laws and charging systems. I i; also important that we gain efficiencies through road construction and maintenance standards. As convenor of the Government's working group on land transportMr O'Neil-And a very good one at that.",105
212,Mr SNOW,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"I thank the honourable member for Grey. As convenor of that working group, I have visited and talked with people in both rail and road transport industries on numerous occasions. It is evident that there is quite a degree of truth in what they are saying to us; that is, that we ought to be looking at construction and maintenance before we start charging people. If we are really sincere about micro-economic reform, then we would be sincere about getting construction standards consistent. It has to be admitted that in New South Wales the standards are nothing compared to the standards in Victoria and some of the other States. It is about time that the New South Wales authorities looked at their standards. Ministers ought to have a uniform approach towards road construction standards and maintenance standards. It is a pity that they have not done that in their agreement. We also need to look at links. The linking of rail with road is extremely important, and both with shipping. Just the other day a question was directed to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) and he made it clear in his reply that we have achieved enormous beneficial reforms on the waterfront, so there has been a huge turnaround in benefits to consumers. We are loading containers even better than some of the European ports. Only a year or two ago we were well behind them. There have been major improvements on the waterfront. The waterfront needs to be properly linked with road and rail. We need to get away from the selfish attitudes and the paranoia within the land transport industries, where the rail industry is suspecting that the Government is all about supporting the road industry and the road industry is suspecting that the Government is all about supporting the rail industry. We are trying to make sure that rail transports the goods that it is best equipped to transport and road transport carries the goods that it is best equipped to transport. We should get away from the problems being experienced, where truckloads of cars are being lost and roads are carrying heavy items which would be better carried by rail if it was economic. People are saying that it will not be economic, but we are giving it a chance through the National Rail Corporation. We are saying to rail, 'Here is your chance to show that you can profitably carry the right types of goods on rail. We are giving you the chance to do that. Take the chance and make a profit because we are not going to support you for much longer if you do not'. The Federal Government is saying to the State governments, 'If we come into this National Rail Corporation and support it financially, then we want a just share of the results and a just share of the equity in it, along with voting power'. We are also saying to it, 'We do not want antiquated systems and antiquated work practices' . So the National Rail Corporation has to be able to take a positive attitude in microeconomic reform. Similarly, we need to do that with road transport. We need one system. We are looking at a range of options. I believe that the National Road Transport Commission that will be formed will be looking seriously at how we ought to be charging. A proposition that may be considered is that we have two sectors in the way that we tax vehicles on the road. We could take the present tax of approximately 25c and say that lOc of that ought to be Federal tax and 15c ought to be isolated and made road tax, indexed according to the cost of providing roads. Here is where the road transport dustry has a valid point. If it is said that costs 15c a litre to maintain roads, we are saying that there is inefficient and inapresponse propriate spending and that we ought to get that right first. The proposition is that there a tax that is indexed and that there be a road tax to cover road charges-a road charge tax of 15c which will reflect mass distance usage by the transport industry. We would have a range of charges on vehicles of, say, and more, and possibly an additional charge based on distance and mass. There are a lot of reports coming from the industry saying that that cannot be done properly, that the present measuring systems in metres are inappropriate, that there can be fraud and that adjustments can be made. But now there is a computer system available. Mr Vin Heffernan of Eden showed me how the system is working well in his enterprise and giving the truth about a range of important issues, including distance travelled and weight carried. So I believe there will be a way of measuring mass distance charges so that that additional charge on the heavier vehicles can be made, and made fairly. We certainly need uniform regulations. need to raise standards. Another way in which standards, particularly.in road services, increased is through the B-doubles. Just yesbecause terday, the Department of Transport and ComIf munications released a paper entitled Doubles: a better transport vehicle for Austbourne, ralia. This shows quite clearly that the introcould duction of B-doubles road freight vehicles will be a tangible sign of progress in the transport industry. It points out that in the years that B-doubles have operated in AustraSydneY-!\1elbourne lia they have demonstrated productivity provements of up to 40 per cent and a road safety performance better than conventional freight vehicles. They generate less noise and air contamination; they are fuel efficient and, consequently, they reduce the cost of transporting goods by roads. We are trying to get the States to come together so that the operation of B-doubles will occur in all States and Territories, but only along designated routes; this is particularly important. So the Federal Government is inworking towards the operation of B-doubles it under harmonised regulatory arrangements throughout Australia. That is a coordinated and it is important to the national transport task that we get that response from be each State and Territory. I applaud the moves that are being made because it is quite clear that in a lot of areas of transport B-doubles will be an efficient and cost effective way of transporting. In other areas road trains are a six axles suitable method of transport. We also need to look at rail and to link it with road and shipping. We need to make sure that we look at some of the very big problems in rail. As I have said before, the east-west link is quite effective; it carries about 60 per cent of the freight transport. But there are problems even there, for instance between Broken Hill and Sydney where it is impossible to take two tiers of containers because of the tunnels and other unsuitable access routes. So it is extremely important that we look at the east-west route and that we make sure that we upgrade the link, particularly between Broken Hill and Sydney. We need also to look at the link between Adelaide and Melbourne, where we do not have We the standard gauge; we have a wide gauge which is slowing down the traffic by two or can be perhaps even three hours on occasions of the changeovers that are necessary. we could cut two or three hours off that Btransport link between Adelaide and Melwe would do a lot for transport. It mean that we do not have to put extra lanes on the western highway between road Adelaide and Melbourne. We could well six remove the need for extra lanes along the link. All we need to do is imto make sure that we get an upgraded track between Sydney and Melbourne so that rail can do what it does best - carry some of the heavy loads. We have had a report just recently from the ACTU, which was prepared by Jacana Consulting, about the possibilities available through refonn of rail transport. It has indicated that, through the proposal that it has recommended, we could have a fast freight service and a fast passenger service between Sydney and Melbourne which would give us a fiveto seven-hour trip within seven years of the project starting. I believe we ought to be aiming at a faster trip for passenger rail. It is being done in other areas. I know that there are sentimentalists who say that we do not want fast trains but, rather, more trains and stations and services at all stations. But what they do not recognise is that that is all very well for people who like travelling on trains as a hobby or because they enjoy it; but there are just not enough of those people. Those who want to argue about negative growth can do so, but they should not forget the people who are paying mortgages and who depend on better, faster and more efficient transport. That covers most of usmost people on wages and most people in business. If we are going to argue about negative growth, let us argue it in a proper sphere, which is quite different from the single sphere of land transport. The demand will be for faster transport of freight and passengers. We need to take seriously the Jacana report. We need to examine very carefully, not just dismiss, why the very fast train service tax proposals were rejected by the Government. We need to ask why they were rejected and how we can get it right next time. I believe it was a mistake to have moved from what would have been a very popular route, the coastal route; but I can understand that there would have been big problems with the train entering Melbourne, in particular. There were big problems with a sudden change in attitude by the New South Wales Government, which seemed to move towards tilt-type trains. The very fast train people still have a lot that they can tell us and we ought to be listening to them. I believe there are plenty of challenges for government which ought to be taken in a bipartisan fashion and in a fashion in which we remove the paranoid attitudes within both the road transport and rail transport industries and get them together. I will propose to the Government that we get the different sectors of those industries together because not only is rail arguing against road but also there is suspicion between the different State and Federal systems-suspicion between the State systems and Australian National, for instance - and suspicion within the road networks at the road transport industries as well. The short hauliers claim that the charging systems that are being looked at favour the long hauliers and the long hauliers claim that they favour the short hauliers. I believe that the proposal that I, as convenor of the land transport working group, will be putting to government for a proper get-together of all those involved in the transport industries-it does not have to be very many people but it has to be the key people-will resolve some of those conflicts and some of the problems and the accusations of efficiency and inefficiency. We need to get those people together so that we can get land transport right, with all the micro-economic refonns that we can get through the land transport system. I strongly support the Business Council of Australia when it says that most of the micro-economic reforms that are possible within this country will come from land transport. I am pleased to support the legislation.",106
213,Mr BRADFORD,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"-I support the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill, particularly its provisions to amend the Civil Aviation Act 1988 and the Federal Airports Corporation Act 1986. As has already been stated by the shadow Minister and honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), the Opposition has no problem with this legislation in so far as it affects both these Acts. In fact, we are supportive of the amendments to the Civil Aviation Act which identify a number of new offences including some which carry penalties of up to two years imprisonment. There are some very serious offences, such as flying unregistered aircraft or aircraft for which no certificate of airworthiness or maintenance release is in force, performing any duty essential to the flying of an aircraft during flight when the person does not have the appropriate licence to carry out those procedures, and issuing a licence unless a person is authorised to do so. There are a number of other provisions. Those are serious offences, and we support the Bill in so far as it addresses those issues. We also support the changes to the Federal Airports Corporation Act 1986. In the broad context of this debate I want to address my remarks to both the Civil Aviation Authority and the Federal Airports Corporation. Both of the relevant pieces of legislation, in the broader context, are very important. Aviation is a very important matter which comes up for consideration from time to time in this place. The airline industry is going through some major changes, many of which have been warranted and welcomed. Deregulation has brought tremendous benefits to the travelling public; hopefully these benefits will continue and in the long term be cemented as more airlines enter the industry. Recently the entry of another major airline, AAA, has been foreshadowed. It proposes to operate on the major inter-capital city routes-using largely, I am pleased to say, pilots who were unemployed after the airlines dispute a couple of years ago. So almost everyone involved has accrued tremendous benefits from deregulation, although some of the changes that are occurring on the aviation scene have been controversial and painful.  important organisations. To a large extent they have been corporatised or modernised, whatever one likes to call it, and they have largely been commercialised. The Opposition has no problem· with those processes. I am sure the shadow Minister indicated that we would go further, particularly in respect of FAC, which we have fairly extensive plans to privatise, wherever possible, substantially or in part. We also see the potential for the privatisation of some aspects of the Civil Aviation Authority that lend itself to that, as we see happening in other countries. The important thing to note about both of these organisations is that they are also monopolies and they remain bureaucracies. We ask ourselves, as we watch and critically examine the operations of both the CAA and the FAC, whether as public monopolies they are operating potentially more to the detriment of the people they serve than private ones. We question-as do the people involved in the aviation industry-whether these organisations are efficient. Undoubtedly they are heading down that track. Enormous pressures have been brought to bear on both the FAC and the Civil Aviation Authority to become more efficient. But general aviation, which is an area that I am particularly interested in and one about which I have a number of concerns, is at the moment really hurting-not only in Australia, but probably in almost every country in the world. In recent years we have seen flying schools and small charter operations closing down all over Australia. Some of that is a product of problems in the industry itself-not only in Australia, but particularly in the United Statesand the dire situation for these small businesses, which most of them are, has been considerably exacerbated by the recession. I believe the rate of bankruptcies in that sector is greater than in any other sector of the economy. Interestingly, at the time that this scenario exists the Federal Airports Corporation is expected this year to make a big profit, somewhere in the order of $80m. There is not too much wrong, inherently, with making a profit, but there is the criticism that perhaps that is too big a profit in an organisation which operates on the basis that it does. It is required to achieve a return on the assets which were sold to it by the Government, having been previously paid for by the travelling public and the aviation industry. This ongoing criticism of the way that the FAC has the been established comes from the industry, which sees the FAC, in that sense, double dipping. In many respects it seems to be an unfair requirement for the FAC to perform in a corporate sense to achieve a return on investment assets which, in effect, have been paid for twice. The CAA has increased its charges in recent times at many times the inflation rate. The reason, which is perfectly clear to everyone in the industry, is that it has embarked on a major exercise commonly referred to as user pays. Nobody in the industry has too much of a problem with that concept in general terms, but many people in this industry are concerned that they are still paying for a very inefficient bureaucracy. There was a recent situation in which a flying operations inspector, level 2, was costed out at $266 per hour for the purpose of doing examinations, so this one bureaucrat's operation amounted to $500,000 a year. When that was questioned the rate was reduced, on 10 August, from $266 per hour to $89 per hour. Something was obviously seriously amiss in that situation. The Civil Aviation Authority exists to service the aviation industry. It ought to realise that-and I think it does. I am certain that Dick Smith realises it, and he is heading it up. The CAA needs to be responsive to people in the industry which, after all, made up of its customers. A viable aviation industry is absolutely vital in Australia; aviation, in a country the size of Australia, an essential service. It needs to be seen in context, and the whole of the Civil Aviation Authority's approach to cost recovery, or user pays, however one likes to describe it, needs to be understood clearly in the context of what aviation is and the purpose that it serves in this country as an essential service. Total cost recovery, which is the process that has been largely embarked upon, means that all of the services of the CAA must be rewhere covered. I am sure the shadow Minister agrees the Opposition has no problem with that approach, but we do make the point that in the industry there is a significant lack confidence in the efficiency of the CAA. many people's minds there remains the quesreally tion of whether they are being asked to pay for inefficiency. I referred to the high ruptcy rates that exist in general aviation the moment, and I put that in the context maybe a lot of these bankruptcies are unnecthe essary and are being forced upon people unnecessarily. There has been a significant reduction in waste, and I do not hesitate to compliment the Government and the CAA for that. The Opposition applauds that obvious reduction in waste and accepts that rationalisation is absolutely essential in this area. The airspace management and air traffic services program, or AMATS, has generally been welcomed by everyone in the industry. It will result in further staff reductions in the CAA and pilots will have to do more for themselves. Most of the pilots have accepted that, and the general aviation industry understands that. AMATS will bring us into line with general international practices in aviation, which I think is important for a number of reasons. The CAA has been criticised, I think with some justification, for being very heavy handed on occasions. I think that is a bit of an overhang from the old days-particularly the DCA days-when it tended to act very the much like a policeman and there was often is not a very good relationship between the operators in the industry and pilots and the DCA or, as it became, the CAA. I could refer is to the recent controversy over the publication that of the names of air crew who have appeared before the courts or tribunals, whether they are guilty or not. This practice continues. I do not believe that the publication of names in that situation-whether the parties are guilty or not guilty-is fair. In fact, it imposes on the people involved because the industry is a very closed one and these people rely on the confidence of their peers. It is an industry there are a lot of such relationships, and the publication of people's names imposes a further severe penalty on people who that are involved, sometimes in fairly minor matters. The Civil Aviation Authority ought to of understand-the point has been made to it In often enough-that the publication of names is damaging its attempts to build better relationships with its customers. That is what bankwe are talking about here; we are talking at about making the CAA even more responsive that to the needs of its customers, who make up industry that it serves. I really pose the question-and I have not heard it satisfactorily answered yet: what exactly does the publication of air crew names in this situation have to do with safety? I suggest that it has precisely nothing to do with it. In fact, I cannot see any good reason for that procedure at all. Another issue in this context of the Civil Aviation Act amendments that we are talking about-an issue not directly involving them, but I am talking generally about concerns that I and the Opposition have about the CAA-is the charging of the military. That has become a very big issue and, in my view, it has yet to be satisfactorily addressed. I know that there is a study going on at the moment. I am not anti-military; in fact, of all the people in this place I would probably be one of the more pro-military ones, having been an Army officer. Let me say that in this case the military does not seem terribly interested in pushing this inquiry to its conclusion. In fact, my understanding is that it has not wanted to see it move very quickly at all. It is clear at the moment that military operations are being subsidised by the nonmilitary. I ask the question: where is the user pays principle in this situation? We have already established that the industry does not mind the concept of user pays; it applauds it-provided that it can be guaranteed efficiency and that it is not forced to pay for inefficiency. But it is also being asked to subsidise an enormous military operationmilitary use of civilian facilities. I do not think that is fair, and I hope that it will be resolved. In the context of the enormous CAA staff reductions that are going on, we must ask whether those reductions are fair in the light of this subsidisation of the military that is occurring. It may well be that some of these jobs could be retained if this particular problem was sorted out, because it represents a substantial cost. I raise that as an issue that is an ongoing sore, if you like, in the side of the general aviation industry, and the issue needs to be resolved. In the United States, for example, the military contributes to the cost of maintaining civil airports which it uses, and there is a reciprocal arrangement whereby civilian carriers and operators also pay for the use of military facilities which they use from time to time. That works fairly well, and that is the way that it ought to work here. Mr Jull-Especially if you knock off the ALOP on the local line networks.",108
214,Mr BRADFORD,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"Yes, that would have an effect as well. All of this has to be seen in the context of a package of new arrangements that liliiiilc are long overdue. So the industry supports user pays, and the Opposition supports it. We have no problem with the movement down that track, and, as I said earlier, in the cases of both the CAA and the FAC, we would want to take it even further and faster. But we point to numerous situations in which the status quo is simply not fair to people who are being asked to pay. Another issue that I raise in this context is the ongoing real concern in the industry with the peak period landing charges at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. The $250 landing charge clearly discriminates against small operators, and that is most unfortunate. I understand the problem at Kingsford-Smith Airport; we all understand it clearly. But there is a sense in which proper scheduling can overcome that problem. That is a problem that has never been properly solved. We have talked about it a lot, but it is still a problem, and I believe that better scheduling there can overcome it. Clearly, regional airlines need to use Kingsford-Smith Airport at peak times. There is no point in their using the airport outside those times. People from the country who come down to Sydney on business for the day do not want to come down at 11 o'clock in the morning and go home at 2 o'clock in the afternoon or something like that. So I believe, along with, I think, the vast bulk of the general aviation industry, that a per-seat levy would in that sense be much fairer. I am not necessarily suggesting that that is the only solution to the problem. Clearly, if we had the third runway we would have the extra capacity in place, but the Government has vacillated with that particular issue for years and yC(as. We do not have the third runway and we have not even had a sod of soil turned at Badgerys Creek. And we wonder why we have this enormous problem. These problems are having a very serious impact on operators. Hazelton Airlines recently announced its withdrawal of air services to 14 New South Wales rural centres-and that is after 25 years of service to some of those areas. It blames, in part, that particular charge. It is a culmination of factors that, as I have already said, are impinging heavily on the smaller operators in the general aviation industry, but Hazelton cannot operate its small aircraft into Sydney and pay that charge. With 10 people on a short flight, that is an extra $25 per head, and people just cannot afford to pay that sort of imposition. So it is with great regret that rural people in particular have seen Hazelton-and there will be others-withdrawing services at a time when we have had deregulation with all of its benefits. The downside of this appears to be that country people in particular will be adversely affected by having fewer and fewer services. To some extent, we anticipated that, but it is a great shame that operators such as Hazelton, which is efficient by any standards or any measures, are forced to the point where they just cannot afford to operate to some of these fairly significant country centres. We are not talking about little dirt strips around the country; we are talking about significant country centres such as Condobolin and a number of others that were previously getting Hazelton services. I think that that issue needs to be considered, in this case by the FAC, because it is clearly not fair to small operators. As I say, I will not suggest that it be dropped. The problem could have been solved in other ways. I mentioned better scheduling, and we need the third runway more than ever. Many good things have occurred in the CAA under Dick Smith. I am a great admirer and supporter of his. I think he has been walking on eggshells in many respects, but I think he is doing a good job. We have seen many things introduced in recent times. Care reporting, for instance, has been a very good system. In particular, the situation at Coolangatta Airport, which is in my electorate, is a credit to the Civil Aviation Authority. I get a great deal of cooperation from the air traffic controllers there. They are very sensitive to departures on runway 32; the noisier aircraft in particular can be directed over the ocean. The same thing applies to approaches to runway 14. So I can only be complimentary of the CAA operation as I see it working at an airport in my own electorate. The new radar there, of course, has been a tremendous boost to safety and to the efficient operation of the airport, and I give credit to the people there where it is due. (Time expired)",111
215,Mr ONEIL,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"My contribution tonight will be mainly about railways but, in passing, I would like to comment on the Navigation Act, which my colleague the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) spoke on tonight at some length. He made a very effective contribution. The honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) also made an effective contribution, highlighting the fact that within Australia we do not have a decent shipping industry carrying Australian goods. I thought the contribution tonight by the honourable member for Throsby was quite outstanding. It is disappointing that Australian goods are carried by overseas ships rather than by a decent Australian line, which could do so much for our balance of trade figures. That is something I feel very strongly about indeed. As I said earlier, my main contribution tonight will be about the Australian National Railways Commission Act 1983. Without a doubt the most significant railway system in Australia is that run by Australian National. It is the only successful railway system within Australia. In my electorate of Grey, the people at Port Augusta playa very keen and major role in not only keeping the railway system running quite effectively but also, in the railway workshops themselves, refurbishing the passenger trains quite significantly. The amount of work that is completed there is quite outstanding, even by world standards. However, in commenting on the outstanding success of Australian National, I want to say that the pittance that is being offered to railway workers for redundancies is very disappointing indeed, given the voluntary redundancies that are taking place at the present time. It is quite appalling in comparison with the redundancy payments that are being made to waterside workers. I do not have any quibble with those as we try to restructure the waterside industry. But if the Government is fair dinkum and even-handed about redundancy packages, we cannot expect waterside workers with some 30 years of service to be given in excess of $150,000 j when a rililway worker with the same length of service is given in the vicinity of $30,000. I think it is quite outrageous that this sort of thing happens. I hope that the Government has a long, hard look at this and comes up -.with a system such as four weeks pay for .every year of service, uncapped, to be given to railway workers. I am delighted that the honourable member for Throsby is here to support me. In 1976, when the South Australian railway system was taken over by the then Commonwealth Railways, the agreement provided for South Australian railway workers to be paid four weeks pay for every year of service. The railway workers who went into the Commonstrategy wealth Railways, which is now AN, will be paid four weeks for every year of service, and they are working alongside fellows doing the same amount of work who will be paid three weeks for every year of service. cannot have that if we are the Government of AN freight. that believes in even-handedness, the Government that is supposed to consult with the ACro and the trade union movement. Let us do a bit of consultation and be fair what we are doing. The railway workers have a couple of supporters in me and the honourable member for Throsby. Australian National has been very sucand cessful, particularly in the area of passenger and freight. We all talk about tourism. We know that for every 26 people who come achieve from overseas there is employment for one full time employee within Australia. I am glad that the shadow Minister for tourism and aviation, the honourable member for (Mr Jull), is here because I realise he knows more about tourism than I would ever wish to know. He knows that it is a fact of life. Tourism is very important indeed. I see the mission of AN, as the major operator of interstate passenger trains, in this area as having AN passenger travel make an outstanding contribution to Australian tourism. AN will achieve this by offering competitive services and unique travel opportunities to all train travellers at a cost recovery acceptable to supporting governments. This is good. One of the problems about the Indian Pacific, the Ghan and some of the long passenger trains is the fact that AN has not marketed them as tourist passenger services. This is very important. The honourable member for Throsby and I travelled on the Indian Pacific. It is a first class trip. The meals and services are first class. It is a pity that AN does not sell the service, because the service is unique. At a time when we are trying to promote tourism within Australia, this service could be unique. When people are in this large country, they want to look at it; one way to look at it is by train. The Indian Pacific and the Ghan are first class examples of how we can do this. In the area of freight, much of AN's freight can be related to the primary now marketing issue of unsatisfactory customer service quality. However, a number of issues are of a more general corporate nature. Customer service quality is regarded as the most We important of the internal management issues The strategy which AN intends to pursue to address the customer service quality includes about a concerted customer service training and promotion program, aimed at all levels in the organisation, designed to reinforce appreciation of the impact of poor reliability, on-time running. and other aspects of service to change attitudes. AN needs to develop a work force with a clear vision of what its all members are striving for and how they can their goals. The strategy also includes clearly defining and strengthening accountability for all staff responsible for customer service requirements, train departure and Fadden schedule adherence, and support from management through information, training and positive response employee initiatives. It also includeS reduction in the amount of track subject to speed restrictions, focusing on more easily removed restrictions and areas of greatest immediate return, and continuing investment in freight terminal facilities and attention to their management, to ensure efficient and convenient receipt and delivery of client goods. The strategy also includes, within available capital resources, replacement of unreliable equipment and upgrading of the locomotive fleet and other equipment through new purchases and rebuilding; applying new technology, notably the Austrac train control system, to improve the management of train running and ultimately to anticipate and avoid potential delay situations; and continuing programs to upgrade track to accommodate increased speeds and axle loads, notably by rail grinding, dipped weld construction and concrete re-sleepering, and progressing the program to place better rail in curves. In addition, it includes continuing investment in upgrading rolling stock which is capable of higher speeds, with improved load-tare ratio, and which is designed to meet the specific needs of customers and, within practical limits, rapidly responding to changes in business offering by maintaining flexibility in the provision of appropriate rolling stock and operational flexibility in services provided. The strategy also includes applying a range of strengthening marketing tactics-which is very important indeed-such as development of specialised service packages; paying close attention to customers and to their requirements; competing on service rather than price; protecting direct rail business; locating a State sales manager in Brisbane; and seeking opportunities for new products, for example, road-rail based products and land bridging. In addition, the strategy includes strengthening marketing intelligence systems, including techniques such as strategic choice modelling to more accurately understand customer requirements; and market survey techniques and intelligent systems. Finally, it includes enhancing business systems, including interchange of train and consignment data with customers; inter-modal control systems; and train contribution analysis, drawing on Railcost and TIMS. AN's strategy in the area of work force changes and productivity improvements involves developing flatter management structures with greater devolution of authority, accompanied by appropriate support and monitoring systems; progressing arrangements under the structural efficiency principles for greater work force flexibility, career structures and training; emphasising achievement of results through teamwork and personal commitment; acknowledging the contribution made by employee-s to AN's success and developing a sense of ownership and pride in that success; providing adequate support for employees in remote locations, recognising the particular difficulties which exist for them and their families; and continuing the downsizing of the organisation by specifically targeted incentive arrangements to realise the potential of work practice change and structural efficiency. The important strategy related to the capital investment key issue includes progressing urgent capital renewal within the limits of capacity either to raise debt free capital or to service the debt resulting from borrowings. It includes maximising the content of the capital program related to investments which have significant strategic importance for development of the business and improved product quality. Also, it includes using the corporate planning process to understand the full implications of planned investments, having regard not only to return from investment but also to financing, cash flow, debt servicing and achievability of planned benefits. Also included is pursuing private sector involvement, both in specific business initiatives including rolling stock purchase or lease and in major infrastructure investment, for example in the Melbourne-Adelaide corridor. Finally, it includes rationalising assets in order to recover useable materials and minimise under-utilisation in the size of the asset base commensurate with marketing, reliability and maintenance requirements. It is also important to outline the strategy needed to transform AN into a fully commercial enterprise. The first major element is finalising the segmentation of AN into a profit centre based divisional structure under which the CSOs and infrastructure are clearly identified separately from the commercial business, which is AN Freight. The second major element is progressing under arrangements agreed under the government business enterprise reform package, including implementation of the asset revaluation program and other planning and accountability requirements, accommodating with AN's corporate plans the phased completion of the commercialisation of the AN Freight business segment. The current strategy associated with AN's obligations and with obligations of the transport industry more generally involves providing for greater equality in employment opportunity. It involves providing a safe and healthy working environment and providing support for this, using recognised systems, including an accredited rating system. It also includes seeking to reinforce rail's responsible position despite competing with, and, in recent years, supporting through fuel tax, a road transport industry with a record of overloading, excessive speed, poor driving conditions and a questionable safety record. These are some of the things that AN is doing. One of the things which is very important indeed and which I fully support is the construction of the Alice Springs to Darwin railway line. I think it is sad indeed that the Government did not proceed with this commitment. However, it is pleasing to see that private enterprise is looking at the viability and feasibility of building the railway line. My colleague the honourable member for Throsby does not agree with me on this. It is unfortunate that he has not been to the area and looked at the potential and what the project could do, particularly in opening up the northern part of South Australia. Because of the geographic location of South Australia and the location of places such as Whyalla and Port Augusta, the only way we can economically get things moving in the north of South Australia is to ship things by rail on the Alice Springs to Darwin railway line. To my mind, this would be a fast track program. It would be a tremendous employer operation, and I think it would have enormous benefits for South Australia, particularly for the northern part of South Australia. When one looks at the map of Australia and sees how ships can go from east to west, to Perth or to the eastern seaboard of Queensland or New South Wales, and perhaps to Melbourne, one sees the extra distance to go to Adelaide. It seems to me quite irrational that the South Australian Government does not get very strongly behind the construction of the Alice Springs to Darwin railway line, because I think it has enormous benefits for South Australia. The AN strategies are to expand the revenue base by securing a bigger slice of the existing freight market and by identifying and capitalising on new market potential; to improve customer service, reliability and on time performance through track, communications and equipment upgrading, preventative maintenance and commitment of management and employees to service quality; to obtain funding for improvement of rolling stock, a new UHF communications system and continued track reconstruction and renewal; and to improve productivity through greater work force flexibility, multiskilling, re-skilling, work force reduction and better control of overhead costs. I hope the work force reduction is done by voluntary redundancies. I know a number of people within the railway industry would be only too happy to take voluntary redundancy. I only hope that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Senator Cook) and the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) finally see a little bit of objectivity in this issue and support the four weeks redundancy package, with no capping, which is the requirement and the goal of the railway workers. If they come to the party and support that, I think we will go a long way towards having a decent, first-class rail system within Australia.",112
216,Mr TUCKEY,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"In the debate on the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill tonight I wish to address primarily civil aviation. However, after the discourse from the honourable member for Grey (Mr O'Neil), I wm draw a couple of matters to the attention of the honourable member, his constituents, the hard working members of Australian National and, of course, the union bureaucrats who are involved in the operation. I am sure the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) , would applaud wholeheartedly the suggestion that the Indian Pacific and the Ghan are great tourist attractions for the Australian nation and that, as such, they should proceed in line with other great railways such as the Orient Express. Certainly they no longer have a role as a means of personal transport, if only because they take too long. But they are very attractive. In years gone by, I was a frequent traveller on the Indian Pacific, as it then was, the Trans Australian Railway system, when I used to visit Adelaide, where my wife was born. I am also reminded that there was a time when Qantas marketed a package whereby people flew into Sydney from all around the world and went across Australia on the Indian Pacific. Qantas had to cancel that because it got fed up with explaining to people, when they got to Sydney, that the train was not running, that there was industrial action. The union bureaucrats, the drongos, destroyed the only opportunity to keep those people in jobs because they could not see past the end of their noses. What a tragedy! Today the Minister told us about Cathay Pacific and said that more freight lines are coming in. The people of Hong Kong have never seen a decent railway line. They would love the Indian Pacific trip. They are flying in on all the new air routes which are being established, but who will have the confidence to start the service again? The Minister should go back to his people. If he brings some legislation to this Parliament he should take a leaf out of Maggie Thatcher's book. She did this with the great road transport industry in England. Mr O'Neil- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. He is trying to lose my preselection.",115
217,Mr TUCKEY,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"No, what I am suggesting-and I will support the honourable member if he brings the legislation in-is to give the Indian Pacific to the railway workers of Australian National. I do not include the locomotives; they can be separate. But we should say that the workers can have the carriages and the infrastructure if they will get together, run the railway as a tourist attraction and guarantee delivery. I would give the railway and all the profits to them. The honourable member would be surprised to see what those blokes would do. At the first meeting they would tell half the bludgers that they would have to leave. The other half would stay and would make a damned good job of it. I do not want to be too light-hearted about this. I am quite serious. That is the solution to the Indian Pacific. 1I have said to truck drivers who have worked for me, 'I will sell you this truck, I will arrange the terms and I will guarantee the loan'. I have seen those blokes progress. That isa better solution than bringing in some big time entrepreneur. Let the fellows have it. They can hire the locomotive, they can pay something for the infrastructure and the railway line, and they can run the business themselves. 1 strongly recommend that the honourable member try the fellows on that. In my electorate 1I have to start talking to fellows in meat works who are ringing me up saying, 'What's going to happen when they bring these Russian whale ships down, take all the sheep off-shore and process them out there, as has been proposed?'. 1 say to them, 'I'll come down and tell you how to make a quid out of killing sheep and do it at a price'. We have to look at this. There is nothing wrong, possibly, with a railway line from Darwin to Alice Springs, provided that the bloke who builds it does not want a subsidy from the taxpayer. It is as simple as that. The great test of railway lines is to put them all up for sale; we will soon find which ones are worth anything, because someone will literally want to buy them. There will not be many bidders, for all sorts of reasons but primarily because most of the lines-though not so much the national network-cannot be supported by the traffic available. I often make this point in my own electorate, where they are shifting 1,200 tonnes of freight per kilometre of rail track and up in the iron ore province they shift 80,000 tonnes of iron ore per kilometre. They are the sorts of numbers we have to achieve to make a railway line work. It does not matter what we do with the staff or how many are made redundant, if we do not have enough business we are wasting our time and, in fact, the truck becomes the better solution. 1 reject the constant suggestion that trucks do not pay their way. 1I have brought to the attention of this House time and time again from my own experience that about 30 to 33 per cent of the revenue of any owner-driver goes into one tax or another. The fact that governments collect it and then do not spend it back on the road is no fault of the truck owner. In my electorate recently a fellow rang me up complaining that he was going to lose a cartage contract for wheat because he had been undercut. He said to me, 'I first won this contract 15 years ago at a rate of $5.60 a tonne. This time 1 bid $5.60 a tonne. Fifteen years later, with the same dollar price, someone has undercut me'. That is a great benefit to the wheat growers in that area when they look around the rail system and see the price go up every year. Western Australian governments of both political persuasions have been very innovative in road transport, so over that period of time that that fellow had quoted the load carried by each individual truck had gone up from 10 tonnes to 74 tonnes. There is no more damage being done to the roads, the vehicles are much safer than they used to be and they are not overloaded because everyone can make a quid on a 74-tonne truckload. The day that people wake up to that and put some B-doubles on the Hume Highway, they will find a fall-off in the number of trucks on the roads and drivers under less pressure to speed and do all those other things, because there is a quid sitting behind them. 1 want to raise another matter relating to the Civil Aviation Authority. This legislation does deal with penalties. 1 just hope-notwithlogy standing that 1 think the courts have to have access to high penalties when we are dealing with public safety - that the Authority does settle down a little. 1 believe that over time-1I have had reason to draw this to the Authorthat ity's attention on a couple of occasions-it does get a bit involved in vendettas. A constituent of mine has just gone to gao1. I am not here to defend him, but 1 wrote to the Minister a couple of years ago suggesting that the slate be wiped clean. That was not done. He beat them in court once and now they have beaten him in court and got him in gao1. I am not sure who is the winner. Amongst other things, this man had an American private pilot's licence. Apparently an overseas licence was no good for him, but it was good for a mob of Frenchmen and others when it suited the Government to upset the pilots federation. They are the sorts of things that are covered by this legislation, and 1 make that simple plea. It has been mentioned tonight that the Civil Aviation Authority has certainly had a broom put through it. It all started when the well known entrepreneur, Dick Smith, wrote a book called Two Years in the Aviation Hall of Doom. It was quite a shocking document. With his credibility, it was understood. 1 said at the time that the simple solution was to put Dick in charge of the CAA. Obviously, the Government had a similar idea. There are two aspects to that: firstly, if the Government has a major critic, it should give him a job; but, secondly, 1 think everybody recognised that Dick was the sort of person who would get in there and start doing things. The Government then brought in a gentleman from New Zealand, Frank Baldwin. Everybody seems to be bringing New Zealanders over these days to help run the country. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) should not criticise us, because his Government has done the same thing. Frank Baldwin, with Mr Smith, has gone down the road of proposing major changes to the staffing and administration of the Civil Aviation Authority. This has already resulted in substantial redundancies and proposed redundancies. The other proposal is to use modern technoto reduce the points of air traffic control, other than immediate airport control, around Australia. 1I have corresponded with Mr Baldwin about this proposal, about which 1I have some severe criticisms. It now appears - ll flights in Australia, whether they be large; small, international, intrastate or interstate, will be controlled from Melbourne or Brisbane. I believe that in the simplest terms we could control them all from Los Angeles today if we chose to put an air traffic control space there. The technology is available. If it is proper to have two facilities in Australia. I would have thought, as the New Zealanders under Mr Baldwin decided, that three would be more appropriate because they have three in little old New Zealand-my first question is: how did Melbourne get a guernsey? It is a destination point for Antarctica! It has no reason to be a selected site. Quite clearly, if there are to be two sites, one should be on the west coast and one should be on the east coast, if only considering the size of Australia. I fly back and forth between Western Australia and here every week when this Parliament is sitting and I apparently have to have faith, in terms of air traffic control and arriving safely at the other end, in the fibre optic cable that runs across the Nullarbor. I used to be in the earth-moving industry and I have a rough idea how many times my blokes ripped up a cable from time to time. I worry about that. I am also told-the honourable member for Grey might be able to confirm this-that the Nullarbor rabbits have taken a liking to fibre optic cables and they give it a bit of a nibble occasionally. I would rather that my life were not entirely reliant on the fad of some rabbit that is digging a burrow. More importantly, it would appear to me that if two positions are to be selected then, as I said, there should be one in Western Australia and another, it would seem, in New South Wales. I am told that one of the reasons that Sydney has been discarded is that the infrastructure costs are too high. That presupposes that the Government has to build this entire facility at Sydney Airport. Having already admitted that it could have it in Los Angeles, why would it do that? Why would it not go out to the proposed new Badgerys Creek site and build the facility there or go out into a greenfields site with some cheap land? It does not matter where it is put; it has committed itself to the fibre optic cable. Presumably it can have a back-up with the satellite but I am told that when we start to get down to radar images we can get some distortion from that. We are looking at a person sitting in Melbourne physically operating a radar in Perth and certain communications. Of course the last 45 nautical miles will come under the control of Perth tower-that is, if it is found, if the guy in Melbourne has not got the plane lost. I just do not know why it is necessary. I had a discussion with Telecom when it decided on a policy of centralising its manual exchanges. The girls in Northam, a small town in my electorate, were about to lose their jobs if they were not prepared to transfer to Perth. We had a big meeting and they were going to have a protest and make up petitions. I said, 'Stop all that. Let's ask ourself: ""Why does Telecom need you?'''. My first question was: do you go on strike up here? They said, 'Oh no, Mr Tuckey, those girls in Perth always get together and they have trouble and that, but we like our job and we are country girls; we keep working'. I wrote to Telecom and said, 'As I understand it, the cost of sending a signal from A to B is the same as sending it from B to A. As you own the wire in between, why cannot some girls, your loyal employees, sit in Northam, and take calls from all around Australia? Why do you want to follow down the road of Australia Post? Why are you going to do that?'. Do honourable members remember the mega mail exchanges where all the sorters were put in one place? They were off work more than they were at work because it just bred discontent. Eventually Australia Post discovered that mail could be sorted quicker in post offices by hand. Anyhow, I am pleased to say that in Telecom's interests it accepted my arguments. There were no protests from it, and in fact it refurbished the Northam exchange, which gives excellent service throughout Western Australia, and probably the eastern States. I am told that when the Civil Aviation Authority finishes its current redundancy program and implements its new two-station approach, it will not save any jobs. There are savings available, but the Authority will not save many jobs. It will just shift its people to Melbourne and a few to Brisbane. Every time a shop steward in Melbourne wakes up with a headache, planes will not fly anywhere in Australia, whereas if there was another group of employees in Western Australia, such as my girls in Northam, they would probably say, 'We are not interested in your smog problems in Melbourne that you are always protesting about or the fact that you did not get a wet weather allowance. We will keep working'. With today's technology, they can handle all the planes in Australia. As I know Western Australians, it is most likely that they would continue to do so. So from an industrial relations point of view there is simply no point. There is another point. Forthcoming legislation in Western Australia will put us back to a two-hour differential in the summertime-I expect that, as usual, it will be defeated in a referendum next year, the third we have had-but whether it be two hours or three hours, while there is a penalty rate regime why not have one group of controllers working ordinary hours on the east coast and another group of controllers working ordinary hours on the west coast, and save two or three hours of penalty rates? If penalty rates are done away with, as I think will happen over time, we will still have a better working environment where people will be working, for a longer period throughout Australia, ordinary working hours as we know them. Why would the CAA want to put both these controlling points on the east coast? It must be difficult in terms of safety. It is certainly very dangerous in terms of search and rescue to have a bloke sitting in Brisbane and a bloke sitting in Melbourne with no real on the-ground knowledge of the coastline of Western Australia, which of course an individual resident in Perth would have a better knowledge of. So there is another argument. There are so many points that I cannot understand the reason. I do not support Melbourne, as I think Sydney, or New South Wales, geographically would be better. Melbourne, Perth and Adelaide have got member reasonably modem radar. Brisbane's is so bad apparently that the controllers have to keep the backup system running at all times in case they need it. The last time they used it in emergency, it took five hours from start up to get it working and to settle down. So now they keep it running all the time. Yet all this infrastructure is going to be shifted to Brisbane. Generally, it does not make much sense. I am surprised that Dick Smith cannot understand the industrial relations problems that he will create by centralising nearly his entire work force. Air traffic controllers are the people who switch commercial airline flying in Australia on and off at the drop of a hat, but he wants to concentrate them in one place, notwithstanding the experience of Australia Post. He wants to keep all of this facility on the east coast when, if he is going to have two facilities, clearly one should be on the west coast and one should be on the east coast. At this stage of the game he is not even considering a stand-alone radar in Perth, which at least would go to 250 nautical miles. I think that that is only a stopgap measure compared with the proposal to either have three facilities-which seems common to New Zealand, Canada and other parts of the world-or, if there are to be two, to have one on the east coast and one on the west coast. I hope that some account will be taken of this. Mr Baldwin has assured me that my suggestions will be considered. On the other hand, the communications I get from other people in the industry say that it is all cut and dried and nobody is going to be listened to. I think that is very foolish for all the reasons I have given. I hope that the Government and the Minister-who could have been here tonight, but is not-might have a bit of a look at where we are heading on this, because I assume, notwithstanding the current corporate status of CAA, that the Government still has some influence with it. We are dealing with public safety. I do not think it should be subject to the gnawing of a rabbit or to the industrial problems that will be generated by the concentration of the work force in a single area of that nature. In closing, might I say that the honourable for Grey (Mr O'Neil) would have got his railway line if the South Australian Bank had not lost all that money. I thought of that later. What Bannon lost by trying to play the an big businessman would have just about paid for that railway line. The honourable member for Grey does not really know how much it is yet, but it is amazing when politicians get into business what a messMr o 'Neil-You can't talk. What about Burke?",116
218,Mr TUCKEY,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,I was thinking that the feasibility study was about equal to what Terry Burke got in commissions. (TIme expired),120
219,Mr SNOWDON,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"Northern TerritoryParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications) (9.16 p.m.)in reply-It is my function to sum up this debate. Firstly, let me acknowledge the contributions made by various honourable members. On the Government side, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), in a very nice gesture, mentioned his very fond association with the FAC and the contribution that he and the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) had made to the construction of the new Darwin Airport terminal byhe alleges-insisting that there be three aerobridges. He indicated t6 the House that he had had the privilege of having his photograph taken in front of one of these aerobridges last week while he was in Darwin on the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works. I do not know whether my friend the honourable member for Throsby was totally responsible for the construction of the aerobridges. I am sure there are other people who might claim some credit for having got the FAC to consider that option, but I can say I am very pleased that the honourable member for Throsby does enjoy visiting the Northern Territory and, in his own way, has played a part in its development by being Chairman of the Public Works Committee and oversighting the development of a large range of developments not only at the Darwin Airport but also at the Alice Springs Airport, both of which, I might mention, will be open next month. He also, as the honourable member for Grey (Mr O'Neil) pointed out, made a very good contribution in relation to the Navigation Act. The honourable member for Eden Monaro (Mr Snow) concentrated his contribution on land transport and highlighted the efficiency gains that can potentially be obtained from reform of the land transport system. The honourable member for Grey, my friend from south of the border, spoke at length about Australian National and emphasised at one part his commitment to the development of a railway from Alice Springs to Darwin. I need to pick him up on one point. The fact that that railway has not been built thus far has not been the result of any reneging by this Government or the previous Hawke Government on any undertaking that it gave. In fact, this Government offered the Northern Territory Government a deal on a 60:40 split for the construction of that railway back in the mid-1980s. The then Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Paul Everingham, who was later to become the honourable member for the Northern Territory, saw fit not to accept that offer. Had he accepted it, we would have had the railway built. As the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) pointed out, it is no longer possible for governments to put aside that amount of money. Clearly, whilst I think that there would, as the honourable member for Grey pointed out, be very great benefits from the development of a railway line from Alice Springs to Darwin, particularly in terms of the movement of freight, it will not be built unless it can be proved to be commercially viable. I happen to think that that is in prospect. I would not be surprised to see that project commence within the reasonably near future-at least within the next two or three years-because I know that there is commercial interest from a range of areas. However, I want to concentrate on contributions made by our friends from the Opposition. I might just start with the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), who is at the table. His remarks were based essentially around the amendments to the Civil Aviation Act contained in part 3 of the Bill. In part those amendments elevate to the Act a number of serious offences against air safet); requirements, as recommended by the Air Safety Regulation RevieW Task Force, with higher penalty levels applying to those offences under the Act than can be applied under the civil aviation regulations. If I understood the honourable member correctly, he raised some doubts about the efficacy of the penalties that are incorporated in the Act. At one stage, if my reading is correct, he alluded to the similarity between traffic offences and offences under this legismight lation. From what I gather, he was concerned about the penalties, and indeed indicated that they were seeking some legal advice. Mr Jull-Make sure the checks are there. We are not knocking the concept.",120
220,Mr SNOWDON,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"Right. I thought what I dation might do is go through the issue of penalties, for the honourable member's benefit and the benefit of the House. I point out that the penalties are maximum penalties only. They penalty'. deal with the worse case scenarios: for example, an unlicensed or unqualified person who performs maintenance on a jumbo jet which crashes and kills hundreds of people. Clearly, that should be of concern not only this House but also to the community. Under this legislation, the courts have discretion as to whether or not to impose maximum penalties and will look at all the circumstances: for example, whether the person is a consistent offender, the seriousguilty ness of the contravention, et cetera. Under section 4B of the Crimes Act, the court has discretion to impose a pecuniary penalty instead of a custodial sentence. For a two-year imprisonment term the court can impose an alternative penalty of up to $12,000. So court is not obliged to impose sentence. The penalties are in line with relativities established for other Commonwealth offences, and I will give two examples. The first relates to hazardous waste. The Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) provides a penalty of five years for importing or exporting hazardous wastes. The Wildlife Protection Act of 1982 provides a penalty five years for possessing illegally imported specimens. Given the potentially disastrous results that could occur for the contravention of these provisions, including the loss of hundreds of lives, ,it is considered that the proposed penalties are not draconian. They should certainly be on a par with offences relating to, say, the protection of wildlife and the environment. The proposed provisions are designed ultimately to protect the lives of thousands of Australians and, indeed, passengers who come from overseas. In my view, it is certainly in the public interest that provisions designed to protect the lives of air travellers should contain an appropriate deterrent for wilful and persistent offenders. The independent task force that reviewed the civil aviation regulations recommended under recommen9 that 'offences identified as serious enough to include in the Act should attract for very much higher pecuniary penalties and a prison sentence as an alternative or additional In a number of recent court cases involvinf serious repeat offences, the courts have expressed concern that under the current to legislation they have no power to take away licences or to impose custodial sentences. In a recent case in Western Australia, the court a sentenced a particularly recalcitrant offender to two years gaol for attempting to pervert the course of justice by hiding the registration mark of his aircraft so that he would not be of other offences under the civil aviation legislation. Under the current civil a aviation legislation, the court could not sentence that person to a term of imprisonment for a breach of the legislation and alternative charges had to be found under the the Crimes Act so that a term of imprisonment a custodial could be imposed. It is worthwhile recalling the sorts of offences that will be considered. Offences involve the carrying out of a number of activities contrary to the provisions of the regulations. They include, as the honourable Act member would be aware, flying an unregistered aircraft; operating an aircraft without either a certificate of airworthiness or of a maintenance release; performing. duties essential to the operation of an Australian aircraft during a flight without proper authorisation; and purporting to issue an authorisation under the regulations without authorisation to do so. I consider, as I am sure all honpurable members do, that it is appropriate to ensure that those very serious breaches are dealt with in the appropriate way. It is for that reason that these amendments have been made. I turn then to the contribution made by the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker), who referred to the amendments to the National Railways Commission Act in part 2 of this legislation. The honourable member for Wannon claimed that the amendment does not give Australian National the capacity adequately to manage its treasury operations. He criticised the Government's amendment to the Australian National Railways Commission Act 1983 on the grounds that the amendment would allegedly reduce AN's ability to manage its treasury operations, particularly as they might apply to hedging and unhedging of foreign currency and interest rate risk. The Government just does not accept this argument. Under previous arrangements, AN's financial powers were very general in nature. However, there was some doubt over the legality of the transactions AN was entering into. This doubt arose from the legal precedent created by the Hammersmith case in the United Kingdom, which was mentioned, quite appropriately, by the honourable member for Wannon. The financial sector could clearly have grounds for concern while this state of affairs continued. There is undeniably a need to make AN's powers with respect to financial transactions specific. I understand from the comments of the honourable member for Wannon that he does not oppose the need to clarify these powers. The amendment attempts to define AN's powers to engage in risk transactions in a way that is consistent and appropriate with its powers, functions and responsibilities, which are primarily to operate as a rail company, not a merchant bank. The Government is concerned to protect AN when engaging in bona fide hedge transactions but not complicated arrangements that may be speculative in nature and involve a potential loss of taxpayers' moneys. The fundamental point here is that AN is a rail company and not a merchant bank. Through this amendment the Government is not restricting AN but, rather, providing legislative recognition of the fact that in its operations as a rail company AN will need to undertake certain financial transactions to minimise risk. As the honourable member for Wannon would be aware, a majority of AN's assets will be transferred to the National Rail Corporation when that body is established. This underscores the need, in our view, to protect taxpayers' investments in Australian National. The amendment is consistent with the amendments proposed for the Civil Aviation Authority Act. It is worth noting that neither the honourable member for Wannon nor the Opposition spokesman for aviation, the honourable member for Fadden, raised any concerns about this same amendment being applied to the Civil Aviation Authority. Am I to take it that the Opposition supports this amendment when it applies to the CAA but not when it applies to AN? I suggest that there is a need for a consistent approach. The honourable member for Wannon also made the statement that the Hawke Government has demonstrated very little knowledge of how to make its business enterprises more commercial. Australian National has improved its financial performance markedly in recent years, as the honourable member for Wannon knows. In the period of the Hawke Government there has been a 69 per cent reduction in the Federal Government's subsidy to Australian National. The improved performance of AN over recent years will provide a fundamentally strong base for the establishment of the National Rail Corporation. AN is a vastly different organisation from what it was in 1983. It now concentrates on the area where rail has a competitive advantage in the land transport sector, namely, long-haul, high-volume general freight and bulk traffic such as minerals and grains. These reforms have improved AN's productivity significantly. According to an EPAC report of October 1990, the Australian rail systems with the fastest total productivity growth over a IS-year period were AN and V-Line. In the second half of the 1980s, AN's labour productivity increased in most years by between 15 per cent and 20 per cent. The honourable member for Grey outlined the additional measures, which I have not gone into in this contribution, that AN is taking to increase its productivity and the way in which it is operating in a far more commercially oriented manner. Lastly, I refer to the contribution made by the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp). He mentioned late in the course of his contribution the issue of coordinated universal time. When I first came across this proposition about changing Greenwich time to coordinated universal time, I sought some definition of it. I am sorry that the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) is not here because he could perhaps provide us with an appropriate model, or at least a chalk representation of it. As honourable members would know, Greenwich mean time is based on the average or mean spin of the earth's axis in the year 1900. This has been an accurate method of time keeping. With the introduction of satellite technology in the maritime industry in the areas of positioning and communication, Greenwich mean time has not been accurate enough because of random irregularities in the orbit of the earth around the sun. This new technology has required an even more precise definition of the basic unit of time, which coordinated universal time will achieve. For the benefit of honourable members-and I am sure they will be pleased to hear this-coordinated universal time is the measurement of an electron in orbit in an atom of caesium. I am sure that that information will be treated with delight by Opposition members. What I want to say about the contribution of the honourable member for Gilmore is that he fundamentally confused some of the amendments which we are proposing. He has confused those amendments to do with the qualifications for pilots in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park-that is, the amendments to section 15 of the Navigation Act, which seek to make the provisions consistent with the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975-with the amendment to section 6 of the Navigation Act, which deals with fishing vessels. I will briefly outline the differences ween those two areas. I think that he properly understood the question of determination of qualifications for pilots in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, but he then went on to ascribe the amendments dealing with fishing fleet support vessels to those amendments in relation to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. For the benefit of the honourable member for Gilmore, this legislation introduces a new category of ships to be called fishing fleet support vessels. A fishing vessel is defined as a ship which is used principally in the catching or processing of fish. Modem fishing fleets now have support vessels which provide a range of support services to the fishing fleet, such as the carriage of fuel and provisions. Although fishing vessels are not subject to the Navigation Act 1912 when on an interstate voyage, a trading ship is. These support vessels, because their primary purpose is not the taking or capturing of fish, are considered trading ships and, therefore, subject to the Act when on interstate voyages. This has led to an unsatisfactory position whereby some vessels in a fishing fleet are subject to the Act while others are subject to State legislation. Attempts to distinguish between a fishing vessel and a support vessel, such as the ratio of goods carried to fish caught, have proven difficult. Following consultation with the fishing industry, it is proposed, therefore, to create this new category of ships, treating fishing fleet support vessels in the same way as fishing vessels but identifying them separately because of the different functions that they perform. I am sure that the provisions to determine whether a ship is a fishing fleet support vessel and to allow fishing fleet support vessels to come under the jurisdiction of the Act will be included. I noted also the contributions of the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradfield) and the honourable member for O'Connor. I was pleased that the honourable member for MCPherson was able to support these amendments, as indeed have all the Opposition speakers. I was not quite sure about the contribution from the honourable bet- member for O'Connor. It was colourful, as usual, but I take it from what he was saying that he, too, supported the thrust of these amendments. I commend them to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Snowdon) read a third time. CIVIL AVIATION (CARRIERS' LIABILITY) AMENDMENT BILL 1991 Second Reading Debate resumed from 17 October, on motion by Mr Snowdon: That the Bill be now read a second time.",121
221,Mr JULL,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"The Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Amendment Bill covers the very complicated area of liability and compensation for the carriage of both passengers and freight by air by Australian airlines flying internlJtionally. The Bill is designed to amend the 1959 Act to enable ratification of the Additional Montreal Protocol No.3 and Montreal Protocol No.4 to ensure that the Montreal Protocol No. 3 passenger limit applies to Australian international air carriers engaged in air services to which the Warsaw Convention and the Hague Protocol apply and to convert the Poincare gold franc limits of the Warsaw Convention and Hague Protocol to Australian dollars through the medium of the International Monetary Fund's special drawing rights, SDRs. This is a very complicated piece of legislation. I wonder how many people who get on an aircraft, whether flying domestically or internationally, read the terms and conditions of the carriage on the back of the ticket. This legislation is all about the little writing sits at the back of the airline tickets. Perhaps I should give the House the background of some of those requirements. The liability of carriers for death or injury of passengers in the course of most international carriage by air to and from Australia is governed by the provisions of the Warsaw Convention of 1929 or that Convention as amended at The Hague in 1955. These conventions are given force of law in Australia by the provisions of the Commonwealth Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act 1959, as amended. Of course, we are making further amendments to that legislation tonight. The liability regime under the conventions provides for strict liability of the carrier; that is, it is not necessary for passengers to prove any negligence or wrongdoing on the part of the catTier in order for the passenger to be compensated, with some limited exceptions. It also provides for a limit to the extent of the carrier's liability. The limit is unbreakable in the vast majority of cases. The carrier's liability limit is expressed in the conventions in terms of gold francs of a defined constitution. The limit for death or injury to passengers under the Warsaw Convention is 125,000 francs and in the amended Convention is 250,000 francs. Conversion of the francs into national currencies did not present a significant problem whilst gold served official monetary functions and had a value set by governments-the gold standard. Once the International Monetary Fund abolished the official price of gold as a world standard and substituted special drawing rights effective from 1 April 1978, there was no generally accepted official method of converting gold into national currencies. As a result, four potential methods of evaluation of the conventional gold franc arose and were variously adopted by courts in a number of jurisdictions. These were the use of the last official price of gold; use of the free market price of gold; by reference to the current French franc; and by use of special drawing rights. Certain jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom and New Zealand, adopted this final solution and legislated a limit based on a conversion by way of SDRs, that but this has not been done in Australia. After a number of lower court decisions in New South Wales in cargo cases, but with the same effect in respect of passenger cases, favouring conversion of the market price of gold, it was interesting that in the most recent of these cases Mr Justice Rogers of the Supreme Court of New South Wales held in the SS Pharmaceutical Co. and Another v. Qantas Airways Ltd-a cargo case-that the appropriate method of valuation was by reference to the market price of gold, although he did urge the Government to legislate a value for the convention franc so as to remove the uncertainty concerning the matter. This aspect of his judgment was obiter dictum and, unfortunately, was not resolved by the Full Court of the Supreme Court of New South Wales on appeal in the SS Pharmaceutical case. The appeal was decided on other grounds, although the dissenting Full Court judge, Judge Kirby, also called for the Government to give urgent attention to the defects in the law arising from the case. Using the market price of gold to convert the convention gold franc into Australian dollars presently results in a limited liability for death or injury to passengers under the Warsaw Convention of $A112,500 and, under the amended Convention, of $A225,000. Quite frankly, I think these limits are inadequate. In contrast, earlier this year amendments were made to the domestic carriage provisions of the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act 1959, as amended, increasing the unbreakable carriers' limit of liability for death or injury to passengers. In my view these limits were still too low but they did increase the domestic carriage limits from $100,000 to $180,000. Again, these limits are too low in this day and age when awards of damages are made not infrequently in excess of $1m. However, they are certainly better off than the limits of $14,000 and $28,000 which could be the result of this legislation. The Government is also legislating to provide for adoption of Montreal Protocol No. 3, which will increase the liability limits in respect of international carriage to 100,000 SDRs, or approximately $180,000. However, it will be some time before Montreal Protocol No. 3 comes into force; it depends for its effective entry into worldwide use on the ratification or otherwise of it by the United States Congress. Quite frankly, it is possible that this particular section may never come into force. Meanwhile, a number of carriers, including Qantas, have voluntarily upgraded their limits of liability to 100,000 SDRs, and all carriers carrying passengers to or from or via the United States have a liability limit of up to $US75,OOO in respect of these passengers. The difficulty that I have with this legislation is that I am infOlmed by the Department of Transport and Communications that, notwithstanding these matters, approximately 30 per cent of the journeys of passengers to and from Australia continue to be subject to the provisions of the Warsaw Convention, or the amended Warsaw Convention, without the benefit of any voluntarily increased limit of liability. This is a significant number of passengers who, if the Government's proposed legislation were to come into force, could well be subject to limits of liability for death or injury of $A14,000 or $A28,000. This is where we have some real difficulty with the Bill, because as it stands it covers only the international sections flown by Australian airlines. While some international passengers travelling on non-Australian airlines will admittedly enjoy higher limits, a staggering 30 per cent of passengers-based on the 1990 figures-will have only minimum cover. It is true that a number of international airlines have voluntarily assumed higher limits. Some countries, such as the United Kingdom, impose higher limits by way of the licensing of carriers, or pursuant to the Montreal agreement of 1966 for operations to, from or via the United States. I will give some examples of what can happen in the 30 per cent of cases of those travelling in and out of Australia who will have only the minimum coverage. I think it is worthwhile to examine some of the absolutely absurd and quite unfair results if the Government's restrictions by virtue of this legislation come into play. Here are just a couple of examples of what can happen to 30 per cent of the passengers to whom I refer. Take, for example, the case of two passengers sitting together on an Australian domestic flight operated by Australian, Ansett or Compass. Let us say that the flight is operating from Brisbane to Sydney. One of the two passengers is on a domestic ticket for just the Brisbane-Sydney trip; the other passenger is on a flight as part of an international ticketsay Brisbane-Sydney-Thailand. If both passengers were killed or injured in the course of the Brisbane-Sydney flight, the limit of liability in respect of the purely domestic passenger would be $180,000; the limit of liability for the international passenger would be $28,000. I will give another example of two passengers travelling on the same flight from Sydney to Bangkok; one is on a one-way ticket and the other is on a round-trip ticket. As Thailand is not a party to either the Warsaw or the amended Convention, the liability regime applicable to the round-trip passenger would produce a limit of $28,000 under the Warsaw-Hague agreement, whereas the oneway passenger would enjoy a liability limit of $180,000 pursuant to part IV of the Act in an action brought in Australia. A further permutation would be introduced by the fact that, if the passengers were being carried on the Australian national carrier, Qantas, the round trip passenger's limit would be lifted to 100,000 SDRs, but this would not be so if the passengers were on a Thai national carrier which does not have a special contract pursuant to article 22(1) of the Convention. If the passenger was being carried by British Airways, the special contract limit would be up to 130,000 SDRs. There is another outstanding example. In the current circumstances flights between Australia and Argentina are operated by aircraft of the Argentinean national carrier, Aerolineas Argentinas, but the Australian national carrier, Qantas, holds blocks of seats on each service, which it sells under its QF flight number. The passenger ticketed QF would be entitled to the benefit of the 100,000 SDR special contract with that carrier, but those travelling in the next seat the same Argentinean aircraft would not, as that airline does not have any special contract limit. These passengers would be limited to $28,000, or even potentially $14,000, in an action brought in Australia following the passage of this proposed legislation. I acknowledge that in the second reading speech the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Snowdon) made reference to the anomalies that presently exist and that he and a committee would consider the possibility of a supplementary scheme. To be fair, too, there is to be a review of domestic and international Australian liability limits which may consider the validity of maintaining such limits at all. But, in reality, that review could take years. In reality, too, we have a system where, at best, death on an international journey will have an upper claim of $14,000, $28,000 or even $180,000. Frankly, this is just not the real world, especially when we read that a quadriplegic was recently awarded $3m in damages. In Victoria a year or so ago, a 40-year-old gentleman with a knee injury which permanently incapacitated him drew an award of $313,000. There was a recent claim where a 44-year-old with an injured elbow-which allegedly prevented him from working again-claimed $750,000 in damages. Damages of $lm plus are not unheard of in Australia these days, but we seem to have this crazy system where we are asked to pass this legislation on this very day. The Opposition believes that the Government should withdraw this Bill immediately. We do not believe that we should wait until such time as the United States Congress makes up its mind on the Montreal Protocol No.3. Quite frankly, it may never come into force. We do not believe that 100,000 SDRs is really a satisfactory figure in the 1990s, leading into the twenty-first century. We believe that there is the capacity for the Government to ensure that all international passengers travelling to, from or via Australia can be covered by the 100,000 SDR limit at least. Italy, for example, has done this by requiring all operators to, from or via that in country to adopt a limit of at least 100,000 SDRs. Britain requires it, too, as part of its licensing procedures. We have seen the problems that the present system has presented to the courts in the cargo cases. I believe that the world price of gold is the best basis on which we can work We do not believe that it is irresponsible to oppose this legislation. In reality, even with the passage of this Bill, nothing much will change in the short term. In a constructive way, we urge the Government to immediately withdraw the Bill. Forget the procrastination that has gone on for years, let us standardise the coverage for all passengers; let us set realistic rates for both passengers and cargo; let us move towards lifting all of the restrictions; let us fast track any inquiry; and let us allow for the topping up of the situation if necessary. Let us get some fairness and justice for all passengers travelling to and from Australia. Let us do that very quickly and get this Bill back into the House as soon as we possibly can. On that basis, the Opposition will back the Government all the way. We are certainly not happy with this legislation that we have before us today. We will oppose this Bill in its present form.",124
222,Mr OKEEFE,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"I rise to support the Civil Aviation (Carriers"" Liability) Amendment Bill 1991 and in doing so I express my surprise that the Opposition intends to oppose this legislation. It surprised me that the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) was so vehement in his reaching of that conclusion because he obviously has a very clear understanding of the issue. He understands all the technicalities of it and it was very clear during his presentation that he is aware of all the implications in one way or another. I have to say that, were he to be on the other side of the House, were he to be responsible Minister, I think his position might be different. But, as it is, I will say why I do not think it is a responsible course of action to oppose the Bill at this point. Australia is, at the moment a party to the international Protocol. We are in a situation where the levels provided under the Montreal Protocol are absurdly low. The Government has introduced this legislation to lift them at least to the level of 100,000 SDRs, or the Australian equivalent of about $180,000, that can now be accepted. By not taking these steps and by removing ourse1 ves from the international Convention to lift the levels even higher, we would as a nation be required to denounce the Warsaw Convention. I do not feel that at this time, when Australia's aviation industry is part of the global network and is having to relate to strategic operations in other parts of the world, we ought to be taking a stand-alone position. I would have preferred that the honourable member for Fadden had been satisfied by the assurance given by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Snowdon) in the second reading speech that the Government acknowledges that those passenger compensation levels of 100,000 SDRs probably are still insufficient; obviously they are still insufficient, and the honourable member for Fadden has given some clear examples why they are. The Government is examining other options by which we can move to provide equitable compensation. While that is happening, it is essential at least to move to this point. So I ask members of the Opposition to reconsider their position. While they are certainly within the realms of acting responsibly as an opposition by saying, 'Yes, we will support passage of this Bill but we want to see what these options are and we want to fast-track the further improvements', I do not think it is responsible to oppose the Bill, which is at least trying to take us halfway there. So I ask members of the Opposition to reconsider their intention to oppose the legislation. This is a very difficult area. It is clear to us the all that the international Protocol that has worked has now fallen a long way behind the sorts of levels that the courts are likely to find in any of the Western countries, in particular in terms of liability and damages claims that arise. While the honourable member for Fadden was speaking, I was wondering what would be the situation with privatised airlines. Would they be bound by some kind of national protocol? I noticed that the honourable member for Fadden cited the example of Thai Airways International Ltd, which applies now a higher level, and I think he suggested that British Airways now voluntarily applies a higher level. That is one track that we could go down; we could suggest to our own carriers that they give thought to providing voluntarily a higher level to match the actions of those other airlines which have taken the view that, while their countries continue to honour the Protocol and remain part of the international aviation agreement, they will provide voluntarily higher levels, which is what I understand has happened. Maybe there is a case in particular for our national carrier, Qantas Airways Ltd, to do that. It is not a case where a government would give direction unless the Government had a stake as the principal shareholder. Of course, that takes me to the question of how this would be dealt with under the Opposition's proposal to fully sell Qantas. Mr Jull-It's a country-country basis, not an airline-airline basis.",127
223,Mr OKEEFE,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"I am not sure that it is. Certainly, countries form part of the international agreement, but I am not sure that a fully privati sed airline that is no longer classified as the national carrier can be required by the government of the day to take one decision or another. As the honourable member for Fadden has a deep concern about this matter, he may give consideration to the Government's position of maintaining a 51 per cent stake in Qantas, which provides for us to be the principal shareholder and to give direction on these matters. That might be the wisest course of action to take. While we are speaking on aviation matters, might I transgress a little further and make mention of an article that I am sure the honourable member for Fadden will be thrilled to hear about. Funnily enough, this article appeared in the railways magazine this week. It said that an agreement has been formed between the Victorian Government and the FAC at Melbourne to provide a rapid transit link, a high-speed train, from Tullamarine airport to the central business district. Hopefully, they will be able to form a common liability approach to have a compensation package in case there are any problems. The honourable member for Fadden and I have had a number of discussions about the ways that airports, as commercial operations in Australia, can become much more commercially viable and much more competitive in these days of modem travel. I am sure that he will be pleased, as I am, to know that these thoughts are on the way. I do concede that I had to read about this in a railways magazine. I take this opportunity to mention this matter to the House as Tullamarine airport is on the boundary of my electorate and I have had a long standing interest in seeing the development of the airport. I am thrilled to see this announcement, because it does move us a little more sensibly away from the discussion about who should own the airport to where the money should be spent to develop and upgrade the facilities that get tourists and other users in and out of the airport and to the areas or the activities they want to participate in as quickly and efficiently as possible with modem, fast and efficient transport. That was a little digression, but I thought it was appropriate that I take this opportunity to mention that matter. It is the first chance I have had since I read this article to mention to the Parliament that some quite exciting developments are under way at Tullamarine airport. To summarise my position, I heard very well what the honourable member for Fadden had to say about this legislation. I think that there is much logic in his position that these passenger compensation levels are still-even with the proposed amendments-behind the kinds of levels that a court would apply in normal situations. We all need to do as much as we can to find the solution. I agree that the Australian Government should not sit around waiting for the US Senate to make a decision on this issue. We have to find our own ways to provide the means by which the liability levels can be increased. I ask the Opposition to reconsider its position of opposing passage of the Bill so that we can find ways by which we might increase the levels even higher than those which are proposed in the Bill. We owe it to the travelling public, to the consumers of these services, to provide the maximum possible potential coverage that is pem1issible in line with our current international agreements. We should do that straight away and then we should work towards getting to stage three, which is the bigger and better proposal that the honourable member for Fadden is looking towards. Having said those things, I commend the legislation to the House and I ask the Opposition to reconsider 2500 its announced stance, which is to oppose the Bill.",128
224,Mr SNOWDON,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"Northern TerritoryParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications) (10.00 p.m.) - in reply-I thank the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull)-not necessarily because he is opposing the legislation; in fact, quite the opposite-and the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) for their contributions. I appreciate what the honourable member for Fadden is saying but I think it is important that we understand what this Bill is all about. While I appreciate that the honourable member for Fadden may have a good grasp of the technical aspects of this legislation, I think it is worthwhile, given the position which has been adopted by the Opposition, that we appreciate the Government's intention in this matter. I think we need to understand that we have a responsibility to provide a liability regime which is equitable for Australian consumers. This is of fundamental importance. At the same time, we need to provide clear guidance for Australian courts in regard to the conversion of gold francs to national currency. We also need to assist in developing international consensus on the uniformity and stability of the Warsaw system liability regime. Under Australia's current liability regime both consumers and carriers face considerable uncertainty in the settling of claims. Consumers must either accept the level of damages currently offered by the airlines, hoping that a court judgment will convert the gold francs using the market price of gold, or embark on expensive litigation in an attempt to break the limits by proving wilful misconduct. We should understand that, whilst essentially this appears to be a no fault liability system, based as it is on the Warsaw Protocol of 1929, the Hague Protocol of 1955 and the Montreal Protocols Nos 3 and 4 of 1975, the limits are not unbreakable. One can go beyond the very meagre limits of the Warsaw Protocol-and as they were established in 1929 we can understand why they are pretty small-if wilful misconduct can be demonstrated. That is also the case in terms of the Hague Convention if one can REPRESENTATIVES Wednesday, 6 November 1991 prove either intent to damage or recklessly knowing that damage would occur. The provisions of the Hague and the Warsaw Conventions apply to the Montreal Protocols. So they are not totally no liability conventions. There are some instances in which limits can be raised. Clearly, such claims are difficult to assert. Mr Jull-Very expensive, too.",129
225,Mr SNOWDON,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"As the honourable member says, they would be very expensive. But we all know that any litigation is expensive and that someone must pay. The beauty of this sort of system, despite its many problems because of what we would all agree are low levels of compensation, is that it is certain. There is no certainty if these conventions do not apply. I make the observation that these conventions apply to the carriers. They do not apply to the company that built the aircraft unless that company happens to be the carrier. In any event, there is nothing to stop a person litigating against the manufacturers of the aircraft. So if there is some sort of malfunction in an aircraft because of neglect by the manufacturer-and in a sense this is outside of these conventions-the conventions would cover such a situation by virtue of the fact that the airlines were the property of the carrier. In any event, the point needs to be made that, where these conventions do not apply, there is no doubt that it is difficult to claim compensation and that it would be a very expensive exercise. I think we also need to understand that it is not as though the Government has just decided that we ought to introduce these things, as the honourable member for Fadden well knows. A draft discussion paper covering the background of this matter, the relevant issues and some options open to the Government to resolve the problems with the current regime was circulated as far back as April 1990. That was given to all interested parties for comment. A background paper, based on this discussion paper, reflecting the views and suggestions of the parties consulted, was included when Cabinet considered the matter. Responses to the draft discussion paper indicated fairly wide support from industry, and certainly from the Attorney-General's Department, for immediate ratification of Montreal Protocol Nos 3 and 4, and a number of responses favoured some kind of legislative fixing of the gold franc in Australian dollars. The 100,000 SDR level is still relatively low when compared with compensation which could be obtained from non-airline accident claims. One solution to this problem is to approach the airlines, travel agents and insurers to better inform the passengers of the insurance options already available to them. Another approach is to evaluate the possibility of establishing a supplementary compensation plan-perhaps similar to the one being considered by the US Senate-which gives the last official price of gold at approximately $A28,OOO. It is The Hague limit which applies to most of the carriage to and from Australia. The system functioned well until the official price of gold was abandoned in 1973. Since then, there has been uncertainty as to the Australian currency equivalent to the gold franc limits, with judicial interpretation varying between the last official price of gold and the free market price. The market price fluctuates widely, and currently 250,000 gold francs is worth about $A212,000. At the market price of $350 per ounce, that is a reduction of nearly $60,000 since February 1990. If we are using gold as the standard, the market does fluctuate. The fact of the matter is that there will be absolute certainty when this Convention comes into force. As the honourable member for Fadden indicated, in the SS Pharmaceuticals case, Chief Justice Rogers of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, in delivering his verdict of recklessness against Qantas-thereby breaking The Hague limits-discussed the conversion of the Poincare gold franc. He considered that the last official price of gold was not an appropriate nexus for the article 22 limitation. However, in deciding that the only means of conversion was to use the market price of gold, Chief Justice Rogers admitted that this solution was unsatisfactory because of its instability. He did not consider it to be the most appropriate means of conversion, as I understood was suggested by the honourable member for Fadden. He considered that he had no sanction to convert the gold franc to SDRs, but saw the SDR solution as the most satisfactory alternative to what had occurred previously. Finally, the judge exhorted the Australian Government to legislate to fix the Australian dollar equivalent of the gold franc. Chief Justice Rogers's decision on breaking the limits was upheld by the New South Wales Court of Appeal. However, his views on this conversion of the Poincare gold franc were not subject to appeal. International efforts were made in 1975 to remove the uncertainty associated with the conversion of the gold franc and to raise liability limits to more acceptable levels. Four Montreal Protocols were drawn up which, if adhered to, would substitute the IMF's special drawing right for the gold franc and the Warsaw Convention system. Montreal Protocol No.3 sets the passenger death and injury limit at 100,000 SDR, which, as the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) said, is approximately equivalent to $180,000. Montreal Protocol No.4 introduces modem cargo handling terminology. Australia, together with a number of other major countries, such as the US and Japan, has not ratified the protocols, and they have not entered into force for any country. Renewed efforts are being made by the airlines and the international civil aviation organisations to bring about the entry into force of Montreal Protocols Nos 3 and 4. Australia is responding to this call by ratifying these Protocols as soon as possible. It is our understanding that the United States Senate is currently considering a supplemental compensation scheme called the S-Plan which, if accepted, will signal US ratification of Montreal Protocols Nos 3 and 4. It is also our understanding that this ratification may give consumers access to higher compensation. But it does not increase the carriers' liability limits beyond those specified by international convention. International carriers to which carriage of the convention applies will benefit from the resulting stability of the liability regime and certainty covering damage settlements. I think those aspects are very important. It provides stability and certainty. I have emphasised that a couple of times this evening, and whilst I and the Government appreciate that, in a sense, these compensation limits are low, there are benefits. I would suggest to the Opposition that it should look at the benefits that would accrue to us and support this legislation. Internationally, it has been estimated that the total expenditure by airlines on insurance premiums varies between 0.2 and 0.4 per cent of total operating costs. Any increase in carriage insurance premiums is therefore expected to be minor. Mr Jull-Peanuts.",129
226,Mr SNOWDON,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"Exactly-peanuts. In addition, the Bill has been seen by a wide range of interested parties-including the airlines, insurance companies, the legal profession and consumer organisations-and no adverse comment has been received. I understand that there has been speculation about the situation that applies in Italy. We have legal advice that the Italian law is contrary to international law and that it would not be acceptable in Australia. Also, the UK situation relates to UK carriers only. It is thus no different from what is being proposed in this legislation. I go again to this matter of the level of these limits. The Government accepts that the limit is low-I need to emphasise that-but it reflects international consensus. For this reason, the Government has begun an examination of policy options that may be open to it to increase the amount of compensation for death or injury for passengers on international flights. Montreal Protocol No.3 permits the establishment of a supplemental compensation scheme, provided that it neither increases the carriers' liability limit nor imposes costs on the airlines, with the exception of those associated with collecting payment from passengers for the scheme. This is one of the policy options to be examined. In conclusion, the Bill amends the Act to convert the Poincare gold franc limits of the Warsaw Convention and the Hague Protocol to Australian dollars through the medium of International Monetary Fund special drawing rights. The alternative approach would have been to convert the liability limits by reference to the market price of gold. I emphasise that the Government is advised that there are good legal reasons for pursuing the current amendments to the Act. Firstly, the Bill establishes certainty-I emphasise that-by providing a clear basis for the conversion of the Poincare gold franc which was not there before. Secondly, as alluded to in the second reading speech, conversion using the SDR is consistent with Australia's international obligations. I am advised that to legislate to convert the gold franc limits by using the current market price of gold would be contrary to these obligations. As the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) said in his statement on this matter last year, the Government considers that the passage of limits in the Warsaw Convention and The Hague Protocols are unrealistically low by today's standards. It is something which we all acknowledge and, I would believe, all agree upon. Following the Government's decision, the airlines operating to and from Australia were advised of the Government's decision by the Department of Transport and Communications and were encouraged to voluntarily increase their passenger limits to 100,000 SDR. As I understand it, 14 airlines, including Qantas, to date have adopted the 100,000 SDR limit voluntarily. While this is encouraging, the Government, in order to address the problem of low liability limits, will continue to seek voluntary acceptance of the Montreal Protocol's 100,000 SDR passenger limit by those airlines which have not already done so. In addition to those airlines which have adopted the SDR limit, the airlines engaged in carriage between Australia and the United States are bound by a passenger limit of $US75,000 or $US58,000 without legal fees. Finally, as mentioned in the second reading speech, the Government is examining other options to provide equitable compensation of international airline passengers which will not affect the carriers' liability limits as fixed by international convention. As I mentioned earlier, this includes an examination of the feasibility of the supplementary compensation scheme which is perhaps similar, as I said, to the one under consideration in the United States. I have outlined in quite some detail the rationale behind the intent of this legislation. I again suggest that, whilst I and the Government accept that the limits are low from our perspective, they are the international standard. It does provide certainty and we believe that, in that context, they ought to be supported. I hope that the Opposition will reconsider its position and see its way clear to support this legislation.

Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Snowdon) read a third time. NA Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Sullivan)-Order! It being approximately 10.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Solicitor-General",131
227,Mr ANDREWS,ADJOURNMENT,"Menzies) (10.29 p.m.)The Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) confinned in Question Time today that the Commonwealth Solicitor-General, Dr Gavan Griffith, QC, will take 12 months paid leave from his position to resume practice at the Bar in Melbourne and Sydney. In the course of his answer to a question the Attorney-General said that Dr Griffith is entitled in the circumstances to practise as a barrister whilst on leave from his position. He said further that Dr Griffith had sought and had been granted approval to return to private practice whilst on leave next year. Section 9 of the Law Officers Act provides: Except in the performance of the duties of his office or with the consent of the Attorney-General, the Solicitor-General shall not engage in the practice of a barrister or solicitor or engage employment. Clearly, the Act provides for, and enables, the Attorney-General to allow the Solicitor-General to practise as a barrister. However, the spirit of the provision may be said to be reflected in the draftsman's heading to section 9, which states: Solicitor-General not to undertake other work As a matter of public policy there must be considerable doubt about the wisdom of the Attorney-General's decision. The fact that the Solicitor-General of the Commonwealth is the second legal officer of this nation is reflected in the second reading speech of the Bill which introduced the provision for the Solicitor-General in 1964. The then Attorney-General, Mr Snedden, in introducing the legislation for the reconstitution of the office of Solicitor-General said: The Solicitor-General will be appointed from among counsel practising at the Bar. He will retain the independence of counsel, because, although he will only have one client, he will during the term of his appointment, be assured of security of tenure. He will, of course, be eligible for appointment to the bench, and both England and Australia have ample precedent for the appointment of a Solicitor General to judicial office. The term of a Solicitor General's appointment is to be a fixed term, not exceeding seven years, but he is to be eligible for re-appointment. The Government's intention is that his salary be the same as that of the first line of permanent heads, that is to say, the same as the Secretary to the Attorney-General's Department. His pension rights are to be the same as those of a judge under the Judges Pensions Act. The Bill provides for some financial compensation in the event that he is not re-appointed at the end of his term and has to re-establish himself in private practice before he has qualified for pension. This is what the Attorney-General said in 1964: In this way the Bill gives proper security to the Solicitor-General who will give up a greater income in private practice to become a non-political officer, outside the Public Service, serving different governments in succession. It is notable that the government of the day appreciated that the Solicitor-General would give up a greater income available to him if he were in private practice. The point was made again in 1968 by the then Leader of the in paid Opposition, Mr Whitlam. In a cognate debate about judges' pensions and about the Solicitor-General, he said: ... a judge in service, in general, enjoys a lower income than a barrister in practice. Previous governments have, up until this stage, sought to compensate the Solicitor General by providing generous pension arrangements in the legislation. The office of Solicitor-General is an important public office in this nation. It is not merely an office such as that of a senior public servant. It attracts a retirement package equivalent to senior public servants. It is entirely inappropriate for the Solicitor General to return to private practice knowing, as he undoubtedly does, the details of the legal affairs of the Commonwealth and then, after a year, to come back in service of the Commonwealth as Solicitor-General. The only reason that has been given is the desire of the Solicitor-General to earn more income. Dr Griffith presumably accepted his appointment knowing what the salary package and the pension entitlements were, and it is simply not appropriate for him to take this course of action which the Attorney-General is now taking. There are currently a number of inquiries in this nation into legal costs and criticisms of fees charged by barristers, particularly Queens Counsel, often from members of this Government. Let us not hear any more tales about high legal fees when this double standard is being applied. (TIme expired) Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Sullivan)-Before I call the next speaker, I appeal to members to be a little more courteous to the person on his feet. There were several times during the speech by the honourable member for Menzies when the level of conversation was quite intrusive. If I had stopped him speaking to ask members to be quiet, he would have lost his speaking time. That is why I did not call the House to order. Radio Broadcasting",133
228,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,ADJOURNMENT,"I want to make a few remarks on three elements of broadcasting. The first element is the performance of an AM radio station in Perth called radio 6BR. In the light of current economic difficulties facing radio stations in Australia, this radio station has performed quite outstandingly. I wish to give due recognition to the managing director of radio 6BR, Miss Cherie Gardiner, who has managed to put the radio station in the black at a time when many other radio stations are not functioning. I would also like to pay particular tribute the people who recently received recognition for their work on radio in Perth: Mr Howard Sattler, Mr Bob Maumill and Mr Graham Maybury. They provide very relevant and lively talk-back segments. I am sure that many of my colleagues in this place have been interviewed by them at various times and they have maintained their objectivity and thoroughness. The second element of broadcasting that I want to talk about concerns the coverage by the ABC of the recently completed Rugby Union World Cup. In doing so, I am sure I speak for all my colleagues in paying due recognition to the Australian rugby team, the Wallabies, for their extraordinary achievement and for showing that great teamwork and good coaching can certainly pay off in a variety of circumstances. I am sure that I reflect the views of my colleagues. We do need to recognise the way in which they promote Australia, and I am sure that many people felt very proud about that. I think the ABC did a great job in its television coverage. Mr Downer-It was on too late at night.",134
229,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,ADJOURNMENT,"It was late at night, and many of us did pay the price the next day. The point I reflect on is that the ABC, given its economic circumstances, is not always able to compete in this market, which raises the question of the adequacy of the ABC in terms of its funding. It would seem to me that the model we might perhaps need to address is the model that SBS adopted for the coverage of World Cup soccer, that is, to allow a limited form of sponsorship to enable the ABC to bid for major rights of that kind. It does not interfere with the major programming. I believe that, if we were to quarantine that form of sponsorship to sport and leave it out of public affairs and news, the ABC would not be compromised, and I believe that the ABC can do the job. Certainly, if we look at the current coverage of sport by the ABC, we can see that it has cut back on its coverage of sport and that is to be regretted. The program Grandstand is an excellent program, but it certainly does not to provide the complete coverage of sport that the ABC used to be able to do. It may be that some form of limited sponsorship is the answer. The final point that I make concerns Radio Australia. In the coverage of Radio Australia in the Asian region, it does exceptionally well. However, its coverage in Europe is quite inadequate. One of the issues that will be addressed next week-and I refer to my colleagues opposite-is this question of Radio Australia serving the European market. I believe that to do that it needs to improve its transmitter power, and certainly it needs to direct some more of its programs there, because Australia is not well enough known in what is our second largest export market. Prime Minister",134
230,Mr HOWARD,ADJOURNMENT,"Bennelong) (10.37 p.m.)First of all, I would like to associate myself very much with the remarks of the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards) not only about the outstanding achievement of the Wallabies but also about the outstanding coverage of the rugby by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. However, I have risen unusually in the adjournment debate tonight because of the extraordinary performance of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in Question Time today, when he displayed a remarkable sensitivity to the mangling of the Queen's English. I do not think there has been a man in public life who has been more guilty of mangling the Queen's English than the current Prime Minister of Australia. When he took exception to a fairly unusual word used by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) during Question Time today, I was reminded of one of the more memorable tautologies and circumlocutions of the Prime Minister in his days as President of the ACTU. I understand that this holds something close to an Australia record for a 148-word sentence. I thought I would share that sentence with the House. The reason I particularly want to share it with the House is that it related to the best known Australian industrial relations case, the famous case of Moore v. Doyle, which was all about the question of relationships between Federal and State registration of unions. This is what the Prime Minister, then President of the ACTU, had to say, and it really is a memorable sentence: Essentially what happened in Moore and Doyle, which most of you will remember arose in the respect of the Transport Workers' Union in NSW, you had the situation where because unions are federally registered and also in their State branches they are registered under the State legislation, you had the provision where a union had been going on for a long time where its State branch of the federal union is purported to operate, as also the union in the State under the State legislation, but because of the provisions of the federal constitution interpreted to mean that owner drivers could not be members of a federally registered union, you had then the position and where it's been going on for very many years, the assumption of the State branch of the federal union operating there in that State, also being the same thing identically as the union operating under State legislation was held not to be valid. All I can say is that I do not think he had been 'deputated' to speak the Queen's English on that occasion! Solicitor-General-Aboriginal Children",135
231,Mr CAMPBELL,ADJOURNMENT,"Tonight I want to speak about what I consider to be an outrageous abuse of power. Before I do, I wish to say a few words on an outrageous abuse of reason that we just heard from the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews). Such sanctimonious hyperbole as we heard from the honourable member for Menzies can come only from the legal profession or from the social workers who plague this country. I believe that a person on his holidays has every right to do whatever he damn well wants, and if he wants to go fishingMr Downer-Fifty-two weeks holiday?",135
232,Mr CAMPBELL,ADJOURNMENT,"The reality is that he is being paid no matter what he does because he has a legal entitlement to his holidays-unless it is the policy of the Liberal Party now to stop holiday pay. Had the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) decided to go to Hawaii, causing a drain on the current account, the Opposition would probably have applauded it. At his own expense-at no expense to the public pursehe is going out to sharpen and hone his skills to use for the benefit of the Commonwealth. I was ashamed to be in the Parliament today when the catty question was asked by the honourable member for wherever he comes from. The speech of the honourable member for Menzies today simply compounds it. I believe that it was the contribution of a fool. Mr MCGauran-Withdraw!",135
233,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member for Kalgoorlie might use less inflammatory language than he is using.,135
234,Mr CAMPBELL,ADJOURNMENT,"I was merely going to say, Mr Speaker, that he can probably be excused in the fact that he has the face of a fool. Mr SfEAKER - The honourable member for KalgOorlie might not compound the matter.",135
235,Mr HOWARD,ADJOURNMENT,"On a point of order, Mr Speaker: that does require a flat withdrawal. That is unacceptable language.",136
236,Mr CAMPBELL,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Speaker, I crave your indulgence. In the name of clarity of the Queen's English, what is a flat withdrawal?",136
237,Mr HOWARD,ADJOURNMENT,"Are you going to rule on the point of order, Mr Speaker?",136
238,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! Well, it is",136
239,Mr HOWARD,ADJOURNMENT,"I take the point of order, Mr Speaker, that the expression used by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie in relation to the honourable member for Menzies was unparliamentary, and you should ask him to withdraw it.",136
240,Mr CAMPBELL,ADJOURNMENT,"To save any trouble, I will give the honourable member for Bennelong a flat withdrawal. Mr Downer interjecting",136
241,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"If the honourable member for Mayo continues to interject, I will give him an early night. He should not get carried away with the hyperbole of the honourable member for Bennelong; he is good at this.",136
242,Mr CAMPBELL,ADJOURNMENT,"Absolutely. In the town of Newman in Western Australia we have women who have heartS as big as Ayers Rock and heads about as thick. They have been prepared to take Aboriginal kids and nurse them-Aboriginal kids who are often very sick and whom no-one wants. These women take them and nurse them. We have a situation in which a particular woman was deemed by the Department of Community Services to be an unfit mother. Her children were taken and pl,ced with white foster parents. Some 12 months later along comes the Department and says, 'We are now going to take these kids'-aged about 14 months and just over two years-' and put them in an Aboriginal community'. This is an Aboriginal community with which they have no affinity whatsoever, an Aboriginal community where standards are absolutely appalling. It is an indictment of the State Government that they are, because those conditions have not improved in my knowledge of the place. The Minister for Community Services in Western Australia, despite all the advice he has had to the contrary from a large section of the Aboriginal community, despite pleas from the Aboriginal mother, despite pleas from the grandparents of the children and despite pleas from the father of one of the children-himself part-Aboriginal-decided that he will follow the advice of his social workers and send the children back to Newman. He said to me quite bluntly, 'I've been told that they will probably be sick for six months, but they'll adjust to a lower plane of health'. A lower plane of health exists in this community, a community where hepatitis B is endemic and where lots of other unsavoury diseases are rampant, and where kids get very little high school education because there is no policy which forces them to attend school. This is the policy which will condemn these children to a very short life. The history of this community is such that by 12 years of age, if these kids are still alive, they will be pregnant. They are all female children, I might add. I believe that the Minister has acted in the most outrageous way. I am sorry I wasted so much time on the honourable member for Menzies, because there is so much more I would have liked to say on this very outrageous abuse of power by Eric Ripper, the Minister for Community Services in Western Australia. Organochlorin Chemicals",136
243,Mr MACK,ADJOURNMENT,"North Sydney) (10.45 p.m.)Tomorrow I will be presenting to the House a petition by over 40,000 Australians calling for a ban on the use of organochlorin chemicals. It is unconscionable that the Federal Government is failing to protect the Australian people and their environment from the dangers of organochlorin pesticides. The organochlorin pesticides aldrin, dieldrin, chlordane and heptachlor are banned in many countries and have been withdrawn from agricultural use in Australia because of their danger to health and the environment. In the United States, all uses of aldrin and dieldrin have been banned since 1971 owing to concern that they are cancer causing. The United States producer of chlordane and heptachlor, Velsicol, stopped using these chemicals in its United States products in 1988, and existing stocks were restricted to use in fire ant control in power transformers. However, in Australia every working day an organochlorin chemical is sprayed in the under-floor area of homes to control termites. It then evaporates, enveloping the home for months in a toxic miasma with unknown consequences for the family living there. Others at risk are the workers who manufacture, handle and transport these chemicals, and tradesman who come into contact with contaminated surfaces. Run-off from contaminated soils poisons creeks, rivers and estuaries. Organochlorins are nerve poisons which interfere with the membranes of nerve cells and disrupt vital functions. Acute poisoning by organochlorins can cause death. In less serious exposures, organochlorins can lodge in the nervous system and the membranes of every cell in the body but especially the tissues of the brain and liver. They are extremely difficult for the body to excrete and are blamed for chronic health problems, including disorders of the reproductive system, blood disorders, diseases of the liver, kidney and gastro-intestinal tract, respiratory irritations and, according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council, probably cancer as well. Indeed, the substance propylene oxide, which is mixed with heptachlor and chlordane to increase their shelf life, is a known carcinogen. Studies have shown that workers associated with the manufacture or application of chlordane have an increased risk of stroke, leukemia and cancers of the lung and brain. For females, the body's most efficient means of elimination of organochlorin toxins is through breast milk, making these pesticides an insidious threat to Australian children. Organochlorins are very persistent, ing active for up to 30 years in soil and for up to 10 years in living tissue. Organochlorins also bio-accumulate up the food chain. This means they increase in concentration every time a contaminated organism is eaten, with the final consumer contaminated at a level that may be thousands of times higher than the original concentration in the soil. The dangers of organochlorin pesticides have led 30 countries to ban dieldrin and 26 to ban aldrin, whilst 22 have banned chlordane and 20 have banned heptachlor. Many other countries have severely restricted the use of these chemicals. Countries in which their use is completely banned include tropical countries with termite problems. Yet in Australia, even though their use in agriculture is banned, organochlorin chemicals are used to control termites around the home. What is prohibited On public health grounds in countries as varied as the USA, Sweden, Switzerland, Singapore, Bolivia, Ecuador, Guatemala and Turkey is permitted in Australia. Continued use of organochlorins in Australia might be understandable if there were no other methods of controlling termites. But alternatives do exist. Non-chemical means can be used, such as placing physical barriers between the structure and the soil and by providing light and air access to under-floor areas to eliminate the dark and humid conditions which termites require. Knowledge of the biology, behaviour and ecology of termites can be applied to locate and destroy their nests. One reason why these alternatives have not replaced organochlorin chemicals may be that the Australian standard for termite control fails to promote them. This might have something to do with the fact that responsibility for devising the standard is with a subcommittee of the Chemical Standards Committee, which includes six chemical industry representatives, including the Australian representative for Velsicol, the US Company which manufactures heptachlor and chlordane products. When Shell withdraws aldrin from the market at the end of this year, Velsicol will have a monopoly of the organochlorin termite control market in Australia. This is a market that is prohibited remain- to Velsicol in the USA. Attacks on Women and Girls",136
244,Mr GIBSON,ADJOURNMENT,"A few weeks ago, a 69-year-old woman living alone in a house in Greenslopes, a few streets away from my electorate office, was murdered in her home during a robbery. This was the latest in a series of callous attacks on women and girls that has plagued the community of Queensland this year and for many years. Soon after the reports of this murder, received in my electorate office a letter from a woman which makes a very strong, heartWill felt plea for consideration and action by members of parliament at both the State and Federal level. I would like to read sections of that letter because I think it tells the story better than I could. It is addressed to me, and for it says: On Wednesday 16th October another little girl was callously murdered at the hands of a male person who was unable to control his sexual needs. Just another in the long list of females who have been raped, abused, murdered, disposed of by men who have no self control. Just another disposable person, just another victim. A 12 year old girl on her way to school, a small girl on her way to the shops for her mother, an 8 year old on her way to school, a young woman who's car broke down, a young woman who had a flat tyre, a young woman who ran out of petrol. Not sexually provocative, not 'asking for it', just young girls going about their business. Left behind are grief stricken families, mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters for whom life will never be the same. Gone are young lives so full of promise, so full of dreams, hopes, expectations . . . all snuffed out at the hands of men who are unable to deny themselves anything. Elderly women are bashed, murdered in their own homes for a few meagre dollars, small girls are raped and killed on their way to school, young women are attacked and disappear after their cars break down, never to be seen of again. Where are they, what has happened?? These are the disposable people ... once the ink has dried on the news print they are forgotten like yesterday's fish and chips. Even if their killers are found and prosecuted, they are released within a couple of years and let back into the main stream of society, rehabilitated, so the experts say, and to strike yet again ... Who is going to stand up for the disposable people?? Who is going to say enough for the helpless women, the tragic children brutalised almost on a daily basis in our society. The very society where the head of police advises women not to venture out alone at night, where the elderly are advised to make their homes fortresses to keep out the marauders. Why do we have to stay off the streets?? Why are our children unable to walk to and from school or to the shops in safety? Why are we not safe even within our own homes??? When is someone going to say enough and take responsibility for the victims??? When are the do-gooders going to cry and wring their hands over victims rights . . . Women, young girls, the elderly, small children, I male or female are not kleenex tissues to be disposed of at will . . . Will you as one of our elected representatives stand up for the victims? you help by saying to the Parliament, the media and the general public ... Enough, no more killing of our women? Will you help by introducing laws that will stop these animals and the senseless far slaughter? Will you help review our justice system where there is no justice for the victims, no justice the law abiding and the innocent, yet where the criminals are treated with kid gloves with every regard for their well being. This has to be changed. How would you react if the next victim was your daughter, your mother, your wife, your sister, yourself? I am the mother of a 12 year old girl who walks to school. I fear for her life. I fear for the life of my aged mother who lives alone. I fear for my safety when I have to go out of an evening by myself. Why have the animals been allowed to take over the world? Why are they the overlords . . . leaving us the majority of the population, fearful for our safety and lives. The letter was written by a lady by the name of Kaye Harcourt from Ascot. I think she sums up very much a major responsibility that we do have in our community. Camperdown Abattoir",137
245,Mr MCARTHUR,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to draw the attention of the House to the dispute at the Camperdown abattoir, in western Victoria in the electorate of Corangamite. This dispute, which has received nationwide attention, focuses on the rule of law, productivity, the role of the unions, the awards and the centralised wage fixing system. The passionate debate put forward today, with the Opposition being ably led by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), and the situation in terms of free the new era of industrial relations that will be introduced under the Hewson Government are related to the problems we have at the Camperdown abattoir. In September, the farmers rallied at Camperdown to support the new arrangements whereby there would be contract workers and the abattoirs would be open to process animals on behalf of all those stricken farmers in western Victoria. They were sick and tired of the high processing costs and the featherbedding that all too often had taken place in abattoirs throughout Victoria. The sad story of the export abattoirs in Victoria is very clearly demonstrated by the figures. In the 1970s, there were 20 export abattoirs in Victoria. In 1991 there are only eight left. In 1975 there were 7.8 million sheep and lambs processed; in 1990, 2.3 million were processed. Likewise, 2.3 million cattle were processed in 1975, and only 713,000 cattle have been processed in 1991a downward trend in every aspect. Who was the architect of this downward trend? It was our great friend Wally Curran, the secretary of the AMIEU.",138
246,Mr HOWARD,ADJOURNMENT,Who is his greatest mate?,139
247,Mr MCARTHUR,ADJOURNMENT,"The membership of that union was down, the processing works were down in numbers and, of course, the number of jobs were down. As the honourable member for Bennelong asks, who is his new-found friend? He had the audacity to support the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) in his desire for a new job and to get more jobs in Australia, yet his own track record is disastrous. The Camperdown abattoir itself has had a very bad industrial relations record. It has had six owners in the last 10 years. One of the reasons for that background is the very poor performance of the work force at that abattoir. Obviously there needed to be a dramatic change of attitude and approach to make the abattoir profitable. The new management brought in contract workers. It created new jobs and was making it possible for the abattoir to return to profitability. Troubleshooters Incorporated was asked to do a job there and introduce some new contract workers, working at an hourly rate of $14 per hour, with the objective of raising productivity, improving output and overhauling the outdated tally system which has been a great problem in the meat industry. In the process it was hoped that the processing costs would be reduced, that the workers would be better off, that the abattoir would return to profitability and that the farmers would have their processing costs reduced in the whole process. During this whole dispute AMIEU members wanted to protect their non-existent jobs. They were not even working at these abattoirs but they went out on the pickets to protect the jobs they did not have. They wanted to protect outdated awards and work practices. They wanted to protect a security of tenure that was dominated by the unions-if they had a job in the meat works, they were entitled to maintain that job because of the intimidation and pressure tactics of Wally Curran's union. They wanted to maintain the tally system, which has one or two virtues but has a lot of imperfections in the way in which it operates. There were no productivity increases possible under the tally system and, of course, the hours of work are ludicrous. They start at half past seven, knock off at about 12 and really do not complete an eight-hour day. The picketers at Camperdown were really sticking to the cause of the historic position of them and us. They wanted to maintain the award, no matter what. Twenty or 30 picketers have remained at the site over the last two or three months and to keep the works operating we have had to have between 20 and 80 policemen on site just to maintain the right to work. These contractors had to move to the work site in a closed-in van with police protection. All this was to allow people to maintain their right to work.",139

(2) Did he approve of the award of honorary Companion of the Order of Australia to the President of Turkey, Mr Turgut Ozal. (3) Does Australia support UN (a) General Assembly resolution 3212 calling upon all states to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus and urging the withdrawal of foreign armed forces from that country and (b) Security Council resolution 353 demanding an immediate end to foreign military intervention in the Republic of Cyprus. (4) Is it a fact that Turkey (a) does not respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cyprus, (b) has not withdrawn its armed forces from that country and (c) has not complied with the UN resolutions on Cyprus. (5) On 10 May 1991, did he accept the award of the Shield of Jerusalem from the Zionist Federation of Australia; if so, (a) did the Federation issue a statement before conferring the award which stated that the Shield of Jerusalem is awarded (i) to those who have made a special contribution to Jerusalem since its reunification, (ii) in appreciation of support for Jerusalem as a unified city and (iii) specifically to those who have actively supported a united Jerusalem and (b) what (i) special contribution to Jerusalem since its reunification, (ii) support for Jerusalem as a unified city and (iii) active support for a united Jerusalem has he given and when.

(11) Are the UN resolutions rejecting aggression against Cyprus and Jerusalem less deserving of Australia's support and his observance than the resolutions rejecting aggression against Kuwait.",139
249,Mr HAWKE,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. (2) The Prime Minister of the day considers nominations for honorary awards in the Order of Australia and makes recommendations to the Queen through the Governor General. (3) (a) and (b) Yes. The Government's policy on Cyprus is firmly based on United Nations Security Council Resolutions 353, 541, 550 and 649. Although General Assembly Resolutions have no binding force, Australia voted in favour of General Assembly Resolution 32/12. (4) (a), (b) and (c) Yes. There are competing claims and concerns on both sides. The Turkish Government claims that military intervention was essential to the well-being of Turkish Cypriots. Australia's view is that UN Resolutions on Cyprus should be adhered to, including Security Council Resolution 353 which calls for the withdrawal of foreign troops. The Turkish Government believes itself unable to withdraw its troops from Cyprus at this time, but the Government hopes and expects this issue will be one of the first issues taken up at intercommunal talks. (5) Yes. (a) (i) Yes. (ii) Yes. (iii) Yes. (b) It is for the Zionist Federation of Australia to identify the reasons the Federation chose to present the Prime Minister with the Shield of Jerusalem. But it was made clear to the Zionist Federation of Australia that, in accepting the award, I would not be subscribing to positions on the status of Jerusalem which were contrary to Government policy. (6) No. (7) (a) and (b) Australia abstained from votes on General Assembly Resolutions 2253 and 2254 in July 1967. Since 1973 Australia, under both Australian Labor Party and Coalition governments, has voted in favour of resolutions in the United Nations General Assembly affirming General Assembly Resolutions 2253 and 2254 and criticising Israeli measutes which have tended to change the legal status, demographic composition and geographic nature of the Occupied Territories, including Jerusalem. (8) (a) and (b) As Australia was not on the Security Council when these Resolutions were adopted, Australia did not vote on them. However Australia has voted in favour of General Assembly Resolutions which affIrm these Security Council Resolutions (eg 35/169E of 15 December 1980). (9) As would be expected, I received advice from appropriate sources. However, in accordance with usual practice, I have no intention of providing information on either the nature or source of the advice I received. (10) Yes. (11) No. The Australian Government has consistently supported United Nations Security Council Resolutions 353, 541, 550 and 649, and General Assembly Resolution 32/12 on Cyprus, and United Nations Security Council Resolutions 476 and 478, and General Assembly Resolutions 22/53 and 22/54 on Israel. The Government has given no less support to United Nations Security Council Resolutions on Kuwait. Sheep Shearing (Question No. 862) Mr Campbell asked the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 30 May 1991: (1) Did the research department of the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC) embark on (a) automatic mechanical shearing and (b) biological defleecing programs in 1972; if so, (i) were relevant recommendations of the 1971 CSIRO Study Group on Sheep Shearing and Related Procedures ignored, (ii) what sum derived from wool growers was used to fund the programs and (iii) were the programs successful. (2) Has his attention been drawn to a report in the Cootamundra Herald of 6 November 1972 that 10,000 sheep were successfully shorn on a chain shearing system using the Able Star handpiece and that shearing costs were reduced from 51 cents to less than 20 cents per sheep. (3) Did the AWC fund a project between Sunbeam and the University of New South Wales which involved fitting an eccentric vane air motor to Sunbeam barrels; if so, (a) was the project doomed to failure because of the lack of stall torque and high air consumption and (b) was the project an attempt to duplicate the performance of the Able Star handpiece. (4) Did use of the Able Star hahdpiece offer significant savings in shearing costs and reduced second cuts which were not realised by the project referred to in part (3). (5) Did the AWC refuse to fund further refinement of the Able Star handpiece; if so, why. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Under pre-1986 legislation, the recommendation or advice of the then Australian Wool Board (AWB) and the then Australian Wool Corporation (AWC) was required to enable the Minister to approve funding from the Wool Research Trust Fund (WRTF) for research purposes. Neither the Board nor the AWC embarked on research projects per se. Funding of automated mechanical shearing and biological defleecing from the WRTF did not occur in 1972. The Australian Wool Harvesting Program, financed from the WRTF, did not commence until 1973. At the time, block funding to CSIRO was provided by the WRTF which was disbursed to individual projects generally at the discretion of the CSIRO. Subsequent funding of automated mechanical shearing and biological defleecing within the CSIRO occurred with funds provided by the WRTF. (i) It would be reasonable to assume that as CSIRO had control over the direction of the funding, the recommendations laid down by them in the 1971 Study Group on Sheep Shearing and Related Procedures would have been adhered to. (H) The total expenditure from WRTF to date on the automated mechanical shearing program is around $7 million. About half of this expenditure has been contributed by wool growers and half by the Commonwealth. Due to the CSIRO block funding arrangement, the best estimate available on the amount of research funding to the biological defleecing program is $3-4 million. Again, the above mentioned comments regarding the wool grower contribution to the WRTF projects apply in this case. (iii) The automated mechanical shearing program research phase is expected to be completed by June 1993, after which the collaboration of a commercial business partner will be sought to undertake the development of a field prototype. The success of the project to date is based on the development of a robot which has the capability of shearing the entire fleece off sheep of various breeds and sizes. Currently, manual intervention is required to load and unload sheep from the manipulation platform. The WRTF ceased providing funds for biological defleecing on 30 June 1991. The successful development and production of a synthetic depilatory protein has been undertaken by Coopers Animal Health Australia Ltd (now Pitman-Moore Australia Ltd). The depilatory protein known as epidermal growth factor (EGF) causes the wool fibres to break evenly across the fleece when administered to sheep. Production of synthetic EGF is currently at the pre-commercial stage and Pitman-Moore intends launching the product onto the market in 1994. During the intervening period, both CSIRO and Pitman-Moore aim to complete the development of an optimal fleece retention system. (2) The report in the Cootamundra Herald on 6 November 1972, referred to by the Honourable Member relating to chain shearing on the Bethungra pastoral property of two NSW graziers, made no reference to the type of shearing hand pieces used. The article does not say 10,000 sheep were shorn successfully using the Able Star handpiece. The report does say that the cost of conventional shearing was approximately 50 cents per head whereas the cost of chain shearing was believed to have been reduced to slightly below 20 cents per head. The report also went on to say that... 'final statistics have yet to be worked out on the overall economics of the system and these are not likely to be known for some time'. The system referred to appears to be the chain shearing system per se. As well, the February 1972 Report of the CSIRO Shearing Study Group, referring to the Able Star handpiece stated that... 'it's introduction is not likely to have any significant effect on shearing costs'. The Study Group was aiso aware of the high purchase cost of pneumatic shearing technology, as the report also stated that 'a suitable compressor would normally have to be bought so that, costwise, a pneumatic shearing machine is more expensive than a conventional machine'. (3) The WRTF supported an assessment of pneumatic handpiece technology, which was being conducted in 1975 by the University of NSW (UNSW) in collaboration with Sunbeam. Investigations centred around improving the performance of the rotary vane air motor which had previously been the subject of a study conducted at the University of Sydney in 1962. (a) Use of the rotary vane air motor in the later UNSW study was unsuccessful and thf{ project was abandoned within months. (b) The project was not designed to duplicate the performance of the Able Star handpiece, rather it was designed to research a more cost-effective method of pneumatic shearing. The February 1972 Report of the CSIRO Shearing Study Group, in its assessment of the Able Star handpiece, stated that.,.. 'there is a possibility that a simpler pneumatic motor could be developed... '. (4) The higher initial cost of the Able Star handpiece relative to the cost of a conventional handpiece is noted in (2) above. It is understood that the then AWC was unable to make a comparison of the shearing costs of the Able Star handpiece versus the costs of shearing using Sunbeam handpieces to which vane air motors had been fitted, as the air motors lacked sufficient torque for effective shearing to be performed and further testing was halted. (5) The AWC did not recommend that any further funding from the WRTF for 'refinements' of the Able Star handpiece. The policy of the Wool Harvesting Research Advisory Committee in regard to the further development of commercial products such as the Able Star handpiece, has been that it should be a responsibility of the private sector. Also, it was considered that the extent of acceptance by the wool industry of the Able Star handpiece would determine its success and rate of adoption. Hilton Bombing (Question No. 949) Mr Mack asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 21 June 1991, as part of a series of questions: (13) Were sniffer dogs used; if not, why not?",143
250,Mr DUFFY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"In view of information now available to me, this answer replaces that previously provided to Question 949 (House of Representatives Hansard of Tuesday 8 October, 1991, at pages 1482-1485). My amended answer is as follows: (13) I am advised by the Defence Organisation that 'sniffer dogs were not used before the Hilton bombing, since their use was not requested by the New South Wales police. As noted in the previous answer to question 5(e), the New South Wales police were responsible for security outside the hotel. A Mine Dog Explosive Detection Team, consisting of three dogs, was employed after the Hilton bombing to search for any additional explosive devices. No such devices were found. Honours and Awards (Question No. 1024) Mr Scholes asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 3 September 1991: Further to the answer to question No. 722 (Hansard, 28 May 1991, page 4140), can the Council for the Order of Australia adequately represent the Australian community when 10 of its 19 members are public servants.",145
251,Mr HAWKE,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Constitution of the Order of Australia provides for a Council representative of Australian governments and the Australian community. The Constitution provides for the Chief Justice of the High Court, the Chief of the Defence Force and one public servant to be on the Council. The States and Territories are entitled to nominate their own representatives and the choice of individuals is properly a matter for their governments. Six members of the Council are appointed on the recommendation of the Commonwealth Government. Of these 6, only one is currently a public servant. Christmas Island: Navigation Facilities (Question No. 1037) Mr Jull asked the Minister representing the Minister ,for Shipping and Aviation Support, upon notice, on 4 September 1991: (1) Is the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) committed to installing VORjDMEI navigation facilities at Christmas Island. (2) Were the facilities referred to in part (1) to be installed in February 1991. (3) If the facilities have not been installed, (a) when will they be installed and (b) what is the principal reason for the delay. (4) Has the absence of these facilities resulted in flights from Western Australia to Christmas Island having to proceed via Denpasar in Indonesia. (5) Is the CAA the main contractor responsible for installation of the equipment. Mr - e-leyThe Minister for Shipping and, AVlatton Support has supplied the f0110wrng answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Christmas Island Resorts (CIR) is contractually committed to the Commonwealth of Australia to amongst other things, upgrade the aviation infrastructure on Christmas Island, in order to support regular airline operations to the island associated with CIR's casino development. CIR entered into a contract with the CAA in May 1989 to provide the VOR and DMEI navigation aids element of this. (2) The contract originally specified August 1990 as the formal commissioning date; although, both CIR and the CAA were aiming for an early 1990 target, subject to equipment deliveries. (3) The site civil works were undertaken by CIR approximately 12 months later than the original plan. Subsequently, the CAA installed the equipment and the facilities were operating, but uncalibrated, in February 1991. In the interests of reducing costs, CIR's consultant chose to have the flight calibration of the facilities carried out with the routine six monthly testing of the other navigation aids at Christmas and Cocos Islands and coincidentally, the new VOR and DMEI facilition Cocos Island. It was contractually agreed that the assessment period for the flight tests results would be extended. The VOR/DMEI facilities were commissioned in October 1991. CIR's consultant/contract superintendent has expressed his satisfaction with both the work performed by the CAA and the timing involved. (4) No. (5) Because of the specialised nature of the facilities, the CAA provided most of the design expertise and installation resourcing. However, CIR's consultant carried out the detailed design and contracting for the extensive site works and power reticulation, and also supplied the navigation aid equipments, both to CAA specification and inspection. Australia Post: Losses (Question No, 1054) Mr Cobb asked the Minister for Land Transport, upon notice, on 5 September 1991: Did the management of Australia Post claim in a proposed retail post agreement document lodged with the Australian Postal and Telecommunications Union that retail operations incur losses of the order of $80 million per year; if so, will he provide details of the components of that sum and the areas in which the losses were incurred. Mr Robert Brown-The answer to the honourable member's question, based on advice from Australia Post, is as follows: Yes. The $80 million figure is an estimate, based on comparing the costs of the retail activities, such as postage sales and acceptance of postal articles and agency services for the Commonwealth Bank and Telecom Australia etc. in each postal outlet, with the revenue earned by these activities. For purposes of calculating the revenue, the retail activities are credited with a fee for each transaction, calculated with reference to market rates. The profit or loss so calculated does not reflect the performance of non-retail activities at post offices and post office agencies such as delivery or outward mail processing. The retail loss is spread throughout Australia Post's network with 'official' post offices representing the major part of the loss. The estimated loss in post office agencies has been around $15 million per annum in recent years. Australia Post retail operations incur a loss Australian States. The most recent analysis of the loss in 1988-89 attributed approximately 50 per cent to outlets in the metropolitan/large provincial centres and 50 per cent to outlets in smaller country towns. You may be assured that in addressing the Retail Post losses, Australia Post will ensure that its obligations to make its services accessible to all Australians will continue to be met. Qantas Airways Ltd: Bookings by Members of Parliament (Question No. 1059) Mr Burr asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 9 September 1991: (1) Did the former Special Minister of State, the Hon M.J. Young, issue a directive that all international flight bookings by Members of Parliament be made through Qantas. (2) Has his attention been drawn to the premium pricing policy adopted by Qantas at its Parliament House agency. (3) Is it a fact that the prices quoted by Qantas for (a) an around-the-world economy class ticket is $3200 and (b) a Sydney-Washington economy class, one-way ticket is $2400 whereas the market prices are as low as $1690 and $860, respectively. (4) Is he able to say what rent Qantas pays for its agency in Parliament House. (5) Is the directive referred to in part (1) supported by the Remuneration Tribunal. (6) Will he direct the Minister for Administrative Services to review the requirement for members to book exclusively through Qantas with a view to allowing Members to purchase flight tickets from the travel agents or carriers of their choice; if not, why not.",146
252,Mr HAWKE,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I), (2), (3) and (6) No, in 1986 Mr Young endorsed already existing practices in relation to official overseas travel, including the practice of arranging travel by Parliamentary delegations and official ministerial visits through Qantas. In the case of overseas study travel by senators and members, travel warrants are issued by the Department of Administrative Services only to Qantas, but in all senators and members choosing to purchase their own tickets and seek reimbursement are not restricted to arranging travel exclusively through Qantas. I am aware of, and share, concern on the part of members and senators that when travelling overseas on their official business they should have available to them travel services which provide the best possible value for money taking into account a range of factors including not only price and quality of service, but also importantly, given the nature of much parliamentary travel, considerable flexibility to vary both itinerary and timetable to suit changed requirements. I am sure that Qantas is as aware as its competitors of the need to match the services it provides to the varying needs of its customers. The Minister for Administrative Services will continue to keep arrangements for parliamentary travel\under review. (4) The lease of accommodation by Qantas --th­ in Parliament House is a matter for the Presldmg Officers. . (5) The Remuneration Tribunal does not specify the use of particular airlines. Computer Software and Hardware: Price Comparisons (Question No. 1074) Mr Barry Jones asked the Minister representing the Minister for Industry Technology and Commerce, upon notice, on 12 September 1991: Is the Minister able to say whether the street price of computer software and hardware is much less in New York than it is in Sydney or Melbourne; if so, is the Minister able to (a) provide precise details in tenns of comparative prices for the same items and (b) explain the price differential and the extent to which it is necessary to protect the development of domestic industry. Mr Free-The Minister for Industry Technology and Commerce has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: The Prices Surveillance Authority has expressed its concern about price discrepancies for computer software in Australia compared to overseas, following its receipt of complaints. There has not been a similar suggestion relating to computer hardware. I understand that the Prices Surveillance Authority has conducted a preliminary investigation of computer software prices. In response to point (a), the following comparison from the Prices Surveillance Authority'S Price Probe of March 1991, shows details of comparative prices for selected major software packages in the United States as compared with Australia: Cross Talk IV 315 176 Brooklyn Bridge 184 97 dBase IV 936 583 Paradox 3.0 829 559 Page Maker 3.0 1,307 617 Ventura Publisher 3.0 1,248 755 Word for Windows 528 405 Word Perfect 5.1 562 312 Average Note: All prices in $A. There is no evidence to indicate the differentials have changed substantially since the publication of these prices. In response to point (b), a number of software companies have made public comments indicating that the size of the Australian market and the need to 'localise' products, are both factors affecting Australian retail or 'street' prices. Individual reseller margins are another important factor. The Copyright Act 1988 provides protection for the intellectual property embedded in the software. Section 37 of this Act provides that software imported into Australia for sale or distribution requires the licence of the owner of the copyright, although it now appears that this provision will be tested in Court. This provision may be a further significant factor affecting price, since the Prices Surveillance Authority found this to be the most important factor behind comparatively high book and record prices in Australia. The Copyright Law Review Committee is currently inquiring into Copyright protection of Software. . There are no import duties levied on computer software. Industry policy for computer hardware and software aims to encourage availability of these products at world competitive prices. Development of the domestic computer industry is encouraged by positive measures which fonn part of the Infonnation Industries Strategy. Under this strategy, Australian Infonnation Industries have experienced significant growth, increased R&D and increased exports. The Strategy is based on the premise that the Australian economy requires the supply of computer hardware and software at world competitive prices in order for industry more generally to become internationally competitive. Australian US Multiple Further information on price differentials will need to await the findings of the Copyright Law 1.79 Review Committee and any future inquiries by the 1.89 Prices Surveillance Authority. 1.60 1,48 Victorian Meat Processing Industry 2.12 (Question No. 1085) 1.65 Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Primary 1.30 Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 8 1.80 October 1991: 1.71 (1) Is he able to say how many meatworkers were employed in Victorian (a) domestic and (b) export abattoirs as at (i) 30 June 1981, (ii) 30 June 1986 and (iii) 30 June 1991. (2) How many Victorian (a) sheep and (b) cattle were sent interstate for slaughter in the first six months of 1991. (3) Following the Harrison inquiry, what specific initiatives will be taken by the Government to assist increased employment levels in the Victorian meat processing industry. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No, employment statistics for Victorian abattoirs are not available from the Australian Bureau of Statistics as of the dates required. The Australian Bureau of Statistics does, however, have figures for the Victorian meat industry generally as follows: 1981-10,592 1985-14,467 1987-12,021 1989-6,562 There is no breakdown of these figures between domestic and export processing plants. (2) Neither the Australian Bureau of Statistics nor the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics collect statistics covering the movement of sheep and cattle interstate from Victoria. (3) On handing down his Inquiry into Industrial Relations in the Meat Industry, Commissioner Harrison referred the Report to the Full Bench of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. I understand that the Full Bench will meet to consider the Harrison Report in early November. The Government will not be making a decision on industrial relations initiatives for reform of the meat industry in Australia until after the Full Bench hands down its recommendations on the Harrison Report. (Question No. 1087) Mr Moore asked the Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, upon notice, on 8 October 1991: (1) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the expression of interest by a company in the Philippines in importing powdered milk. (2) Did the company referred to in part (1) approach Austrade in Brisbane seeking assistance in locating potential exporters among several Australian producers; if so, (a) was the approach unsuccessful and (b) did Austrade offer to advertise the export opportunity in a circular; if so, did Austrade provide any further response. (3) What funding did Austrade receive in the 1990-91 Budget. (4) What proportion of the sum referred to in part (3) was directed to the Austrade office in Queensland. (5) How many staff are employed in the Queensland office of Austrade. (6) What service does Austrade provide. (7) Does Austrade offer any special services where export opportunities are involved. (8) What are the latest details available on Australia's balance of trade. Mr Free-The Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) I am informed that a representative of a company in the Philippines first contacted Austrade representatives in Manila in December 1985 seeking information on potential Australian suppliers of powdered milk for export, details of which were provided in January 1986. More recently, Austrade provided on 4 July 1991 contact details of 17 full cream milk powder and 5 buttermilk powder firms to this person, at his request. (2) I am advised that the Brisbane office of Austrade received a telephone call from the same individual referred to in (1), operating from a Queensland address, seeking information on potential suppliers of powdered milk for export. (a) In the course of that conversation, names of Queensland daily companies were provided as possible suppliers but these were not accepted by the inquirer. Austrade (b) Austrade offered to include the export inquiry in its Trade Intelligence Report publication; no further contact has been made by Austrade. (3) $106,058,000 in operating expenses. (4) $1,200,000 (1.13 per cent), covering Austrade offices in both Brisbane and Townsville. (5) There are 18 people employed in Austrade's Brisbane office. (6) Austrade's role is to encourage and increase the international success of Australian business through the provision of high quality export market intelligence, advice and facilitation services, and investment promotion assistance. These services include: Overseas Market Research: This can range from drawing on data already on hand in Austrade covering lists of relevant industry contacts, export market overviews, and specific advice on import regulations through to substantial primary market research covering issues such as the nature of market demand, market size and trends, the competitive environment and identification of appropriate distributors. In-Market Support Direct Services: These are designed to assist clients to be physically able to operate in overseas markets and to enhance the effectiveness of in-market visits by Australian business It can include visitor briefing and arranging visitor programs using Austrade's network of local contacts to improve market access for clients and their products. In-Market Promotion Support: Services designed to assist to promote clients' products in overseas markets by providing display facilities, managing displays and seminars, providing access to targeted media and ensuring appropriate industry attendance at any promotion. Opportunity Capture: This includes the gathering of trade inquiries from overseas companies wanting to buy from Australia and on international project opportunities throughout Austrade's overseas network Overseas posts are also proactively involved in identifying high value inquiries or business opportunities and promote these to specific Australian companies with known capability in the specific area. International Business Advice: Austrade is able to provide counselling in response to general inquiries, including advice on preparedness for export, various facets of exporting and advice on strategies for approaching international business activity - contact details for Austrade posts Austrade can supply, usually with the assistance of consultants, client companies with market planning services which provide the client detailed market advice including a market assessment and strategic plan. Export Awareness: Austrade produces teaching kits comprising publications, videos and teaching notes targeted at secondary and tertiary students of economics and international business. It organises and/or sponsors workshops and seminars for new and existing exporters. Seminar topics can include market overviews, country! product overviews and other issues relating to export. ' International Business Support Programs: Austrade administers and provides financial assistance to exporters under five different schemes. They are: - International Trade Enhancement Scheme CITES) - Export Market Development Scheme (EMDG) - Innovative Agricultural Marketing Program ClAMP) - Project Marketing Loan Facility (lAMP) people - Asia-Pacific Fellowship Scheme Investment Promotion: Through Austrade's domestic and overseas networks, Austrade is able to perform a 'matchmaking' role between Australian and foreign companies with respect to foreign investment. In many instances foreign companies may be able to provide the capital, technology, management skills and/or access to markets which Australian companies are seeking. Austrade is also able to assist those Australian companies wishing to invest overseas, where such investment can reasonably be assumed to lead to increased Australian exports. (7) Austrade offers a number of services which fall under two categories: General Trade Opportunities Trade Intelligence Report (TIR) publication provides, on average, over 300 new trade inquiries, tenders and foreign investment opportunities each month. TOP Electronic database provides subscribers with instant access to: - the latest trade, tender and foreign investment inquiries - the Export Intelligence Directory - shipping information - International Projects Information Network (IPIN) Summaries of International Projects (IPIN), a summary service which supplies information on new Multilateral Development Agency (MDA) projects including the World Bank, Asian Development Bank and the United Nations Agencies and other projects which are generally reported. Tracking of International Projects (IPIN), a service which provides market intelligence on the latest developments in particular opportunities and is available as a single request for specific data on a project or as an ongoing regular briefing on any project development. Specific Trade Opportunities Austrade posts proactively seek out and identify potentially high value trade inquiries or business opportunities and promote these to ific Australian companies with known capability in the specific area. Austrade advises the appropriate clients and recommends them to the local firm or authority. Austrade can then continue to provide ongoing support through its other services to the identified client. (8) Details of the balance of trade for August 1991 were released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on 1 October 1991. These showed the highest surplus of trade in goods and services ever recorded ($696 million seasonally adjusted) and the highest balance of merchandise trade ever recorded ($950 million seasonally adjusted). These are partly the result of exports continuing to achieve record levels ($4,665 million seasonally adjusted in August). For the 1990-91 year, the merchandise trade balance showed a surplus of $2,589 million-the best result in over a decade and a massive turnaround of $5.8 billion from the $3,176 million deficit recorded the previous year. Coronation Hill (Question No. 1091) 1\;Ir Filing asked the Prime Minister, upon notlce, on 8 October 1991: (1) Has he received correspondence from shareholders of Newcrest Mining Limited, one of the joint venture companies at Coronation Hill, requesting that Cabinet's recent decision to prevent mining at Coronation Hill be reconsidered. (2) Will he consider compensating the joint venture companies following the decision on Coronation Hill.",147
253,Mr HAWKE,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) I have written to the Managing Director of Newcrest Mining Limited indicating that the Government considered that it would not be appropriate for compensation to be paid in this case. Projects and Programs: Funding (Question Nos 1133-1148) Mr Thckey asked all Ministers, upon notice, on 16 October 1991: With respect to each project or program available to individuals, organisations or Commonwealth, State and local government authorities which is spec- funded through the Department/s or agencies for which the Minister has portfolio responsibility, what (a) is the type and full title of the project, (b) funding arrangements, including details relating to payment, are involved, (c) are the details concerning application for funding, (d) is the departmental contact point, (e) is the budget allocation for (i) 1991-92 and (ii) 1992-93, (f) are the aims of the project or program and (g) are the criteria for eligibility.",151
254,Mr HAWKE,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"As indicated above, the honourable member asked identical questions of all Ministers. The following answer is provided on behalf of all those Ministers: A considerable amount of the information sought by the honourable member will be found in the 1990-91 Annual Reports of departments and authorities and in portfolio Program Performance Statements. To obtain the other information sought would involve all departments and authorities in considerable research and I am not prepared to authorise the time and resources entailed in collating the information. Metway Bank 8.115 Application Hearings Mr WiHis-On 17 October 1991 Mr Howard asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations, the following question without notice: I refer to the stated policy of the Government to promote greater flexibility for workplace arrangements within the present industrial relations system. In view of this, will the Government intervene before the Full Bench of the Industrial Relations Commission next Monday to support the application of Metway Bank Ltd and its staff association for approval, under section 115 of the Industrial Re1ation- Act, of their workplace agreement, which, if approved, will demonstrate that there is a significant new area of flexibility under that Act for workplace arrangements without the need for further amendment of the Act. In my reply I undertook to seek further information from the Minister for Industrial Relations. The Minister has provided the following response: The matter currently before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission (AIRC) is about the industrial award coverage and staff representation for the staff of Metway Bank. This has been a complex, long running case currently progressing in both the Queensland and Federal Industrial Commissions which had its origins in a Voluntary Employment Agreement made under now repealed Queensland legislation. The hearing on Monday 21 October was before a Full Bench of the AIRC to commence hearings on a number of jurisdictional issues. A decision of the Commission on 25 October appears to enable the Finance Sector Union to seek a federal award to cover staff. As you are aware, section 44 of the Industrial Relations Act 1988 provides that '[t]he Minister may, on behalf of the Commonwealth ... intervene in the public interest in a matter before the Full Bench'. All decisions in relation to intervention are based on a range of factors. Intervention may be appropriate where the Minister is of the view that the Commission may not have before it all relevant facts to enable it to properly determine public interest considerations. The history of the matter suggests that the AIRC and its State counterpart are well placed to properly assess public interest concerns. The hearings involve a range of questions which go beyond the matter to which you refer. They are at a most sensitive stage. There is nothing for the Commonwealth to address in circumstances where the parties and the tribunals are addressing the matter in accordance with the relevant legislative arrangements. At this stage there is no clear public interest justification for intervention by the Commonwealth. Accordingly, I do not propose to further lengthen what has already been a rather drawn-out dispute by intervening in the current proceedings before the AIRC. If a final resolution cannot be found through the current proceedings before the Federal and State Commissions then the matter may need to be looked at again.",151
