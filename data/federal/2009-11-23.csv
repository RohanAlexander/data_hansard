3,The SPEAKER,MAIN COMMITTEE,"In accordance with standing orders 41(e) and 41(h), and the recommendations of the whips adopted by the House on 18 November 2009, I present copies of the terms of motions for which notice has been given by the members for Indi, Bonner, Lyne and Hindmarsh. These matters will be considered in the Main Committee later today. FOREIGN ACQUISITIONS AND TAKEOVERS AMENDMENT BILL 2009 Second Reading Debate resumed from 20 August, on motion by Mr Swan: That this bill be now read a second time.",19
4,Mr HOCKEY,MAIN COMMITTEE,"Thank you for coming into the House to listen to my speech on the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Amendment Bill 2009, Mr Speaker, and thank you to the vast number of Labor members who have come into listen to my address. The good news for the government is that the coalition supports this bill. The bill explicitly requires foreign investors to notify the government where there is a possibility that the type of acquisition or investment arrangement being used will deliver influence or control over an Australian company, either currently or at some time in the future. Mr Hale interjecting",19
5,Mr HOCKEY,MAIN COMMITTEE,"And I wish the member for Solomon to listen carefully to this because financial arrangements and company structures have become increasingly complex in recent years, a bit like caucus, and this bill goes on to address those new developments by expanding the definition of ‘foreign control or influence'. The bill updates the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975, which provides the basis for the Treasurer to examine proposed foreign investments in Australian businesses and assets to ensure they are not contrary to the national interest. The bill will incorporate a wider range of financing structures that may deliver effective control or influence of Australian companies to foreign interests. There are no changes to the national interest test or to the monitoring threshold for consideration by the government. The bill in fact strengthens those safeguards. It does not alter the role of government to finally determine the national interest or a foreign investment proposal. The Foreign Investment Review Board is a non-statutory body that was established by the Fraser Liberal government in 1976 to advise the Treasurer on the government's foreign investment policy and its administration. Its role is to examine proposed investments and make considered recommendations to the Treasurer. The FIRB plays a critical role in the foreign investment process because it ensures that foreign investment decisions are thoroughly examined. This is demonstrated-I am slightly put off, Mr Speaker, by what I am seeing happen with your chair.",19
6,The SPEAKER,MAIN COMMITTEE,I apologise to the member for North Sydney.,20
7,Mr HOCKEY,MAIN COMMITTEE,"It is something about the Labor Party, isn't it!",20
8,The SPEAKER,MAIN COMMITTEE,You are doing a good job.,20
9,Mr HOCKEY,MAIN COMMITTEE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. This is demonstrated by the fact that, between 1999 and 2008, an average of 76.4 per cent of foreign investment proposals were changed to meet certain conditions in order to be approved. The most recent figures show that the FIRB approved 7,841 proposals in 2007-08, which was a 27 per cent increase on the previous year. Those approvals involved proposed investment of over $191 billion, a 23 per cent increase on the previous year. The mining sector led the charge, with $64.3 billion worth of projects approved in 2007-08, followed by $45.5 billion for real estate, $35.7 billion for services and $31.3 billion for manufacturing. The United States is the leading foreign investor in Australiaand was in 2007-08, with $49.5 billion worth of proposals approved. That is 26 per cent of the total amount in that year, which is a very important point. The United Kingdom, Germany, Singapore and Switzerland were also regarded as major investors in the 2007-08 year. There has been a steady increase in the value of foreign investment over the past decade. There were nearly 45,000 proposals for foreign investment in Australia worth $1 trillion between 1999 and 2007, so this illustrates the magnitude and significance of foreign investment in this country. As I said earlier, this bill contains no changes to the national interest test, and this is very important. As a matter of interest, in fact there is no specific definition of ‘the national interest' in the act or in this bill. government determines what is: ‘contrary to the national interest' by having regard to the widely held community concerns of Australians. In practice, this usually refers to existing government policy and legislation, national security interest or economic development. For example, the Treasurer refused to approve the China Minmetals Corporation nonferrous metals takeover of OZ Minerals in April until it removed the Prominent Hill mine from the deal. Prominent Hill is a prohibited area for the purposes of the ‘testing of war materials' and contains places classified under the Aboriginal Heritage Act. It is located within the Woomera Prohibited Area, and the Treasurer said it would not be approved, on national security grounds. The coalition strongly believes foreign investment is overall in Australia's national interest. We believe that foreign investment has a positive impact on Australia and always has. We support foreign investment but we are always mindful that there must be full and open transparency when it comes to foreign investment. One recent example of this was the amendment to the Guarantee of State And Territory Borrowing Appropriation Bill 2009 which I moved successfully on 18 June. The amendment recognised that government debt is a massive looming issue for this nation under the Labor Party. More than 65 per cent of government borrowings are in fact coming from overseas. So not only do we have a government that is engaging in the biggest borrowing program in modern Australian history but 65 per cent of the money they are borrowing is coming from overseas. The amendment that I moved to the act ensures that the government publishes the registered beneficial owners of Australian government The bonds. Australians have a right to know who is lending us all this money. Ultimately, just as anyone who has a mortgage needs to know who they owe the money to, because inevitably the bank has some influence over the way we go about our daily lives, so too should Australians know who they owe money to. The government at first completely resisted this transparency. You did not have to worry about that under the coalition because we were not borrowing money on that scale. In fact, we left the Australian ernment with no net debt, so we did not have to worry who we borrowed money from, because we did not owe anything. We had more money than they were lending to us. But, hang on-along comes Labor and borrows record levels of money. And of course we want to know who is lending us that money. It is widely recognised that the biggest vestor in the world at the moment is the Chinese government. Therefore, if the Chinese government invests in Australia the Australian people should know. As this act illustrates, if you have large-scale investment by a private sector organisation or a foreign government and they are buying into equities, real estate or Australian assets, the Ausgregate tralian people should know, and the Australian people should know who is lending us the money. It is quite an interesting challenge for the nation to have a massive investor going forward. As I pointed out, companies and individuals from the United States were the largest foreign investors in Australia in 08. That may have shifted somewhat in the last 12 months; we will wait and see. But we want to know that there is a transparent process for identifying if someone is investing in equities or in real estate, and that is addressed under this act. Then the question is: who is investing in Australian government debt? That is addressed by the amendment that I moved to the Guarantee of State And Territory Borrowing Appropriation Bill 2009. I might add that that bill passed and was proclaimed earlier this year. So far we have seen no registry, so I am putting the government and the authorities on notice that they now have a legal obligation to publish the full registry of those people who are lending the Australian government so much money. I want them to deliver on that registry and if they do not then they govwill be in breach of the law that they helped to pass. This is a significant challenge for the nation, and just as we need to know if individuals or corporations are investing so too we need to know whether it is a foreign government that is investing. In order to protect our national interest, this bill broadens four key definitions in the act: substantial interest, aggregate substantial ininterest, voting power and potential voting power. ‘Substantial interest' is currently defined as 15 per cent or more of the voting power or of the issued shares. This bill changes this definition to holding at least 15 per cent or one or more of voting power, potential voting power, issued shares or rights to issued shares. The current meaning of ‘agsubstantial interest' is 40 per cent or more of the voting power or the issued shares. This bill extends it in a similar vein to two or more persons taken together holding at least 40 per cent of the voting power, potential voting power, issued shares or rights to issued shares. ‘Voting power' is currently 2007- defined as the maximum number of votes that can be cast at a general meeting. It has been clarified to explicitly include potential voting power. ‘Potential voting power' refers to the number of votes that could be cast if it is assumed that a future right is exercised. Currently there is compulsory notification for proposals involving the acquisition of ‘substantial shareholding'. This bill will replace the word ‘shareholding' with the word ‘interest'. As I said earlier, financial arrangements and company structures have become increasingly complex. People have sought to use more exotic mechanisms to try and avoid proper and full disclosure of not only their equitable interests in the company but also their voting interests and influence in the company. There are numerous examples. One example this bill will cover is debt-forequity swaps. When a company needs to restructure its finances it can issue a debt-fora equity swap and debt is exchanged for a designated amount of stock. In effect, an investor buys the debt in return for a certain ber of shares or capital in the company. Another example is derivative instruments. An option on a share would give an investor the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a share at some point in the future for a specified price. If that future potential share chase were large enough to represent a substantial interest then it would need to be ported under the requirements of this bill. At the moment, the act does not properly cover these kinds of investments. That is why the coalition is supporting this bill. The bill broadens the definition of what has to be reported to the government and incorporates, as outlined earlier, potential control. The vestor in a debt-for-equity swap could potentially gain a controlling share in the company if it later swaps the debt for equity. This bill clarifies Australia's foreign vestment regulations. It will apply retrospectively from 12 February 2009. A transitional period will apply from 12 February 2009 to the date of royal assent to ensure that foreign investors are not adversely affected by the start date. During the transitional period, there will be no criminal penalties, and retrospective criminal prosecution is expressly excluded. The transitional arrangements provide that foreign investors will have 30 days to notify the Treasurer if an investment is covered by this bill. Foreign investment, of course, is vital to Australia's future growth and prosperity because it creates jobs and promotes healthy competition in our industries. This bill supports investment in this country while safeguarding our national interest. For the benefit of the people in the gallery, I would say that this is another example where the opposition and the government work together to deliver bill in the national interest. Quite obviously, this is not going to make television news tonight. I find that hard to believe, Mr num- Speaker, notwithstanding your presence in the chamber-but this happens on numerous occasions and I am sorry that Australians are not aware of it. We can come to an agreement on something that is in the national interest. We often do. It is just not reported, purand so often the coverage is restricted to a slightly frayed temper during question time re- or the humorous quip from the Speaker. On that note, I commend the bill to the House and reaffirm the commitment of the coalition to support this legislation.",20
10,Mr CRAIG THOMSON,MAIN COMMITTEE," Mr Speaker, it is good to see you very comfortably there in your chair, given the inearlier activities! Australia needs legislation to improve the integrity of its foreign investment screening regime. The Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Amendment Bill in2009, which I am speaking in support of today, clarifies the operation of the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act to ensure that the government has the capacity to examine all substantial investment proposals that could potentially raise national interest concerns. The government welcomes and encourages foreign direct investment because of the benefits that it provides to the Australian economy. Foreign investment creates new job opportunities for Australians, encourages innovation and skill development, introduces new technologies and promotes competition amongst our industries. Foreign investment has helped build the competitiveness of our economy and will continue to do so in the future. The Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 seeks to get the balance right between encouraging investment into Australia and ensuring that the government can review significant foreign investment proposals and intervene where these could undermine the national interest. The act provides the basis for the Treasurer to examine proposed foreign investments in Australian businesses and assets to ensure that they are not contrary to the national interest. The act requires shares. foreign investors to notify the Treasurer of their transactions in certain circumstances and provides the Treasurer with the power to block or place certain conditions upon those proposals determined to be contrary to the national interest. The notion of ‘control' is a fundamental component of the act. Overall, the current provisions of the act that deal with control have worked well. But the use of innovative and increasingly complex financing arrangements has been a growing feature of investment activity over recent years. These arrangements have highlighted some shortcomings with the act where ownership and control events may potentially arise, either now or in the future, in a variety of new ways other than through traditional shares or voting power. To preserve the original policy intent of the act, on 12 February 2009 the Treasurer announced that the government would amend the act to ‘clarify the operation of the foreign investment screening regime' to ‘ensure that it applies equally to all foreign investments irrespective of the way they are structured'. The amendments are designed to capture all significant foreign investments that have the potential to provide substantial influence or control over an Australian company, either now or in the future. The bill clarifies the operation of the act by explicitly requiring foreign investors to notify the Treasurer where there is a possibility that the type of investment arrangement being used will deliver influence or control over an Australian company valued above the relevant monetary threshold. This will be achieved by expanding the definition of ‘voting power' so that it covers the number of votes that could be cast if it is assumed that a future right is exercised and by clarifying the section of the act dealing with interests in The bill will also clarify where the act deals with interests in shares. The act currently provides that a person is deemed to hold an interest in a share if they have a right to acquire a share or to have a share transferred to them. The bill clarifies that a right can include a right under an instrument, agreement or arrangement, whether the right is exercisable presently or in the future and whether on the fulfilment of a condition or not. These amendments are not the result of any one investment proposal. They ensure that the foreign investment framework keeps pace with the changing nature of foreign investment proposals and with trends that were evident some time before this government was elected. The amendments in this bill apply from 12 February 2009-the date that the Treasurer announced the changes-to provide certainty around the act's application. Let us clarify what these retrospective amendments mean. To ensure that investors are not unfairly affected by the retrospective start date, the bill includes transitional provisions that apply in relation to business proposals and transactions that occurred between 12 February and the date of royal assent. During this period, there will be no criminal penalties for non-compliance. Upon commencement, foreign investors will have 30 days to notify the Treasurer if, during the transitional period, they entered into a transunderpins action of the type covered by these amendments and have not already provided notification to the Treasurer. The transitional provisions will ensure that no foreign investors are adversely affected by the start date of these amendments. It is not expected that there will be many investors in this situation. The Foreign Investment Review Board has noted that the proposed amendments were broadly anticipated by investors, many of whom voluntarily notified the board of their investments. Nothing in the transitional provisions would reduce the government's ability to block or place conditions on proposals which are determined to be contrary to the national interest. The act focuses on situations where a foreign investor has obtained substantial influence or control. Overall, the current provisions in the act that deal with control have worked well, and its approach remains sound. However, since the act was drafted in the 1970s more complex investment instruments have evolved. The use of innovation financing arrangements have been a growing feature of investment activity over recent years. These arrangements have highlighted that ownership interests and control can be held in a variety of forms other than through traditional shares and voting power. While these types of investment arrangements have a solid commercial basis, they have raised questions about the act's full application. It was for this reason that the government announced earlier this year that we would amend the act to safeguard its policy intention. We consider that these changes improve the integrity of the act and capture arrangements that may be deliberately structured to avoid foreign investment screening. These changes are consistent with Australia's international obligations under our free trade agreements. The bill does not change the robust national interest framework that our foreign investment policy or the screening examination arrangements of the Foreign Investment Review Board. These procedures are well established and familiar to foreign investors. The examination procedures and the decision to block or impose conditions on foreign investment proposals will continue to be based on whether the investment has altered or will alter the control of an Australian business or corporation and whether the investment is contrary to the national interest. The government is confident that this bill strengthens and modernises Australia's foreign investment framework. As we build stronger foundations for Australian prosperity beyond the global recession, we are committed to a regulatory regime that gets the balance right: protecting the national interest while ensuring that Australia is a more competitive destination for foreign investment. The fact that the Australian economy has performed much better than the economies of the rest of the world during the global recession will help make this country an attractive market for investment, especially when the economy fully recovers. But, while we have fared better than most, we should not forget that there are now 670,000 Australians out of work, and we expect further rises in unemployment ahead. Cancelling fiscal stimulus in one hit rather than continuing with our gradual and careful phasing down would cost thousands more jobs, ruin many more small businesses and risk sending the economy backwards before the recovery in private activity has taken hold. The recent Westpac-Melbourne Institute survey of consumer sentiment found that consumer confidence fell by 2.5 per cent in November after five consecutive months of improvement. It is important to keep in mind that consumer confidence is still 44.3 per cent higher than it was in October 2008, prior to the announcement of the first fiscal stimulus package. That compares with a mere 3.9 per cent increase in consumer confidence for the OECD as a whole over the same period. But confidence is a fragile thing, and we need to be careful and make sure that the stimulus package is properly seen through. We also saw the results of the NAB monthly business survey for October. Business confidence continued its upward climb, consolidating the gains we saw in recent surveys. However, the most striking finding of the October survey, as pointed to by NAB Chief Economist, Alan Oster, was ‘the sharp acceleration in actual business outcomes.' The International Monetary Fund released the report Recent Global Developments and Prospects last week to APEC finance ministers, ahead of the APEC leaders' meeting that weekend. The IMF made it clear that the global recovery is not yet self-sustaining and is still dependent on policy support. The report says: The overarching risk is that the recovery stalls. This could occur because of a premature exit from accommodative monetary and fiscal policies-especially if the policy-induced recovery so far is mistaken for the beginning of a sustained and autonomous recovery in private demand. For these reasons the IMF again cautioned against the premature withdrawal of fiscal stimulus, stating that ‘policy support needs to be sustained until recovery is firmly established.' Healthy foreign investment needs a strong economy, and this government has taken the decisive measures to help weather the unprecedented storms of the global recession. Again, we are confident we are getting the balance right: protecting the national interest while ensuring that Australia is a more competitive destination for foreign investment. I will sum up by looking at where we are with this bill and what the amendments actually mean for the foreign investment regime. These amendments simply modernise the act to preserve its original policy intent with respect to new investment instruments. They should not be viewed as the result of any single foreign investment proposal but as addressing new trends in investments that have been growing in recent years. The amendments are designed to capture all significant foreign investments that have the potential to provide substantial influence or control over an Australian company, either now or in the future. They require foreign investors to notify FIRB where there is a possibility that the type of investment arrangement being used will deliver influence or control over an Australian company valued above the relevant monetary threshold. This will be achieved by expanding the definition of ‘voting power' so that it covers the number of votes that could be cast if it is assumed that a future right is exercised and by clarifying the section of the act dealing with interests in shares. The act currently provides that a person is deemed to hold an interest in a share if they have a right to acquire a share or have a share transferred to them. This bill clarifies this provision so that it is clear that the rights include a right under an instrument, agreement or arrangement, whether that right is exercisable presently or in the future and whether it is exercisable on the fulfilment of a condition or not. The bill will not change FIRB's screening and examination procedures. The examination procedures and the decision to block or impose conditions on foreign investment proposals will continue to be based on whether an investment has the potential to control an Australian business or corporation and whether the investment is contrary to the national interest. Through the bill the government will maintain the right balance between encouraging investment in Australia and ensuring that the government can intervene when necessary to protect the national interest. These changes strengthen the operation of the act by ensuring that it keeps pace with new types of investment instruments. Generally, Australia welcomes and encourages direct foreign investment because of the benefits it provides to the Australian economy. International capital opens new investment opportunities and helps to develop Australian industries. Foreign investment brings new job opportunities for Australians, new innovation and skills development, new technologies and promotion of competition amongst our industries. It is estimated that foreign investment supports around one in every four Australian workers in the mining industry. On 4 August the Treasurer announced reforms to the screening regime to reduce some of the compliance costs faced by foreign investors and to ensure that Australia remains a competitive and attractive destination for foreign capital. Specifically, the screening threshold for private foreign investment will be increased from $100 million to $219 million and indexed annually. New businesses in Australia valued above $10 million will no longer need to notify the Foreign Investment Review Board. The government has not rejected a single new business proposal for the past decade or more. New business proposals are subject to a range of other regulatory requirements. These amendments, combined with the 4 August announcement, better target the national interest test towards cases that could raise national interest impacts. This is part of the overall regulatory reform that the Rudd government has been engaged in since coming to office almost two years ago. It is an important piece of legislation. It is legislation that, thankfully, is supported by the opposition and it is legislation that this parliament should support. I commend the bill to the House.",22
11,Mrs MOYLAN,MAIN COMMITTEE,"I am pleased to have an opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Amendment Bill 2009 today. There is little doubt as to the importance of foreign investment to Australia. It brings new jobs, innovation and competition, all improving Australian industries. While we need to make a continued effort to encourage investment in Australia, we also need to be aware that sometimes a foreign investment may actually come at a significant cost to the overall Australian economy and that it might not always be in the national interest to allow such an investment to go ahead. One of the cases that I was most closely involved with was the proposed takeover of Woodside by Shell. My colleague who is at the table, the member for Brand, was also at that time closely involved in that matter. There is no doubt that it was not in Australia's best interests for that transaction to proceed. It certainly would have meant the loss of billions of dollars worth of investment in Australia, in Western Australia in particular. There would have been little benefit to the nation from that particular proposal proceeding. In 1976 the Foreign Investment Review Board, a non-statutory body, was established. That occurred so that the Treasurer might be advised on the government's foreign investment policy and its administration. Since that time the Foreign Investment Review Board has played a critical role in the foreign investment process because it ensures that foreign investment decisions are thoroughly examined and that they proceed on the basis that they are in the national interest. I think the reason for this is pretty clear, because the level of foreign investment has been exceedingly high in recent times. We see that from 1999 to 2008 an average of 76.4 per cent of proposals were changed to meet certain conditions and that over the period from 1999 to 2007 there were 45,000 proposals valued at $1 trillion. It is a very substantial amount of investment, and there can be ramifications if it is not closely scrutinised. So we are very pleased that the Foreign Investment Review Board has been doing its job under the act, and these proposed amendments should give greater clarity to its carrying out of that work. As I said, a number of proposals had been received. I think that the 7,841 proposals received in the year 2007-08 represented a 27 per cent increase, so I do not think we are going to see a slowing down of interest in investing in Australia anytime soon. That particularly applies to the mining sector. One of the interesting arguments that was run during the Shell-Woodside debate was that if the government, and indeed the Foreign Investment Review Board, did not approve that deal we would see a flood of capital away from this country as people would not want to invest. I never believed that was a sound argument at all. I think that the investor is looking for a safe haven, for stability and for good projects, and that this country can offer that, so I never believed that, the basis of one project being knocked back by the Foreign Investment Review Board, we would see foreign investment fleeing this nation. I think that the decision was made on the best possible grounds and that it was an important decision. In the legislation before us there are no changes to the national interest test, so that will remain, or indeed to the monetary threshold for consideration by government. But this bill certainly seeks to strengthen the current safeguards and, hopefully, it gives the Foreign Investment Review Board greater guidance in terms of what can and cannot be done. The balancing act between the benefits and the costs to our economy has been at the centre of the foreign investment review policy for the 35 years that it has been in operation. With the introduction of the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975, certain transactions must be reported and the Foreign Investment Review Board must advise the Treasurer whether to approve an investment. Clearly, there have been significant changes to the mode of foreign investment since 1975, and it is important that the legislation is updated to reflect these changes. There was an article in the Australian Financial Review written by Jo Clarke which was quite illuminating to read. In that article there was this quote from a lawyer who had apparently had quite a bit to do with foreign investment: “This is likely to lead to more creative financing structures to get around FIRB, particularly now that FIRB has introduced further delays and complicated the approvals process,” … Well hopefully, through the passage of this legislation, we might be able to avoid some of the worse abuses of creative schemes designed to get around the proper processes that foreign investment should rightly have to adhere to when making investment in this country. As I said, we understand that it is a on balancing act between benefits and costs to our economy, but that should not deter us from making sure that there is a robust process for approval. Section 18 of the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act gives the Treasurer the power to prohibit proposed acquisitions that would result in a foreign investor having a controlling interest in an Australian company where it is decided that such a transaction would be ‘contrary to the national interest'. Section 26 stipulates that the Treasurer must be notified of any agreement to acquire a substantial shareholding in an Australian company. As of 22 September 2009, a notification must be made where the target company is worth $219 million or more and the acquisition will result in the foreign entity holding a substantial interest in the company. ‘A substantial interest' is understood to mean a holding of 15 per cent or more of the voting power or the issued shares in a corporation. This definition of substantial interest will be expanded by the bill before us today to ensure that it applies to all the different models and structures that characterise modern foreign investment. It is no longer sensible to assume that foreign investment will be structured to relate only to voting power and issued shares. In considering whether the transaction will result in a substantial interest being held by the foreign entity, regard will now be had to not just voting power but also potential voting power and the right to an interest in the issued shares. This change will encompass the more sophisticated and complicated structures that are now common in foreign investments, ensuring that the obligation to inform the foreign investment review tribunal applies evenly to simple and more complicated transactions. Substantial investment proposals need to be fully examined for national interest concerns regardless of the way that they are structured. Essentially, where an investor has the future right to acquire votes or shares, they are deemed to have them at the time of the transaction. This potential exists even where the right may only be exercisable on the fulfilment of a future condition. This change for potential voting power is extremely relevant where instruments such as convertible notes are used, where an investor may gain control of a corporation through means other than the present acquisition of shares or voting power, or a convertible note is a debt instrument that allows for the conversion into equity in the future. Law firm Allens Arthur Robinson has described the impact of this bill as: … it is the grant, rather than the exercise, of the equity options inherent in convertible notes that will need to be the subject of the traditional ‘subject to FIRB approval' clause … So if an investor is to acquire convertible notes or other options over unissued shares, they will need to report the transaction under the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act, where the notional conversion would result in 15 per cent of the votes in the corporation being held by the foreign investor. I can only assume that where an instrument does not specify the exact amount of shares that an investor would have a future right to but, as is often the case, specifies the dollar value of the share entitlement, the calculation of whether this would amount to a substantial interest would need to be based on the value of the shares at the time of the transaction. Given that share prices are vulnerable to fluctuation, especially when foreign investment is in the pipeline, it is entirely foreseeable that some transactions will not be reported where it may be appropriate, and vice versa. For example, if the price of shares increases dramatically between the date of the transaction and the time that the investor converts the equity into shares, then they may acquire considerably less than the significant interest and yet the transaction would still be subject to considerable delay while it is being reviewed by the Foreign Investment Review Board. The issue of delays within the approval process has become serious since the influx of applications following the collapse of the Chinalco deal. On 16 September the Australian Financial Review noted that there is a ‘growing backlog' causing delays to many transactions. The same article also said that the amendments proposed in this bill are: … likely to lead to more creative financing structures to get around FIRB, particularly now that FIRB has introduced further delayswhich was the quote I read out earlier. Foreign investment is integral to Australia's economic growth, and the need to find the balance in the review process is more important than ever. Clearly the review process should not become so arduous and timeconsuming that investors are turned away, but at the same time it does need to be thorough enough to ensure that transactions that are not in the national interest do not get proved. I think there is considerable public disquiet, particularly when it comes to iconic Australian companies and when it comes to those corporations that are involved in either our mining or our energy sector. I can understand those concerns, often expressed by electors in the electorate of Pearce, that we should ensure, in so far as possible, that we remain in control over our resources and, in particular, those resources that have security interests such as energy. I understand always the tensions that we in this place are faced with in trying to balance the national interest with continuing robust foreign investment in Australia and the jobs that can offer and the growth and development that can offer, which might otherwise not take place. Australia does have a lot to offer foreign investors in this mutually beneficial relationChinese ship. The nature of foreign investments has changed dramatically since the introduction of our review process back in 1975 and no doubt many new structures and models will come about in the future. For now, though, it is important that all major foreign investments are reviewed, regardless of whether the investor acquires shares, voting power or some other interest or right exercisable in future. If we get that balance right, then the Australian economy has everything to gain. In conclusion, I listened carefully to the contribution of the member for North Sydney, the shadow minister, in this debate. I support his call for an amendment which ensures that the government publishes the registered beneficial owners of Australian government bonds. Many would say it is perhaps, after all, another way of attracting foreign investment into this country. Given the sensitivities out there within communities, I think it is just part of open and accountable governance. It is a sensible suggestion. I hope that my colleague the member for Brand might particularly want to supapport that suggestion, knowing of his great interest in open and accountable governance and his experiences in the attempt by the great Dutch company Shell to take over Woodside some years ago. Currently, the Chinese government, as the member for North Sydney, the shadow minister, said, is the biggest investor in the world. If the Chinese government invests in Australia, the Australian people should know about it. Most people would be pleased to know that the biggest single foreign investor in Australia in 2007-08 was the United States, with a total investment of $49.5 billion, which is about 26 per cent of the total investment. After that, the United Kingdom, Germany, Singapore and Switzerland are also major investors. Of course, we welcome the investment of our near neighbours, the government and the people of China. They are clearly playing an important part in the development of some of our resources and will continue to do so in the future. In the interests of, as I said, openness and accountability in government and the fact that the Australian government is raising a substantial amount of money through govthe ernment bonds it would be appropriate for the Australian community to be kept appraised of those transactions, just as they want to be kept appraised of the transactions which are of interest to the Foreign Investment Review Board. In essence, I am very pleased to be able to support this legislation. If it means greater clarity and streamlining of the foreign investment process, then it has to be said that it will add immeasurably to the legislation that we have passed in this House in the past.",26
12,Mr GRAY,MAIN COMMITTEE,"Brand-Parliamentary Secretary for Western and Northern Australia) (12.48 pm)-I rise to speak in favour of the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Amendment Bill 2009 and, in so doing, I commend the speakers to date in this debate. The member for Pearce quite properly references the significant issues around the takeover proposal from the Shell oil company of Woodside in 2001. I should declare my personal interest in that matter, having been at the time and for a subsequent six-year period an employee of Woodside. On many occasions I appeared at the offices of the Foreign Investment Review Board to represent the interests of that company in the area of creating understanding and seeking approval for investments in Australia's oil and gas sector. It is also important to note in the presentation of the member of Pearce references to the national interest. It was extremely important during 2001 to bear in mind that we were coming off the back of the Asian financial crisis and that there was an aggressive bid by one of the world's largest oil companies, Shell, for one of the real growth assets of the Australian economy in this sector, Woodside, and to bear in mind the clear threats that were made by a range of corporate leaders-not just Australian but internationally recognised corporate leaders-that if the then Australian government did not acquiesce to the demands of an international company, then there would be dire consequences for the Australian economy. The dollar would crash, they said; investors would be disinclined to come to Australia, they said; they also said that to do anything other than wave through that application would have been grossly irresponsible of the then government. I am pleased to say that the then government, led by Prime Minister Howard, and the decision made by the then Treasurer Peter Costello to give an Australian company a chance was insightful-not saying we do not like foreign investment but saying that, given the nature of the investment, given the area of business in which the investment was being made and given the possible future for the LNG industry at that time, the transaction was not appropriate. I personally believe that at any other time, should that transaction have been considered by an Australian government of either persuasion, different parameters would have played in the minds of the Treasurer and the Prime Minister of the day. The national interest is something which we have to accept from time to time. We need to change, alter, amend and create an understanding that is completely appropriate to our economic circumstances. At the time, in 2001, it seemed to me that not only was our national interest preserved by preventing the takeover of that company but, moreover, it was also preserved by saying to large international companies and company directors-and Leigh Clifford's name comes to mind here-‘No, we as the Australian economy will not be bullied by international investors. We are participants in the process of investment and we are thoughtful stewards of our economy and thoughtful managers of our future.' That being the case, an appropriate decision was made that I do not believe would reflect on any future attempt by Shell to invest in Woodside or anyone else to invest in any other company. They are all decisions taken at the time and on their merits and do not reflect in any way on the participants in the decision. Royal Dutch Shell is an outstanding company. Its managers and its personnel are outstanding people. At the time a decision was made because at the time the Australian government's view was, I think quite properly, that that was in the interests of the Australian nation and our future. The Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Amendment Bill 2009 clarifies the operation of the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act to ensure that the government has the capacity to examine all substantial investment proposals that could potentially raise national interest concerns. Australian governments of all persuasions have always welcomed and encouraged foreign direct investment due to the benefits that it provides to the Australian economy. From time to time politicians in this place do seek the low road. From time to time Senator Barnaby Joyce does seek to vilify foreign investment on the basis of political advantage rather than with calm, clear analytical skills that one would presume would better characterise a Senate leader. Foreign direct investment creates jobs for Australians. Foreign direct investment encourages Australian innovation and skills development. Foreign direct investment introduces new and innovative technologies. Foreign direct investment promotes competition amongst Australia's industries-in agriculture, mining, services, banking, property, retail and the media. Foreign direct investment has helped build our nation and the competitiveness of our economy, and it will surely continue to do this into the future. In the Senate Economics References Committee recent inquiry into foreign investment by state owned entities, Professor Peter Drysdale of the ANU and Professor Christopher Findlay of Adelaide university noted Australia's efficient mining sectorprobably the most efficient in the world, they said. They said: This is importantly due to its openness to foreign investor competition and participation, because that brings with it, and fosters, the technology, management know-how and market links that are essential ingredients in the development of a world class, internationally competitive industry. Australia, therefore, has a long record, and a strong policy regime, characterised by openness towards foreign investment in its resource industries … The Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 set the framework for foreign investment in Australia. It was at the time an act required because of community interest and concern about the rapidly escalating levels of investment in the Australian economy by the growing Japanese economy-growing and seeking to identify resource partnerships and seeking to grow its resource stocks in the areas of iron ore, bauxite, oil and gas, and coal. In a crude way the act sought to get the balance right between encouraging investment while ensuring that our national interest was protected. Currently the act requires foreign investors to notify the government of their transactions in certain circumstances. Unfortunately, in the main, interaction with the Foreign Investment Review Board seems to be the province of lawyers and lobbyists. It does not appear to be principally the province of companies entering to talk their own book. Of course, what we often see in public commentary around the Foreign Investment Review Board are comments by lawyers and lobbyists seeking, in my view, to encourage their own business growth rather than to smooth the way, to create insight and to ensure that serious business propositions get serious consideration, serious elevation through the system, to ensure timely decision making. In short, frequently commercial opportunists clog the system. The FIRB act empowers the Treasurer to place conditions upon or block those proposals that could be contrary to the national interest. Under the Rudd government there have been two rejections, both on national security grounds: Minmetals's bid for OZ Minerals and a joint venture between Wuhan Iron and Steel and Western Plains Resources. Both were rejected because they would have involved activities within the Woomera prohibited area. Minmetals, insightfully, gained approval on the condition that they left out the Prominent Hill copper and gold mine from their proposal. The act focuses on situations where a foreign investor obtains substantial influence or control. The current provisions in the act deal with control have worked well. However, since the act was passed in the 1970s the nature of investments has grown increasingly complex. The use of occasionally opaque or ‘innovative' financing arrangements has been a concern. Such innovative vehicles have highlighted that ownership interest and control can be held in a variety of forms other than through traditional shares and voting power. While these types of investment arrangements may have a solid commercial basis, they have raised questions around the act's full application. To safeguard the act's policy intention, the government announced that it would seek to amend the act. This amendment bill clarifies that under the act foreign investors must notify the ernment where the investment arrangement could deliver influence or control over an Australian company valued above the relevant monetary threshold. Importantly, the act will apply equally to all investments, irrespective of how they are structured. The amendments make specific provision for transactions involving instruments that eventually convert into shares. This will be achieved by first expanding the definition of ‘voting power' so that it covers the number of votes that could be cast if it is assumed that a future right is exercised, and second clarifying where the act deals with interests in shares. Currently the act provides that a person is deemed to hold an interest in a share if they have a right to acquire a share or to have a share transferred to them. The bill clarifies that a right can include a right under an instrument, agreement or arrangement, whether the right is exercisable presently or in the future and whether on fulfilment of a condition or not. The amendments are designed to capture all significant foreign investments that have the potential to provide substantial influence that or control over an Australian company. The amendments in this bill apply from 12 February 2009, the date that Treasurer Swan announced the changes, and provide certainty around the act's application. To ensure that investors are not unfairly affected by the retrospective start date, the bill includes transitional provisions that apply in relation to business proposals and transactions that occurred between 12 February and the date of royal assent. These changes improve the integrity of the act and capture arrangements that may be deliberately structured to avoid foreign investment screening. The bill will strengthen the work of the Foreign Investment Review Board. Who are the Foreign Investment Review Board? They are people of substantial standing as Cangov- berra policymakers and as Australian citizens. Mr John Phillips AO was appointed chairman of the board in 1997 and reappointed for a further five years in April 2007. He has extensive high-level experience in the public, finance and business sectors. Ms Lynn Wood has been a board member since April 1995 and was reappointed on 3 April 2005 for a further five years. These are substantial people with a deep background in Foreign Investment Review Board matters. Chris Miles was appointed to the board in June 1999 and reappointed for a further five by years in 2004. Executive Officer Patrick Colmer made a visit to the Pilbara just a few weeks ago. He actually went out to look at iron ore mines and engaged with operators, workers and the government of Western Australia to better understand the operations of our substantial iron ore and oil and gas assets in the north of Western Australia. It is interesting to note the speakers list this bill. Most speakers are either Western Australians, where these issues tend to bite more quickly, more deeply and more meaningfully, or from Northern Australia, where, again, the implications around foreign acquisitions tend to be more poignant because of their importance in driving business investment and the emotional significance of foreign investment. When contemplating foreign investment, it is difficult to make clear lines available for general understanding purely because of how companies are owned. It is difficult to understand all marketing arrangements, simply because of how marketing arrangements are structured. Dual listed entities make life even harder. Rio Tinto is an 84 per cent foreign owned company. BHP Billiton, a $130 billion company, is about three-quarters foreign owned. The major mining companies in Australia-BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto, Anglo and Xstrata-are all majority foreign owned. In 2006 foreign direct investment in mining in Australia was over 80 per cent of new private capital expenditure. Over 80 per cent of new investment in the mining sector in Australia in 2006 came from overseas sources. Foreign capital underpins the development of Australian resources. Australia's experience in the 1970s and 1980s with Japan demonstrates this, with massive investments in iron ore, in liquefied natural gas, in bauxite and in thermal coal and coking coal-all investments made to serve the resource needs of the Japanese economy and, at the time, investments that raised considerable public interest and debate. That investment profile almost perfectly mirrors the Chinese investment in Australian resources today in iron ore, in LNG, in bauxite, in thermal coal and in coking coal. We should see that there is a clear link between that experience of Japan and for the current experience of China. It is clear that there is a link between direct investment in our resource companies and export opportunities. And it is clear that getting the balance right on foreign investment is extremely important to maintain public confidence in our investment arrangements and also to encourage those investments to take place. I will speak briefly about Chinese investment in particular. According to the Senate economics committee report, as at 31 December 2008 the United Kingdom, at 24.8 per cent, was the largest investor country in Australia, followed by the United States at 24.3 per cent, Japan at 5.2 per cent, Hong Kong, under various arrangements, at about three per cent and Singapore at 2.5 per cent. The People's Republic of China came in at fifteenth on a list of investor countries at 0.5 per cent, worth around $8 billion, in December 2008. The report pointed out that even Belgium and the British Virgin Islands were bigger investors in Australia than China. There has been significant growth in Chinese investment in the Australian resource sector in recent years, but it does come off a very low base. The first large-scale Chinese investments in Australia's resource sector go back to 1986, with the Channar iron ore mine, developed through a joint venture between Sinosteel and Hamersley Iron, now Rio Tinto, in Western Australia. That was a great development producing a wonderful relationship between Rio Tinto and its Chinese customers and investors. Recently we have seen Ansteel invest in Gindalbie's Karara project, Hunan Valin Iron and Steel invest in Fortescue Metals Group, Sinosteel's purchase of the Midwest Corporation in 2008, Sichuan Hanlong Group's investment in Moly Mines, Yanzhou Coal Mining's $3.5 billion purchase of Felix Resources, and Baosteel's investment in Aquila Resources. We also currently have decisions before the Foreign Investment Review Board such as China Railway Materials Commercial Corporation's bid for the United Minerals Corporation and FerrAus. This debate is a constant backdrop to the economic development of the Australian resources sector. It is a constant debate because it must be. As a nation we will always require foreign investment. As a nation we will always play host to investor companies, investor countries and investor nations building deep commercial and political partnerships that underpin wealth generation in Australia-that underpin communities, jobs, careers and the lives that Australians enjoy in the wonderful commercial entities that are built in partnership with foreign investors. I commend this bill the House as an insightful addition to our regulatory approach to foreign investment.",30
13,Mr SIMPKINS,MAIN COMMITTEE,"I also rise to speak on the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Amendment Bill 2009. From my travels through my electorate, knocking on doors and meeting people, I suspect there is no greater industry in Western Australia than the commodities sector, from which people gain and benefit so much in our state. The downstream benefits are substantial. Yes, it is true that not everyone is involved the commodity sector but the influence is substantial and, particularly in the new suburbs of Cowan, the number of people who remain in fly-in fly-out positions is substantial. As the parliamentary secretary just said, there is no doubt about the importance of foreign investment for our state of Western Australia. But there always remain some concerns, and I will deal with some of those concerns in my contribution today. What I would like to begin with is that I do not consider Australia to be the lucky country-I think Australia is a country that has always worked hard to achieve success. We have done well because Australian businesses and Australian people on the whole have been committed to that success and have not been afraid to work very hard, commit a lot of their time and effort, and their sweat-and tears, occasionally-to that success. I mentioned fly-in fly-out positions before, and there are a number of families that are affected by the fly-in fly-out situation. It is financially of benefit, though socially more challenging, but in any case those are the appropriate decisions that individual families have made, and, of course, we wish them all the best. What I would also say is that the success of this country has been achieved through collective and personal means. So it is not just that there are businesses that have been successful; individuals have been successful. We realise that there is nothing wrong with hard work to achieve greater benefit; we should certainly encourage that. If people want to work hard and achieve that benefit, that is good. It is the case that the ability of businesses in Australia to expand here is due in some way to their abilities to raise capital. However, at times, foreign acquisitions of businesses or increased shareholdings may occur, in and sometimes that can be good and positive for Australia-in most cases I would think that is the case. It is also good for those who are employed here. But sometimes we are not quite sure how good or positive this can be. But I welcome this opportunity to speak on this bill. The bill will require foreign investors to notify the government where there is considered to be a possibility that proposed investment in, or acquisition of, business enterprises will deliver influence or control over an Australian company, now or in the future. It is a complex world these days. The location from which capital originates has changed, and the way in which it can be wielded has also changed. The influence of foreign-controlled funds and businesses are worthy of our careful examination. They are, without doubt, potent economic players. But we should be clear about this: some of these organisations are backed by foreign governments, and we must at least be wary of them. Before I speak specifically of the Chinese involvement in Australia, I would like to speak of what is happening with Chevron Australia and the Gorgon project. About 50 kilometres south of Karratha and some 25 kilometres out to sea there is Barrow Island where Chevron has been operating for 40 years. Barrow Island will be the site of the Gorgon liquefied natural gas plant, a threetrain, 15-million-tonnes-per-annum LNG plant. In subsea pipes, gas will be piped from the Jansz field, which is 140 kilometres from Barrow Island and some 1,300 metres below the surface. One hundred and eighty kilometres of mains pipelines and 180 kilometres of service pipelines will be required. The Gorgon field is some 70 kilometres from Barrow Island and 250 metres under the surface. It has been estimated that the Gorgon project will employ 3,000 personnel over at least 40 years. The partners of Chevron are ExxonMobil and Shell. It is also an interesting fact that, through the liquefaction process, the volume of the gas can be reduced by 600 per cent, thereby making it economic for storage and shipment, in this case from the 2.2 kilometre jetty that is planned. I received word that Chevron has recently passed the $7 billion mark in the awarding of contracts for Gorgon, and I would note that strong and successful Cowan local civil engineering firm Ertech Pty Ltd in Wangara has been awarded a contract for site development and the WAPET Landing on Barrow Island. An excellent local company, Ertech are going from strength to strength and I would like to congratulate Executive Chairman Jim Giumelli and Managing Director James Giumelli for their efforts. It is appropriate to spend a little time speaking about Ertech because the head office is in Cowan, located just off Ocean Reef Road and on Motivation Drive. From a distance, it looks very much like many of the businesses in Wangara. You might think when you were driving past that it was just another one of the many small but first vibrant businesses in the local area. But when I visited I found it had around 250 employees, most of whom are not on the Wangara site but located on project sites around the state. The success of Ertech is demonstrated by the story they tell of their involvement at Port Hedland. As I understand it, in 1996 Ertech received an $80,000 contract from BHP to carry out works in the area. For two years, Ertech worked under the expanded requirements of BHP and in the end received additional works and earnings of $14 million for their efforts-a big difference from the $80,000 original contract-for the work they did over two years. Similarly, in 2004, Ertech commenced the site works contract at BHP Billiton's Ravensthorpe site and that contract expanded to $270 million of work over the next 4½ years of the contract. With regard to Gorgon, involved on Barrow Island since 2001, Ertech has been awarded the large job 922, which requires preparing the construction camp, the construction of 300,000 square metres of sealed roads, the setting up a desalination plant to provide water for construction and the provision of a seawater intake tower for the desalination plant. It will also undertake works, including the reticulation of water and sewerage mains, the electric mains, navigation beacons, improvement of the landing craft offloading areas, the creation of a diesel fuel storage area and also the construction of a communications tower. Through ongoing business development and through these latest and future Gorgon opportunities I look forward to the continued expansion of Ertech. I look forward to their creating more employment for my constituents and I wish them every success in the future. I am very glad that they are in the electorate of Cowan. Before moving on, I would just like to mention the value of natural gas for a cleaner world. The influence of production and then use of Gorgon gas, if substituted for other energy fuel sources, has the capacity to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by about 45 million tonnes per year. As Chevron suggested, that would be equivalent to removing two-thirds of all vehicles from Australian roads. Natural gas, therefore, is the cleanest-burning fossil fuel, producing around 50 per cent of the carbon dioxide that coal produces. Clearly, as the population of the world grows and nations develop, the opportunities for economic returns for Australia grow, as does the opportunity for cleaner air, particularly in developing nations. Anyone who has been to China, India or even Thailand knows that the substitution of coal by natural gas will help reduce pollution in the air. It would of course be wrong of me not to mention Pluto, since I have just spoken of Gorgon. The Pluto project is being undertaken by Woodside, the nation's largest publicly listed oil and gas exploration and production company. The gas field is 185 kilometres from Karratha. Woodside has set something of a record with finding the Pluto gas field in 2005 and it is estimated that the first gas will flow around the 5½ year mark. Given it is estimated that the global demand for gas will double by 2020, the future for this $12 billion project is looking Another advantage for Woodside is that the CO2 level in the gas is very low, thereby reducing processing and removal costs. I want to speak about some of the specifics of some of the acquisitions that have taken place in Australia in the last two years. But, before I do so, I would just like to say that there is a certain level of unease amongst my constituents who work in the commodity sector about the ability of Chinese companies to buy into mines and infrastructure in this country. Another concern of my constituents is that they know that cashed-up Chinese companies often contain sovereign funds. We know that Australian firms investing in Chinese businesses or assets do not have the same opportunity under anything like the conditions that we permit in this country. It is therefore very important that we exercise extreme care in considering foreign acquisitions. I have just spoken about Chevron, which, of course, is a foreign company. Given that, there obviously needs to be a degree of balance with that. Everyone in my area believes that foreign investment is necessary, but behind some of the concerns that people have expressed to me are the difference in the methods and experiences that people have had in their employment and their contacts with certain companies. It is worth noting that the figures for 2008 that I have seen certainly do not rate China right up there at all in terms of foreign direct investment. Certainly, when we look at the top end of the scale, the UK and the United States, the top two nations at around 20 per cent each, represent in excess of $50 billion. That demonstrates that the level of direct foreign investment is certainly coming from the Western world and not the Eastern world. After that comes Germany, Japan and also Hong Kong, which are putting billions of very solid. dollars into Australia. That said, I would like to look at some of China's involvement in Australia. I note that, on 8 May 2009, the Treasurer approved an additional shareholding for Anshan Iron and Steel, also known as Ansteel, of up to 36.28 per cent of Gindalbie Metals Ltd. At that time, Ansteel was already a 50 per cent joint venture partner with Gindalbie in the greenfields $1.8 billion Karara iron ore project in the mid-west of Western Australia. While the Treasurer placed conditions on this acquisition, including the development of infrastructure, the essential point is that the Chinese stake in the Karara project is now substantial. If you look at the figures you will see that its involvement in the project certainly appears to be in excess of 50 per cent. Interestingly, Karara and Gindalbie are linked to the Oakajee Port and Rail Project and it is of concern, particularly to some in Western Australia, that the Chinese influence in the mid-west is too great. Some may say that Ansteel or, as it is also known, the Angang Steel Company is publicly listed; however, it is worth noting that that is supervised by the State Council of the People's Republic of China. On 23 April 2009, the Treasurer also approved the application by China Minmetals Non-Ferrous Metals Co. Ltd to acquire some mining assets of OZ Minerals Ltd. Essentially, the conditions imposed on this acquisition were to operate the acquired mines as separate businesses and with commercial objectives; to operate the mines using companies incorporated, headquartered and managed in Australia, under a predominantly Australian management team; to maintain or increase production and employment at Century, Rosebery and Golden Grove mines; to pursue growth in Century and Rosebery mines; and to reopen the Avebury mine and develop the Dugald River mine, subject to economic conditions. The Minmetals revised proposal is for Golden Grove, Century, Rosebery, Avebury and Dugald River mining operations in Australia. These produce zinc, lead, copper and silver, which are priced with reference to the London Metal Exchange. What do we know about Minmetals? It is a state controlled corporation, engaged in both the production and the trading of minerals and metals, including copper, aluminium, tungsten, tin, lead, zinc and nickel. The list of Chinese companies or Chinese government related bodies involved in the commodity sector has been necessary to further investment and development of our commodities, but we must always be extremely vigilant. Certainly, the Chinalco acquisition, of up to 14.99 per cent of the shares of Rio Tinto's London-listed arm, received the support of Colin Barnett, Premier of Western Australia. However, when Rio Tinto joined BHP to exclude the Chinese, that was opposed by the state Premier. As has been stated by most Australian leaders, these decisions are best taken with the strongest consideration of the national interest to either allow or reject the foreign acquisition. It is certainly the case that there will be occasions when foreign investment is necessary to achieve the strategic objectives and to ensure the capital exists to get the job done. In concluding, I appreciate the need for this bill. I would, however, say that we should be very careful about every increase in stockholding and control by foreign businesses, and particularly careful when sovereign funds are involved. We have seen not only the different ways various countries operate and deal with people in their direct foreign investments in this country, as I mentioned before, but also that so much of the investment that has come from the bigger investors in this country-the US, the UK, Germany and Japan-is very much from private enterprise. We should always be very careful when we have the involvement of sovereign funds, or when bodies, organisations or businesses are closely controlled or connected with governments of foreign nations; we should be very careful about looking at the detail of where they invest and how they invest. So I welcome this bill and I welcome the changes that may be required in the future, which will make sure that we are always protected and that the national interest is always protected.",34
14,Mr BRADBURY,MAIN COMMITTEE,"I rise in support of the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Amendment Bill 2009, which seeks to make changes to the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act that has been in place since 1975 as amended. It is an important act because it seeks to achieve a balance between some competing concerns. First and foremost is the need to ensure that we attract foreign direct investment into our country, and there are important reasons why that is necessary, which I will come to shortly. The act is about balancing the need for foreign direct investment with the national interest; is about providing a basis upon which the Treasurer, working with the Foreign Investment Review Board, can determine whether or not proposals, where they may affect control over a particular business or asset, are the national interest. It is important to note that this particular bill seeks to close off one of those avenues that was previously left uncorrected: a potential loophole that certain individuals, businesses or corporations abroad may have been able to take advantage of with respect to particular financing arrangements, whether it be in the form of convertible notes or other instruments where ownership may not be transferred until some later point in time. In essence, the proposals contained within this amendment seek to ensure that the anticipated ultimate ownership reality that might pertain to those particular financing arrangements be taken into account up front when determining whether or not a particular proposal might trigger the interest of the Treasurer and the Foreign Investment Review Board when determining if a proposal is consistent with or potentially a threat to the national interest. These are important amendments. They are important because they go to the integrity of the regime that we have in place and it is important to maintain the integrity of that regime because it acknowledges the importance of foreign direct investment, but it also acknowledges that there need to be limits to the extent of that investment, and those limits are to be determined by the national interest. Foreign capital is important for our growth and for jobs in our country. I have many discussions with constituents in my community and there is often much apprehension when it comes to the issue of foreign investment. One of the things that is often not understood when it comes to the issue of it foreign investment is that it is an essential requirement for our economy to continue to grow. There are some sectors in particular where we rely upon foreign investment to an even greater extent, and I will come to some in of those shortly. But international capital opens up new investment opportunities and helps to develop Australian industries. Foreign direct investment brings new job opportunities for Australians, new innovation and skills development, new technologies and the promotion of competition amongst our industries. It is important to understand the impact of foreign direct investment in Australia. Foreign investment is particularly important because we are a capital hungry nation and because we do not have the capital available here onshore to invest in those areas that require that investment and that attention. Foreign investment creates jobs and boosts our productivity. One in four jobs in the mining industry, for example, rely on foreign investment. One in eight private sector jobs in Australia are in foreign owned businesses and, as of March 2009, total foreign investment has contributed more than $1,700 billion to our national economy. There are some misconceptions in the community as to where foreign direct investment into Australia is coming from. If we look at the figures provided by the Foreign Investment Review Board in its 200708 annual report, we see that, by a long distance, the biggest source country is the United States of America. US proposed inward investment of $49.5 billion represented, in that particular year, about 26 per cent of approved total investment. So a significant amount-about a quarter-of foreign capital coming into Australia is coming from the United States. The other key countries from which foreign investment is coming into Australia include the United Kingdom, Germany, Singapore and Switzerland. These countries accounted for a significant amount of foreign direct investment into Australia 2007-08, with the UK accounting for 17 per cent, Germany, seven per cent; Singapore, six per cent; and Switzerland, five per cent. One sector where foreign direct investment is more important than most is in the mineral resources sector. Mineral exploration and development as a sector accounts for a significant proportion of the foreign direct investment that our country attracts. If we look we can see that, in 2007-08, foreign direct investment accounted for $64.3 billion in approvals. This is important because it is driving jobs in that sector. One in four tralian workers in the mining sector is employed as a result of foreign direct investment. This is an issue that some attention has been drawn to in recent times. I saw an editorial in the Australian last week which said, ‘Australia has always needed foreign investment to develop its potential as a resources exporter, and will need much more investment in the future.' And that is true. In fact, that editorial was making reference to a speech that had been given, I think the night before, by Marius Kloppers, the chief executive of BHP Billiton. Mr Kloppers gave a speech which I intend to quote from at some length because I think his comments are relevant and important to this discussion. He said in a speech to the Lowy Institute on Wednesday, 18 November: Foreign direct investment, or FDI, in major national resources will always be a sensitive issue, and those sensitivities increase when investors have close connections with foreign governments. To my mind, the FDI debate in Australia often misses the critical investment issue. Capital sources to fund resource projects are limited, primarily due to a mismatch between the risk appetites of some funding sources and the inherent riskiness in the projects themselves. The Australian banks are hesitant to take the lead on syndicating loans for very large projects because they fear that the syndication market may leave them over-exposed, a genuine concern in given recent conditions. Foreign banks have shown more willingness to lend … … … … The Australian bond market (another typical source of debt funding for companies) has always been stunted, forcing many companies to issue bonds on foreign markets, at a higher cost. Existing shareholders can be a source of equity, and have been tapped extensively by many companies, from all sectors, through this downturn. While this can be effective as a tactical source of funds, it is not a long-term solution. What we see from that speech that Mr Kloppers gave is recognition that the continued Aus- growth and development of our mineral resources sector, which is critical if we are to continue to meet demand and maintain market share in this sector internationally, and our competitiveness really does rely upon our having access to capital and that that access to capital, for the reasons that he outlines-and a number of reasons are outlined there in terms of the nature of our bond market and also the lack of risk appetite on the part of Australian banks-means that if companies seek to further exploit, explore and develop their mineral resource capabilities in this country they need to seek access to capital from offshore. In doing so, they are able to achieve greater growth and more jobs in Australia. Of course, there is a balancing act, and that is what the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act is all about: trying to ensure that there is a balance between the need for foreign investment and what is in the national interest. This particular set of amendments seeks only to tighten up, if you like, what factors are to be taken into account when determining whether there is a threat of the sort that should be assessed as to whether or not it is a threat to the national interest. I should make mention of the fact that, as a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, I have been involved in an inquiry in productivity in the Australian economy. Last Friday, we received evidence from the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy as part of that inquiry. We heard from Michael Catchpole, the CEO, and Monika Sarder, the manager, in relation to some of the issues pertaining to productivity and its measurement in respect of the resources sector. I will quote from the submission that that organisation made to the inquiry. There is a reference to the ‘challenges of increasing remoteness, depth and depleting quality of ore reserves' and the impact that has had on the overall measurement of productivity growth within that sector. I make the point that this really does underline some of the challenges that we do face in the resources sector-that is, owing to the depth, the remoteness and the depleting quality of our resources, more and more investment needs to be undertaken in order to extract the materials that we know are in demand internationally. That is why it is important that we ensure that companies trying to exploit those resources have the capacity to do so by having access to the capital they need. It is an important point to understand because we have all been beneficiaries of the minerals resource sector boom in this country. People employed in electorates such as Cowan-the member for Cowan has now left the chamber but spoke very passionately about the jobs in his electorate-and other parts of the country have been direct beneficiaries. In my electorate the same numbers of mining jobs are not available, but clearly overall living standards have improved and people have benefited greatly from the impact of the mining boom, whether through greater revenue collection for government, allowing it to pursue high priorities or bring forward priorities that might not otherwise have been delivered upon or, through the tax and transfer system, to deliver benefits or accommodation to taxpayers in other parts of the country. As Australians, we all recognise the importance of our resources sector and we understand that it is an important platform for future growth in this country. That is why it is important to ensure that we do not lose market share. Many people close to the sector are making the point that as a nation we must be careful not to take for granted the investment that we are receiving from this sector. If we do that it will be at our own peril. The consequences will be, ultimately, a loss of market share, and to lose market share is to begin to give away some of the comparative advantage that we have as a nation. So it is critical that we ensure a competitive and efficient resources sector. Central to ensuring that competitiveness and efficiency is access to capital, and if that capithings tal cannot be sourced from within our shores then as a nation our aspirations and ambitions for growth require us to seek capital elsewhere. But when we do so it is important that we do so in a way that does not compromise the national interest. That is why these amendments, which seek to strengthen the provisions of the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act, will ensure that as a nation we can continue to strike a balance between having a regime that attracts foreign direct investment and ensuring that the national interest continues to prevail. I commend the bill.",38
15,Mr KATTER,MAIN COMMITTEE,"I rise to speak on the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Amendment Bill 2009, which is a subject very near and dear to my own heart. I live in a little town called Cloncurry, and we would have no sealed road connecting us to the coast if it were not for Mount Isa and the giant mineral deposits that were discovered about 100 kilometres west of Cloncurry. Cloncurry probably would not have even warranted a railway line. Most certainly, in our day and age you would never in a million years have had a railway line built by the government to a place like Cloncurry. It was built at the time by what we would today call a corrupt allocation of shares and it was rebuilt with an allocation of shares to the Queensland cabinet. So it was built and then rebuilt only because large parcels of shares were given to the various ministers in the government at the time. That mine languished for 30 years. There was no real production there in the first quarter of the century until the Americans came in. They brought three things-markets, somewhere to sell the product; technology and know-how, which, arguably, we did have in Australia at that time but were never applied to Mount Isa; and capital expenditure. Mount Isa did not have any of those three when Julius Kruttschnitt arrived there. His technology and know-how were equal to that of BHP, but BHP were not interested in opening up a mine that far away and the Americans saw a possibility that no Australian saw. With it came huge employment for north-west Queensland. In fact I started my first job there. In those days we had an enlightened government and we paid virtually no tax. As an unskilled labourer I was on the equivalent of about $110,000 in today's money. The miners were paid the equivalent of about $370,000 a year in today's money. That was really a marvellous thing. Many young people were able to buy cattle stations, sugar cane farms or whatever captured their fancy. Many of them got into the tourism industry in Cairns in the early days with the money they had made working at Mount Isa for two, three or four years. If the government had seen fit to say, ‘We are not going to allow foreign investment or foreign companies into Australia,' then large parts of Australia and our economy would simply not exist today. Senator Joyce went to my home town of Cloncurry and gave a speech there recently. I do not criticise Senator Joyce. He is one of the really good guys, in my opinion. But Senator Joyce is a great proponent of opposing Chinese investment. The Dugald River facility, north of Cloncurry, has been there now for close to 40 years. The Dugald River copper, silver, lead and zinc deposits were found some 40 years ago. They were found to be very extensive reserves. I quote from the annual report to shareholders by Conzinc Riotinto-or Rio Tinto, as it was at that stage. It says: ‘As always, the Dugald River resource remains one of our most important resources and one of the world's most important resources.' I think I am the only person in this parliament that has any experience in mining. I mined my own mines. I found, developed and produced from my own little mines and I also worked as a labourer, off and on, for mining companies, so I can speak with some considerable authority in this field. No matter how many times you drill it, you never really know whether the ore is in an ore body until you start mining it, so you have to commit yourself to $100 million worth of expenditure on the basis of a dozen or two dozen drill holes. Let me be very specific. At Century mine, which has the richest zinc deposits in world history-not the biggest but the richest in world history-they drilled the entire hill except for one section at the back where there was no mineralisation. The wet came early and they could not get the drilling rigs out, so they found no payable ore whatsoever and they had put out millions of dollars on the drilling program. But there was the little section at the back where there was no mineralisation. They said, ‘Well, we can't get drilling rigs out so we may as well use them instead of having them sitting there doing nothing,' so they drilled that sector and they found the richest deposits of zinc in the world, which have been a great contributor to the economy of that area. We have got electricity into a corner of the world where we would never have got electricity, we have had upgraded roads that we would never have got upgraded and, for our first Australian population right up in the gulf country north-west sector, we have 70 jobs for people who would never have been able to get those jobs, so it has been a wonderful thing for us. Dugald River will be a wonderful thing for Cloncurry. But, outside the Chinese, I cannot see any other group-and I am a person who tenaciously believes, as I will go on in this speech to assert to the House, that there are decisions that a government has to take and they are not easy decisions. There are some times when I would be implacably opposed, and it is to the disgrace of the last government and, to some degree, the current government, even though they have only been there for two minutes, that they have allowed takeovers to occur. But clearly, in the case of Dugald River, you have had an ore body sitting there for 40 years and noone has done anything about developing it. The state government had laws on the books put there by the great Ted Theodore: ‘Use it or lose it.' You are not allowed to sit on an ore body and do nothing with it. But it is a hard decision for government to make because a company can say, quite rightly, that they are looking more closely at the ore body: ‘It's a complicated ore body. We may not be able to process it as successfully as we would have hoped.' Let me just give you a quick example. The Greenvale nickel mine went broke because the content of silicon had not been properly analysed. For those of you who are not fathe miliar with silicon, after diamond it is the hardest rock known to man. When they put it into the crushers, they did not crush the nickel ore; the silicon in the nickel ore was crushing the crushers and destroying them. They found ways of overcoming this, but in the meantime the company went broke. Vam was the third biggest mining company in Australia at the time of the metals boom in the sixties. One of their major deposits was at Gunpowder. They drilled at a particular place and intersected a characteristic ore body at a depth of, let us say, 100 feet and then, a kilometre away, they put drill holes down again and again intersected the ore at exactly the same level they had intersected it in the other place. They extrapolated then that they had an ore body stretching for a kilometre, which was quite a reasonable conclusion for them to come to based upon the evidence they had. One would say it was an absolute conclusion: they could say conclusively that they had an ore body that was a kilometre long. When they started mining-they had a bit more money-they drilled in the centre and they got no ore body at all. In Charters Towers, you can clearly see where a block has moved. You have an ore body here and an ore body there, and they were a continuous ore body at some stage, but a block in between has simply moved downwards in what we know now as the Brilliant Deeps. Of its very nature, mining is a very, very risky business. The markets, of course, are a roller-coaster. We had a situation where the prices three years ago were double what the prices were five years ago. The metal price doubled. The metal price, you can say now, has halved, or gone down 50 per cent, but it has really gone back to what it was six or seven years ago. So you also have to ride the roller-coaster of the markets. In the case of Dugald River, I am a very strong and enthusiastic supporter of the nese coming in both there and at Centurythe old zinc deposits now belong to them. We have virtually run out of ore body there, but we have very extensive phosphate deposits there. For an Australian company trying to break into the world markets with that phosphate it would be very, very difficult indeed. But if you have a deal with the Indians, such as Joe Gutnick has with Legend's phosphate in that area, then you have connected into world's biggest consumer group except for China. Similarly, at Century, I am very, very optimistic that what has been the richest mine in the world will become one of the premier phosphate deposits in the world, but I dare say that nobody in Australia is going to develop those. We have four of the 24 world phosphate deposits in north-west Queensland. Only one was ever developed and that was the Duchess phosphate deposit, developed by Western Mining Corporationand even that involved 20 years of painful leaning on them by the Queensland government: ‘Use it or lose it.' I was the minister leaning upon WMC to proceed with that. There would be no Mt Isa and no Century if, the case for foreign investment having been put, the government had then said, ‘You can't come in.' Foreign corporations developed these mines. Australians had 40 years in which to do it, and we never did it. These are clear-cut cases. For the coal mining industry, if the government had said, ‘No, you are a foreign corporation, you can't come in, Mr Japan,' then we would have had no mining industry in Australia. The man responsible for the Australian export coal industry was Sir Leslie Thiess, who at all times had the closest of close relationships with the Japanese. When he started mining, it was through a combined company with the Japanese. We were vilified as a government at the time for allowing the Japanese-and we are going back to a period not that long after the Chi- Second World War-to get involved The people who were running Australia were men who had fought in that war. My father was in this place; he was a captain in the Army in the Second World War. My uncle fought at Milne Bay in the Second World War. These were people who had great sensitivities-and the Australian population had great sensitivities-towards the Japanese. Bjelke-Petersen showed very great strength the of character in standing his ground. He was of Germanic background-Danish, technically, but of a Germanic background. He zinc showed an awful lot of courage. Of course, the famous Jack MCEwen was the person who really spearheaded the Japanese involvement. Without the Japanese we would have had no markets for our coal. There was no-one in the world to sell it to. America was awash with coal; they did not need it. God has been good to Europe as far as coal goes. We had no technology, either, and we needed to bring the Americans in for that as well. Finally, we needed the capital, and we could not get any Australians to invest after the crash of the mining boom in the sixties. Everyone was terrified to touch mining, so these men could raise no money. These people built most of the Snowy and half of the great developments that you see as Australia today, including the giant highway from Geelong to Melbourne and the casino in Townsville. But even this Thiess family-this company-as big as they were, were run to their last cent in developing those coal resources. If they had not got the Japanese to come in on time and did not have a government that was positive towards the Japanese coming in, then it would have been a very sad day indeed for Thiess. I will now switch to the other side of the coin. And I am criticising the last government very stridently here. I fought like a tiger and took belated action to try to stop the takeover of Mt Isa Mines by Xstrata. The government remained totally unconvinced. During that period the six great mining companies in Australia all became foreign owned. The government sat on its hands while the six great mining companies of Australia were all taken over by foreign investors. The price of metals went up by nearly 300 per cent. A town like Mt Isa was costing $2,000 million a year to run-around about that figure-and they were just breaking even. When the price went to $6,000 million, there should have been $4,000 million profit for Australians. But there was not. For those who, like me, like looking at statistics, it is very curious that Australia is making profits at long last, as a trading nation, on what we buy and sell and yet, when the current account comes in, we are in a dreadful, desperate state. And that is because we are selling the product overseas; we get the money to come in and then we just write out a cheque to the owners of the company, who live in London or Geneva or New York or somewhere like that. Those cheques would have gone to Australia. Australia was cheated out of hundreds of thousands of millions of dollars because the last government allowed those six companies to go. In summary, these are not easy questions, and I think the government is probably setting it right here in admitting that they are not easy questions to answer. But to sit on your hands and idly say that every single foreigner who wants to come in here and buy shares can do so, because it will boost the share market price in Australia and people living in the big cities will make a big quid for themselves, is not an enlightened government position. We are moving to a slightly more enlightened position today, and we thank the government for that contribution.",41
16,Mr ZAPPIA,MAIN COMMITTEE,"I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Amendment Bill 2009, albeit that I have less than 60 seconds before question time. It is good to see some of the members of the opposition coming in here today. Hopefully they might be able to come in with some good news that they have reached agreement on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme amendments that we have been negotiating with them in good faith, because it is so important for our nation to get on with the implementation of that legislation. I do welcome the opportunity to speak on the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Amendment Bill because this bill, too, is in Australia's national interest. The purpose of the bill is to improve the integrity of Australia's foreign investment screening regime by ensuring that the government has the capacity to examine all investment proposals that could potentially be against Australia's national interest. The amendments are designed to capture foreign investments that have the potential to provide substantial influence",44
17,The SPEAKER,MAIN COMMITTEE,"Order! It being 2 pm, the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 97. The debate may be resumed at a later hour and the member for Makin will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA",45
18,Mr RUDD,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I inform the House that the Minister for Foreign Affairs will be absent from question time today as he is attending the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Trinidad and Tobago. The Minister for Trade will answer questions on his behalf. The Minister for Financial Services, Superannuation and Corporate Law and Minister for Human Services will be absent from question time this week as he is meeting with international funds and asset managers, as well as representatives from the UK government and the Financial Services Authority, in New York and London. The Treasurer will answer questions in relation to financial services, superannuation and corporate law, while the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs will answer questions in relation to human services on his behalf. NA Asylum Seekers",45
19,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister inform the House as to the nature and status of the injuries sustained by both Australian personnel and asylum seekers in the recent riot at the Christmas Island tion centre?,45
20,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I am advised that at approximately 6.30 pm on Saturday, Christmas Island time, a disturbance took place among a group of detainees at the Christmas Island Immigration Detention Centre. The disturbance was brought under control within about 30 minutes, with the assistance of the Australian Federal Police. I am further advised that, following containment of the incident, the centre is calm and all the detainees have been briefed by departmental officers. Departmental officials are currently investigating the circumstances of the disturbance. The Australian Federal Police is also conducting an investigation. If a detainee on Christmas Island has committed a serious offence, this will be taken into consideration as part of the assessment as to whether or not they are granted a visa. There were a number of injuries sustained, with 43 individuals receiving medical treatment. I am advised that five of the detention provider staff sustained minor injuries. On the matter of mandatory detention on Christmas Island, the opposition and the House will be aware that the government's policy on mandatory detention and offshore processing has been constant since the government was elected to office. That will continue to be our policy into the future. Emissions Trading Scheme Mrs D'ATH (2.03 pm)-My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister update the House on the progress of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme as the centrepiece of Australia's efforts to tackle climate change?",45
21,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question, as I am sure all members and those listening to the debate today are concerned about the future of acdetention on climate change. This week in the Australian parliament we are down to the business end of deciding what our future national action will be on climate change. For the parliament there can no longer be any delay. Let us face the basic environmental and economic fact that we are the hottest and driest continent on earth-or one of themand that the impacts will be felt here first hardest of all continents on earth. Therefore, it is in our national interest that we act locally on climate change. It is in our national interest that we also act globally on climate change. It is in the planet's interest that we do so as well. The alternative is simply unsustainable. To ignore the science also means to fail in our fiduciary duties as a nation and fail in our fiduciary duties as international leaders towards the international community and its future. It is simply unsustainable for us to turn and look our kids and grandkids in the eye and say, ‘We didn't step up to the plate when we had a historic opportunity to do so.' The time to act globally on climate change has come. Let us put all this into some context. It is now more than 30 years since the first World Climate Conference was called and governments were called on to act to guard against the consequences of dangerous climate change. It is 20 years since the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was formed and produced its first report. It is 17 years since the international community acknowledged the importance of tackling climate change at the Rio Earth Summit and created the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. That is where the global consensus has been emerging over the last 20 to 30 years. It has also been a long time since we first began the debate here about implementing an emissions trading scheme within Australia. Again, putting this into its general context, around the world a very large number of countries have brought in emissions trading schemes. Twenty-eight countries are already operating emissions trading schemes. There are six major economies moving towards emissions trading schemes and some 27 states in Canada and the United States are also moving towards emissions trading schemes. Here in Australia, former Senator and Hill, the former Minister for the Environment, said in July this year: Well, I started work on a potential cap and trade for Australia almost a decade ago; the political time wasn't right then. Perhaps it's getting closer … But basically, as with most Western nations, I think a cap and trade is the way to go. If you look at the rest of the action that has been undertaken since then, again, it puts into historical context that the time to act on this has come and the time for further delay has, frankly, well and truly gone. In 1999 the Australian Greenhouse Office released six discussion papers on climate change and emissions trading. In 2000 and 2002 two further discussion papers were released on how we could bring about an emissions trading scheme. In 2007, the then secretary of the Prime Minister's department, Dr Shergold, provided the Prime Ministerial Task Group on Emissions Trading's Shergold report. And, of course, at the last election, the previous government also committed itself to introducing an emissions trading scheme. These are the facts. Since the election of this government, we have sought to bring this legislation to fruition. We began in June 2008, when the CPRS green paper was released. There was the Garnaut review in September 2008 and the CPRS white paper, released in December 2008. Then in March this year, nearly nine months ago, we produced draft legislation for the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. We have also introduced the renewable energy target legislation, boosting to 20 per cent the amount of electricity to be produced by renewable sources by 2020. We have had countless inquiries over a long, long time, we have had countless Senate investigations, we have had countless industry consultations, and the time for action has well and truly come. That is why we must rise to the occasion and rise to the challenge and get this deal done this week in this parliament. This week the Australian parliament reaches the culmination of 30 years worth of science, some 10 years of development of a cap-and-trade scheme for Australia and some two years of specific work on the design character of a carbon pollution reduction scheme. This week Minister Wong will bring the proposed deal to the cabinet of Australia for its consideration. Following cabinet endorsement, the deal will be put to our-that is, the Australian Labor Party-party room so that it has whole-of-government support. Tomorrow morning, the government's endorsed package and the draft amendments will be provided to the opposition for their final consideration. The deal that we put to the opposition is a deal for this week. The government is focused on passing the legislation this week. The reason for that is that the clock is ticking for us all. I say to those opposite: the government is willing to extend the time available for parliamentary sittings should it be necessary to bring about a vote on the scheme this week. There are times in our national politics when all Australians require us to reach beyond the normal partisan divide and to frame an agreement in the national interest. I believe we have reached such a time in Australia. We have reached such a time in Australia this week. I believe that climate change represents a challenge of our times to which we in the parliament must rise. So I appeal to all those on opposition benches who are people of goodwill who wish to see the passage of climate change legislation to look beyond our normal partisan divide and join with the government to see the passage of this Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme for the future. It is necessary for Australia, it is necessary for our national action, it is necessary to underpin our global action. I believe the eyes of the nation are on all of us in this House, government and opposition benches alike, this week. Asylum Seekers",45
22,Ms LEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister inform the House: what is the capacity of the Christmas Island detention centre and how many asylum seekers are currently in the detention centre? Will the Prime Minister also inform the House when he expects the Australian government will have to start processing asylum seekers on the mainland, at Darwin?",47
23,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question. First of all, my advice is that we have 1,188 people accommodated there. Second, the capacity of the centre as it currently stands is 1,400. I am further advised that the department of immigration has recently sourced some 70 demountables to increase capacity further-I understand, by some 200 beds-by the end of December. I also understand that the department is exploring additional measures to increase capacity should that be required in the future. I also say to the honourable member in response to her question that, on the 10-hectare site available, the advice of the department is that there is room for that to occur. The second part of the honourable member's question goes to the processing of individuals on the mainland. I say to the honourable member that our policy is first and foremost mandatory detention; and, secondly, when it comes to the interdiction of vessels offshore, that we will seek to process those through mandatory detention on Christmas Island. As I have said already in answer to questions in this place, the immigration minister has already put on the record other contingency arrangements that have been put in place. So far, in the time of this government, I am advised that one vessel has reached the Australian mainland. All others have so far been interdicted offshore. That is why they have all been processed on Christmas Island. In the period of the previous government, I am advised about 15 per cent of vessels in fact made it to the Australian mainland and brought about a different set of circumstances for the processing of vessels at that time. Emissions Trading Scheme",47
24,Ms NEAL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. Why is the introduction of a carbon pollution reduction scheme such a vital economic reform for Australia's future?,48
25,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Robertson for her question. The rationale for the CPRS is very simple and it is very clear. By taking action now, we avoid larger costs for future generations, something everyone in this House should be concerned about, because climate change is a very serious economic challenge to future prosperity. It would be wonderful to think that it does not exist, but it does, and hard-headed governments must deal with it-and hard-headed governments around the world are dealing with it. They are dealing with it because it is an economic threat, not just an environmental threat. Australia has more to lose that just about every other developed nation, so there is an urgency in this country to deal with it, and we must, because every tonne of carbon that is pumped into the atmosphere imposes a cost on our community. It is a cost that is felt right across the community and right across the economy: hotter days, water restrictions, bushfires and drought. Of course, that is denied by so many opposite. But we are now experiencing only a fraction of the costs that will be left for future generations if we do not act, and that is why we must act. We now have and have had for some time the modelling from the Garnaut review. I would like to go through some of those conclusions because I think they are worth reviewing as we go into this debate through the next 24 hours. Increased temperature and reduced rainfall will cause substantial reductions in agricultural output. That should be obvious to just about anybody. The modelling forecasts a 92 per cent decline in irrigated agricultural production in the Murray-Darling Basin by the end of the century. Unmitigated climate change would disproportionately affect the price of food. Relative to other goods, Garnaut found that the cost of food could increase by more than 10 per cent. There are fundamental bread-and-butter impacts from climate change and long-term damage to the economy that many opposite simply will not face up to. They just want to put their head in the sand and wish it was not happening. But governments committed to hard-headed reforms, which protect our prosperity, know that in these circumstances we must act. Nobody else can act. We cannot leave it up to voluntary groups, welfare groups or volunteers. There is only one group in a society that can act in these circumstances and, of course, that is government. That is what members of this House are elected to do, to represent the community and protect the national economic interest. There is so much of this debate that reminds me of debates of earlier times about the hard-headed decisions that were taken, which were not necessarily popular at the time but which have ensured our prosperity. I well remember the debate about the introduction of national superannuation and how many on that side of the House went around and said, ‘We cannot do this, it is a tax and it is a cost to business.' But it was right for the nation. As we go forward we have discovered just how important that long-term reform was to our economic prosperity. It has been demonstrated, particularly in the past 12 months, because that pool of superannuation savings has been absolutely critical in ensuring finance in this economy as we go forward. But there were plenty of people who were not prepared to take the hard decision back when that long-term reform was introduced and many of them were on that side of the House. What we have got to do is put aside the short-term scaremongering. What we have got to do is put in place policies for the term national interest that will look after ture generations and of course do the right thing by our economy. Those opposite have got 24 hours to make up their minds. I hope they think long and hard about their position. I hope they don't do what they did with the economic stimulus, which was a short-term populist thing to oppose it in this House. I hope they don't do that. I hope they don't do what they did over the years when they did not invest in infrastructure. I hope they face up to the long term responsibility and acknowledge that action is required. I hope they don't do what they have been doing recently by opposing in this House essential savings measures. Those opposite always take the easy decisions. What I hope is that there are enough in the party room that acknowledge the national interest and get behind this important long term reform for our children and for the future prosperity of our national economy. Asylum Seekers",48
26,Dr STONE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister tell the House if the asylum seekers medivaced following the riot on Christmas Island will now be offered a special deal like the Oceanic Viking asylum seekers?,49
27,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Once the individuals have been appropriately treated, I am sure they will then be processed consistent with those procedures which apply to Christmas Island. That is the first point. The second point I would make in response to the honourable member's question is her interesting interview this morning about where in fact these individuals should be processed. It is a little bit confusing but, when asked about it this morning by Jon Faine on the radio, on the one hand you said that the opposition is saying that ‘we should continue some sort of processing without allowing people to land longin Australia,' now you are also, at the same fu- time, saying that we ‘should use facilities that are on the mainland'. Then the member for Murray goes on in her answer: There comes a time when a small place like Christmas Island simply cannot continue to have thousands upon thousands stacked up, even at the big facility that Christmas Island was when it was built. If you do not take them to Christmas Island, I suggest that the only alternative being advocated by the member for Murray is to bring them to the Australian mainland. Our policy is very simple: it is mandatory detention and it is based on processing offshore on Christmas Island consistent with the arrangements we have put in place for some time. Climate Change",49
28,Mr TURNOUR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Defence Personnel, Materiel and Science, and the Minister Assisting the Minister for Climate Change. Will the minister outline the significant scientific consensus that has developed around climate change? What has the government done in response to the science and what is preventing further action based on the scientific evidence? Mr Robert-We have your names, Greg.",49
29,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have not hidden my identity. I thank the member for Leichhardt for his question. He has taken a very keen interest in this issue given the vulnerability of Far North Queensland to climate change. This is, in any view, a momentous week potentially for those in Australia who support taking action on climate change. As the Prime Minister was saying a short while ago, if agreement can be finalised with the opposition then we can achieve as a nation a historic economic and environmental reform. It is important to remind ourselves why the government is so committed to acting on climate change. It is because the scientific case for action on climate change is very clear. The climate is warming and we need to act respond to it. In 1988, governments formed the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to analyse the peer reviewed scientific work of global scientists to inform policy making decisions. The IPCC has released four assessment reports that have confirmed the science and informed the international efforts science: to take action. The most recent such assessment report, released in 2007, has of course been informing the Copenhagen process. That report, the fourth assessment report, found that the observed warming of the climate is unequivocal, that the observed warming is very likely to be due to human activity and that projected warming of between 1.1 to 6.4 degrees centigrade can be expected by 2100. These findings have been both confirmed and strengthened by subsequent world leading scientific societies. Labor accepts the science and that is why the government has a strong record of action ing with climate change. We have ratified the Kyoto protocol. We have committed to international negotiations. We have commissioned the Garnaut climate change review. We have produced green and white papers. We have had extensive consultations with industry and environmental groups. We have set strong targets for emissions reductions. We have passed the renewable energy legislation. We have commenced the largest ever investment in energy efficiency. We have committed significant resources to explore carbon capture and storage and solar technology. We have committed to implement the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, and we need the CPRS so that we can begin the difficult work of reducing our greenhouse emissions. To that end, we need those opposite to support action on climate change. The government has been working hard to achieve agreement. But the opposition remains split into two camps and divided on the science. The member for Warringah has attracted a bit of attention in recent days. He has chopped and changed camps on the Liberal side of politics and he has got an unusual take on the science. The member for Warringah had this to say on Lateline last week in relation to the If you look at Roman times, grapes grew up against Hadrian's Wall. In Medieval times they grew crops in Greenland and in the 1700s they had ice fairs on the Thames. I do not think I can explain it to the House, Mr Speaker. We would have to have some peer review of the source material to work that out. The member for Warringah also had this to say back in October in no lesser material than Pyrenees Advocate. He said: The argument on climate change is absolute crap. However the politics of this are tough for us. Eighty per cent of people believe climate change in dealis a real and present danger. So it is a political problem from the member for Warringah's point of view. The climate science, as he said, is ‘absolute crap' in his opinion. But in Australian on 19 October when the member for Warringah was in the other camp-that is, the camp supporting the Leader of the Opposition and attempts to negotiate an agreement-this is what he had to say: It could indeed help the outcome of the Copenhamade gen climate change talks if Australia agreed in advance not only to a carbon emission target also a mechanism to deliver it. That was a sound observation of course but it has been contradicted by a number of other statements. That is, as I have said, when the member for Warringah was in the Turnbull camp, wanting to negotiate. But now he seem to be in the Minchin camp, which is where in fairness he is probably most comfortable, fighting that international communist conspiracy out there. He has been attracted to that. I would leave the observations about the member for Warringah with no lesser authority than the Leader of the Opposition, who said this on 20 November, a few days ago, on the doors: Tony's expressed a number of views, each of which was at odds with the views he's expressed before. Say no more. Mr Speaker, as we approach this important and momentous moment when potentially the parliament is able to pass an emissions trading scheme and begin the hard work of emission reductions, all of those on that side of politics need to take responsibil- tionsity, stand up for what is right in the national interest and work with the government to reduce emissions. Asylum Seekers",49
30,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister inform the House whether he has approached directly any other countries, asking them to resettle any of the 78 asylum seekers from the Oceanic Viking? Which countries have been approached and what has been their response?",51
31,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Curtin for her question. The answer to the honourable member's question is, no, I have no such approach. Furthermore, I say to the honourable member for Curtin, consisbut tent with government arrangements, which were long in place when she was a minister in the previous Howard government, that what normally occurs through the UNHCR and relevant governments around the world is that when it comes to the resettlement of individual applicants for refugee status either in places like Indonesia or elsewhere, individual countries are approached through the UNHCR for assistance. I imagine that is what will occur in this case. I imagine that is what will occur in future cases as well. In answer to the honourable member's question, though, I have made no such approach myself. I also say that, having reflected on",51

33,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That was the question I was asked. I simply respond to the question as I was asked. I say to the member for Murray, the member for Farrer and the member for Curtin, the reason for them asking this question goes back of course to the Ronaldson doctrine on the following. Remember what the Ronaldson doctrine is; you don't get news stories by trying to change percepMs Julie Bishop-I rise on a point of order, Mr Speaker. The Prime Minister is straying into areas that have nothing to do with the question and so therefore the point of order is relevance.",51

35,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, the question went to the handling of asylum seekers. It went to the resettlement of asylum seekers. It went to a range of questions that I have been asked this morning and I am sure the deliberations between the member for Curtin and Senator Ronaldson have been of interest to many members here.",51

37,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will resume her place. The Prime Minister is responding to the question. I will listen carefully to his answer.,52
38,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. If in fact there was a genuine debate being marshalled by those opposite about the normal resettlement procedures available under the refugees convention, then of course we would be seized to engage every element of that debate. But we know that it is not. It is all about what the Ronaldson doctrine is about, which is: you don't get news stories by trying to change perceptions; you get them by reinforcing stereotypes. That is what is going on here. Global Food Security",52
39,Mr ADAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. How has the government been engaging internationally on the connections between climate change and food security?",52
40,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Lyons for the question. Last week representatives of governments from around the world gathered for the Global Food Summit, where we dealt with projections that by 2050 the global food supply will have to be in the order of 70 per cent higher than it is now. There are many challenges to food security around the world, including investing in agricultural development; increasing demand as a result of increasing global population; changes in land use; the need for improved market access; and, of course, climate change. While certainly not the only issue for global food security, climate change is one of the issues with which the nations of the world is wrestling. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon put it best when he said ‘there can be no food security without climate security'. As you go through the different continents of the world the challenges are different, whether it be drought, like our farmers in Australia are dealing with; the increase in the number of major weather events; or rising sea levels and the various pressures that occur there. In Asia, for example, a reduction of between 2.5 per cent and 10 per cent in crops is expected by 2020. Most recently, the Philippines has been experiencing some of the challenges that come with an increase in major weather events-the recent floods caused by typhoons Ondoy and Pepeng and the impact they have had on the rice crop. Can we say that those individual typhoons were climate change ones? No. But what we can say is that it is consistent with projections of an increased number of major weather events occurring throughout the world. At that event I was fortunate to co-chair with the Prime Minister of Bangladesh a round-table on the connections between climate change and food security. In Bangladesh they are dealing with increased floods and rising sea levels-and what is often forgotten is that rising sea levels mean not merely a loss of agricultural land but also an increase in salinity levels as you go further upstream on river systems. The challenges of food security are many, and climate change is one of them. But it is one of the areas where the nations of the world need to act, and Australia needs to be among them. Asylum Seekers",52
41,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Would the Prime Minister tell the House whether he regards the recent surge in people smuggling as a serious problem? There have been 54 boats since he weakened our border protection policies in August 2008. If so, what is his plan to stop the people smugglers, or has his election promise to turn back the boats now become telling Australians to just get used to it?",53
42,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is good to see that the Ronaldson doctrine has now been elevated to the Leader of the Opposition-which is in the great Australian newspaper published email entitled ‘Digging dirt' and says, ‘You don't get news stories by trying to change perceptions, you get them by reinforcing stereotypes.' That is what they are on about here. The Leader of the Opposition's question goes to numbers. I would draw his attention to the following numbers. When it comes to the decrease in numbers worldwide from countries like Iraq, Afghanistan and Sri Lanka in the early 2000s, they were as follows: between 2001 and 2003 the number of Iraqis claiming asylum globally dropped by 50 per cent, from 52,000 down to 27,000; the number from Afghanistan dropped by 73 per cent; and the number from Sri Lanka dropped by 61 per cent. This is the period in which those opposite say that, uniquely as a consequence of their particular approaches to the Pacific solution-temporary protection visas and the like-there was some ‘unique success' in this country. They must have been uniquely successful in multiple countries around the world, because those figures are global numbers coming out of each of those countries. All of these global factors were at work and the numbers out of all three countries were coming down. The opposition then latch on to it and say, ‘It's all because of us.' And then of course we go to volume 2, which is what has been happening between 2005 and 2008. Guess what? The reverse occurs. The global increase in the number of Iraqis seeking asylum has gone up by 193 per cent. Secondly, the number of Afghans claiming asylum globally has gone up by 139 per cent. Furthermore, the number of Sri Lankans has gone up in that same period of time by 72 per cent-and the reason why that is occurring worldwide is because of security factors alive within those countries.",53
43,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister will resume his seat.,53
44,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, the question was about numbers. I believe I am answering that question. Mr Turnbull- Mr Speaker, on a point of order on relevance: the question was about whether the Prime Minister has a plan to stop the people smuggling, and he clearly has none.",53
45,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. The question went to two or three parts, and the Prime Minister is responding to the question. Mr Albanese- Mr Speaker, on the point of order: on every question so far today from the opposition, they have stood up and, in the guise of moving a point of order, have just repeated the question.",53
46,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the House will resume his seat. The Prime Minister has the call.,53
47,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, the figures are as I have just described them. They are discomforting for those opposite because they actually go to what has happened globally, both in the early 2000s and recently. Of course, the Leader of the Opposition knows that he is engaging in an exercise which, on the facts, is simply unsustainable. Then we go to the question of policy responses. Here we have the policy responses announced by those opposite in their fourpoint plan on border protection which came out a week or so ago: 1.We will once again secure our borders. Look for the detail-‘We will once again secure our borders.' This is the same policy which in times past saw nearly 250 boats arrive in Australia carrying nearly 15,000 people-and they say, ‘We will once again secure our borders.' 2. All processing offshore. Someone should remind the member for Murray that that is their policy because on two occasions, one last week and one this week, we have had a bit of a ‘blippo'haven't we, Member for Murray?-as she could not quite remember the script. Then, three-here is one to hold the phone. Listen to this one; it is consistent with economy? what we have heard this morning: A compassionate and fair refugee and humanitarian program. Compassionate and fair. Well, hold the phone! That one is really worthy of gaining the newspaper headlines. Then, policy no. 4: A non-permanent visa for unauthorised arrivals. The temporary protection visa by another name; that which they have been speaking about for some weeks. This is their recommendation by way of a border protection policy. The temporary protection visa; what is its track record? After they brought it in we saw nearly 10,000 people arrive in this country. Subsequently, we saw 90 per cent of those granted TPVs being provided with permanent residence in Australia. That is the great magic being offered by temporary protection visas. Our approach is based on mandatory detention. Our approach is based on offshore processing on Christmas Island for vessels that we interdict on the high seas. Our policy is based on stringent ASIO assessment of the security profile of individuals. Our policy is based on stringent health assessment of the health profile of individuals. Our policy is based on those who are not deemed to have bona fide refugee status being sent back home as they have been already, to Sri Lanka and elsewhere. Our processes are also to apply the norms consistent with the UNHCR convention to which we are proud signatories. And we will not put kids behind razor wire. Training",53
48,Mr SYMON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Education, Employment and Workplace Relations and Social Inclusion. Will the Deputy Prime Minister update the House on the latest measures the government is taking to ensure Australia has the skills needed to transition to a low carbon",54
49,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Deakin for his question. I know that he, like me and members of the government, is concerned that this nation is ready for the challenges of the future, including of course the profound challenge of climate change. The science is in. The action that needs to be taken by this parliament this week is to pass the government's Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. Of course this measure is fundamental to this nation's cutting its carbon emissions and getting ready to meet the challenge of future climate change. Work is already under way on ensuring that skills and training are ready to meet the challenge of the future-the challenge of climate change. We of course know that adapting to a low carbon economy is going to change the way that we work and the way that we live. Consequently, the government is already moving to change skills and training so workers can have the skills they will need for this lowcarbon future. I am very pleased to report that on Friday, when I met with tertiary education and employment ministers from around nation, we were able to agree on our National Green Skills Agreement to ensure that training around the country has embedded in it the new skills that workers will need for a carbon constrained economy. This is an important agreement to changing the content of training packages for some of our most traditional trades. Obviously, some of our most traditional trades will need new green skills, whether it is motor mechanics learning to work on hybrid vehicles, whether it is plumbers learning to deal with the way in which people want to use waste water now, and whether it is electricians who are getting ready to deliver the newly designed buildings that will use less energy and less electricity, we want to embed these new green skills in training packages. This agreement ensures that for trade apprentices who commence training after 1 January next year these new green skills will be embedded in what they study so they are ready to take their place in a low carbon economy. This of course builds on work that the government has already done with an investment of $94 million to provide 50,000 young Australians with job and training opportunities in new green skills. Then of course it builds on the $200 million investment that we are making to upgrade TAFE institutes so they too are ready to teach the green skills that we will need in the future. The time for denying climate change has passed. The time for inaction has passed. We, as a nation, need to move forward. We need to make sure that working people in this nation have the skills they need for a low bon economy. We need to make sure this nation has in place a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and that is the task before this parliament this week. Health System",54
50,Mr OAKESHOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. With the target now set for population increases in Australia, with the well-known ageing population challenges we have right now, with debt at both the Commonwealth and state levels meaning tighter fiscal settings for forward budgets and with state governments consistently and frustratingly not following their own funding formulas within their own health departments-and, Prime Minister, this is at least as important as asylum seekers and at least as important as climate change-when can we expect real structural reform in health and hospital services in Australia for a network of services already struggling despite the obvious pressures on the near horizon.",55
51,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Lyne for his question. I recall very clearly my visit to Port Macquarie and the time. I spent with him and others speaking to the staff at Port Macquarie Base Hospital about their particular needs. The fact is that in Port Macquarie, as I was advised, you have a hospital which was essentially designed around what was estimated to be the needs for that region in the early nineties, and here we are at the end of the first decade of this century and its physical capacity has not been substantially increased. Mr Hockey-It should've stayed a private hospital.",55
52,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The interjection from the member for North Sydney is ‘It should've remained a private hospital.' I will not go into the details of the evolution of this one but can I say to the member for North Sydcar- ney, who has suddenly become an expert on these matters, and to the member for Lyne, who legitimately represents the interests of his constituents, that the entire saga which has gone before with this hospital, namely the evolution between private ownership and state ownership, has not been a happy one for the local constituents. That is what should drive all our concerns here. The member for Lyne raises a concern about when we will take structural action in relation to the reform of the health and hospital system and whether it will be substantial action-if I got his question correctly. As I said prior to the last election, the Australian people are sick and tired of a blame game between the Australian government and state governments on the future reform of the health and hospital system. Some basic facts need to be put before the parliament, the first of which is the ageing of our population. Secondly, there is the growth of our population. You have seen the projections referred to by the member for Lyne in his question: up to some 35 million people by midcentury. Thirdly, there is the exponential increase in the cost of pharmaceuticals for treating those within our health and hospital system. Fourthly, there is the woeful job that has been done in times past in properly planning for our health workforce requirements-our doctors, our nurses and our allied health professionals. All these things are bearing down on a health and hospital system which, in the advice of Christine Bennett, who delivered the National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission report not long ago, is a system now at tipping point. There are 750 public hospitals across the country. The figures when it comes to elective surgery and to treatment within clinically acceptable waiting times at accident and emergency have not seen any significant improvement over a long period of time. These are the facts. The question is: what proposals do we have before us and how can we change that for the future? What we have got before the Australian people and of course before the health and hospital community at the moment is two sets of strategic options. One, of course, involves a partial takeover of the system by the Australian government. The second is a two-stage full Australian government takeover of the entire system. They are the strategic options we are presented with. Each of the elements of primary healthcare reform-GPs, acute hospital care, post-acute care, aged care, dental care and mental health needs-are canvassed exhaustively within that report. Our process for making these decisions is as follows. We are going to have a meeting with the Council of Australian Governments next month and we will then, with the states and territories, discuss in detail the options that we have been presented with through that report and seek their direct response to what is canvassed in that report in addition to their statement of the strengths and weaknesses within their own systems. Secondly, we have also indicated that in the first part of 2010 we will then convene a further meeting of the Council of Australian Governments in order to bring forward our recommendations for future long-term policy reform. My view very simply-and I put this to the member for Lyne in terms of his question-is that the days for simply frittering around the edges on this debate have gone. What we actually need is a government prepared to step up to the plate with the states and territories and embark upon a long-term policy reform. ",55
53,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Right on cue, the member for Pyne interjects: when are we going to act! Ms Gillard-Member for Pyne?",56
54,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Member for Pyne, member for Sturt, the pining member for Pyne, the pining member for Sturt. For 12 years-I asked this question the other day-where was their healthcare reform plan? Where was their hospital reform plan?  about your promise?",56
55,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Was he the minister for health at some stage? Mr Albanese-No. He never made it that far.,57
56,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He never made it that far? I lost count of what he was responsible for, but can I say: for 12 years they did two things. Firstly, they pulled out a billion dollars from the public hospital system in Australia and, secondly, they put forward no reform plan at all for the future of our hospitals, for the ture of Australia-not one. All they did was play the old game: blame the states, make sure that you can whip it up into a frenzy prior to an election, get through, make sure that you did not cop any responsibility yourself and get home free. That was their approach. Ours is different. You have seen it in the Bennett commission report. That is the blueprint we have put out there. We are consulting with hospitals around the country at the moment and we will adhere to the timetable that we have foreshadowed, which is in close consultation with the states and territories, because the nation wants long-term hospital reform. We intend to deliver that in partnership with the states and territories. Climate Change: Emergency Management",57
57,Mr GIBBONS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Attorney-General. Is it the case that climate change is projected to lead to more severe heatwaves, intense cyclones and floods, severe storms, more extreme bushfires and sea level rises? What is the government doing to ensure that the emergency management sector is better able to prepare and respond to these more frequent and intense natural disasters?",57
58,Mr MCCLELLAND,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Bendigo for his question and I congratulate him and indeed other members of this House who have been such passionate and determined advocates for their electorates who have suffered the consequences of natural disasters. The people of his electorate, like indeed all Australians, are unquestionably concerned about the likelihood of more severe and frequent natural disasters. The facts are that climate change is real and, as the honourable member said, it is projected to lead to more intense cyclones, floods and storms, more heatwaves and droughts and indeed, unfortunately, to even greater bushfire risks. For instance, by 2030 fuit is estimated that we will face up to 20 per cent more months of drought and up to 25 per cent more days of very high or greater fire danger. The increased risk to human beings, to property, to infrastructure and to our natural environment is obvious. Last week we saw extensive fires throughout Australia but very intense fires in South Australia. Over the weekend we saw temperatures of over 40 degrees in New South Wales, with winds gusting up to 70 kilometres an hour. This resulted in some 141 different fires around that state alone. They were fought by 1,000 firefighters, including two teams from the ACT, and we are grateful, of course, for that. There were 75 aircraft involved and 550 fire trucks. The Commonwealth government was pleased to make the Richmond Air Force base available to assist the aerial firefighting effort. We of course are very grateful to all those who risked their personal safety both over the weekend and last week, but it shows the tremendous cost to the community, not only in terms of fighting fires but in terms of responding. In the past year, for instance, the Commonwealth has paid nearly $300 million in natural disaster relief and recovery payments, and this amount will substantially increase in response to the more intense and more frequent natural disasters. Given that that money matches contributions from state governments, it shows that the burden on Australian taxpayers from natural disasters is intense and will likely increase. Last Friday I chaired the Ministerial Council for Police and Emergency Management. It was highly productive and I certainly thank my state and territory counterparts for their very constructive contributions. We endorsed a number of initiatives including a National Catastrophic Natural Disaster Plan, we developed a national work plan to reduce bushfire arson, and significantly the meeting also endorsed a National Climate Change Adaption Plan. The plan, essentially, will ensure that climate change adaption strategies are integral to emergency management, planning, response and recovery. This bushfire season unquestionably poses great risks. On 20 October I made a comprehensive statement to the House about our preparations for this season. Of course, the Commonwealth stands ready to assist states and territories, in whatever way we can, to confront the challenge that faces all Australians, particularly those in rural and regional Australia and those on the urban fringe. I remind all Australians, particularly those in high-risk areas, to do everything they can to be prepared for bushfires, to be vigilant and to follow the instructions of emergency personnel. Again, and I should emphasise this, if we are serious in doing all we can to protect our local communities from natural disastersand I know that all members from both sides of this House are-then we cannot ignore the reality, we cannot ignore the evidence, we cannot ignore the facts. We have an obligation to do whatever we reasonably can do to mitigate the effects of climate change. National Schools Chaplaincy Program  the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his announcement last Saturday that the National Schools Chaplaincy Program has been given an 18-month stay of execution with funding of $44 million. Why won't the Prime Minister support school chaplains into the future, as the opposition did on Friday when it proposed a $165 million funding package over three years, rather than the government's bandaid measure to get it through the next election?",57
59,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Honourable members interjecting repeat the second part of that question. Why won't the Prime Minister support school chaplains into the future, as the opposition did on Friday when it proposed a $165 million funding package over three years, rather than the government's bandaid measure to get it through the next election?",58
60,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The good news is that it was 26 days since we had the last question on education, 33 days, by the way, since we last had a question on the economy and 101 days since we had our last question on jobs. We should all say to give Joe a job, let him have a go, let's get some questions rolling. But I go back to the question which was asked by our personal House favourite, the member for Sturt. He asked about school chaplaincy. How does all this resonate with some of the debates we have been hearing in recent times, because I sense the build-up of an attempt at a little bit of a fear campaign in the lead-up to the next election-a fear that, somehow, the government will not be committed long term to school chaplaincies. ",58
61,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He says, ‘They are not.' Can I say to the member for Sturt, as he constantly interjects, that so deep and profound were the previous government's commitments to this that they put it into the forward estimates for only three years. When challenged about whether it was to be a permanent feature of long-term allocation under the previous Howard government, they ran for cover. It was not entrenched in the forward estimates, there was no forward budget for it, it was not brought into the future erations of the budget. It was treated as a one-off for three years and then dropped dead. That was how it was funded. It might be uncomfortable for those opposite, including the member for Sturt, to admit the reality as to what the budget papers actually said, but they simply dropped dead-three years! I am so sorry that the member for Sturt now will not be able to whip up his fear campaign in the next 12 months or so. I am always delighted when the member for Sturt says that somebody squibbed it. Can I say to the member for Sturt that what I have done, what the government have done and what the education minister and Deputy Prime Minister has done is to say to the schools chaplaincy organisation for Australia, ‘Here is certainty of funding through 2010-11.' During the course of 2010 we are going to work with the sector on this. How do we provide more chaplaincies in the future for people in rural Australia who are not getting a fair shake at the moment? How are we going to provide more chaplaincies in the future for those from the most disadvantaged areas of Australia? Because at present, of the 2,700 chaplains who are funded by this program nationwide, there is an underrepresentation of those from rural areas; there is an underrepresentation from some of the most disadvantaged parts of Australia. We actually would like to see this program extended to other parts of the country. That is why we are going to take time working our way through this with the sector during the course of 2010. That is why we have responded to the request from the sector to provide certainty for the year ahead and the year following. That is why the sector have welcomed the statement made by the government over the weekend. That is why honourable members from all around Australia, in Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia and other states, in response to op- their school communities have been receiving phone call after phone call over the last several days saying that this is fantastic news and that we have certainty for the next two years ahead. Can I say to those opposite, the only one who seems to be disappointed by this outcome is the member for Sturt, because the member for Sturt has had his own little attempt to whip up a fear campaign on behalf of his marginal seat members collapse from underneath him. We support school chaplaincies, that is why we are funding them to the tune of an additional $42 million on top of that which was provided by the previous government. We provided certainty for the future and we will get on with the job. Income Support for Students Legislation",59
62,Ms LIVERMORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion. Will the Deputy Prime Minister outline to the House the importance of the government's student income support reforms and the impact of today's vote on students?",59
63,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Capricornia for her question and know that, as a member of this parliament representing a regional electorate, she cares about support for country children going to university. Unfortunately the Liberal and National parties do not. They continue their war against students; the war against students they started in government when they sat there as a government and watched the participation rates of kids from country backgrounds go down-something that they should be ashamed of, watching the participation rates of country students go down. This is a government that is committed to supporting access to education and particularly access for disadvantaged groups including country students. That is why we have before the Senate a new and improved student financing arrangement which better targets money to those households and those students that need it the most. Who supports this new set of arrangements? Well, people who care about education do. Australia's universities do. Last week I was joined by representatives of every university system in the country, standing shoulder to shoulder with me, calling on the Liberal and National parties to get out the way and pass this bill. Since that time the Group of Eight vice chancellors-the vice chancellors of our oldest and most prestigious universities-have issued a press release directed at the Leader of the Opposition and the Liberal and National parties. It is entitled Student income support is not a political plaything, and that is absolutely true. The Group of Eight has said in this press release: The Group of Eight supports these changes because they target finite resources to the students most in need, including those in rural and regional areas. All universities support this bill. Student organisations support this bill. So there are the Liberal and National parties, in their arrogance and in their war against students, having presided as a government over declining participation rates by country children, now setting their face against expert advice from universities around this country. There was a time when the Liberal Party had the decency to acknowledge that its student financing system was inequitable. Those days of decency were when the member for Casey was shadow minister for education and he slammed the old Liberal system-as he rightly should",59
64,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Sturt is warned.,60
65,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"because the participation rate of country children was going down. That is the shambles, the management of the Liberal and National parties that saw that happen to country kids. Yes, the member for Sturt is right. Their administration was a shambles. And the member for Casey was right when he said: … it has become too easy for students from affluent backgrounds to qualify and too difficult for students from modest backgrounds … He was right when he went on, saying that the current system: … particularly disadvantages many studentsparticularly those from the country-who have to leave home to study … The member for Casey was right about that, but that sentiment is not reflected in the current actions of the Liberal and National parties, who are determined to stop a bill and are determined to rip money out of the hands of country kids at the start of next year. We know that universities are opposed to the strategy of the Liberal and National parties. Students are opposed to the strategy of the Liberal and National parties. All universities are opposed. The member for Murray, ring your local vice chancellor and see if your local vice chancellor supports the strategy you are on, to rip out of the hands of country kids-773 of them in your electorate-scholarship money for next year. Vice chancellors do not support the Liberal and National parties. Students do not support the attitude of the Liberal and National parties. The former education spokesperson does not support the current attitude of the Liberal and National parties. When you want a guide to what the backbench of the Liberal Party is actually thinking it always pays to consult that great journal of record, the Daily Liberal. From the Daily Liberal last week we learned that, despite the pontificating of the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister for education, the Liberal backbench actually likes that trade training centres program. From the Daily Liberal we now learn, in the words of the member for Parkes, that they are hoping that this student financing matter is resolved. The member for Parkes in the Daily Liberal says he hopes agreement will be achieved so that rural and remote families know where they are heading. He goes on to say: It's not fair for students, parents and schools be left dangling without clear guidelines on Youth Allowance. The member for Parkes is right. What he needs to do is take the short walk and say to his shadow minister, ‘Stop trying to rip off country kids because no one supports you doing it.' Building the Education Revolution",60
66,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Minister for Education and Minister for Social Inclusion. I refer the minister to reports that Berwick Lodge Primary School's school stimulus project manager has estimated that a proposed relocation of sewerage pipes would cost $203,000, whereas the principal has obtained an independent quote for just $63,000. How does the minister justify this staggering inflation of 300 per cent while ignoring the pleas of St Lucy's special school for blind and disabled children in Wahroonga who are facing a cut of $80,000 to their funding as a result of Australian government policy?",61
67,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question because it enables me to explain some facts-things that the Liberal Party does not like when it comes to education. The facts stand about their track record in government where they discriminated against country kids; where this nation came back of the OECD class for investment in early childhood; where the standards of schools in this country against the standards of the world went down; and where the man who sits next to the member who asked the question sat there saying, ‘We knew a skills shortage was coming; we just did not bother doing anything about it.' Their track record in government is one that bears repeating when it comes to the facts. On these schools that he has asked me about let me explain the to situation to him very clearly. There are water pipes under an area of the Berwick Lodge school that was first identified for construction. The local water authority has ruled out constructing on that spot because of the nature of the pipes and other work that runs under it and consequently an alternative position for the construction will be identified. This is the kind of problem that anybody with a modicum of common sense knows Program happens when you are dealing with construction. On the question of lack of common sense, here it comes Mr Speaker: the question was about the 300 per cent inflation rate, not about the relocation of pipes.",61
68,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Prime Minister is responding to the question.,61
69,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you very much. I was asked about a building at a particular school, and I am answering about that building at that school. On the comparison that the member has drawn with St Lucy's, let me just explain to the member that, of course, the amount of funding that this government has allocated to students with disabilities in fact gone up. We allocate that to school systems. We allocate it in particular to the Catholic school system. The Catholic school system, as it did when the Liberal Party was in government, makes determinations about allocations for the school within its system. Consequently, there is more money available to the system overall and it has made its determinations, including the determination for St Lucy's School. If the member wants to take that up with the Catholic Education Office then he should, but he should not be drawing an inappropriate, inaccurate comparison in this House in the attempt to confuse or mislead people, because that is completely wrong. Can I say to the member opposite: this is a government that has almost doubled allocations of funding to schools over a four-year period. We are doing that to drive a fundamental reform agenda, including transparency, which you were too incompetent in government to do; including a national curriculum, which the Liberal and National parties were too incompetent to do; including directing more money to disadvantaged schools, which is something the Liberals and Nationals in government could not have cared less about; including money for teacher quality reforms, such as Teach for Australia which provides more money for the best teachers in the country to go to the classrooms that need them the most-a reform you would never have dreamed of and could not have delivered even if you tried. There is the Digital Education Revolution, the Building the Education Revolution, trade training centres in schools",61

71,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, it is embarrassing for you, isn't it? Yes, it is.",62
72,Mr HAWKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The question was in relation to has waste in the school stimulus program. The minister is now deviating from that topic.",62
73,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Prime Minister is responding to the question. I call the Deputy Prime Minister.,62
74,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. In conclusion: the waste was almost 12 long years when education in this country went backwards. We are delivering an education revolution because we believe Australian students deserve better. The real tragedy is that we will never get those almost 12 long years back and kids only get one go at school. So what the member should be reflecting on is the thousands of school children that the Liberal and National parties let down with their track record of insufficient resources and insufficient reforms. That is the real waste that this House should be directing its attention to. Cancer Services",62
75,Mr MURPHY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Minister, will you update the House on government initiatives to tackle cancer in our community?",62
76,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Lowe for his question. I know that, along with all members of this House, people understand the great challenge we have in fighting cancer in our community. It remains the No. 1 burden of disease in Australia. Unfortunately, one in three men and one in four women will be diagnosed with cancer before the age of 75. This year, cancer will claim the lives of approximately 40,000 Australians. Although we know that Australia has relatively good survival rates compared to international results, outcomes are not as good for the 30 per cent of Australians who live in rural and regional Australia. I know that is why many members on this side of the House, and I dare say some on the other side of the House, were pleased last week when the Deputy Prime Minister and I announced the next phase of our plans to help improve cancer services and outcomes for regional Australia. Applications are now open for the $560 million available for the Regional Cancer Centres Initiative. We are now calling for innovative applications from public and private sectors to establish a network of around 10 cancer centres which will help improve access to services in regional Australia and help close that gap in cancer outcomes between the city and the country. Applications for the Regional Cancer Centres Initiative are open until Friday, 8 January. They are a key part of our historic $2 billion investment in cancer care, which was announced in this year's budget. Our commitment also includes $526 million for two integrated cancer centres-one at the Peter MACCallum Cancer Institute in Melbourne and another at the Lifehouse Chris O'Brien Cancer Centre in Sydney. The Prime Minister was at the RPA last week for the Chris O'Brien dinner. We look forward to turning the first sod soon. These flagship centres will become one-stop shops for patients, with state-of-the-art treatment, support services and research all under the one roof. We are also continuing to roll out more cancer research and services. At the Bathurst community cabinet, for example, where the Prime Minister and I held a health consultation earlier this month with the member for Macquarie, the Prime Minister and I were pleased to meet two of the MCGRATH Foundation breast cancer nurses and were able on that occasion to announce that all 44 nurses have now been recruited and are at work in those 44 communities, providing additional services to breast cancer patients. Last day, I also announced that the government is providing another $2½ million to continue the National Skin Cancer Awareness Campaign this summer to help educate and inform Australians, particularly young Australians, about the dangers of sun exposure. Unfortunately, Australia is No. 1 when you look internationally at skin cancer incidence in the world. This is not one of the instances where we wish to be No. 1 and is something we are determined to address. Last Thursday I was pleased to join the chief executives of Cancer Australia and the NHMRC and some of our key peak cancer stakeholders in announcing funding of $12½ million to fund 42 innovative cancer research projects. These grants are going to help keep us at the cutting edge of cancer research. Consider these investments helping us tackle cancer by investing in research, cancer services infrastructure and cancer prevention. The Rudd government is working hard to tackle cancer on all of these fronts. We know, of course, that there is much more to be done to beat this dreadful disease but we intend to keep working with researchers, clinicians, stakeholders and patients to build a worldclass cancer centre and service system for all Australians. Terrorism",62
77,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware of a bill to assist the more than 300 Australian victims of overseas terrorism on which the members for Paterson and Newcastle will be speaking tonight? Does the Prime Minister think that it is especially important to acknowledge the civilian casualties of the bipartisan campaign against international terrorism? Will the Prime Minister undertake to make time available for this bill or another bill which achieves a similar result to be debated and voted upon? I ask this question not just for me but also on behalf of Sun- Paul Anicich and Tony Purkiss, two survivors of the 2005 Bali bombing, who are in the gallery today and who will be paying close attention to the Prime Minister's answer.",63
78,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I think, like all members of the House, we share deep concerns, as government and as opposition, for those who have become the civilian victims of terrorist attacks anywhere in the world. In the case of Australians, we are, regrettably this chamber, all too familiar with the impact that has had on Australian lives. All of us who were in this chamber at the time remember the extraordinary impact of the Bali bombing and of course what happened subsequent to that with further terrorist attacks. And Australians have been involved in and affected by other terrorist attacks around the world. On the question of the legislation which the honourable member refers to, I presume it is a private member's bill. I am not familiar with the contents of his bill. I assume it has been advanced into the chamber in good spirit and good heart. Therefore, in deference to the honourable member's motivation, we will subject it to examination. Consistent with the objects concerning the bill, as described by the honourable member in putting forward his private member's bill, let us examine it and see what practical things can be done to assist Australians in these circumstances. As I think all of us would know here, it being now some years since the Bali bombing where we had 80 or 90 Australians who were directly affected in lives being lost, there were many others who were injured by that as well. Then there ing consequences which extend years and years into the future. In the spirit with which the question was asked, we will submit this to examination and in due course come back to the honourable member. Child Care",64
79,Ms KING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Early Childhood Education, Childcare and Youth and Minister for Sport. Will the minister update the House on efforts to ensure that Australian families have access to high quality and affordable child care?",64
80,Ms KATE ELLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member in for Ballarat for her question. I know that she shares this government's vision for a childcare sector in Australia that is accessible, affordable and of high quality-we have been delivering on all three of these areas. In terms of accessibility, we are investing $970 million to ensure that all children have access to preschool in the year prior to school. We are also delivering $114.5 million for the establishment of 38 new centres across Australia and we have been investing $12.8 billion to improve affordability for parents. We have delivered on our election commitment to increase the childcare rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent. We know that this has dramatically improved affordability, with ABS statistics now showing that childcare costs to parents actually fell by over 20 per cent as a result. In total, we are investing some $16 billion in child care over four years, which is $1 billion more each and every year than the previous government did. We do this because we know that early childhood is a critical time, a time which shapes children's development, their learning and their well-being outcomes. That is why we are now turning our attention to the quality reform agenda when it comes to Austraare the rolllian child care. We know that the one million families who have children in child care deserve to know, when they drop their children off in the mornings, that they will get the best care possible throughout the day. We have all seen too many reports about children being injured at child care or wandering off due to inadequate supervision and we know that this is not acceptable. Recent reports found that in Queensland alone more than 2,000 services were issued with compliance letters regarding issues with quality. I can inform the House that national regulatory data show that these safety issues are not isolated. The data show that over one-quarter of long day care services were found to be unsatisfactory in ensuring that potentially dangerous products, plants and objects were inaccessible to children. They show that 20 per cent of services were found to be unsatisfactory in making sure that the building and equipment used by children were safe, that almost a quarter of services were found to be unsatisfactory in supporting each child's need for comfort, sleep and rest, and that almost a quarter were unsatisfactory in toileting and nappy changing procedures. We on this side of the House find this entirely unacceptable. Whilst we know that the dedicated staff out there in the sector are doing their best each and every day, there are clearly some issues that they and we as a government want to address and want to see improved. We want to improve staff-to-child ratios so that each staff member has fewer children in their care, which means that each child gets greater individual time and attention, something we know they need. We also want to raise staff qualifications so that staff are aware of the practices necessary to ensure safe environments for children, so that they can lead play activities and inspire youngsters to help them learn. We need to do better for our children. Those opposite and the shadow spokesperson have accused us of being obsessed with a quality agenda. To this I absolutely plead guilty as charged. We make no apology whatsoever for prioritising safety and quality for our children and we will continue to work to ensure that Australian child care is accessible, affordable and of the highest possible quality. Second Sydney Airport",64
81,Mrs MARKUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his election promise as stated in this letter of 26 September 2007: Labor has no plans to alter the status of RAAF base Richmond, and should we be elected to government later this year, Richmond will continue as a permanent operation facility. Will the Prime Minister rule out the Richmond RAAF base in my electorate being used as a second airport for Sydney following pressure from the New South Wales government to find an alternative to Williamtown?",65
82,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable member for her question. Can I simply say that no decisions have been made whatsoever in terms of the future location of further airport facilities in Sydney.,65
83,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,65
84,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Off they go, again, with another fear campaign-a fear campaign on school chaplaincies, a fear campaign on airports, a fear campaign on asylum seekers, a fear campaign on debt and deficit. What have I left out? A fear campaign on climate change as well. That is the stock-andfully standard approach. I simply say to those opposite that the national interest dictates that Sydney will need new airport capacity.",65
85,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,65
86,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let us just say to those opposite that this is called planning for long term infrastructure needs. That is why we have invited the New South Wales government to participate in a joint study to assess options, identify potential sites and evaluate investment strategies for delivering additional airport capacity. The joint study will also look at ways of providing integrated transport solutions for the existing airport as well as any second airport. It will also consider the future of the Badgerys Creek site, given that the government has ruled it out as an option for a second airport. The study's final terms of reference will be outlined in the aviation white paper, which is expected to be released shortly. That is the proper framework within which we will examine these matters. The aviation white paper is scheduled to be released by the end of the year and our commitment to the Australian people is to develop, for the first time, a national aviation policy-something which the previous government did not have. The white paper will set out an aviation strategy for the next generation and the white paper will focus on improving aviation safety and security, making sure we have an economically efficient sector that creates jobs in the short and long term. The government has consulted widely for its white paper through last December's green paper. That is the proper way in which you consider these things. That is the approach which has been supported by the minister responsible and that is the approach that we will be adopting, as a responsible government, on this nation's long-term infrastructure needs. I make a general point about infrastructure. For years and years and years the nation was crying out for a national infrastructure plan. How are we going to lay out our transport infrastructure in the future? What about our major ports for the future? What about our major freight rail links for the future? What about our national highway network for the future? What about the huge challenges of urban transport and urban public transport? We are in the business of advancing a national infrastructure plan and we intend to get on with it. Older Australians",65
87,Ms SAFFIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Ageing. What assistance is the government providing to help older Australians retain their independence and continue to live in their own homes and communities?,66
88,Mrs ELLIOT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Page for her question and for her ongoing interest and commitment when it comes to providing care for our older Australians. Australians are living longer and healthier lives, which of course is great news-in fact, we have one of the longest life expectancies in the world. Our older Australians have a very strong desire to retain their independence and to remain in their homes close to family, friends and community for as long as they can. The government recognises this and, indeed, governments throughout the country recognise this through our Home and Community Care program. We do that to provide funding for services to make sure this can happen so that people can remain in their own homes. Home and Community Care is a joint Australian, state and territory government program. It delivers affordable and accessible care to help meet the needs of older people and their carers. In fact, last year the Rudd government provided $1.1 billion of the nearly $1.8 billion in funding provided for these HACC services. HACC offers services such as household chores, home maintenance and modification, transport, meals, personal care, allied health and nursing care. These are all practical and common-sense services provided to older Australians so that they can remain in their homes for longer. As the 2007-08 HACC annual report detailed, HACC provided services to 600,000 older Australians. This is the first time there has been an annual report in relation to HACC services. What that report also showed is that eight million hours of domestic assistance-practical and common-sense assistance-has been provided. I have had the opportunity to see first hand the benefits that HACC services bring to older Australians. I have seen the benefit of those services right across Australia. In fact, I was very pleased recently to visit a Canberra couple, Mr and Mrs Eckholt, who told me how these HACC services made a real difference to their lives and meant they were able to stay in their own home for longer. In addition to this HACC funding, the Commonwealth government provided $730 million in the last financial year for Commonwealth community care services, and there are now more than 59,000 older Australians who receive assistance through these packages to make sure that they can remain in their homes longer. There is also our commitment to transition care as wellkeeping people out of hospital, getting them out of hospital quicker and making sure they get home much quicker. The Rudd government understands that older Australians want to remain in their homes and in their communities, the communities that they help build. We are doing that. We are supporting our older Australians by providing more services and more funding than ever before. Hospitals",66
89,Mr COULTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to the Prime Minister's broken promise to fix public hospitals by 30 June 2009. Will the Prime Minister identify one of Australia's 762 public hospitals that has been fixed?,67
90,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Parkes for his question. I would draw his attention to one core fact and that that, under the Australian Health Care agreement signed by the Minister for Health and Ageing at the end of last year, we increased the allocation for health and hospitals by 50 per cent, against that which we inherited from the previous government. Secondly, I say in response to the honourable member's question that it stands in stark contrast to the $1 billion that he and his government pulled out of the public hospital system of Australia. To put that into context, what we inherited in an Australian healthcare agreement was $42 billionMr Dutton- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The Prime Minister was asked to name one hospital that has been fixed-just one, Prime Minister.",67
91,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Dickson will resume his seat.,67
92,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That was the missing member for-what seat was he going for on the Gold Coast?-MCPherson. He is still in search of a political home, our good friend the member for Dickson. I am sure the locals hold him in fond regard as he goes quietly slinking back to Brisbane's north side, having been rejected on the south side. We always welcome his contributions to the debate. In public hospitals in various parts of the country, for the first time what we have done is provided a direct investment in elective surgery. We have provided, for the first time, a direct investment in bringing down the waiting times for people in accident and emergency. For the first time, we have provided a direct investment in post-acute services. These are the investments that we have made, and the overall healthcare agreement increased from some $40 billion to something like $64 billion for the five years ahead. They take a billion dollars out; we put $20 billion-plus back in over that period. is And they stand up and say, ‘Where is your plan?' That is what we have done so far. Phase 2 of our reform is for the long-term, the next 25 years. Our program for implementing it is getting on. Mr Hockey interjecting",67
93,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Oh, Joe, you're back! I thank the honourable member for his question. Child Sexual Exploitation",68
94,Ms COLLINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Home Affairs. Will the minister update the House on the government's proposed reforms to child sexual exploitation laws?,68
95,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Franklin for her question and her concern for such a serious and important matter. It is the duty of all governments to protect their nation's children and, wherever possible, it is the duty of all to protect chilinternet. dren around the world. That is why the government is proposing to comprehensively reform Commonwealth criminal offences relating to all forms of child exploitation. These reforms will ensure that all behaviour constituting a sexual offence when committed against Australian children is also criminalised when committed by Australians overseas. These reforms will strengthen child sex tourism laws. There will be new offences for the grooming and procuring of children for sex overseas and an offence of preparing to commit a child sex tourism offence. These offences will ensure that police do not have to wait until the offender leaves Australia, endangering children in a destination country, in order to prosecute them. New aggravated offences will also be introduced, increasing penalties for offenders who exploit a position of trust or a child victim who has a cognitive impairment. Offenders will be able to be prosecuted for persistent sexual abuse of a child overseas, in recognition that the majority of violent acts against children are perpetrated by people who are part of their lives-in their family, in their schools or in care and justice systems-and are perpetrated on a regular basis for an extended period of time. The proposed reforms will also ensure that child sexual exploitation is prevented, investigated and prosecuted, whether it is committed online, through the post or using mobile phones. Child pornography hurts children over and over again. The production of images involves the initial abuse of child victims. The subsequent distribution of the pornography amplifies the original harm. So we are increasing the maximum penalties for online child pornography from 10 to 15 years imprisonment. Child pornography is also increasingly a transnational crime, with networks facilitated by the anonymity of the This was demonstrated in a horrific way by the global child pornography ring identified during Operation Achilles, an Australian led international operation. This is why we are introducing new offences relating to child pornography networks that carry a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment. These new offences take into account the operational experience of the Australian Federal Police, changes to the way in which technology is being used to sexually exploit children and best practice domestically and internationally. I can say that there has been consultation on these reforms. That consultation process has now ended. A number of submissions were received, including from state and territory governments, Child Wise and Save the Children. Child Wise was instrumental in lobbying the federal government to enact the first child sex tourism laws in 1994. In their submission, Bernadette MCMenamin, CEO of Child Wise, states that she ‘applauds the federal government for producing such an innovative approach to the law enforcement and prosecution of child sex tourism offences'. Existing child sex tourism offences were introduced over 14 years ago. The regime needs to be updated to ensure that we protect our children here and overseas. These laws will respond to this very important challenge. Mr Rudd- Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: NA",68

I neglected, in my answer, to add the following, as it concerns health and hospital facilities in his own electorate. I draw his attention to the following quote: What I find exciting about this is that it's not going to deliver primary health care to the people of Gunnedah; it's going to be a great facility for education not only for doctors but for ancillary health professionals. I think that, you know, it's an exciting model. It's collocated near the hospital. It will make the doctors much more efficient. They'll be able just to walk from the hospital back to the medical centre. It'll be great for students. It'll also help attract medical professionals when it comes to the great people of Gunnedah.

123,Mr ZAPPIA,DOCUMENTS,"I continue my remarks in respect of the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Amendment Bill 2009. At the time the debate was interrupted earlier, I was referring to the fact that the amendments are designed to capture foreign investments that have the potential to provide substantial influence or control over an Australian company either now or into the future. The bill clarifies the operation of act by explicitly requiring foreign investors to notify the Treasurer where there is a possibility that the type of investment arrangement being used will deliver influence or control over an Australian company. The Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 provides the basis for the Treasurer to examine proposed foreign investments in Australian businesses and assets to ensure they are not contrary to the national interest. This bill amends the act to reflect the growing use of more complex investment structures, particularly instruments such as convertible notes, which will now be treated as equity for the purposes of the act. The bill will clarify the operation of the foreign investment screening regime and will ensure the act applies equally to all foreign investments, irrespective of how they are structured. The changes to the act under this bill will apply retrospectively from the date of the Treasurer's announcement on 12 February 2009. Although this bill clarifies the eration of the act, it does not pre-empt any final decision by the Treasurer on any current or future investment proposals. Applications to the Foreign Investment Review Board will continue to be examined on a case-by-case basis against the national interest. Foreign ownership of resources, industry and commercial operations in Australia continues to be a polarising subject amongst the Australian people. On one hand, foreign investment has over the years enabled Australia to expand its economic base and in turn create jobs and boost productivity and export income. The counter view is that foreign ownership of Australian assets places Australia at the mercy of overseas countries and overseas boardrooms, who have little empathy for the local community or Australia's national interest but are instead driven solely by their profit and loss statements. This becomes even more of a concern the when the foreign investment results in a monopoly or unfair market power over the sector, leaving Australian consumers vulnerable. It therefore becomes a balance between ensuring foreign investment that benefits the nation is encouraged, ensuring that Australia's national interest is preserved and ensuring that Australia's international investment and trade obligations are met. The recent global economic recession has highlighted the risks Australia can be exposed to when we are too reliant on the global economy and on foreign investment. In South Australia these risks were clearly exposed with the global downturn in the auto industry and the impacts that downturn had on GMH operations at Elizabeth and the Bridgestone tyre manufacturing plant at Salisbury. Whilst the GMH operations at Elizabeth have survived the rationalisation of GM's global operations, the Salisbury Bridgestone plant did not survive. The plant is set to close sometime in April of 2010 with op- the loss of around 600 jobs. Further job losses are likely to occur at other local businesses that have been highly dependent on the Bridgestone plant for the past 45 years. I understand that another 275 jobs will be lost in Christchurch in New Zealand with the closure of that plant by the end of this year. Salisbury is one of Bridgestone's many plants around the world. Bridgestone was founded in 1931 and today operates 190 manufacturing plants worldwide in some 26 countries. Of those plants, 76 are tyre related. Production at the Salisbury plant commenced in 1964 under the Uniroyal brand. In 1980 Uniroyal was bought out by Bridgestone and the Salisbury plant became the Bridgestone plant. Bridgestone's retail operations will continue in Australia, with all tyres sold in future being manufactured in one of their overseas plants and imported into Australia. There has been no evidence that the Australian Salisbury plant was not independently viable or that it could not have survived the global recession. The reality is that decisions about its future were made by a boardroom in Tokyo with the decision most likely based on Bridgestone's corporate international best interests and not because of Australia's best interests. I note that the Bridgestone Corporation recently announced the building of a new retread material plant in Thailand and an increase in production of a tyre production plant in China. On the one hand we have the Salisbury plant being closed and on the other hand we have an expansion of operations in Thailand and China. The closure of the Bridgestone plant also raises another concern. I understand that with the closure of South Pacific Tyres, who were the manufacturers of Dunlop and Goodyear tyres in Australia, we no longer in this try have a major tyre manufacturing operation of any kind. About three weeks ago the member for Wakefield, who I notice is in the chamber here today and whose electorate the Bridgestone plant is within, the member for Port Adelaide and I had meetings at the Bridgestone tyre factory at Salisbury. Along with the Minister for Employment Participation, Senator the Hon. Mark Arbib, we had discussions with the management of Bridgestone to secure the ongoing rights and entitlements of the workers. I am pleased to see that the management is working with the South Australian government, with the federal government and with union representatives to ensure that the rightful termination payments and the necessary support are given to the 600 employees of that plant as they transition to new employment. Mr Champion-They are not working nearly hard enough.",71
124,Mr ZAPPIA,DOCUMENTS,"I note the member for Wakefield saying that they are not working hard enough. In this respect I particularly acknowledge the work of David Di Troia, the state secretary of the Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Union, and the role he has played in supporting Bridgestone employees, most of whom are LHMU members. I am sure that the member for Wakefield and I will be watching this very closely because the last thing we want to see is those workers being given a raw deal of any type, given that many of them have been working at that plant for so long. I know that from speaking to a number of the employees, on the day that we were there, there were people who had been working at that plant for 25 to 30 years, in fact most of their lifetime. For them, I am well aware that it would be difficult to transition to any other form of employment after having spent all of their lives coun- effectively doing one particular job. I was also pleased to read an announcement only recently, on 16 November, that the GM operations here in Australia, which did survive the global rationalisation and restructuring, are stepping up production. At the Holden plant at Elizabeth they will be increasing the production of their motor vehicles from 310 to 340 cars per day and the global V6 engine facility in Port Melbourne is increasing its engine production from between 240 and 320 engines produced per day now to something like 440 engines per day. It is great to see that because the GM operations here in Australia have always endeavoured to be self-sustainable regardless of their connection to the global operations of the rest of the GM organisation. GMH in Australia has always made sure that they were sustainable in their own right. That has only been because of the terrific working arrangement that has been established between the workforce of GM, particularly at Elizabeth-where I can speak from experience, having gone out there on many occasions-and the company itself. There is another brief example I want to give which highlights the volatility of foreign ownership. I refer to the video games industry and the company Ratbag Games. Ratbag was quite rightly celebrated as a South Australian success story. Founded in 1993, it became a world leading developer and producer of video games and had titles published worldwide across a range of platforms. The company employed over 50 South Australians in this emerging industry, an industry for which many young people have a passion and aspire to work within as a career. It made the front page of South Australia's daily newspaper the Advertiser when Ratbag was taken over by Midway Games in August 2005. Midway Games is one of the largest and most established video games companies worldwide. This takeover was celebrated, with a local company started by a group of friends now becoming part of one of the largest international companies in the industry. In December 2005, just four months after the takeover, Midway closed some of its international operations to cut costs as a result of its financial difficulties. This included the Adelaide studio that had previously been Ratbag, with the loss of over 50 jobs. I understand that many of the former Ratbag employees found employment with other companies in the industry, but we see the same situation where a successful local business through no fault of their own has been closed down. The parent company's financial difficulties have meant that the decision to close the operation in Adelaide is again made by a far-off boardroom. I just want to close with a few other issues that are related to foreign investment in this country. One can only speculate as to how often foreign acquisitions are made with the sole purpose of either closing down a competitor or of ultimately transferring operations to an existing offshore facility. It is something that we need to watch, because ultimately it will be the people of Australia that are affected when that happens. The last matter I raise with respect to foreign investment is the alleged practice by overseas parent companies of structuring global operations so that profits are declared in low-tax countries. This is a practice that is extremely difficult to prove particularly when overseas operations of the same company are charging the Australian operations inflated prices for raw materials, products or services, the clear intent being for the sole purpose of tax minimisation, with Australia again missing out on this legitimate tax revenue. These are clearly issues that I am sure that the Treasurer is concerned with and matters that have to be taken into account when we consider foreign investments into this country. I know that this bill goes a step further in ensuring that decisions are made in the national interest, and for that reason I commend the bill to the House.",72
125,Mr SWAN,DOCUMENTS,"in reply-I want to thank all those members who have contributed to this debate on the bill. This bill is a straightforward but important reform to improve the integrity of Australia's foreign investment screening regime. The bill implements my announcement in February 2009 that the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act would be updated to reflect the more frequent use of complex investment instruments such as convertible notes and warrants. These types of arrangements have a solid commercial basis but were not envisaged when the act was originally drafted. The bill clarifies that under act the government can examine in the national interest any investment proposal that could deliver substantial influence or control now or in the future of an Australian company valued over the threshold. The bill applies from the date of announcement, 12 February 2009, to provide maximum certainty around the act's application while providing flexible and sensible transition provisions. The bill is consistent with Australia's international obligations by keeping to the act's original policy intention. The Australian foreign investment regime has helped to deliver significant benefits to the Australian economy. Foreign investment has spurred growth, competitiveness and jobs in the Australian economy. Access Economics has estimated that 14 per cent of all Australian jobs are attributable to foreign direct investment. Foreign investment drives innovation, skills development, technology and healthy competition. The government is committed to a regulatory regime that gets the balance right, protecting the national interest while ensuring that Australia is a competitive destination for foreign investment. I have in recent months announced additional changes that go to this question of balance, which are not dealt in this bill. The foreign investment framework must keep pace with changes and trends if it is to remain effective. This bill clarifies that the government can screen investments that involve complex financing arrangements in the same way as traditional shares or voting power. Supporting this bill will improve and safeguard the integrity of foreign screening. This is one important part of an effective foreign investment approach that is well established and familiar to international investors. This is good for Australia and so important as we prepare the Australian economy for the growth beyond the global recesthe sion. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.",73
126,Mr SWAN,DOCUMENTS,"by leave-I present a supplementary explanatory memorandum and move government amendments (1) to (11): (1) Schedule 1, item 2, page 3 (line 10), omit “subsection 14(2)”, substitute “section 14”. (2) Schedule 1, item 8, page 4 (after line 26), after subsection 9(1A), insert: (1B) For the purposes of paragraphs (1)(c) and (1A)(c), in determining the percentage of the interests in the issued shares in a corporation that a person holds at a particular time, if: (a) the person has a right that, if exercised, might result in the person holding an interest in an issued share in the corporation; and (b) it cannot be determined at that time (whether from the right itself or from the circumstances existing at that time) whether the exercise of the right would have that result; assume that the right were exercised at that time. (1C) For the purposes of paragraphs (1)(d) and (1A)(d), in determining the percentage of the interests in the issued shares in a corporation that a person would hold at a particular time if shares were issued as mentioned in those paragraphs, if: (a) the person has a right that, if exercised, might result in the person holding an interest in an issued share in the corporation; and (b) it cannot be determined at that time (whether from the right itself or from the circumstances existing at that time) whether the exercise of the right would have that result; assume that the right were exercised at that time. (3) Schedule 1, page 4 (after line 33), after item 9, insert: 9A After subsection 11(5) Insert: (5A) For the purposes of a prescribed provision of this Act, disregard an interest in a share if the interest is of a kind prescribed in respect of that provision. (4) Schedule 1, page 4, after proposed item 9A, insert: 9B Subparagraph 12C(b)(i) After “voting power”, insert “or potential voting power”. 9C Subparagraph 12C(b)(i) Omit “issued shares”, substitute “shares”. 9D Paragraph 12C(c) After “voting power”, insert “or potential voting power”. 9E Paragraph 12C(c) Omit “issued shares”, substitute “shares”. (5) Schedule 1, item 12, page 5 (after line 16), after subsection 14(2), insert: (3) In determining how much of the potential voting power in a corporation a person is in a position to control at a particular time, if: (a) a right exists that, if exercised, might result in the person being in a position to control more of the potential voting power in the corporation than the person would be in a position to control if the right were not exercised; and (b) it cannot be determined at that time (whether from the right itself or from the circumstances existing at that time) whether the exercise of the right would have that result; assume that the right were exercised at that time. (6) Schedule 1, page 6 (after line 2), after item 15, insert: 15A Subsection 25(4) Omit “an option”, substitute “a right (including a right under an option)”. (7) Schedule 1, page 7 (after line 11), at the end of the Schedule, add: 22 Section 28 Omit “an option”, substitute “a right (including a right under an option)”. Note: The heading to section 28 is altered by omitting “options” and substituting “rights”. 23 Section 28 Omit “that option”, substitute “that right”. (8) Schedule 2, item 1, page 8 (line 11), after “26(2)”, insert “or 26A(2)”. (9) Schedule 2, item 1, page 8 (line 15), after “26(2)”, insert “or 26A(2)”. (10) Schedule 2, item 2, page 9 (line 4), after “26(2)”, insert “or 26A(2)”. (11) Schedule 2, item 2, page 9 (line 8), after “26(2)”, insert “or 26A(2)”. Since the introduction of the bill some issues were identified that require clarification. These technical amendments do not alter the policy intent of the bill. They are designed to improve the operation of the bill and reduce potential complexity. In relation to the expanded definition of ‘substantial interest', the bill captures new forms of foreign investment transactions that configure future rights and interest to a foreign investor. Some rights are structured so the actual number of shares or potential voting power cannot be determined until these rights are exercised. For example, where a convertible note relates to shares equivalent to a specified monetary amount the number of shares and voting power attached to that instrument would normally depend on the value of the shares at the time of the conversion. The amendments clarify that all rights over shares will be treated as having been exercised at a particular point in time-for example, when the agreement is entered into-or at the time a decision is made under the act. The act currently provides for regulaeign tions to be made to disregard certain prescribed types of interests in shares. We will shortly introduce regulations to ensure only currently held shares and voting power are counted when determining if an investor is a foreign person or foreign business and must notify under the act. This means investors can more easily monitor their foreign shareholdings to know when to notify their acquisitions under the act. Companies may not be able to determine the ownership, foreign or otherwise, of all rights to the future shares and potential voting power given the characteristics of derivative instruments and the way they may be traded off market. The amendments ensure regulations may be made with respect to prescribed provisions of the act such as the compulsory notification provisions. The act provides tracing provisions to enable substantial interests to be traced through the ownership of structures of relevant entities. The amendments ensure these provisions are applied consistently. The act also requires acquisitions or options to be notified only once-that is, at the time of the acquisition. The amendments provide that this also applies to other types of rights over shares or assets to make clear that a second notification is not required at the time the rights are exercised. Since the bill applies retrospectively, from 12 February 2009, transitional provisions are included so that foreign persons will not have committed an offence for failing to notify acquisitions of substantial interests in Australian corporations which would have been subject to compulsory notification by virtue of the bill. The amendments ensure that acquisitions of urban land will also be covered by the transitional arrangements. Full detail on the amendments is in the supplementary explanatory memorandum. The amendments do not change the national interest framework nor the screening arrangements of the ForInvestment Review Board. I am confident the amendments help to modernise Australia's foreign investment framework while providing certainty for prospective investors. Question agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to.

128,Dr EMERSON,NATIONAL CONSUMER CREDIT,"Rankin-Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy, Minister Assisting the Finance Minister on Deregulation and Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs) (4.03 pm)-I move: That the amendments be agreed to. The National Consumer Credit Protection Bill 2009 and related bills deliver on the Council of Australian Governments agreement that the Australian government assume responsibility for the regulation of consumer credit. This package of reforms will create a single, nationally consistent regime for consumer credit regulation. The Senate has moved a number of enhancements to the bills to incorporate the recommendations arising from the Senate Economics Legislation Committee's inquiry into the bills. In addition, other amendments have been made to ensure the efficient delivery of this package of reforms. Amendments that directly address the recommendations of the Senate committee include the deferral of the commencement of the reforms by six months to 1 July 2010 to give industry more time to make the changes they need to move to the new regime. These amendments also clarify that consumers have access to remedies without there needing to be a formal finding by a court in relation to civil penalty and that lenders are required to provide consumers with reasons for rejecting applications for hardship variations and stays of enforcement. The Senate committee also recommended the removal of subsection 130(3) of the main bill so that credit providers will have to verify information provided in a preliminary assessment. Amendments have also been moved to clarify provisions in the bills so that the regime operates effectively. The amendments modify the definition of ‘residential property' so that it excludes properties which are not predominantly used for residential purposes. A number of the amendments clarify the role of the regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. They clarify that ASIC decisions, particularly those regarding enforcement action, are excluded from Administrative Appeals Tribunal review. They also ensure ASIC has the applicability to grant exemptions to some parts of the National Credit Code, subject to conditions, and allow ASIC to exempt a person and all their credit representatives in a single determination. These amendments also allow for the transfer of information, documents, assets or liabilities from a state or territory to ASIC prior to the commencement of the National Credit Code and enable ASIC to issue certain documents in a form prescribed by regulations. Finally, a number of errors have been removed and provisions regarding binding the Crown under the code have been drafted. These changes support and enhance the new national consumer credit regulatory regime. On behalf of the government I thank the Senate for its work on these bills. I also table further explanatory memoranda relating to amendments to the National Consumer Credit Protection Bill 2009 which incorporate all the proposed amendments that have been moved by the Senate. The government fully supports the amendments moved by the Senate on this bill. I commend these amendments to the House. Question agreed to.

129,Dr EMERSON,NATIONAL CONSUMER CREDIT,"Rankin-Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy, Minister Assisting the Finance Minister on Deregulation and Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs) (4.06 pm)-I move: That the amendments be agreed to. The amendments to the National Consumer Credit Protection (Transitional and Consequential Provisions) Bill 2009 also reflect enhancements to ensure the efficient delivery of this package of reforms. I discussed these issues in relation to the amendments to the National Consumer Credit Protection Bill 2009. I also table further explanatory memoranda relating to amendments to the National Consumer Credit Protection (Transitional and Consequential Provisions) Bill 2009 which incorporate all the proposed amendments that have been moved by the Senate. The government fully supports the amendments moved by the Senate on this bill. I commend these amendments to the House. Question agreed to. NA (INCORPORATION OF PROPOSALS) Second Reading Debate resumed from 19 November, on motion by Mr Brendan O'Connor: That this bill be now read a second time.",88
130,Ms LEY,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"The coalition supports the purpose of the Customs Tariff Amendment (Incorporation of Proposals) Bill 2009, which is to amend the Customs Tariff Act 1995 to incorporate alterations that were considered in customs tariff proposals tabled in the House of Representatives during 2009. There have been three such customs tariff proposals: Customs Tariff Proposal (No.1) 2009, to create a new concessional item 41H in schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff; Customs Tariff Proposal (No.2) 2009, to amend rates of customs duty for certain alcohol bacco products in schedule 7 of the Customs iff (Chilean originating goods); and Customs Tariff Proposal (No.4) 2009, to amend rates of customs duty for certain beer and grape wine products. Schedule 1 of the bill creates a new concessional item 41H in schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff Act. Item 41H provides duty-free entry into Australia for goods for use in the testing, quality control, manufacturing evaluation or engineering development of motor vehicles designed or engineered in Australia but not necessarily manufactured in Australia. The new item will encourage automotive manufacturers to undertake design and engineering work for the international automotive market, and will reduce administrative costs in importing such equipment. Schedule 2 of the bill amends rates of duty for certain alcohol and tobacco products that are imported under the Australia-Chile Free Trade Agreement. The legislation that gave effect to Australia's tariff commitments under that agreement did not include subsequent increases in the excise equivalent BILL 2009 component of customs duty for these goods. Schedule 2 of the bill applies the increased rates of duty for these goods where required from the commencement of the free trade agreement on 6 March 2009. This ensures that customs duty imposed on alcohol and tobacco products imported under the Australia-Chile Free Trade Agreement is the same as the duty imposed on these goods when imported from other countries and is also the same as duties of excise imposed on these goods when manufactured in Australia. Schedule 3 of the bill amends rates of duty for certain beer and grape wine products. The Customs Tariff Amendment (2009 Measures No.1) Act 2009 provided revised definitions for beer and grape wine products in the Customs Tariff Act. Schedule 3 of the bill applies the increased rates of duty as required to beer and toand grape wine products from the dates of Tar- commencement of the legislation on 28 August 2009. This ensures that customs duty imposed on these beer and grape wine products is consistent with duty imposed on other alcohol products and with the excise duty imposed when these products are manufactured in Australia. The coalition supports the passage of this bill.",89
131,Ms SAFFIN,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"The Customs Tariff Amendment (Incorporation of Proposals) Bill 2009 will amend the Customs Tariff Act 1995, thus incorporating measures that were contained in the three customs tariff proposals tabled earlier this year. They are Customs Tariff Proposals (No. 1) 2009, (No. 2) 2009 and (No. 4) 2009. These amendments give effect to Australia's international obligations regarding the duty-free entry into Australia of certain goods and to appropriate increases of customs duty. The way the system works, as I deduced from my reading of the bill, the explanatory memorandum and the Minister for Home Affairs' second reading speech, is that the customs tariff regime of proposals, duties and other measures arising is first tabled in the House and given immediate applicability; that is, it is given the protection that islation which follows later has. It gives effect but within a certain time frame the legislation has to be introduced-it appears to be 12 months. A specific amending bill needs to be passed to complete all legislative requirements. This of course can, prima facie, raise the issue of giving effect retrospectively but it is not retrospective in the sense that this is more by way of a procedural operation because of the overall system and not a matter of substance, and it thereby does not vitiate the rule of law that prohibits retrospectivity. Such a scheme enables the customs tariff regime to be responsive to policy changes and calibrations and does so in this very practical way. Those officers who implement the scheme are given the necessary protections while the proposals are operative, which is essential. Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 1) was tabled in the House on 11 February 2009 and created a new concessional item 41H. This item provides duty-free entry into Australia for goods for use in the testing, quality control, manufacturing evaluation or engineering development of motor vehicles designed or engineered in Australia but not necessarily manufactured in Australia. The item will encourage automotive manufacturers to undertake design and engineering work for the international automotive market and will reduce administrative costs in importing such equipment. Anything that can help to reduce administrative costs has to be a good thing for business and a good thing for research and development. Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 2) 2009 was tabled in the House of Representatives on 25 February 2009. Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 2) increased rates of customs duty for certain alcohol and tobacco products applicable to goods imported under the Australia-Chile Free Trade Agreement. The Customs Tariff the legAmendment (Australia-Chile Free Trade Agreement Implementation) Act 2008 gave effect to the Australia-Chile Free Trade Agreement but did not take into account the subsequent alterations to the customs tariff as a result of the February 2009 CPI increases and increased duty for certain spirit based alcoholic beverages known as alcopops-a matter we have debated at length in this place. Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 4) 2009 was tabled in the House of Representatives on 16 September 2009. Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 4) increased rates of customs duty for certain beer and grape wine products as a consequence of the August 2009 CPI increases. We needed Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 2) and Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 4) so that there would not be loss of government revenue and discrepancies between imported and domestically manufactured alcohol and tobacco products. In closing, I can say that the successful passage of this bill would enable the amended duty rates to be incorporated into the customs tariff prior to February 2010 and provide the certainty that is required for importers. That is an important thing. We have to have that certainty. It is an exacting business, importing and exporting, and all the importers and exporters that I talk to always mention certainty. A lot of them also talk about having a single window. If you have a look, Madam Deputy Speaker, at what has to be navigated in the whole area of import and export, you will see that it is quite an exacting business, with all the things that have to be done. Through my work as Chair of the Trade Subcommittee of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I get to meet a lot of exporters and importers-all the various groups-so I have had extensive conversations with people who are doing this. Anything that we can do to bring further certainty to that area is welcome. I welcome this amending bill for the reasons that I have outlined-that it brings certainty, it gives legislative effect to the proposals that were tabled in the House earlier this year and it makes sure that the customs officers who implement those proposals are given the legislative certainty that is required products. within that particular time frame. With those comments, I commend the bill to the House.",90
132,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"in reply-I understand that the member for Kennedy was hoping to speak. That would have been preferable, but unfortunately he is not in a position to do so right now. I thank those members who have contributed to this debate, including the shadow minister, who spoke some time ago, and the member for Page. The Customs Tariff Amendment (Incorporation of Proposals) Bill 2009 contains several amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 that were included in three customs tariff proposals that were tabled in the House of Representatives during this year. The successful passage of this bill through the parliament will enable the formal incorporation of the alterations contained in these proposals in the customs tariff. New item 41H provides duty-free entry for goods for use in testing, quality control, manufacturing evaluation or engineering development of motor vehicles designed or engineered in Australia but not necessarily manufactured in Australia. This new item benefits the automotive manufacturing industry. Recent legislation passed by the parliament to amend the customs tariff did not include subsequent increases in duty rates for certain alcohol and tobacco products. Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 2) and Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 4) were tabled in the House of Representatives to apply rates of duty to these goods to reflect these increased rates. Without this action, there would have been a loss of government revenue and discrepancies between imported and domestically manufactured alcohol and tobacco I conclude by thanking those who have contributed to the debate. I understand the opposition is supportive of the bill. I commend it to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading",91

134,Mr MCCLELLAND,BUSINESS,"I move: That the amendments be agreed to. In explaining those amendments can I say that, under the AusCheck Amendment Bill 2009, as it currently stands, background checks can only be undertaken in relation to Aviation and Maritime Security Identification Card schemes. The main purpose of this bill is to amend the AusCheck Act to provide a capacity for the Attorney-General's Department to conduct background checks for national security purposes. The bill does not impose any requirement for any person to have a national security background check. Rather, it would give the Attorney-General's Department the capacity to conduct such checks in line with any future government decisions. The government amendments to the bill respond to a report of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. I thank the committee for their deliberations. The amendments respond to four of the six recommendations made by the Senate committee and address privacy concerns raised by the Law Council of Australia and the Australian Privacy Foundation during the Senate committee inquiry. The amendments clarify that new national security background checking regimes must be authorised by an act of parliament, other than the AusCheck Act. The bill is another important step forward in the government's commitment to improving national security, within a transparent framework that respects rights and the rule of law. Question agreed to.

135,Mr MCCLELLAND,FEDERAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,"Federal Justice System Amendment (Efficiency Measures) Bill (No. 1) 2008 contains a number of measures to improve the efficient operation of federal courts. It demonstrates the Government's commitment to making the federal courts more flexible, minimising the costs of litigation and improving access to the civil justice system for all Australians. The bill will give the Federal Court power to refer proceedings, or a question in a proceeding to a referee for report will enable the court to more effectively manage large litigation. This procedural flexibility, combined with the referee's specialist expertise, will allow the referee to quickly get to the core of the technical issues and reduce cost and delay for litigants, the courts and ultimately taxpaying community. This measure unquestionably will assist in resolving a number of disputes, but in particular substantial commercial disputes will be resolved more quickly and efficiently. The bill will also give the Federal Court jurisdiction concurrent with the state and territory supreme Courts under the International Arbitration Act 1974, which will assist in ensuring that the Federal Court is well placed to operate as a regional hub for commercial arbitration. Government amendments correct a minor technical point to clarify that awards will be enforceable in the federal courts as if they were a judgment or order of the Federal Court. The bill also responds to concerns about the validity of binding financial agreements, commonly known as pre nuptial agreements, following the decision of the full Family Court in the case of Black and Black. Government amendments provide greater certainty in relation to this issue. In conclusion, the amendments in this bill reflect the government's strong commitment to ensuring that the federal civil justice tem is operating as efficiently and effectively as possible and is responsive to the needs of litigants, the courts and the community. That the amendments be agreed to. Question agreed to. NA AMENDMENT (STUDENT SERVICES AND AMENITIES) BILL 2009 Second Reading Debate resumed from 9 September, on motion by Mr Marles: That this bill be now read a second time.",99
136,Mrs MIRABELLA,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"As the shadow minister for, amongst other things, youth I rise for a second time in this the place to outline in the strongest possible terms the coalition's objections to this legislation and to detail the reasons behind our opposition to the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Student Services and Amenities) Bill 2009. Firstly, let me make one point very clear: that the introduction of this bill and the provisions within it represent a clear and unequivocal breaking of a very clear commitment by the Labor Party. At a doorstop in May 2007 the then shadow minister for education said: ‘I am not considering a HECS style arrangement, I'm not considering a compulsory HECS style arrangement and the whole basis of the approach is one of a voluntary approach. So I am not contemplating a compulsory amenities fee.' That was May 2007, just five months before the last election was called, and Labor categorically said it was not contemplating a compulsory amenities fee. But, like so many other election promises, that has fallen by the wayside. In February 2008, just a few months after they were elected, Labor set up their review into the impact of voluntary student unionsys- ism, which obviously as we know with these sorts of reviews was designed to give them an excuse, an opportunity, to do what they really wanted to do all along, and what we knew and what so many students knew was the real agenda of the Labor Party: to reintroduce a compulsory fee. It is one of a long list of promises made; made because the Labor Party would say and do anything after so many years in opposition to win; made to be broken. I have come across a whole raft of these policies in my other portfolio areas of responsibility of early childhood education, child care and women, but also we see them right across the spectrum of government responsibility. The Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Student Services and Amenities) Bill 2009 should be relabelled more accurately the ‘Slug all students so as to prop up failing student unions bill' because that is exactly what this bill is really designed Despite what the minister says, this legislation is a lifeline for unrepresentative student unions that need compulsorily acquired funds to survive, because they do not have the confidence or they could not be bothered to appeal to students to pay to become members voluntarily. It is an attempt to breathe life back into these old-style student unions, many of which were corrupt and many of which had huge administrative costs that fell apart when the substantial and steady flow of funds they enjoyed with very little accountability under compulsory student unionism dried up as a result of the Howard government giving back power to young adults smart enough and hard-working enough to get a place at a tertiary institution, giving them the choice to decide whether or not it was in their interests to join a student union. That was, of course, through the landmark Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Up-front Student Union Fees) Bill 2005. I was one of many members to speak in support of that bill in 2005. As I noted at the time, I had campaigned for the very important principle of voluntary student unionism for all of my political life. I make no secret of that fact today. It was just as offensive when I was 18 to be forced to pay student union fees and for students from not wealthy backgrounds, with their limited resources, to be forced to pay compulsory student union fees when they could have put that money to better and more important use. So I make no apologies for that. We have currently a global financial crisis, with students being forced to work extra hours in order to qualify for the youth allowance. We have seen an extraordinary rise in youth unemployment, so, more than ever, it is important for students to have greater disposable income that they can control-not income that is diverted for the political and the social priorities of a to do. small group of student politicians. This legislation is obviously a step backwards. For all of Labor's talk about an education revolution, this legislation is simply a return to the good old days when unions ran all sorts of services on campus and played their political games courtesy of funds siphoned from their fellow students who did not have any choice in that matter. I have heard this criticism time and time again from those on the other side who say, ‘You and all those other Liberals were involved as student politicians on campus.' Of course we were, courtesy of what we believed and the values that we held-not because we were getting some sort of free ride and some sort of carte blanche because of compulsorily acquired union fees. In fact, the very existence of those fees drove and motivated many of us to stand up for freedom, to stand up for what we believed in. Just because someone chooses voluntarily to be one of those few Australians to actually engage directly in political activity on campus, it does not make them, for one moment, a supporter of compulsory student unionism. Once again, with this legislation we see that students have choice taken away from them. Universities will be able to charge this $250 fee as a compulsory condition of enrolment. Once again, with this legislation student unions will be able to receive the funds they crave for the purpose of providing so-called ‘supported advocacy services' whether that be administrative support for clubs and societies or the dissemination of student media, both of which are in the proposed guidelines. Once again, student unions or guilds or whatever other name they may have at a particular campus will be able to spend those fees as they see fit, without any real oversight or reporting. We see that the Minister for Youth and Minister for Sport has been given the carriage of this legislation, I assume in order give it a softer, less sinister look than be the case if the Deputy Prime Minister had been arguing it. The minister has told the House that, ‘The bill is not a return to student unionism.' Come on, let us get real. Let us be clear. Saying it does not make it so. The Prime Minister may think that saying something makes it so but there is a reality out there and saying so, Minister, will not make it so. With this legislation, in all ability students' money will be used for highly political purposes, despite what the minister says. You would expect her to say that. The guidelines which underpin this legislation are so broad that they basically mean this fee can be used for whatever purpose is seen fit. I am sure there are very many creative political minds on campus that will be able to facilitate this. The minister's one surance when she announced this plan in November last year was that the legislation would prohibit money being spent for political purposes. Let us have a look at the details of this so-called promise. The only political activities expressly prohibited by the legislawhopping tion are: support for political parties, and support for the election of a person as a member of a Commonwealth, state or territory legislature or local government body. That is a pretty narrow description. It still leaves a large range of political activities, including funding campaigns against legislation and policies, and potentially against political parties obviously, or funding for campaigns for direct elections to the student union. So the university could decide to give the student union a substantial sum for the provision of-let us say-student media and the resultant newspaper could contain all manner of political messages and campaigns. That would be okay because that fits in with ‘…in student media'. The union could receive money to provide so-called administrato tive support for clubs and societies and use might that money to fund the wages of someone they employ to do that, but who actually spends their time campaigning for the re-election of the union president. That would not be the first time that these paid student union positions have been used for such political purposes. This bill would allow exactly that to happen. Many of the services listed on the guideproblines are currently provided by either the government, private sector or universities. The list includes things such as food and beverages which can be-and are-largely provided by the private sector, child care which is already heavily subsidised by the Australian taxpayer, legal services, health care and employment services-all services currently provided by the government. The union could ostensibly receive funds to proasvide important so-called services, but we all know how much of those funds have been and can be eaten up in administration costs. Before voluntary student unionism, Monash University collected over $8.5 million in compulsory fees in one year and a 15 per cent of that went in administration costs. You work that out, Mr Deputy Speaker: 56 per cent of $8.5 million went in administration costs. One wonders whether there were 24 hours of truth in having a look at the accounts of that university and at how that 56 per cent in administration costs were broken up. I am sure that we would find many amusing items funded and certainly some very imaginative titles for that funding. In short, the minister has failed to deliver on her promise that this new massive $250 million fund will not be used for political purposes. She has failed to provide any protection whatsoever against militant student unionism. The minister will point to the guidelines as some sort of guarantee but they are not worth the paper they are written on, and she knows that. If she does not know that, she should know that. The content of the guidelines becomes largely irrelevant because this bill does not provide for a system of monitoring or policing whether or not universities comply with the guidelines. There will be no reporting system by which the education minister can ensure that the quarter of a billion dollars, collected through the new tax, will be spent appropriately. It will essentially be up to individual students to become whistleblowers and to raise any concerns they might have about how their amenities fee is being spent. Even if they can prove a breach, it will then be at the minister's discretion whether any penalty should be imposed. Can you honestly imagine a Labor minister having to hold to account a Labor student union president? You can imagine the weird factional deal: the minister could be from the left, the student union president would be from the right and there would be huge discussions and machinations behind closed doors about how to save the bacon and the reputation of the student union president. It does not work in the big playground of the Labor Party. How is it going work at the student union sandpit level? It will not work. We have seen how dysfunctional the Labor Party is, particularly the New South Wales Labor Party. They have no shame. Look at the deals they do with developers. Look at how they run the states. Look at the contracts they give left, right and centre. It smells in the big party and it will smell even more in the sandpit of politics, because what do many of these student politicians see? They see their heroes who are not held accountable in the federal parliament or in the state parliaments around the country, and so why should they be held accountable? In that there is some consistency. The minister will be able to table any changes she wishes to the guidelines-and that makes a joke of them as well-and it will be up to the minister as to whether or not any action will be taken against those not following the guidelines. This is a joke. It is like the incessant consultation that this government has. They consult on this issue and that issue but, when you look beneath the surface, it is not really consultation. When you look beneath the surface it is just window-dressing, because they want to make it look as though they care what people think. They do not care what people think. They have an agenda and they will push it, and that is exactly what the minister is doing with this legislation. Did I mention, Mr Deputy Speaker, which minister that would be? It is not the one presenting this bill; the minister responsible for the Higher Education Act will wield all this power-none other than the Deputy Prime Minister. The Deputy Prime Minister is a long-time advocate of compulsory student unionism. She grew up politically within that system, and so you would expect her to quite naturally support that system. There are many reasons to oppose this legislation. It represents a broken promise by the government. The guidelines that underpin this scheme are very wide ranging. There will, in effect, be no reporting or accountability to ensure that the funds collected are genuinely spent on student services. But perhaps many will say that the very best reason to oppose this legislation is that the $250 slug will be imposed at a time when students and their families are under considerable financial stress. Many university students often work several jobs and exist on a shoestring budget. They often live on a diet of two-minute noodles just to survive and to afford basic accommodation, food, education and living expenses. This fee is effectively an extra up-front cost, an additional burden, an additional tax on education which will inevitably grow and compound over time. Research has shown that this sort of regressive fee hits those of low socio-economic backgrounds the hardest. You do not need to be an economic genius to work that one out. These students are the ones who have to work harder and longer to put themselves through university. They do not have the luxury of additional time to play political games for 10, 20, 30 or 40 hours a week or to indulge in afternoon after afternoon of free drinks down at the union bar. The truth of the matter is that campus life is not what it was in the sixties, seventies or even eighties. Times have changed. Most of today's university students live and work in local communities. They are members of their local sporting clubs and community organisations. They do not rely solely on campus activities or services. These students see university as a place of learning; they have highly developed social and community links before they even set foot on campus. The vast majority of students are at university to gain an academic qualification to help them get a job, to give them that financial freedom to get on with their lives and to carve out a life that they wish for themselves and their future family. They should not be forced to pay for services or amenities they do not want and, in the case of over 130,000 external students, may never have the opportunity to use. Many university students choose to be part of sporting clubs, associations and community activities situated off campus for which they do pay a fee. Why should they subsidise the activities of those on campus? Why? If the university gym is genuinely better than their local gym, and cheaper and more practical, then they can switch and pay for that service, just as you would expect them to do, but why should they subsidise this choice for others? Most importantly, at a time when the financial situation of students is becoming increasingly difficult and getting an education is their top priority, why should the choice to spend $250 on textbooks, on the internet or on other academic purposes be taken away from students? If universities are genuinely struggling to provide the basics for students like access to food and beverages then the government ought to take a close look at increasing university funding. They have plenty of money to splash around-$16.6 billion alone is being squandered on the ‘Julia Gillard memorial school hall' program. Surely they can help out any university which is genuinely struggling. Why do struggling university students have to pay for this government's economic mismanagement? Perhaps they think direct government payments to prop up student unions would look too much like payback or a bit of paid training for their future politicians. As we know, the student unions have been very kind to the Labor Party with the National Union of Students finding a whopping $250,000 to fund its campaign against the Howard government at the 2004 election. And if that money had been collected by those who had voluntarily joined and paid their union membership fees, I would not have a problem, but it was not; it was part of compulsorily acquired union funds used for such blatant political purposes. Whichever way you look at it, this legislation is compulsory unionism by stealth and the students have voted with their feet on whether they want to be part of a union. Since voluntary student unionism was introduced, membership of student unions has fallen substantially. Why? Because students do not deem that it is in their interests to join. It is quite simple. They are adults and they can make that decision. You may not agree with it if you are on the other side of the House, but why do you deny them the right to make that choice? We have seen that despite dropping their fees from $590 to $99, the University of Sydney has seen student membership fall to 30 per cent; Deakin University student union membership fell to just 17 per cent; Monash University dropped their fees from a whopping $441.20 to just $55 and still their membership fell to just 10 per cent of students; RMIT dropped fees from $500 to $80, yet their union membership fell to just two per cent; La Trobe University, seven per cent; the University of Melbourne, nine per cent; and, the University of Adelaide, six per cent. Interestingly, the University of Western Australia kept their fees at the same level and their membership remained steady at 60 per cent, mainly because, due to state legislation, they have had a system of voluntary student unionism for many years and it seems from their membership figures that they have been able to respond better than others. So to suggest that voluntary student unionism can work and that union membership can be maintained is quite doable. We have seen that from Western Australia because the union there offers services that are deemed worthwhile. The fact is that the Howard government provided over $52 million to help universities through the transition and universities are continuing to receive that money this year. We recognised that there would be a transition and that universities would have to adapt. But instead of continuing with this reform-we know this Labor government is frightened of reform; they do not even know how to spell the word, let alone try to engage in some meaningful reform-Labor has said, ‘Let's turn back the clock, let's go for the mediocre, let's take the easy path, let's go back to the good old days, let's compel students to pay for something they don't want and quite often they don't use. Let's help out those student union friends of ours who are struggling to adapt to the brave new world of accountability. Let's go back to creating a nice little cash flow for them with no accountability and no consequences, because at the end of the day they are part of our broader family.' That is what this legislation is about and that is why the coalition strongly oppose this bill. And no matter what the minister may say, no matter what assurances she may give, we know and students out there know that they are empty assurances. The bottom line is this. This minister and this government are treating university students, intelligent thinking adults, with absolute contempt for the simple reason that it does not suit their political agenda and their political ideology, no matter how outdated that ideology is. There are some on the other side I know who do not agree with compulsory student unionism but they would not dare raise their head. They would not dare speak against the old style orthodoxy, but I encourage all fair members of this House, on this side and on the other side, to think very carefully about this bill and what it actually does, to realise we are in the 21st century and the way students study, the way they socialise, the way they play sport, the way they access services has changed. Their expectations have changed and their costs have changed. Compulsory student unionism will try to drag us back to the bad old days. I encourage all fair-minded members to think about this, to have respect and a bit of compassion for struggling students and to reject this bill. Debate (on motion by Mr MCClelland) adjourned.

138,Mr NEUMANN,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"I speak in support of the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Student Services and Amenities) Bill 2009. A previous bill, in similar form, was defeated in the Senate in August. I say that with sadness and regret because this bill is necessary to assist in the proper running of universities, to give students access to the kinds of services they need. Regrettably, the defeat of the previous bill showed that the coalition has not moved on since the battles so many of them fought in the sixties, seventies and eighties at universities across the country. Their opposition to this legislation is ideologically driven and not evidence-based. You can see that from the words that dripped from the mouth of the member for Indi, from the sarcasm and satire that came from her when she was talking about this issue. This opposition is really not about student needs; it is about the coalition being ideologically driven by an opposition to one word. That word is ‘union'. The coalition's attitude to the university sector was clearly evident with its absolute desire to impose Work Choices on the sector, linking university funding entirely to the imposition of (Fraser- AWAs on lecturers, tutors and administrative staff. That is the coalition's response to the challenges and difficulties in funding and maintaining a viable tertiary sector in this country. So the legislation here is not being opposed because it is bad legislation. It is being opposed because of the extreme conservative position that has been held for decades by so many opposite. The legislation is about restoring equity, accessibility and accountability to the university sector and is about helping students, particularly those in regional and rural areas. It is an absolute shame that at various conferences the National Party passed resolutions to support the compulsory nature of assistance to university students and opposed this type of legislation earlier this year. They know full well that the services provided by student unions in universities located at Cairns, Townsville, Rockhampton, Ipswich, Toowoomba and elsewhere are vital in the areas of physiotherapy, child care, sport, recreation, culture and legal services. They are critical. The coalition was driven by conservative ideology in its imposition of voluntary student unionism in the university sector. That came to a head in 2005 when we saw the coalition's Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Upfront Student Union Fees) Bill 2005. It effectively resulted in a university association, union or guild being prevented from charging a compulsory fee for facilities, amenities and services that were not of an academic nature. Students go to universities to do rials, attend lectures and engage in research but there are other aspects of university life. Many of them are at colleges and come from rural areas like Cunnamulla, Charleville, Birdsville, Mount Isa and Weipa in rural Queensland. They also attend universities at places like Rockhampton, Cairns, Townsville, Ipswich and Toowoomba. Many of those students live on campus or live with other students in rented accommodation close by and they use the university for all aspects of their recreational, sporting and cultural lives and in pursuit of the arts. They need assistance because often they are away from mum, dad, family and friends who would normally provide that kind of assistance. They might have played football, basketball, netball or hockey, or might have sung in the local choral society or the local rock band. It is university which gives them the opportunity to be involved in these types of activities. The Howard government knew when it passed its legislation back in 2005 that there would be problems. To assuage the National Party and Senator Fielding, transitional assisspent tance of about $100 million was given to universities through three competitive funding programs. If the Howard government believed its voluntary student unionism obsession was not going to have an adverse impact upon university services and student services at regional and rural universities, why did it provide transitional assistance? Why did it listen at that stage to the National Party and provide that kind of assistance? They knew. The former Prime Minister John Howard and those people who sat at the cabinet table knew. They knew that student services in rural and remote areas, particularly in places like WA and Queensland, which are the most decentralised states, would suffer. That is why they provided that assistance. So do not come into this House tutoand say, ‘It would make no impact,' because the truth is it made an impact. We took to the last election a policy that we were going to restore campus amenities, restore services and make the system much better than it was. We are going to ensure that Work Choices is eradicated from the tertiary sector. But we are also going to ensure that student services are restored to what they were. That is what it is about: restoring the kinds of necessary services, such as medical and health assistance, physiotherapy and occupational therapy, sporting and cultural facilities, that universities once enjoyed and student unions provided free of charge to many of the people there. I think university unions do a great job. If we are going to say that we live in an independent, democratic and free society, they should be allowed to function in that way, free from interference and the dictates of obsessed, conservative governments who have an ideological opposition to them. Those sitting on the opposition benches must have very sad experiences at university because so much of their vitriol is aimed at, and so much of their time is attacking, student unions. Students in higher education need to get access to those amenities and services. They are crucial. They also need to get access to the kind of democratic student representation which is critical. The legislation we are discussing here, despite what the member for Indi had to say, is not about a return to compulsory student unionism. The legislation makes it clear. I wonder whether she actually bothered to read it. We are not changing, for example, section 19.37(1) of the Higher Education Support Act, which prohibits a university from requiring a student to be a member of a student organisation. That is not happening. We also have detailed guidelines, and it is very clear what they are about. We talk about such politically motivated activities as child care, legal services, clubs and societies, sport and recreation facilities, food and beverage provision. How can these things be considered to be politically motivated? How can they be considered to be the kinds of things that student unions should not provide? What is so wrong with those organisations providing them? The guidelines make it crystal clear that this fee cannot be used to support a political party or support a candidate for political office. They say it very clearly. The guidelines state that they ‘impose a similar prohibition on any person, including an organisation, who receives any such funds from the provider' for doing so. It is there in black and white. The member for Indi must not have been looking at those guidelines clearly because she has not made reference to what the guidelines actually say in writing. The guidelines make the case clear. I think the university sector needs greater support. The government, unlike the previous Howard government, are engaging in greater support. We are delivering tremendous support through our Better Universities Renewal Fund. We provided universities with $500 million in 2008 to support infrastructure in key, priority areas. We are doing that with better libraries, laboratories, inforupfront mation technology, student places and student amenities. We have also increased childcare assistance to parents who are studying at university or TAFE-$23.9 million. The jobs, education and training childcare fee assistance has been extended from one year to two years and provides parents who are undertaking study, training and job search activities with flexible and low-cost childcare support. What did the coalition do in relation to those sorts of things? Did they invest to that extent? Did they give support in that way? They did not. A study has been undertaken, people have been consulted and an assessment has been made of the impact of the coalition's obsession with voluntary student unionism. On November 2007, after one year of voluntary student unionism, we had a report prepared. It was done by the Australasian Campus Union Managers Association and Peter MCDonald, a very important demographer. The report, entitled The impact of voluntary student unionism on services, amenities and representation for Australian university students: summary report, was based on evidence, not ideological obsession. Mr Ciobo-Obsession with freedom.",106
139,Mr NEUMANN,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"This is what that summary report said, and it is worth noting for those opposite. A bit of evidence, a bit of empirical data, is what they need-not ideological obsession but evidence. Mr Ciobo interjecting",108
140,Mr NEUMANN,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"It might help the member for Moncrieff, who keeps injecting. It might give him some assistance. I suggest he sit back and just listen. We released this summary report. We undertook consultations from February 2008 and we invited submissions from stakeholders. The summary report says: Most submissions concluded that the abolition of compulsory student union fees had impacted negatively on the provision of amenities and services to university students, with the greatest impact at smaller and regional universities and campuses. Many noted that the introduction of VSU had forced rationalisations, and that current levels services were more limited than had previously been the case. In many instances, assistance was provided by the university but these funds were redirected from other uses such as teaching, learning or research. That was the case with the University of Queensland, Queensland University of Technology and other organisations. The University of Queensland, for example, had to redirect funds to help the student union with funding for sport because the costs had gone up enormously. That is the case across the country. The opposition should have a look at the study. I doubt whether they actually consulted it. It also found that there was a reduction of $166 million in funding from amenity and service fees, expected to rise to $200 million in 2009. It found that there was a loss of 1,000 jobs, a 30 per cent reduction in employment. How can those opposite say that they are committed to the sector, they are committed to jobs and training and they are committed to providing services for students at university when they presided over that? Those are the consequences of their obsession. This legislation really is good. It is about bringing back assistance to the sector. I have spoken to Pro-Vice-Chancellor Professor Alan Rix, from the University of Queensland Ipswich campus. I had a long conversation with him about this particular issue. In an email he sent to me, he had this to say: My personal view is that the guidelines in the area identified for support, including infrastructure, seem appropriate and would enable an institution to provide services accordingly. That is from someone in the sector, from the University of Queensland, who is held in high esteem-a pro-vice-chancellor, a well known academic in Queensland and a wellrespected person in the community. That is what he has to say about this. Do we hear of those opposite quoting anyone from the sector? No, they spend their time deriding student unions and the people who stand up for the students who are struggling to get through university. They spend all their time casting aspersions upon them. We have got to provide solutions for more funding to go back into the sector. We recognised the negative impact of voluntary student unionism, and that is why this legislation came before the House and then the Senate earlier this year. Regrettably, because of their ideological opposition, those opposite opposed it in the House and voted it down in the Senate, and we can see from the shadow minister that they are going to do that again. That is really a shame. It shows that those opposite clearly do not support the sector-and we see that again in the legislation relating to income support for students that is currently before the Senate. The Deputy Prime Minister has talked about this as another example of the coalition not supporting the university sector and students who are struggling, particularly those from rural and regional areas. The Deputy Prime Minister has made it very clear that about 150,000 students who receive youth allowance will not get the proposed $2,254 start-up scholarships to help them meet the costs of their study if the legislation that is before the Senate is blocked, and students who would otherwise be eligible for a $4,000 relocation payment will not be able to receive this. These would be the consequences of the coalition's behaviour and belief with respect to the university sector and students. The coalition say it is because they want to support choice, but we know what their view on choice and freedom is. Work Choices is the greatest example of the coalition's belief in choice and freedom. It is freedom for the rich, but those who struggle, those from the working class and others who do it tough to get to university are on their own. That is the coalition's attitude to university funding. As I have said, many universitiesGriffith University, the University of Queensland and the Queensland University of Technology-have said they have had to redirect funds from other avenues to their consolidated revenue, and other universities have had to use funds from research and teaching budgets to make up the shortfall in funding for campus services. Without the passage of this legislation, we will see services decline further, and some, sadly, are likely to fold. I urge the National Party, who claim they are the party of the bush, the party that represents the regions, to do the right thing by regional students who attend the universities I mentioned earlierMr Lindsay-Who do not use any amenities",108
141,Mr NEUMANN,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"They should do the right thing. And members from the Liberal Party should do the right thing as well, because they know how important it is to provide services on their campuses and they know that this legislation is balanced, sensible and practical. That is what it is. It is portant legislation, and they should support it. If they want students in places like Townsville, Cairns, Rockhampton, Toowoomba and Ipswich to have access to information, health advice and legal advice, physiotherapy, and sporting and recreational facilities-if they are concerned about making sure students are fit and healthy in completing their university courses-and have access to cultural, drama and theatre and other groups that are important to university life, then they should support this bill. Students also need access to independent, democratic student representation. They need access to the kind of assistance that will help them. This legislation will allow universities to choose to implement a compulsory student services and amenities fee capped at $250 per student per annum, indexed annually. That is not a large amount but it is an amount that will make a big difference. It will help to fund student services and amenities, including those in regional areas of Queensland. I look forward to hearing the contributions of members on the opposition benches who represent those regional and rural areas, particularly in Queensland, just what they have to say about such services in their areas, and seeing whether they have the fortitude and the faith, and the commitment to their communities, to support this legislation. I look forward to the National Party having the integrity and the guts to stand up for students in rural and regional areas, particularly in Queensland, Western Australia and New South Wales, and do the right thing by helping those students get through university. Let us make sure that on a bipartisan basis we can provide a sustainable, robust solution to addressing the ongoing cost difficulties with student services, amenities and representation. That will come if this legislation impasses the House and the Senate. It will not come if those opposite continue to pursue the battles of the fifties, sixties, seventies and eighties.",110
142,Mr LINDSAY,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"I consider the member for Blair, who has just addressed the parliament, to be a good friend and colleague, and I hold him in high regard. But, Member for Blair, I have never heard so much rubbish in my life as what you have just said to the parliament, and you have gone down slightly in my estimation. But, of course, as a person who represents the Royal Australian Air Force and me being a person who represents the Australian Army, there is no comparison, is there, between my garrison city and your small city! Mr Griffin-Controversial!",110
143,Mr LINDSAY,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"The Minister for Veterans' Affairs is helping here! Thank you, Minister, and thank you for your support for Townsville and our garrison city. The member for Corangamite, who is in the chamber, is very envious, because he has only Fort Queenscliff in his electorate! Mr Cheeseman-A fabulous place!",111
144,Mr LINDSAY,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"There you go. The member for Blair condemned himself when he tried to make the point, which was an Exocet point, that the National Party should be standing up in the parliament for the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Student Services and Amenities) Bill 2009 because of the many rural students that they represent. A student in rural Australia who does not actually front up to the campus gets nothing for the $250 student services fee that this bill is trying to impose on them. For heaven's sake, how could that be good for the National Party or for the students who come from regional Australia who do not actually go to the campus for their university education? How could the member for Blair stand up and claim that the National Party should be supporting this fee when it works against the very students they represent? The logic escapes me. This bill is nothing more than a compulsory tax on university students. Let's call it what it is: a compulsory tax, $250 every year and you pay it whether or not you get something for it. It is going to be levied on every one of the one million Australian university students, who will be made to pay it irrespective of how they study, whether full-time, part-time or by distance. They will have to pay it no matter how few services they want or how few services they need. It is just illogical to make students pay for services that they are not going to use, so I firmly oppose this legislation. I have opposed it all the way through and I certainly strongly supported the VSU legislation when it went through this parliament back in 2005. It also represents yet another broken promise by the Rudd government. It is a surprise, that! Why are there so many promises that we have on the record, that were made at the time of the 2007 election, that have now been broken? Remember that Labor promised Australian students that they would not reintroduce a compulsory fee. In May 2007 Stephen Smith, the then shadow minister for education, stated explicitly that Labor was not contemplating a compulsory amenities fee for students, including any on a HECS arrangement. Today in the parliament in question time there was yet another broken promise. This one was in relation to RAAF Richmond where, prior to the last election, the then Labor opposition promised that RAAF Richmond would continue to be the important RAAF base in the Sydney basin. What have we seen today? We saw the government now considering making RAAF Richmond the entirely inappropriate second airport for Sydney. There are a multitude of reasons for that, but that is not part of this bill, so I do not propose to discuss that. I have quite some knowledge about this and I can say quite definitively that RAAF Richmond is not an appropriate location for the second airport for Sydney. This bill that we are debating today represents the second time this year that the Rudd government has broken their promise to Australian university students. I spoke on this legislation in March, which was the first time the government tried to introduce this tax. I thank Keegan Sard, who is a student at Bond University. I asked him about this, and he was quite definitive. He said: To bring back the days of compulsory unionism in Australia will spell the end of a student's right and freedom to spend the limited cash flow that we receive on the areas that matter the most to us. We have student bodies that regularly spend copious amounts of money on frivolous escapades without a benefit to students or as a collective group. We should not have to compulsorily fund these exploits unless we choose to. The Labor Party is against choice, of course. Mr Sard went on to say: In the current economic crisis where students are losing youth allowance benefits and struggling to live in campuses all around Australia, this is certainly not the time to impose a monetary penalty or tax that could further jeopardise students' lives and well-being. Mr Sard, thank you. You sum up exactly on behalf of all of Australia's one million university students how they feel about this iniquitous tax. Today I am going to speak on the same issues I raised in the House earlier this year. Labor presented the same bill and they have not taken into account any of the concerns about this fee which have been raised by uni students across Australia. I speak on behalf of all of those students but particularly those at James Cook University, which is incidentally the most significant tropical university in the world today-well done to Professor Harding, her team and her students at James Cook University. Students at JCU have saved a minimum of $235 per year under voluntary student unionism. They saved that every year since VSU came into being. The Rudd government now want to hit my students in Townsville and in Cairns at JCU with a $250 fee for services they may never use and with no guarantee it will not be used to play politics. This bill will make every one of Australia's one million Australian university students pay that $250 a year regardless of their ability to pay or their desire to use the services the fee would be funding. I am opposed to this attempt to slug students with a compulsory tax they do not want. Let's have a look at a bit of the history of this. Since the introduction of voluntary student unionism by the Howard government in 2005, university students have saved on average $246 per year. This is a large sum of money for many students. In 2005 the then Labor opposition strongly opposed the issue with organisations such as the National Union of Students, spending one-quarter of a million dollars of student funds campaigning against the Howard government at the 2004 election. It is not hard to see why Labor want this back. Student compulsory fees were being paid in large sums to groups such as the NUS, who in turn were delivering political and financial benefits to the Labor Party. Labor opposed a policy that hurt their self-interest. They did not consider what students wanted. The Labor Party profited from compulsory student unionism on campus and want to go back to the days of getting such support. That is what we have with this legislation before the House today. Despite claiming that this bill will not allow the money to be collected and used to support the political parties-I have seen the provisions in the bill-this provision would apply only to direct payment to a political party. But there is no protection from the countless ways that students' money could be used for political purposes or campaigns. The Rudd government were not happy enough just to break their promise to university students not to introduce a compulsory fee. They are now doing it again. What do students actually want? Students do not want to pay this compulsory tax. The Rudd government are trying to return to a system where students have no choice. But the real world is all about choice. I know the Labor Party rails against choice, but that is what the real world is about. This bill would have an unfair impact on students, who would be made to pay it no matter how or where they study. A full-time student on the university campus may be using a variety of services but, contrast, a part-time student who works during the day may only attend classes some evenings and use far fewer facilities. This does not even consider a distance education student who may only physically attend the university campus once a semester and never use any of the services. To charge all three students the same fee, irrespective of what they use, is clearly inequitable. This bill is trying to take away the freedom of choice given by the Howard government's introduction of VSU. This gave the students the freedom of choice to decide what they wanted to spend their money on. Students have been able to choose what areas and services of university are most appropriate to them and to use their financial resources accordingly. This user-pays system provides the best option for students and ensures that the inequality of the situation beother tween the three types of students I just described does not apply. The most important factor what students think. They are the ones that matter. They are the customers. I can tell you commented: I have spoken to students from many different parts of Australia and they do not want this fee. They do not want to lose their freemoney dom of choice. So what do students think? I went and asked them. I asked one of my people to get a broad range of comments from students across rural, regional and city based universities, studying mainly at Australian National University, James Cook University, Bond University, University of Queensland, Monash, Charles Sturt University and the University of Sydney-a pretty widespread group to get advice from. I thank Johnno Patado for his help in assembling these comments. The first question was: the government wants to bring in a compulsory annual fee of up to $250 for all university students, this in money is then designed to assist university costs-what do you think about this? The first comment was: It's crazy considering the price of tuition fees already. An extra levy would deter people from tertiary studies particularly those who have to support themselves. Good point. The next point was: As a university student I'm appalled. Most of us cannot afford to study at the moment, but I also see university education more of a right than a privilege and I think, if anything, the costs of university should be diminished as we will eventually graduate and then start substantially contributing to the economy afterwards. The think the goals should be on encouraging students to graduate so they can start contributing sooner. Dead right! And the next point: And what about full-fee-paying non-HECS students? Would it affect them any differently to those on HECS? I'm not sure if bringing in anfee would be a help or a hindrance. To be honest, I would rather keep my $250 and spend it on my textbooks and you know exactly what it is in this debate is going towards. That is a good point too. The next student I'm against it. I don't really see which costs yet another fee would assist with. That amount of isn't enough to significantly reduce university fees nor would it really subsidise texts, which are sold privately anyway. The main cost associated with university for many students is accommodation and $250 doesn't really make a dent in that either, nor would assistance in that regard be easily monitored. Finally to that question there was this response: I think we pay enough already given that university used to be free. Good on you. The student continued: Students are struggling and an extra $250 is money most students probably don't have especially with the extra cuts in youth allowance too. Good on you, Labor! You are really doing the students in the eye on both fronts. The next question that we asked was: what if this compulsory fee was used for political purposes? Whew, anger! The first comment: I would like my money to stay mine, thanks, and I want to control what it is spent on. Good point. The second comment was: Absolutely not! If university students want to financially contribute to parties, that's fine. If they want to join the Young LNP on their campus and do fundraising, that's fine too. But no way should there be a compulsory fee to assist with that. The third comment: No way. People who are able to financially contribute and wholeheartedly want to contribute should be able to do so, and of course you can't. But you can't force someone to pay for the advertising they receive and absolutely not to forward any political agenda. The next question we asked was: would the fee be acceptable if it was put onto your HECS debt? A resounding no. For most people the fee will tally up to around $1,000 over a four-year course and that is around the cost of an entire unit of study and a big amount to pay off. The next comment was: Not really. It's still not giving people the choice support such a group if they want it or not. And now to this question: do you use university services like sports, clubs, societies and university health? The answer was: Sometimes the sports club and the uni club and the health service at university are really good but no-one knows where they are. And then it continued: We already pay for the classes and equipment needed for them. It's the university's job to use the money that we put into it to run itself. We then asked: if, yes, would you rather pay for these yourself as a user-pays system or have a standard fee for all students that covers the cost. User-pays for suregot the voteThere are a lot of people who do not participate in anything. A standard fee is not fair for off-campus students who do their degree through correspondence. Another one said: We at Bond University have a standard fee that has to be paid before the start of the next semester for things like sport and certain clubs and societies. I opt not to pay it because I can't afford to. I definitely believe that counselling and the doctor should stay free as they have given me unwavering support with my physical and mental health including references to hospitals and psychologists. And finally, the comment: I think I would prefer to have a user-pays system. Since 2004 there has been no compulsory student services fee. What has changed? Have we seen students demonstrating in the streets, blocking the doors of Parliament House, as we had today with students demonstrating on another matter? Have we seen that? Not a single thing. Nothing. People are happy. Students are happy. Services are being provided. At every university in Australia they are there. So why this hell-bent push by to the government to now impose a compulsory $250 student services fee on everybody no matter what kind of study they do, where they might be studying and how much they use the services? No, it is totally illogical to put forward this particular fee. Many university students are under a financial strain during their studies. We all know that. Both sides of the House are well aware of that. Hitting students with another $250 a year fee may prove to be too much. Even with a HECS style arrangement this will be for many students an extra $1,000 on their HECS. We are still in a financial crisis and the future is uncertain. Saddling students with extra debt, with extra liabilities, at a time is irresponsible. I say to the Labor Party: listen to the students. They do not want to pay this fee. They do not want an extra debt. For these reasons I will again vote against this legislation.",111
145,Mr CHEESEMAN,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"I rise to speak on the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Student Services and Amenities) Bill 2009. Firstly, I would like to acknowledge the part being played today by the National Union of Students and the Deakin University Student Association in their campaign to improve access to education and, importantly, campus services. This bill seeks to redress the devastation that the former government's misguided policy direction has wrought on our higher education institutions. This bill is about putting the heart and soul back into universities and returning them to being bright and vibrant centres of social and lectual interaction. It has about returning these institutions to being the creative thinking centres of new ideas and producing Australia's next leaders in science, industry, ernment and, of course, culture. I believe that an environment on campus that is conducive to fostering a social atmosphere that assists in developing initiative and engagement is integral to underwriting every degree our students study for at our universities. This bill is an important part of reestablishing basic campus facilities such as child care, food services, sporting options, campus culture and entertainment-services and amenities that have been culled since the introduction of the voluntary student unionism legislation some years ago. The previous government's policy was based on outdated dogma. The student fees legislation passed by the former government was based partly on ideology and partly on fear. They feared political debate, they feared such student involvement, they feared they were losing the battle of ideas on campuses. They suggested that the views of student organisations were those of a dedicated group of activists, not the broad views of a majority of students. Instead of recognising that student representative organisations have a range of views and responsibilities-from running sports and social and cultural organisations through to providing advocacy-they failed to accept that student associations have a legitimate role to play in their communities. So the coalition ran a totally false smear campaign against student organisations. The coalition ran some bankrupt intellectual arguments about what student organisations do on their campuses. They suggested that student unions were badly run and gave poor service to the majority of students. Some coalition members claimed that student unions could not possibly accurately intel- represent an entire student body-a good argument for a dictator. The coalition could not fathom how the National Union of Students joined the protestors at the Baxter degovtention centre against the previous government's position. The coalition could not understand how students could legitimately have a social conscience. They cried foul when students ran campaigns against the ‘war on refugees'. The truth is that the Liberals cooked up legislation because they were losing the battle of ideas, the battle for involvement on Australian campuses. Rather than participating in the battle of ideas, they decided on the coward's way out. They decided to scuttle legitimate student forums. They decided to scuttle their institutions. They decided to carve the heart out of universities and student campus life. That is what they did. The previous government's misguided belief in their own dogma caused them to legislate against student associations. They gutted the system and almost killed student life. They were and are killjoys on legitimate campus culture. Back then it was ‘Little Johnny Killjoy' and his unhappy band of sad sacks. Today, of course, we have the mutterings of Malcolm-and they are an even sadder bunch. When the previous ‘mean and tricky' government were thrown out by the Australian people one of their clear legacies was the ghost campuses we often see today. This bill has already been voted down by those on the other side, which clearly denotes that they have learnt nothing from that sad episode in this parliament-sad considering that a number of those in the opposition who participate in the parliament today developed their skills in university organisations. The debate and the forums they participated in were funded by services and amenities fees and ultimately led them to chamber. That is absolute hypocrisy. They seek to kill off the very institution that them to this place. The ideological farce that the opposition maintain in suppressing student organisations is an anathema, and it should not continue in this place. Those on the other side who sought to ban student unions might have conveniently forgotten their role in Australian history. The Liberals' move to ban student unions and get rid of student services was crass. Let us be honest, in many cases universities are why people are here in the chamber today. The ideas that we have were in many cases spawned or developed at university through the courses we undertook as university students, the debates we had with our friends and the debates we had in our student organisations. In many cases, the people we met at university are the contacts who have helped us on our path to the parliament to develop and represent one another and to pursue the common interests of our campuses and this parliament. Many members on the other side went to university. Nearly all are lawyers or have similar occupations and many of them participated in student unions or student associations. Almost all of the opposition members who went to university would have enjoyed the services and lifestyle, met their political contacts there and participated in debates in clubs and societies. Then we had the consequence of their coming here, where they attempted to legislate against and close down those services. That was based on pure ideology and madness. A quick look through the biographies of many opposition members shows some very interesting things. Within the opposition ranks there are two former members of the University of Western Australia Liberal Club, two former presidents of the Melthis bourne University Liberal Club, one former Curtin University Liberal Club executive led member, one former president of the Adelaide University Liberal Club and two former presidents of the University of Sydney Student Representative Council. These parliamentarians no doubt enjoyed the well supported student amenities and campus communities that their clubs or societies were affiliated with. Back in March, when we last debated this legislation, I tabled an article on campus communities which talked about some of the social democrats who, in broad terms, in the 1970s supported the idea of Australian workers working together. That was within the culture that existed naturally on university campuses. I noted with great interest and enthusiasm that the recently retired member for Higgins, the Hon. Peter Costello, was photographed accompanying that particular article. Given his history within student unions through that period, it is disappointing that Peter Costello took the view that he took in this place, championing legislation that ripped $170 million from university funding. That led to a very dramatic decline in student services-in the health, counselling, employment, child-care, sporting and fitness services that university student associations and unions delivered to their campuses and their communities. That led to a very dramatic cut in the capacity of universities to deliver important funding for research and teaching; because in good conscience universities had to make up for the decline in services that had historically been offered by student unions and associations. My research went on further, revealing that the founder of the Liberal Party, Sir Robert Gordon Menzies, was in fact a former president of the University of Melbourne Student Representative Council. I am sure that he would be rolling in his grave if he knew what the Liberal Party has done to student life through their attack on student associations and student unions over the course of the last 15-odd years. When I look at my university, Deakin University within my electorate, I can recall a much more vibrant student culture than the one we currently see. There were many more services and a much stronger university student cultural life than we currently have as a consequence of that funding being ripped out of student associations. It is fair to say that student activism plays only a small part in the development of a vibrant culture on university campuses, but it is an integral part. There are also the vices which stem from that and which support the efforts of students in their studies. This bill is about rebuilding student sentation in Australia. This bill will overturn a very nasty piece of legislation that was introduced by the Howard government. We know why the Howard government abolished student fees-they did it because they feared, they loathed, the idea that students might come together and state strongly what they believed in and offer services to support students in their studies. The Liberals believed universities had become a hotbed of political recruitment for Labor and that Labor was using campuses to recruit support for the Labor Party. The Liberals were wrapped up in this view and decided for their own ideological reasons to ram through parliament a most foolish piece of legislationa nasty piece of legislation. Australia's university campuses used to be thriving places full of fun and life. The previous government went too far with their approach to university services and amenities, putting in place legislation to curtail them. As a consequence, university campuses were gutted of services, sporting clubs were decimated, debating societies fell apart, cultural organisations could no longer be funded, music events dried up and drama groups had no funding. Political clubs were seen by the Liberals as evil. This was all because the Liberal Party feared they were losing the battle of ideas on campuses. The motives were shocking and the legacy today is a tragedy. This bill will amend the previous government's voluntary student unionism legislation and deliver a balanced, measured and practical solution to rebuilding student services and those amenities to re-engage students in an independent, democratic organisation that is able to deliver strong services and amenities to those students. The Higher ser- Education Legislation Amendment (Student Services and Amenities) Bill 2009 is about putting life back into student life. Students reprehave often inspired the world; they have done so in the past and they will continue to do so into the future. It is a very important and basic premise that student representative organisations in universities should be fostered, and this bill does that. I commend this bill to the House.",115
146,Mr TUCKEY,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"O'Connor) (5.46 pm)The Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Student Services and Amenities) Bill 2009 is encompassed in the explanatory memorandum, which states in its opening paragraph: This Bill will amend the Higher Education Support Act 2003 to provide for a fee to be imposed by higher education providersfrom 1 July 2009, so it is virtually retrospectivefor a compulsory student services and amenities fee. The fee will be capped at $250 per student per annum and indexed annually. The Bill provides for the establishment of a new component of the Higher Education Loan Program (HELP): Services and Amenities-HELP (SA-HELP), which will provide eligible students with an tion to access a loan for the fee through SAHELP if they wish. In addition, the Bill will require higher education providers that receive funding for student places under the Commonwealth Grant Scheme, to comply with new benchmarks from 2010 onwards, for the provision of information on and access to basic student support vices of a non-academic nature; and requirements to ensure the provision of student representation and advocacy. Why was this voted down when it was previously labelled ‘compulsory student unionism'? It was for a simple reason. As I heard the member for Herbert say: firstly, those who do extension courses-and there are universities now within Australia that have something like 90 per cent of their undergraduates doing extension courses-cannot access the amenities. They cannot get discounted beer at the bar. They are unlikely to exercise a vote in the student union elections; they are not there, they are not canvassed, they are frequently working mothers and others who are attempting to extend their credentials in anticipation of future employment and they will not bother themselves with all the activities practised by the young and the enthusiastic in that particular situation. But this is just another tax. It becomes even more illogical, more hypocritical, when today, as we have for the last 10 days, we heard the Deputy Prime Minister, as Minister for Education, bemoaning the loss of certain funding that she proposed to selectively provide to tertiary students, such as a $1,000 scholarship-give them $1,000 with one hand and take back $250 with the other. Why? So that universities with huge revenues are able to strip a bit of money out of a student who-if the Minister for Education's own ambitions were secured-would still be working 30 hours a week to qualify for Youth Allowance rent assistance. In other op- words, if they did a whole gap year, as the Deputy Prime Minister proposes, earning money for 30 hours a week, they would still have another six months to do, which would mean either that they have a two-year gap between secondary and tertiary education or ser- that they attempt to do 30 hours work a week whilst attending university. As we know, the face-to-face times vary greatly in that regard. Some students do not have many hours a week of actual face-to-face time-they have another word for it that I cannot recollect at the moment. Others, such as those in veterinary science, medicine and those sorts of things often have to attend the university for 30 or 40 hours a week anyway. They have to try to make a living and, more particularly, if they are forced to pay rent because they have come from regions outside of the normal travel time of the tertiary institution they attend, they have got to find the money for it. This legislation says that if you want to go to university you will be taxed $250. We heard the member for Corangamite and previous speakers telling them how much value they are going to get for this money. Well, if you do not want any of the services, what is the value? If you are there every day drinking subsidised beer in the bar, eating subsidised meals in the restaurants, having a massage, going off to counselling-and if you spend too much time in the bar you will probably need the counselling-you get it for nothing, or it is heavily subsidised. you are someone who rushes in and does their lectures and their tute and rushes off to the restaurant where they are working at night for the purpose of funding their education, what benefits do you get? And do you get $250 worth? And if you get up in the morning and, because you are battling financially to get yourself through university, you cut a small lunch and put it in a brown paper bag and take it to the university to eat out on the lawns, or something like that, why should you be paying to subsidise the other person who has enough cash in their pocket to go to the subsidised restaurant or cafe? There is a simple factor applying here. Students are fully capable of deciding the services and representations they desire. If they have the financial capacity to do so, they can pay for them. If I am a young person who takes a job with a builder, or a council or something outside of the tertiary sector and I want to play tennis, or cricket or football in the various codes, I go along and join the relevant club and I pay the annual fee for that purpose, which funds the club. What is more, those basic services, frequently the tennis courts or the other amenities such as the oval or anything else, are provided by the local government authority that is levying rates against my boss or against my parents if we happen to reside in the same area. Those rates are not going to go down when this government taxes me $250 to go to university, when I am not going to use their sporting grounds or when I am not going to use the other amenities that are applicable. If it is my desire to be in the university rowing club and the rowing clubs needs funds for the purpose of operating, they say to me, ‘ Mr Tuckey, it is $50, or $100 or $200 a year to be a member.' That is what happens elsewhere in society and those services are all there. If I think that the university club is a bit elite at $200, I can But if join the Woop Woop rowing club for half that; surely that is my choice. Why has there got to be a legislated amount of money that I pay for the purpose of utilising a service provided by a university whose basic function is not to provide those services? They are the attractions to try and get the students in. Their basic function is to deliver education. If I am of the view that I do not want some feisty young individuals to represent me-on what I am not sure because they do not need to represent me as to the prices in the cafe as I can make that judgment-I can go across to the deli on the other side of the road if I think that the restaurant or cafe is too expensive. I can go down to the nearest pub, where there will be a lot of other young people anyway, and buy alcohol. I do not need to have it available to me on the campus. I might be better off without it. If all of those services are going to be provided by the university administrators, then let them fund them from within their revenues. This fee, of course, will not apply necessarily to an overseas student because, when the overseas student turns up, the university will tell them that they will pay full fees for the services and that will include a fee because you get a subsidised meal down at the restaurant. That is fair enough. The fundamental issue before us here is that all of those fees should be voluntary. As I said, if you want to have some union representative-you might even approve of them attacking a political party from time to time-you pay them the money and you assess their services accordingly. This is the whole issue of trade union membership these days. If a young person can go to the internet to find out what the award wage is that they can expect to be paid as a minimum for working as a brickies' assistant or something else, they can do that. They do not need to pay a couple of hundred dollars a year to be a member of a trade union for that service. Of course kids, as far as I recollect over a long period as an employer, had a very good idea of what they were worth. And if they were in some doubt today they would send an SMS on the telephone to one of their mates, ‘What are you getting paid down the road to serve behind the counter or to do any other sort of service?' It is the same in a univate versity. We have this charade, this farrago, that there is a situation where a university cannot teach you unless you can get subsidised alcohol, subsidised food and child care. There are a very small percentage of students who required child care. It was a service that was recognised as being mostly available to the staff of the university. But again, if someone wants to set up a private childcare centre on the university, it will become eligible for the 50 per cent government subsidy. Why do I have to pay more for it? Why do thousands and thousands of students have to pay for something like that when they have no need for the service? It is as simple as that. There is no need for it. More particularly, as I have just read out, we have this heart breaking suggestion that their debts to the government should be further increased by allowing them to borrow this money. They do not get it for nothing. They must pay that back at a later date. There will be interest accumulated and, if they are an extension student, they are paying for nothing. We know very well why the government wants this money. It is the same as it would like to force every individual worker in this country into a trade union because those funds become available to this government by one means or another. I made the point the other day when talking about donations to political parties that political parties would be better off if they had no sponsors, no donors, because, obviously, people who make large contributions to political parties expect something in return. Nobody expects more than the trade union movement. I have seen the situation in Western Australia when the CFMEU were not getting their way on some particular issue and they cut off the state Labor MPs' funding. Boy, they came to heel then. That is apparently okay, but if anybody else in the prisector tries to do the same thing it is not okay. People might say, ‘Okay, we will no longer allow trade unions to donate to the Labor Party. We will no longer allow the Chamber of Commerce or some other industry group'-who in this day and age tend to share out the money anyway-‘to donate to the Liberal Party.' That is fine. But if they all go out, as I saw in the West Australian newspaper the other day, and take out full-page as tipping the bucket-as they did on one occasions-on the state premier for his decision to protect all the taxpayers of Western Australia from a certain claim for more money by state government employees, how do you prevent that? How does the government or the opposition of the day, when contesting an election, respond to various interest groups? There were two or three advertisements in one newspaper-one of the others was about something of an environmental nature. The political establishment is being bombarded by the supporters of both sides but they do not make donations any more. This bill is a process of taxing the tertiary community when in fact they can voluntarily pay for whatever they like. In the provision of fundamental services, they pay the going rate. If they think it is too expensive, they go elsewhere-not one of these university services is unique to a university. They are all out there in the private sector anyway, in a competitive environment. Why is it that, having paid for these things, someone else will decide where they are allocated; whether there is more money for the bar, more money for the restaurant, more money to print a paper that nobody is going to read? Surely if someone believes there is sufficient demand in the university for a local paper during prosh, or any time, you have a news stand and people will pull money out of their pocket and pay for it. But why should they be forced to? They might be totally disinterested in campus politics. They might be of a religion that does not even vote. Why should they be taxed for that particular service ? I made some mention of the youth allowance and I note that the other day the ABC news in my electorate quoted the Labor member for Albany, Peter Watson. He said regional students should be the only ones eligible for the Commonwealth's Youth Allowance scheme. I can tell the regional members of the Labor Party that Peter Watson survived the last election by 86 votes. Peter has worked it out. He has worked out where the politics are. The minister representing Senator Wong in this place told us the other day that the Labor Party had a clear list of those in the Senate who had the temerity to talk against the emissions trading scheme. Well, I can tell the government benches that I have got a list. I will make sure that those who are more foolish than Peter Watson, the state Labor member for Albany in my electorate, who has got on the bandwagon and is in the pretty happy position of saying what he likes because he does not have a vote on the issue, go on that list. All these members opposite have voted down the concept of the old youth allowance and now they are waiting to take another 250 bucks off the same people if they can comply with Minister Gillard's new deal. Why would you do any of that? It is wrong; it is unnecessary. I am fed up with having the minister tell us what the universities want. I am not here to address the interests of a few fat cat academics. I am here to represent the young people in my electorate who want a tertiary education and will have to finance their own affairs to get one. We get this silly argument that each and every one is on $300,000 a year. What a joke! (Time expired)",117
147,Mr CRAIG THOMSON,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"The Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Student Services and Amenities) Bill 2009 will amend the previous government's voluntary student unionism legislation and deliver a balanced, measured and practical solution to rebuilding student services and amenities of a non-academic nature and restoring independent democratic representation and advocacy in the higher education sector. The bill contains the same provisions for student services and amenities as the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Student Services and Amenities, and Other Measures) Bill 2009 that was defeated in the Senate on 18 August 2009. Students are paying the price for the Liberal Party's outdated view on, and ideological obsession with, voluntary student unionism. Voluntary student unionism is the raison d'etre of young Liberals and student Liberal groups. This is the glue that, for many years, has bound these diverse young conservatives together. Voluntary student unionism was something that the small ‘l' Liberals, the libertarians and the big ‘C' conservative groups within the conservative youth group movement could agree on. They could not agree on much but one thing they could agree on was voluntary student unionism. It was a policy obsession for many a member of those opposite in their early twenties, and unfortunately and rather sadly for them it remains a policy obsession today. Those opposite do not care about the practicalities of their obsession. They do not care about the young mother who is unable to go to uni due to a lack of affordable university child care. They do not care about landing a blow on regional and rural students. They do not care that they have carried this policy obsession for decades. They care more about their world view being maintained than about the practical and real outcomes of this view on the lives of students. They mask their view in an argument about choice. They fail to grasp the very simple proposition that we live in communities and that universities are also communities. Quite clearly, when we take a community approach to things and how they are there for the common good, we understand that there is cross-subsidisation. It happens every day of our lives. It happens with the rates that pay to the local council. It happens in terms of the services provided by the state government. It happens in relation to the taxes that we pay to the federal government. We do not all use up these services to exactly the same measure but we are happy to accept that we live in a community and that part of living in a community is the cross-subsidisation that results so that those who are worse off, who find it a bit tougher than others and who not afford some of the services receive subsidised services. That concept is no different when we look at university communities and how they should operate. We are being asked by the opposition to ignore the fact versities are communities. The opposition's view is that we are all individuals and so we should purchase all of our services on an individual basis. This is the type of rationale that leads to the argument that we should not have a police force. There should be private security guards for those who can afford them and for those who cannot afford them-tough. That is the individual choice that someone makes. This is the approach that the opposition have taken. The opposition have taken an ideological view rather than a practical one on needs of students in universities across the country. In the past, the opposition have tried to mask their ideological arguments in a sort of overarching argument about choice. We saw a stark example of this in the debate on industrial relations and Work Choices. Those opposite were asking us to swallow the notion that individuals should be able to make choices about their own working arrangements and that they should be able to have so-called ‘flexibility' of individual contracts. The Australian population, quite frankly, did not believe them. At the last election, there was an overwhelming rejection of what those opposite were saying about choice in the workplace. Voluntary we student unionism is very similar to that issue. This is not about individuals having choice; it is about providing services for kids who are going to university who would otherwise not be able to afford those services. So for the member for O'Connor to say that kids will have the choice of going to the cafeteria or bringing a packed lunch is insulting to university students, particularly those students who come from my area, which has a can- lower socio-economic make-up than many other areas. The kids in my area struggle to get to university. The subsidised services they are provided at universities are often the only way that these kids are able to take adthat uni- vantage of those services. The government is not saying that this legislation is the return of compulsory student unionism. There were problems with compulsory student unionism, and I think any fair-minded person would concede that. This legislation is not about compulsory student unionism. We are not changing the legislation that prohibits a university from requiring a student to be a member of a student organisation. The new provisions state that a higher education provider who spends the fee on support for a political party or a candidate for an election to Commonwealth, state or territory parliaments or to local ernment is prohibited. A higher education provider must also impose this prohibition on any person or organisation to which it pays any of the fee revenue. The fear about this money finding its way back, as the member for O'Connor said, to the ALP's coffers is clearly a position that the member for O'Connor has taken without reading the legislation, because it specifically says that that is not possible. Most fair-minded people would concede that there were problems with accountability in some student union organisations in the past. Many fair-minded people would concede that the previous government threw the baby out with the bathwater and that it went too far in its approach to university services and amenities. Students are being forced to deal with these consequences. Under the previous government, close to $170 million was ripped out of university funding. This resulted in the decline and, in some instances, the complete closure of vital health, counselling, employment, child-care, sporting and fitness services at universities. The member for O'Connor, again, I think, insulted university student when he tried to say that that funding was being spent on cheap beer and massages. Clearly, the member is not in touch with what the legislation is about, and he is certainly not in touch with what happens at universities. This legislation is about ensuring that some vital services are provided. The member for O'Connor insults university students and fair-minded people with his statements. Of the areas in this country's economy that were neglected over the 11½ years of the previous government, higher education suffered more than most. In fact, the neglect of higher education by the former government was so bad that, while other OECD countries were on average increasing their funding by up to 48 per cent in the 10 years leading up govto 2004, Australia saw a decline of four per cent. This shows a massive difference between what was happening in higher education in this country and that of comparable OECD countries, and we are paying for it now with bottlenecks in skills shortages. The previous government was warned about this over 20 times by the Reserve Bank and still it did nothing about it. When you see how the previous government decreased funding in this sector, it is little wonder that we have problems in skills shortages in key industries. The previous government created that situation. They knew that there were skills shortages in the country and that the situation was getting worse because of their inaction in education generally but particularly in higher education. The National Party have recognised publicly that the current approach to funding student services and amenities is not sustainable and that it has had a terrible impact, particularly on our rural and regional campuses. The National Party voted at their recent party conference to support a compulsory fee being levied on university students to support services and amenities on campus. Despite this, they did not support the passage of this critical bill in the Senate, preferring to side with their coalition partners over the needs of regional students. The National Party need to put their money where their mouth is. They cannot pretend to support funding for student services and amenities when they are out in the bush speaking to their constituents but vote against this important legislation when they are in Canberra. Increases in student costs on campuses were also identified through the consultations, showing that, as a consequence of VSU, students had been hit by price hikes in areas such as child care, parking, food and fitness services. Students have also experienced the indirect costs of VSU on the quality of their education with many universities being forced to redirect funding out of research and teaching budgets to make up the shortfall in funding for campus services. Following consultations, the Australian government has developed a balanced, practical and sustainable solution to help ensure that non-academic student services and democratic student representation are secured for the long term. Under this plan, for the first time universities will be required, as a condition of funding, to meet new national access to service benchmarks to ensure students have information and access to basic but important student support services like counselling and welfare services. In another first, universities will also be required to fil new representation and advocacy protocols to ensure that students have a say on campus. The government is consulting with the higher education sector and other key stakeholders on the development of these benchmarks and protocols and we will ensure that feedback from within the campuses is considered as part of this process. On top of these requirements universities have also been provided with the option of setting a compulsory fee, capped at a maximum of $250 per full-time student and indexed each year, to help rebuild student amenities and student support services. Universities will be responsible for whether or not they set a fee of up to $250 a year and will have flexibility to determine which students are required to pay that fee. To help students manage the fee, the Australian government will provide access to a HECS-style loan under the Higher Education Loan Program, HELP. This is called Services and Amenities-HELP. This means that students will be able to defer payment of the fee in a HECS-like arrangement and not have to start paying back the fee until they start earning a set salary with their HELP repayments. Universities who choose to set a fee will be required to consult with students on what services and amenities the fee will be used for. The government has also released draft guidelines that set out the range of services and amenities that may be funded through the collection of any services and amenities fee. They include things like child care, health services, sport and fitness amenities. Let us make it clear, Madam Deputy Speaker-the new arrangements are not a return to compulsory student unionism and we are not changing the legislation that prohibits a university from requiring a student to be a member of a student organisation. Further, the fee will not be able to be used to fulsupport broader political activities. The government believes that this is a balanced, practical solution that enables universities, students and the government to work in partnership to rebuild important student support services and ensure democratic student representation and advocacy at Australian universities. The University of Newcastle's Ourimbah campus on the New South Wales Central Coast-in my electorate of Dobell-is a fastgrowing and increasingly popular choice for higher education. The campus grounds are nestled in an area of plush subtropical rainforest and bushland in a central location of the region. The Ourimbah campus offers university, TAFE and community college programs and courses all on one site so that students can take advantage of pathways between levels and sectors of education and training. Affiliates are the Central Coast Community College and the Central Coast Conservatorium of Music. There are a range of degree programs offered at this campus, including the Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Social Science, Bachelor of Information Technology, Bachelor of in line Business, Bachelor of Early Childhood Teaching, Bachelor of Education, Bachelor of Exercise and Sport Science, Bachelor of Food Science and Human Nutrition and Bachelor of Psychology. These are a few of the undergraduate courses available. The Ourimbah campus also has a number of postgraduate courses, including a Graduate Certificate in Science, Graduate Diploma in Education (Primary), Graduate Diploma in Science and Master of Food Technology. So you can see, Madam Deputy Speaker, that the University of Newcastle's Ourimbah campus has grown to become a very good and very desirable higher education venue. The campus is currently engaging in such research programs which ask, ‘Can green tea lower cholesterol?' under which Central Coast people with higher blood cholesterol are being targeted to determine whether regular consumption of green tea can help lower blood cholesterol levels. The Ourimbah campus is also behind the establishment of a new marine research centre on the Central Coast. This national centre of excellence in marine research and education will be a reality for the region by Christmas with the keys to its new home handed over at that time. This year marks 20 years since the first classes commenced at the Central Coast campus. This milestone gives the community the opportunity to reflect on the growth of higher education in the region over that time and the importance of having access to highquality educational services. I have talked before in this parliament about how great our university campus is on the Central Coast. Recently I made calls for the campus to change its name. One would think that one of the things we could do rather quickly is at least change its name to the Central Coast campus of the University of Newcastle, rather than the Ourimbah campus, and then look over time to develop a university in our own right on the Central Coast. This issue is not just symbolic. It has a great effect on people being able to identify that this is a place of higher education-TAFE, community college and university-and that this is the Central Coast's. It is something that the university needs to look at. In addition to the government's commitment to improving university services and student representation, the Bradley Review of Australian Higher Education will report to the government later this year on broader issues relating to universities. Ourimbah university student Kris Gesling wrote in response to my previous speech: I'm glad the Federal Government boosted uni funding after Howard's decade of decay but it was just a drop in the ocean to make up for what he did to our education system. We need more funding for education across the sector to ensure that Australia stays at the forefront of innovation. We've been lucky with the resources boom but that won't last and has a devastating impact on our natural environment. Let us go back and have another look at what this bill is actually saying and when these changes come into effect. Universities that choose to implement the fee and make essay help available will be able to charge the fee once legislation has been passed and guidelines are in place. Universities will be able to charge up to $250. This amount will be indexed for 2010 onwards, in line with other loan programs under the Higher Education Support Act 2003. International full fee paying students are not eligible to access the higher education loan program. These students need to have the means to pay their tuition fees. It is therefore reasonable for these students to pay the services and amenities fees if a higher education provider decides to impose them. Part-time students are also affected by these changes. The guidelines to be made under the new provisions will specify how the maximum fee will be worked out for a student who is studying on a less than full time basis. Higher education providers will be able to charge less than the maximum or not require some students to pay a fee at all. To wrap up, let us be reminded why we are going ahead with the changes under this legislation. The previous government went too far with its approach to the university sector, and amenities and students are being forced to deal with the consequences. Under the previous government's approach close to $170 million was ripped out of university funding, resulting in the decline and in some instances complete closure of vital health, counselling, employment, child-care, sporting and fitness services. Universities have also reported having to redirect funding out of research and teaching budgets to make up for the shortfall of funding for campus services. Without urgent intervention services will continue to decline and even fold completely. The decline in student support services has also impacted on the capacity of Australian universities to attract international students. Sporting organisations have identified a decline in participation and an inability to vest in infrastructure and undertake long term development planning. The government has consistently committed to ensuring that university students have access to vital campus services. We are honouring this commitment. This is a practical, balanced and sustainable solution for securing the future support services on campus and also for ensuring that students have access to independent representation. This is not compulsory student unionism. We are not changing the legislation that prohibits a university from requiring a student to be a member of a student organisation. You wonder whether the ideological problem that the opposition have with this legislation is because they are so historically opposed to any reference to unions. We saw what they did with Work Choices. We heard the member for O'Connor spend a good part of his contribution not talking about this legislation but talking about unions, industrial organisations, and their capacity to raise money and use it in political campaigns. Those things are clearly prohibited in relation to this particular piece of legislation. This legislation is about providing student services. It is about providing health services. It is about providing a counselling service. It is about providing sporting services. This is legislation that makes sure students attending higher education facilities around Australia get fair access to these services. It is about making sure the community that exists on university campuses has a fair go, collectively, rather than it being left to those who can afford to pay for these particular services being the only ones who can gain access to them. This is a piece of legislation that is important. It should be supported and I commend the bill to the House.",121
148,Ms MARINO,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"The Higher Education Legislation Amendment in- (Student Services and Amenities) Bill 2009 has the primary purpose of imposing a new tax on the one million students attending universities across Australia. This $250 student fee was first introduced on 11 February 2009 with a section on VET-FEE-HELP as part of the Higher Education Legislation of Amendment (Student Services and Amenities, and Other Measures) Bill 2009. The first bill passed the House on 19 March 2009 and the coalition voted against it in the House of Representatives. It was then introduced into the Senate on 20 March this year and negatived at the third reading on 18 August 2009. As a result, the second time around the VETFEE-HELP section has been removed and is now in a bill separate from this legislation. I am rising to talk for those who have contacted me wanting choice. Students in my electorate are saying they want choice and opportunity. This bill can be considered as another broken promise by the Labor government, with the Minister for Education stating in 2007 that at no point did Labor promise to introduce such a compulsory tax. In 2005 the Howard government introduced voluntary student unionism, a historic move for those who believe that freedom of association for students is a fundamental right, as is choice a fundamental right. The coalition believed then, and still does, that students should be free to choose how, when and on what they spend their hard-earned money. It is very hard-earned money that in so many cases is scarce for university students, particularly for those who will fail to qualify for youth allowance but who get to university in spite of that and for those who have no choice but to work while at university to support their education. Every dollar is important to each one of those people and we are very well aware of the significant costs of going to university for regional and rural students. We are aware that this cost can be anything from $15,000 to $30,000 a year for each student who has to move to the city to study, so every dollar is very important to both the student and their family. It is on behalf of these young people that I have risen to speak tonight. One of the university students from my electorate of Forrest who emailed me regarding this legislation said: While entering my final year at university I am all too familiar with the ‘high costs' associated in being a student, especially considering the fact I have had to become financially independent from my parents in Harvey in order to study here in Perth. I would like to point out that there are many other students from a country background such as myself who are in the same ‘boat' in terms of being forced to live away from home in order to have the opportunity to study. With this in consideration I can only view the proposed levy for higher education as an unnecessary cost placed on students, who already have numerous costs associated with their studies … The student went on to say in this email: In my experience the Student Guild at my University provides a large range of services to students, regardless of whether the students are fullfee members or not. Therefore I can see no extra benefit (in terms of services) that the Guild could provide if the levy was imposed. In terms of funding, I am certain that the Guild at my university has sufficient funds for its services (perhaps along with university funding) as every semester they launch a large campaign to recruit students in becoming members. As a Commerce student, I view this situation similar to that of Private Health Insurance, as it has many similarities. (1) The Guild service is available to all students (2) Those who can afford it or see extra value in becoming a member, will chose to subscribe. (3) And those cannot afford it won't subscribe, but are still entitled to some essential Guild Services. He also said: I believe that the Government of this country needs to provide our students with every means possible to encourage and support their studies, as it is the Tertiary students who will one day become the leaders of this country in solving its problems; from the environmental issues to economic problems. If the Rudd Government is genuinely serious in supporting the learning and developments of our nation's students it will reconsider its proposal. Another current university student raised another two key points that I want to mention in the course of this speech. The first was that a majority of students are currently dissatisfied with the activities and funding distribution of their student guild. The second was that the implications of this legislation are not widely understood by a majority of students at the university she attends. The university student also stated that at present approximately 60 per cent of students at her university pay the student fee, which is currently $90. Furthermore, a majority of the guild members are those students who study full time and even live on campus. I remember the member for Wills, Kelvin Thomson, saying during the debate on the Higher Education Support Bill on 14 October 2003: … Labor will not support any measures to increase fees for Australian students or their lies … Well, this particular university student from my electorate stressed her concern that under this proposed legislation the current fee of $90 could rise to as high as $250. Every dollar is important to this young lady, and $250 is a major additional expense for a university student, particularly when many students are unable to identify exactly what their student guild does for them. We also know that there are a number of students from regional and rural areas for whom ever single dollar is important. It is critical to whether or not they can study. I also understand that funding from student guilds in Western Australia can be largely determined by membership numbers in the groups, with groups with more members receiving more funding than the smaller groups. The coalition strongly believes that students from regional and rural areas certainly have a right to an affordable higher education. We have already seen the government ignoring regional and rural students through the proposed changes to the youth allowance and by now imposing a further annual tax. I am very concerned about the youth allowance issue, which might see fewer students actually being able to get to university only to be forced to pay this additional $250 in tax. We know that the current legislation disadvantages 25,000 students. Only 5,000 students of those who are currently in their gap year will be able to take advantage of the amendments sought by the coalition and agreed to by the government. However, we have legislation that will severely disadvantage rural and regional students, particularly those from farming and small business families who will not be able to access dependant youth allowance because of the assets test. That can often be so even though those particular small businesses or farming busifaminesses, while they might have assets, can be extremely cash poor and have the significant and high costs of relocation and keeping their young people at university. Then we have the other particular part of the government's youth allowance legislation, which is the requirement for 30 hours of work a week consistently every week for 18 months out of any two-year period. While members like me who represent regional and rural electorates would know of many small towns and small communities in which there just might be seasonal work available to these young people, there certainly would not be and will not be 30 hours of work a week, every single week for 18 months out of a two-year period. This further compromises their capacity to attend university and then they will be hit, if they are able to attend university, with actually having to find an additional $250. We have seen the government and the Minister for Education clearly oblivious to these issues, which are very specific to regional and rural areas. I have parents from towns like Donnybrook, Harvey and Dunsborough contacting me on a regular basis asking where their child would find 30 hours of work a week, every week for 18 months. It is a great concern. If it is not youth allowance that will have a significant detrimental effect it could well be the waste and mismanagement from Building the Education Revolution, or BER. We have seen $1.7 billion wasted in this program, with $7.3 million just for plaques and display signs. In conclusion, the coalition believes that students should be free to choose-students like the young people who have contacted me and said they want the choice of what to spend their hard earned money on. I oppose this bill on its primary purpose of imposing a new tax on the one million students attending universities across Australia.",126
149,Ms KING,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"I rise today in support of the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Student Services and Amenities) Bill 2009. It is somewhat ironic that the member for Forrest's contribution in this debate centred around her concerns that the bill that Labor is introducing here will impose a financial cost or burden on students, not recognising the important services that will be offered to students, at the same time as the opposition, and clearly herself, are opposing the very scholarships that the government is proposing, particularly for regional and rural students, and also its measures to ensure that more lowand middle-income students, the majority of whom in fact live in regional areas, will be able access income support. It is somewhat ironic that she is concerned about student unionism and what that will potentially do in relation to her perceived concerns about the costs that it might impose on students, yet she is not that concerned about the fact that the opposition's proposals to block the income support measures for students will in fact see many, many students far worse off. With the introduction of this bill Labor seeking to, again, revitalise those near termiportance nal student services right across Australia. I use the word ‘terminal' because, without the support of members opposite, the future cultural and social life of our universities will die. It is nine months since I spoke in support of these measures and I do so with as much conviction now as I did then. I speak on these bills because I know the grim situation that is facing our peak education bodies across the country-not only our universities, our student bodies and our student services and amenities bodies but also, most of all, the students who are facing the challenge of a loss of services on campus. That challenge is the real possibility that, by members opposite letting down students with their opposition to this bill, they will have to begin closing doors on student services and amenities. Unfortunately, in many universities, this process has already begun. Let us reflect a little bit on how we got here today. The former government, in a somewhat older style of thinking, believed that the sole objective of student bodies around this nation was to lobby against the Howard government-playing, again, old student politics and reliving the glory days of battles fought and lost when they themselves were at university, deciding that the way in which you crush student opposition to not only the Howard government but also conservative governments was to get rid of student unions. The same objectors to the bill to today fail to realise the impact that their decision to introduce voluntary student unionism has had on university campuses, particularly in regional and rural Australia. When this government came to office we made a commitment to current and future students that we would restore services at universities, and I made a commitment to universities within my own electorate to show support for those student services. We are on this side of the House know that the imof these services not only for students but also for parents who are supporting them in going to university cannot be underestimated. In our first year, since being elected, the government held discussions around Australia to talk about the real needs of university students. The minister for youth travelled from region to region to seek feedback on the impact of the Howard government's devastating changes and on what the Rudd government should now do to combat these effects. One of these consultation sessions was conducted in my own electorate in February 2008. There was a strong attendance by the major stakeholders across my electorate. They attended because they knew all too well the importance of getting the right system in place. We had strong involvement from the University of Ballarat, the University of Ballarat Student Association, the Australian Catholic University and the Aquinas Student Association. The Committee for Ballarat also attended, an industry peak body in the city, the City of Ballarat and also representatives from Deakin University Student Association, which many of my constituents in my electorate attend. They are all local stakeholders who put hard work and effort into working with the government to fix the problem created by the previous government. Following this review we found that student services and amenities were eroding across campuses around Australia. We also found that the former government's changes were having a serious impact on, in particular, regional and rural Australia. And I know this to be true in my own electorate. I would like to quote some of the stakeholders. In 2008 the University of Ballarat, in their submission, stated: While the current services appear to be at least marginally sustainable, the ongoing maintenance of these services is subject to a significant overeffect head subsidy from the University. If this position is continuedwhich it has beenthe University community will suffer from an inability to provide new or enhanced services. I am sure that if the university were to put in a new submission today it would not only say that it is suffering an inability to provide new or enhanced services but it would also tell you that, in reality, it is even struggling to maintain those services that continue to exist. The Australian Catholic University, whose regional Aquinas campus is in my electorate-in fact, across the road from my home-stated: Student Association reserves and University funding have been used to maintain essential services in the short term. It went on to say: This model is not sustainable past 2008. If only it had known then what we now know: that this battle would drag on much beyond 2008! And to those opposite who find this news compelling, I assure them that this information is not new. These quotes were part of the Aquinas university's submission to the original review and were also part of my speech on the second reading in support of the previous bill. I know that members opposite are stuck in their archaic views and are pretty quick to begrudge the position of universities and their student bodies, but you would think that, of all the stakeholders across my electorate, they would listen to the Committee for Ballarat-a group of business people across the Ballarat region. Yet their voices were not heard. The Committee for Ballarat, like others, know how important student services and amenities are. In their submission, they stated: We are concerned that the introduction of Voluntary Student Unionism … has had a marked already on the provision of services, representation and amenities at the University of Ballarat's regional campuses and the local regional campuses of ACUthe Australian Catholic Universityand UMthe University of Melbourne. And, as I noted in my speech on the second reading on the previous bill, the Committee for Ballarat stated: We are convinced that unless the present, early, damaging trends are arrested and reversed very soon, then longer lasting and deeper damage will be done. We urge that remedial action be taken as a priority, in consultation with these universities. Amazingly, in 2005 I spoke against the Howard government's changes when introducing voluntary student unionism. Earlier this year I spoke in support of our reforms and today, in November 2009, at the tail end of the parliamentary session, here we are again still arguing a point that the opposition fails to understand: the importance of providing student services and supporting regional university students. In this bill the government has recognised the importance of student services at universities. The bill is not some radical plan to invest in political activities on campus. Despite the conspiracy theorists on the other side, it is not some radical plan to make student associations suddenly become a political wing of the Labor Party. In these amendments we have provided for higher education providers to support student services that are of a non-academic nature. The history of the University of Ballarat provides a great example. Whilst there have been some members of its student association who have gone on to political life-former Premier Steve Bracks is one, and there have been a number from the conservative side as well-the student association has never been known to engage in political activity. It has been a very traditional regional campus student association that has focused on the provision of services such as food, child care and sporting services and it has also added to the cultural and social life of the university. I have been the member for Ballarat for almost 10 years, and the only time that the student association became political was with the introduction of voluntary student unionism. As I said both in my contribution to the second reading debate and when I opposed the bill in 2005, whilst I opposed the bill, to some extent I want to thank the opposition, who were then in government, for introducing voluntary student unionism, because it in fact activated the then president of the student association so much that he actually joined the Labor Party, having had no interest in doing so before, and he is now a long term staff member in my office. I am very grateful for the fact that his political activism started because of this. But the student association at the University of Ballarat was not a political organisation by any means prior to that and would have had no interest in political debate unless it had a direct impact on them. In this bill we also have measures in place to ensure that higher education providers give students access to representation and advocacy. This bill also allows for higher education providers to introduce a compulsory student services and amenities fee, capped at $250 per student a year, if they choose to. Let me make two things about that fee very clear. Firstly, students who find it difficult to pay the fee will now, under our provisions, have the option of a loan, similar to what currently exists under the Higher Education Loan Program. Therefore, we will not place students, especially those in regional and rural Australia, in a position of further financial hardship. Secondly, this fee will be used to provide student services and amenities within the guidelines-food and beverages, sport and recreation, clubs and societies, child care, legal services, health care and housing. We want this fee to be spent on vital student services. Under our provisions we have prohibited the fee from being spent on supporting local political parties or supporting candidates for political office. Let me reiterate: our plan is that no money will be invested in political activities at universities. Let me talk a little bit about some of the services as they relate to universities in my electorate and what has actually happened. The University of Ballarat Student Association previously had a campus shop that assisted students by subsidising the cost of food, drinks, toiletries, stationery and much more. What has happened to that campus shop since voluntary student unionism has been introduced and the opposition opposed our amendments? That campus shop has now gone. Not only have students lost two great facilities, the campus shop and also the student cafe, but also the staff at the cafe and the shop have lost their jobs. There is no such thing as competitive pricing at the University of Ballarat, because students have only one choice when buying food and drink. Students struggling to make ends meet, already on tight budgets, are now paying an increased proportion of their week-to-week budgets on much needed supplies. Students are telling me that they have experienced considerable price hikes and there is nothing that they can do about it. Clubs and societies have also taken a big hit at the University of Ballarat. The number of students involved in clubs and societies has diminished dramatically, with fewer than half the numbers of volunteers today compared to three years ago. Clubs and societies are disappearing because the support they need to run is also disappearing. The importance of the universities' clubs and societies should not be underestimated. Without this element, university campuses lose their sense of individuality. The communities that exist within the university stop. Many students rely on this social experience to develop friendships and to combat isolation, particularly regional students who have had to move a long way to go to the University of Ballarat. We also know that the rate of student retention at university is strongly supported by positive learning environments and that universities are not about just the quality of lectures and the quality of the campuses on which people are teaching. They are also about the social and cultural experiences that young people have at university. On-campus childcare facilities are no longer subsidised since voluntary student unionism came in. If it were not already hard enough for parents to study at uni as it is, the former government has made it even tougher. In terms of other services, certainly there has been a lot of concern about student advocacy. Much as I would love to think that universities and university boards always get it right, they often do not. Disputes often arise because students find themselves in difficult circumstances-they feel that they do not have their marks assessed properly or administrative errors occur. Student associations have provided a very important role in advocating with university boards, university councils and heads of units to negotiate their way through sometimes very difficult issues for students. We do not have to look too far to see that there are actually some supporters other than the government for this bill in the parliament. But there are many outside as well: Australian University Sport, Universities Australia, the Australasian Campus Union Managers Association and, more recently, the Australian Olympic Committee. These groups all know that the former government's policy decisions have been a huge blow to higher education students. These groups all support the bill because they, like us, have the best interests of students at heart. Yet there is one group who opposes the bill: the Young Liberals students' groups. It seems to me that a somewhat old-fashioned, ‘battles past' argument is appearing again with this bill. Frankly, I think it is time. The world has moved on a bit from student politics and they really need to get over losing those battles. They do not need to continue to fight them within this parliament. But there may be a ray of hope in this debate. Whispers around National Party circles indicate that they are a bit divided from the Liberals on this bill. It is not often that the National Party as a ray of hope, particularly in relation to regional university students, but on this bill maybe they might be. Maybe National Party members have started getting out on the ground and seeing first hand the devastating impact that the Liberal Party's obsession has had on students. Maybe the National Party members have seen that it is students who in fact have been paying the price for the former government's ideological obsession with this bill. I welcome the news that National Party members support a compulsory fee for university students for student services and amenities. Even more relevant to the university campuses across my electorate, the National Party have recognised that rural and regional campuses are being hardest hit. While the National Party may be saying one thing at conferences and to constituents in local electorates, we have seen in the past that in Canberra they will do the complete opposite. The last time these measures were introduced into the House the National Party voted against our amendments. But this time they have an opportunity to change their vote. We are now almost a year down the track from when our amendments were first introduced, and a lot has happened on university campuses. A lot of services closed and a lot of universities came under substantial pressure to cross-subsidise services that were previously funded out of student association coffers. So just maybe the National Party has seen the light and will actually follow their national conference position and support these bills. They should certainly follow this position as laid out in their own National Party conference and vote in support of the bill. Members opposite have refused to accept our position on this matter. We, along with a long list of stakeholders, have delivered them. I see warning after warning about the impacts their changes have made to student life and university campuses. They know they got it wrong, yet their obsession and their stubbornness have meant that they have refused to change their view on this issue. They have successfully ripped away basic services from students in higher education. When voting on this bill, members opposite have to take into account the realities at hand. Firstly, students across Australia are doing it tough, and the changes those opposite have made mean that students are doing it even tougher. Secondly, the position we find ourselves in with this bill is a result of consultation across a broad range of stakeholders, and that is why there is strong support for the Rudd government's amendments. Thirdly, the education and well-being of our nation's current and future university students is a top priority. Without immediate certainty, services in my electorate will rapidly fold-if they have not done so already. The student association has limped along through this year in the hope that these amendments will be passed. The university has attempted to negotiate with the student association to continue, but that position is clearly not tenable in the long term. I am concerned that there will now be further job losses at the University of Ballarat Student Association. That is something I hope can be avoided. But if the amendments in this bill are not passed, then certainly the cultural and social life and the services provided to students at the University of Ballarat, the Australian Catholic University and the University of Melbourne campus in Creswick, and the services for those students who commute the long distance from Ballarat to Geelong, to Deakin University campuses, will cease to exist or cease to exist in the form that we know them. I commend this bill to the House.",129
150,Mr WINDSOR,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"This must be deja vu-I remember the last time we spoke on this the member for Ballarat was the preceding speaker. On that occasion we had had some meetings with regional university people in one of the rooms here in Parliament House. A number of the issues that she raised just now were raised on that occasion. Let us hope we do not return to the scene of the crime; let us hope that this legislation is passed this time. The Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Student Services and Amenities) Bill 2009 is really designed to recognise student services and amenities. I think there is still some confusion in people's minds-or some people's minds-that this legislation is about voluntary student unionism. It is not about student unionism at all; it is about the provision of amenities and services to university students and is particularly important in a regional context, as the member for Ballarat mentioned. I am very supportive of this legislation, and I would like to reiterate that support by way of a reference to a conference held last Saturday week in my electorate-the Vision New England Summit. It is an event that I hold once a term. I invite all interest groups from across the electorate to send one or two people and determine an agenda that they agree with right across the electorate. So, rather than what normally drives the political process, particularly in this place-the politics of division-people come along and determine what they have in common, irrespective of whether they are, as they were on this occasion, from the Transport Workers Union or the farmers association or the various tourist and regional development groups or whether they are the mayor and general manager of the local council or are involved in a whole range of other organisations across the electorate. Even in this place, many of us would recognise that even though there are arguments at the margin almost daily-and the art of politics is finding where the division is rather than the unitythere is a lot of unity of purpose in relation to a lot of the issues that we debate in this place. Resolution 12 from the most recent Vision New England Summit states: That this Summit calls on Coalition and crossbench Senators to pass the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Student Services and Amenities, and Other Measures) Bill 2009. And encourages all organisations and individuals to write to the Senators as a matter of urgency in support of the Bill. That is an interesting resolution because it comes from a very broad cross-section of political focus within the electorate, not only from the University of New England and others involved with education but, as I said, from all the council groups within my electorate and a whole range of other organisations. It is one of 21 resolutions that the Vision New England Summit agreed to support unanimously. There was no division in my electorate on this particular issue, and it was interesting to see how it played out on the day and gained the unanimous support of all of the interest groups that were there. One of the issues that plagued this particular issue when it was first introduced by the Howard government was that some young Liberals in particular, people who were actively involved in student politics and who have evolved to this place-you and I, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, are not of that ilk, but some are-were living in the past, and they still are in relation to this particular issue. They are trying to settle old scores through the politics of this place. Some of those people are in their 40s now, and older, and they should recognise that this bill is not about reinstatement of little cliques of political dominions within various universities. It is about, as I said, the provision of services and amenities to young people at our universities. I would like to recognise a few people in the gallery behind me. I note that there are quite a lot in the gallery tonight! The first member of my staff and it is the first time she has been in this building. Melissa Penrose has been working for me for 14 years, and I welcome her to the building and obviously to such a packed parliament. It is something to behold! Graham Nuttall has always been in this building-members would recognise him, so I will not welcome him because this is his sandpit anyway-but there are two other people in the gallery whom I would like to refer to: Professor John Pegg and Dr Lorraine Graham. Some of you may remember that last week I moved an MPI that related to educational facilities for country people in particular. John and Lorraine are the architects of the QuickSmart program that was the basis of my matter of public importance. The bill that we are debating today, the service fee bill, was also part of that broad debate in the matter of public importance. I congratulate John and Lorraine for their leadership in relation to that particular program. As I mentioned last week, the QuickSmart program is a unique program in that it is based on assisting those young people with literacy and numeracy problems. We know of them in our various schools, and we have grown up knowing kids who have fallen behind at school. In some cases they never catch up and in other cases they become antisocial and react to the feeling that they are deemed to be failures with their schoolwork. One of the significant issues that John and Lorraine and their team at the University of New England have been able to achieve is to empirically assess the QuickSmart program over time. It has been going for eight or nine years and is currently in about 200 schools. They are here in Canberra at this particular time to talk to 10 of the schools in the Canberra area that are using the QuickSmart is a program. That particular program is showing that, over 30 weeks, kids who are falling two, three or four years behind in their numeracy and literacy skills can be brought forward and placed on a positive pathway. More importantly, and this is why I talked about the program last week, that upward pathway does not stop at the end of the program. They have been able to go back and assess young people five or six years after they have finished the 30-week program and have found that that upward path has been maintained. A lot of what is happening here is related to young people's brains et cetera, but it is also related to confidence and a whole range of factors that are impacting on young people. So I am delighted that they are here today and that they have put this work into this program. I urge all members, as I did last week, to really look at this program because of lot of money is spent on education in this place. In my view, some of it is wasted; a lot of it is good money. But here is a program that brings kids forward and maintains that pathway, and the success rate is enormous. I used an example last week, and I will use it again, of the Orara school. It is not in my electorate. This program is in my electorate, but this particular school is at Coffs Harbour, in the member for Cowper's electorate. They were so taken by this particular program that they put 44 young people into it. From memory, 42 progressed at the rate of more than 20 per cent. Two did not, but they had some special issues to be dealt with-and did improve anyway. But the farcical thing in terms of the education system is that the improvement was so great on the external testing that was done that that school lost its disadvantaged school funding the next year because they had been so successful. So what you will see at that particular school are peaks and troughs if we do not come to grips with these sorts of programs where we assist these young people. The member for Ballarat mentioned briefly the politics of this issue. When the previous government was in power and the voluntary student unionism bill was before this parliament, Senator Barnaby Joyce moved some amendments in the Senate, and those who remember the debate would remember that Senator Fielding became a key number at that time and the legislation went down. But I will always remember-because Senator Joyce had not been in the building for that long at that time-sending him a congratulatory note because of the stance that he took. Senator Joyce is a graduate of the University of New England and would have known, and still knows, the importance of some of the student services and amenities to young people who are away from home and attending university. As I said, I congratulated Senator Joyce on that occasion. Now that there has been a change of government there seems to have been a change of heart, even though the bill is somewhat different to the previous VSU bill. But I would urge Senator Joyce to look very closely at this bill again because, in my view-as I think he will agree when he reflects on this, as may some of the other Nationals in the Senate-this bill is a significant one in relation to the services that it provides to our young people. It provides that, if the money is not available, it can be part of a loan that the student can pay back after university has been completed. The National Party senators in particular should pay some heed to what their constituents are saying on this issue. At a recent conference it was voted that they should support this legislation. I think they are in a state of flux at the moment, with some internal divisions with the Liberal Party, so that they are reluctant to break with the Liberals on this particular issue. But I would urge them to look beyond that. Senator Joyce is, I believe, going to be a candidate against me at the next election for the seat of New England, so I should not be praising him up too much. But we will have some degree of common ground during the election campaign in that we both supported this legislation last time, and hopefully he will be supportive of it again on this occasion. I would urge those senators to reflect on what happened between them and the Liberal Party on the sale of Telstra. I think it is time that they actually did start to stand up on some of these substantive regional issues where our children not only go to university but in most cases live many hundreds of kilometres away from their parents and families whilst at university. Some of the services that this fee goes to providing relate not only to sport and the obvious ones but also to health, counselling and some of the issues where our young people may need help. We would all hope-and I listened to the member for O'Connor earlier on-that none of our kids would need any of those services. But one thing is for certain: if those services are not there, there is no way they will get them. There are occasions when our young people are vulnerable and I think they need the opportunity to seek help. As a parent, I think it is pretty low rent, in a sense, if I can guarantee help to some kids from country backgrounds who need help and assistance from time to time, in that there is a facility at the universities to actually help deliver those services. I would like to congratulate some of the Australian university sport people from across Australia who have been working hard on this issue, particularly Tom O'Sullivan. Tom has spent a lot of time in Canberra debating this issue and championing the issue with many members of parliament, along with Don Knapp and the University of New England sports director, David Schmude, who was here only last week talking to various people. I would hope that their influence-because they are all very sane, level-headed people-would have some influence on the numbers in the Senate. I would also like to recognise someone who is not with the university movement anymore but who put an enormous amount of work in, in the last parliament: Greg Harris. I think the legislation is passed, in some shape or other, that Greg will, even though not involved directly now, have been very directly responsible for keeping the issue alive during those early days. I will conclude by saying that this will be a test for the National Party in the Senate because they actually believe in what the services and amenities fee is about. They fully understand what it means to our kidsparticularly country kids but also city kids who are away from home-in terms of service provision. It underpins a lot of the vices-services that some of our students may or may not use. But if those services are not there, our students will not be able to use them. As I said earlier, I think that the small contribution that is made, which can be arranged in the form of loan, is a way of making a contribution to university life. As per my MPI of last week, if members of the House and this packed gallery do not remember anything else they should remember the QuickSmart program, because it is something that really does work and needs our support. There are currently some suggestions before the Minister for Education in relation to that, and the government has been supportive of the program in the past. There are something like 200 schools utilising that program and, when you actually talk to the principals or the teachers of those schools about how it is going, the enthusiasm is quite incredible. If we are serious about the Aboriginal education issue that we talk about in this place quite often, the runs are on the board in the Northern Territory in relation to the empirical evidence-not just rumour and innuendo-of the success of this program in lifting Aboriginal kids who were dragging behind in terms of their numeracy and literacy. So I urge all present to have a look at the QuickSmart program on the website et cetera. If you need to talk to the architects, they if will be in the dining room for the next hour and a half.",134
151,Mr DREYFUS,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"The Liberal and National parties have an obsessive hatred of all things union, and that obsessive hatred drove them to inflict major damage on student services in higher education when they abolished compulsory student union fees in 2005. I support the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Student Services and Amenities) Bill 2009 because it provides a framework for reversing the trail of destruction left by the previous governser- ment's voluntary student unionism legislation-perhaps I should say ‘so-called voluntary student unionism legislation'. In particular, this bill will help reverse what has been noted as the ‘lessening of vibrancy and diversity' on university campuses and will give essential service delivery back to students. The legislation fulfils the election commitment the Rudd Labor government gave from opposition to rebuild essential services and amenities on university campuses. It is an election commitment which we have already attempted once to honour with legislation that passed through this House in February and was rejected by the Senate in August. There should be no doubt that the so called voluntary student unionism legislation was a direct attack on university students. When the regime was introduced by the Howard government in legislation in 2005 it imposed an annual reduction of some $170 million on essential campus services and amenities. That annual reduction of $170 million affected services such as the provision of food outlets; buildings; meeting rooms; toilet facilities; stationery; second hand bookshops; childcare services; legal services; welfare services; accommodation assistance; funding to student groups on campus, including clubs and societies; support for campus theatres; student representathe tion; educational advocacy; shortand long term student loans; student newsletters; and student newspapers. It is evident from this long list of services provided under the vious model of university services that had existed for many decades and that were enjoyed by all with a university education in this country-a very large proportion of whom are members in this place-that the services were broad ranging and essential to the maintenance of a rich university experience. I spoke in February on the previous version of this legislation and I do not want repeat the comments that I made then about the immense value of a full range of services being available to students. It was very to hear that the member for New England, the previous contributor to this debate, understands the importance of the broad range of services being provided to students. He supports this legislation because he understands the need to put in place a compulsory fee system to be able to raise the necessary funds. He understands the disastrous impact that there has been from the former government's legislation on students from regional areas in particular. It is an understanding which, regrettably, those opposite and their colleagues in the Senate appear to have not yet reached. I hope very much that those in the National Party to whom the member for New England directed his comments pay close attention to what he had to say about the disastrous impact of the current regimethe regime this government is determined to replace to honour its election commitmenton students from those areas that the National Party, at least, purports to serve. It is worth mentioning a few other effects of the regime introduced by the former government with its so-called voluntary student unionism legislation. The Australasian Campus Union Managers Association, which is peak body representing student unions, reported a loss of over 1,000 jobs on campuses just one year after the introduction of so-called voluntary student unionism. In fact, presome 25 out of 30 student associations experienced significant job losses, much of which came in the area of professional academic and pastoral support to students. Student advocacy also experienced a significant blow from the regime introduced by the former government. Advocacy is now mainly conducted by the university or a company representing the university rather than by independent student service providers. This to means that students facing academic exclusion or those wishing to appeal against results may not have access to independent good ombudsmen or independent representation. As part of the same survey, some 13 out of 18 student organisations reported that they had made substantial, or near total, cuts to departmental or portfolio funding. The broad range of clubs and societies which exist at higher education institutions across our country should be encouraged for the great services that they provide to students. I certainly look back very fondly at the range of services I was able to access at the University of Melbourne when I attended that great university in the 1970s-from the chocolate appreciation society right through to sporting clubs, bushwalking clubs and all the other essential services that should be taken to be part of university life. These clubs and societies diversify and enhance learning in our universities as well as provide important social avenues for students to unwind and enjoy life at university apart from their studies. The opposition does seem to have an obsession with destroying all things union and tearing away at all things that they perceive to be connected with the union movement. We saw that in their attack on the industrial relations system in this country with the Work Choices legislation. Regrettably, that same obsession was manifest in this regime that was introduced to Australian higher education institutions by the former government. It is an obsession which seems to stem from an irrational fear of trade unions and perhaps from the perception of the power of trade unions. But, regrettably, it has blinded those opposite to the true role that student unions have played on university campuses around our country. It has blinded them to that role, even though student unions are unique in the way in which they facilitate and enhance university life and provide essential So intent was the former government on tearing out and striking down anything they regarded as being associated with the union movement that they were prepared to visit destruction on the range of university services; they were prepared to visit extreme damage on the fabric of university life as it has been known for many decades in our country. I would remind the House, just to take a single example, that the current Leader of the Opposition, the member for Wentworth, was once the president of the student union at the University of Sydney. It has been interesting to hear contributions not only to the current form of the legislation but also when the previous version of this bill was debated in the House in February, in that those opposite made almost no mention that some of those sitting opposite-indeed, many former people occupying front-bench positions opposite-were directly and very actively involved in the student union movement. Regrettably, those opposite have persisted in the contributions we have heard thus far with the same kind of obsessive attack on all things union that we heard when the Senate rejected the previous version of this legislation in August. Those speeches in the Senate reflected not the slightest attempt to understand the legislation but were simply filled with statements bordering on abuse and condemning the legislation as what was treated by various Liberal and National senators as compulsory student unionism. We saw from Senator Birmingham the statement that it was a move ‘to a form of compulsion through compulsory student unionism'. We heard from Senator Cash this sort of statement: … the Liberal Party will continue to stand up for the rights of university students … There were multiple references in speeches in the other place to freedom of association. services. We heard from Senator Cash: Freedom of association, including the freedom not to join an association, remains one of the Liberal Party's core beliefs. It is a pity, in fact, that those sentiments about freedom of association were not expanded to trade unions-true trade unions. But I digress. Perhaps the most intemperate comments heard in the other place were from Senator Bernardi, who, as with so many of those opposite, seems to have not read the former form of this legislation. Again, it seems that those opposite have still not grappled with the way this legislation works. Senator Bernardi had this to say: … compulsory student amenities fees-which is just compulsory unionism dressed up under another name. I am yet to hear a university student say, ‘I'm not going to attend university because they do not have the social and creative outlets that I want there.' I would pause there to say that he clearly has not spoken to very many university students, because it is in fact something I have often heard from university students. They directly compare the range of facilities that are available at particular universities. The academic standards, the type of courses that are provided at universities, are only one of the matters that university students take into account in deciding whether or not to attend a particular institution. Particularly these days there is a great range of choice of the universities that one might choose to attend. But to return to Senator Bernardi's comments, he said: A university is meant to be a place of higher learning. It is meant to be a place where you broaden your experiences and you learn to become an independent adult operating in the world. It is not necessarily a place just for slush funds divert money in support of non-conservative governments or to support left-wing student unionists. That is not what it is about. Sure, we accept that there is a hotbed of socialism in some of our universities, which many of us reject, but we should not be paying for them to pursue their leftwing tendencies. That is as far as I will take it, quoting from Senator Bernardi. It is hard to believe that that is a senator speaking in the Australian parliament in 2009, seemingly misunderstanding the way this legislation is structured and misunderstanding the limitations that are placed on this legislation-not only the form of legislation that is directed merely at permitting universities to compulsorily collect a fee to provide services at universities but also omitting to see that there are very, very direct limitations involving any engagement in political activity. Far from this legislation being a return to supposed compulsory student unionism, it is a modest measure designed to repair the damage caused by the former government's legislation. I would hope that, when this legislation returns to the Senate, opposition senators-guided by wise counsel such as from the member for New England about the disastrous effect that former government regime has had on student services-change the position that they adopted when the former form of this legislation was before the Senate. The former government very much seems to have intended to not only pursue its attack on unionism but also directly suppress the political activity and debate which has been and should continue to be a very important aspect of university life in this country. On this side of the chamber we want to encourage young people to be involved in participatory democracyMr Briggs interjecting",137
152,Mr DREYFUS,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"rather than stifle their interests, which I am sure is what the memto ber for Mayo, from his interjection, wishes to occur. He wants to see a stifling of involvement in political activity and a stifling of the richness of university life. We say it is completely appropriate to require all students to contribute to the services that are provided for their assistance. I am happy to be able to say that Universities Australia have argued very directly for the same view. I will quote from the submission that Universities Australia made to the Senate committee inquiry into the former form of this legislation in February 2009. They said: … not all students may use these services during their study, but [Universities Australia] is firmly of the view that it is better for all students to contribute to the provision of the services, which are then available to all, than to not have the services available to those who need them. Additionally, such services will provide a safety net for those students who had begun their study with no need for the services, but whose situations change for the worse during the course of their study. It is not different from the approach that successive Australian governments have taken to such matters as the Medicare levy, which is a levy imposed on all, even though everybody here and the entire Australian community would understand that not all members of the Australian community, happily, have need to avail themselves of the services provided and funded by Medicare, by that levy. Students have experienced indirect costs caused by the so-called voluntary student unionism regime of the former government because universities have had to redirect funds that would have otherwise been spent on other aspects of university activities. Universities have had to redirect funds which otherwise would have been spent on research and teaching to fund services and amenities that, because of the voluntary student unionism regime of the former government and the reduction of funds available, would otherwise have had to be cut. The process will work in reverse. The reintroduction of a student amenities fee will help universities provide those services and allow them not to have to divert essential funds from research and teaching activities. Again, I will quote from something Universities Australia said on the subject. It is the peak body representing the university sector. It said: Universities have struggled for years to prop up essential student services through crosssubsidisation from other parts university budgets, to redress the damage that resulted from the Coalition Government's disastrous Voluntary Student Unionism … legislation … It is also worth quoting from what the Council of Australian Postgraduate Associations said in November last year: … this bill becomes an effective measure to restore and sustain quality student services for postgraduate students that are sustainable into the longer term. It should be noted that the student services and amenities fee will not present a financial imposition on students because they will have the option to take out a HECS style loan as a new component of the Higher Education Loan Program. The reintroduction of this vital legislation shows this government's commitment to all Australians, including students. It shows a commitment by the Australian Labor Party to be the party which provides for and nurtures student learning. It meets an election commitment, which was to restore campus amenities, services and student representation-the effect of the Howard government's legislation being that all of these were heavily cut. The bill will go a long way to reversing the disastrous change in the administration of our tertiary sector which began in 2006 with the coalition's obsessive desire to destroy all things union. I predict, seeing that the member for Mayo is about to follow me, that we are likely to hear a yet further attack directed at all things union as the only possible basis for not supporting this legislation. I commend the bill to the House.",140
153,Mr BRIGGS,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"I appreciate the warm welcome that the member for Isaacs just gave me as the warm-up act to my contribution this evening. It is always nice to hear from the member for Isaacs and be reminded of the talent that is sitting over there on the Labor Party back bench-so he of already stretched tells us. Mr MCMullan-No-one would ever say that about you, mate.",141
154,Mr BRIGGS,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,I think there was an interjection from someone over the other side.,141
155,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,The member for Mayo will ignore the interjection.,141
156,Mr BRIGGS,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"I want to address a couple of comments that the member for Isaacs made about student unionism and the so called attack by this side of the House on unions. It is actually not an attack on unions; it is an attack on compulsion, Member for Isaacs. We have no problem with unions at all. In fact, we have always supported their role in both the workplace and at university. Our problem is when you force people to be members of the union so that they can fund Labor Inc., so that they can fund the training ground. We accept that very senior members of our side-the shadow Treasurer, the member for North Sydney; the member for Wentworth, as we were reminded; the member for Sturt; and, I think, the member for Warringah-were all involved in student politics. Of course they would be; they were interested in politics. The member for Isaacs was involved in student politics when he was a young buck. But the issue was that you chose to be involved. Our problem with this Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Student Services and Amenities) Bill 2009 is that you are charging a compulsory fee to bump up the bottom line of the student union so that it can go out and campaign on issues which largely are not representative of what most university students think. That has always been our problem and that has always been how we have outlined it. The member for Isaacs said that this is meeting an election commitment. I will read to you what the then shadow minister for education said: … I am not considering a HECS style arrangement, I'm not considering a compulsory HECS style arrangement and the whole basis of the proach is one of a voluntary approach. So I am not contemplating a compulsory amenities fee. I am not sure how that set of words is consistent with the election commitment they claim to be meeting. I would have thought that was the complete opposite of the election commitment the Labor Party gave. Like so many things that we heard from the Labor Party before the last election, it turns out that it is just not true-the approach on this issue, their economic conservatism or the buck stopping with the Prime Minister on health and hospital reforms. As we heard today, not one single hospital has been assisted. These promises made before the election have failed to be delivered. We were going to have a superfast internet network, NBN mark 1. We now have NBN mark 2 on the drawing board. All of these promises were made purely to get through an election campaign. The creme de la creme, we should not forget, was, ‘I'll turn the boats back.' That was the best promise that we had from the Prime Minister. It was just days-two days, I think-before the last election that he made that promise, and we have seen that that promise is as fraudulent now as it was when he made it. So this is clearly a commitment the Labor Party have gone back on. This reintroduction of compulsory student unionism is a broken election commitment. The second issue I wanted to address with the member for Isaacs is that he talked about the Liberal Party being the party that likes to censor debate. But we are not the party that have introduced censorship of what we can send out, including whether copies of Hansard can be sent out. I do not think that was our side of politics, Member for Isaacs; I think that was the side of politics that you are on. Under the biggest control freak of a Prime Minister in the history of our country, we now have to check what we can say about apthe policies of the Labor government of the day with bureaucrats in its censorship bureau. But the member for Isaacs has the gall to allege that we are the party of censorship. Give me strength. This is Orwellian in its nature. It is 1984. These guys will say and do anything to mislead this place. It is an extraordinary suggestion to say that the Liberal Party is the party that wants to censor or stop debate. We saw it at the Labor Party's national conference. The minister for finance and his thought police at the front of the room had to see any motion before it could be put to the floor of the conference. That side of parliament have become a North Korean style communist organisation run by a factional warlord, and they want to control every single word, every single sentence and every single thing that happens-so much so that they are now trying to control this side of the House as well. All we have heard in the last few weeks is how much of a debate we do have on the Liberal Party side of politics. So the member for Isaacs's arguments are somewhat befuddling, I must say. The real intent of this bill is to get back what Labor believe in, which is a compulsion for unionism, a compulsion to ensure they get the money and the numbers. The student unionism plays an integral part in the flow-through of young people who make up the Labor Party brand across the country. There is no better example than the several members of parliament from South Australia. My friend the member for Kingston who is, I grant you, a hard worker, came through the training school. The minister responsible for this bill, Ms Kate Ellis, spent five years at Flinders University, three of them, from memory, as president of the student union, so she has a very long history with this area. She went from there into Labor Party staffer land in South Australia, with now Deputy Premier Mr Kevin Foley. So there is a long history here. The usual tactic with the Right in South Australia is that Don Farrell, dubbed the ‘godfather of the Right' by the Adelaide Advertiser-and tonight he and the member for Port Adelaide hold the future of the Premier of South Australia in their hands, whether or not they believe the story, but we will not get into that during this debate-gets the numbers through compulsory student unionism, in the first instance, which allows them to build up their numbers base. They move into the right side of the SDA and they are able to control Labor Party branches and conferences in that way. I am sure my friend the member for Wakefield will very soon correct any mistakes I make on this matter. So this is very much Labor Inc. This is what they do. Student unionism is an important part of the Labor organisation and its structure in terms of how the Labor Party is able to operate, particularly in my state of South Australia, and we have seen that for a very long time. The $250 student services fee was first to part of the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Student Services and Amenities, and Other Measures) Bill 2009 introduced in February 2009, which included a section on VET FEE-HELP. It passed this House in March, and we voted it down in the Senate in August. It has been reintroduced in this place without the VET FEE-HELP section, which has been hived off into a separate bill. So this is very much the ‘student unionism bill 2009'. Let me make this very clear. Unlike what the member for Isaacs said, this was not promised before the last election. Indeed, it was the very opposite that was promised before the last election. There was a very specific promise by the member for Perth as the shadow minister at the timenow our foreign minister-not to do this. But instead we are seeing the second attempt to get this student services fee through. I was interested that the member for Isaacs mentioned a couple of senators who had made contributions on this bill-I think they were Senator Birmingham and Senator Cash. In fact, I thought what the member for Isaacs did was make a very good argument, which was that this is about freedom of association; this is about choice. If students want to be part of the clubs and use the services that are offered at universities, they will join. There is no need for the compulsion. The only reason for the compulsion is to get the funds in the door so the student union, run by the Labor Party organisation, can run their campaigns, as they have for very many years. What Labor do not like about voluntary student unionism is that it has been chipping away at the underbelly of Labor Inc. That is what this bill is about: reestablishing those arrangements, which were taken away in 2005 by the former government. This bill is, very simply, about the reintroduction of student unionism in Australia. It is not about services. It is not about students' well-being on campus. It is about the beginnings of Labor Inc. and important aspects of how the Labor organisation works. That is very much what this bill is about. The minister responsible for this bill is a beneficiary the Labor Inc. organisation. She has very much benefited from how this set-up works, from student union days all the way through. She is now the minister who has been able to reintroduce this bill in an attempt to re-establish Labor domination at universities. What we are saying is that this bill should be treated as we treated its predecessor earlier in the year-with the contempt it deserves. This is a bad piece of legislation. It is a backwards step. It is purely about the reintroduction of compulsory student unionism in Australia. As I said earlier in my contribution, the sue is about compulsion. It is not that we do not like student unions. If people want to be involved in politics at university, if they want to get involved in student unionism or if they want to get involved in sports clubs at university, of course that is encouraged and of course that is what people should do if they wish to, but it should not be compulsory that they do so. They should not be forced to do so. This is a very Labor Party bill. The Labor Party is now trying to censor this side of the House as well as its own MPs and its own members. The Labor Party conference had the thought police at the front there run by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. Any idea to be presented had to go through the minister for finance. This is the most controlling government in the history of Australia. The most controlling Prime Minister in the history of Australia is now trying to control this side of parliament as well as his own. This bill should be treated with the contempt it deserves. It will obviously get through this place when it is put to a vote, but I am sure in the Senate it will be treated as it should be.",142
157,Ms REA,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"I do not know whether it is a good thing or a bad thing that I follow the previous speaker, the member for Mayo, because I could spend the of whole of my time allotted refuting some of the almost hysterical and ridiculous arguments that he was putting forward on the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Student Services and Amenities) Bill 2009. It would also mean that I would not be able to focus on what are some of the very important reforms that are contained in this legislation. For the record, particularly for the member for Mayo, this is not a bill that will reintroduce compulsory student unionism. In fact, the legislation specifically prohibits any university or higher education provider makis- ing it mandatory or requiring that students join a student organisation. But more of what the previous member had to say later. By way of beginning, I have just come from the Main Committee where I moved a private member's motion concerning the Millennium Development Goals, particularly goals 4 and 5, which deal with the very significant issues of attempting to improve the global community's ability to reduce both child mortality and maternal mortality. The reality is that, as we are speaking in this place today, 24,000 children under five will have died of preventable diseases like malaria, diarrhoea and other very common diseases. It is a reality that every minute we are speaking in this debate a woman is dying in childbirth. The reality is that those statistics are so shocking because they are born of poverty and they are born of a lack of resources in many communities across this globe to deal with some of those most fundamental issues like caring for our children and for the women that bear and rear those children. If there is one thing that any community will acknowledge that can reduce poverty, it is access to education. The opportunity for any person on this earth to be able to provide a living for themselves and to improve their existing circumstances is through their ability to gain an education. That is what this is about. It is about allowing students-in fact, enabling and supporting studentsregardless of their background, regardless of their circumstances, to have the right to not just a university education but a university education that will give them all of the support that they need to obtain their degree. This week I am a little bit focused elsewhere. My daughter finished year 12 last Friday. Her father and I delivered her to the Sunshine Coast to enjoy what we all know as ‘schoolies week'. You can appreciate that my mind and my heart are a little bit elsewhere this week. While I hope that she is enjoying herself and enjoying the freedoms and privileges that go with a week without parents, I also hope she is not a victim of what we know are some of the excessive behaviours. But that is just this week. When she comes back from ‘schoolies' she has the rest of her life ahead of her and her goal is to go to university. Her goal is to study journalism at university-a fact which maybe her mother, as a politician, is not necessarily completely comfortable with. Nevertheless, I will do anything to support her in her pursuit of opportunities and her goals as she moves into her adult life. The reason I support this bill is that I want my daughter not just to go to university-to attend tutorials and lectures and to struggle through the pains and trials of assessmentbut also to enjoy her time at university. I want it to be the making of her not just professionally but personally-the making of her as a young woman who will develop a whole range of skills, be they social skills, friends or all those relationships that she will form that, hopefully, will be with her throughout her life. I want her to remember university as a time when she did not just learn what she had to learn for the next exam but when she learnt about life. That is the experience I had at university, bill and the experience I had through many activities at university, whether going to the theatre to see movies, whether playing sport or being able to eat in a cafeteria, because on the student income I received I was still able to buy myself some food, I want her to have. I want her to have those resources and those services as well. I want to know that if she gets into trouble and is finding it difficult, whether it is on a personal or educational level, there is a counselling service that she will be able to go to and seek the advice and guidance that she needs to keep her on her way. I want her to know that there are clubs and different societies where she can pursue all of the interests that she has as a young person and be able to do that with neither the fear of the cost of participating in that activity nor that the service will not be there at all because the university she is attending simply cannot afford it. That is the reality of this bill. It is not sort of politically paranoid rant we heard from the member for Mayo. It is not about, as Senator Abetz said in his speech, turning vice-chancellors into shop stewards. It is not about forcing people to join an organisation that they see no value for. It is actually about supporting students to not just achieve their educational goals but also to enjoy a full round of services on the way. It is not also a broken election commitment, as the member for Mayo indicated. In fact, as Minister Ellis has said on many occasions publicly and in the House, this is about delivering on our election commitment to rebuild essential student services and amenities on university campuses. This is actually about getting back into universities those fundamental supports, resources, services and amenities that students deserve while they study, and indeed, many of them need. When you look at the results of what occurred on campuses right across this country as a result of the draconian legislation that was introduced by the previous Howard government, you can appreciate just how important this particular bill is. If you live in a capital city and you have the opportunity to attend one of the Group of Eight universities, as you know, they were well-resourced and in some ways were able to provide some support to students. They were able to prop up their student organisations with funding agreements. For example, in my own city of Brisbane there is the wellrespected University of Queensland, which I attended, and I admit I was involved in the student union and was very active in it. The University of Queensland was able to support student organisations to provide some of the basic services that had been lost as a result of this legislation. But their bucket of money was finite as well. It meant that the university had to take money away from the teaching and learning resources to provide those essential services to their students. But if you represent a rural or a regional electorate, you know that many universities did not even have that luxury. Many universities simply had to cut services or dramatically increase fees for students to be able to use those services, in effect putting those services out of reach for probably most of the students who actually needed them. Those who often cannot afford something are the ones who need that service the most. So, in effect, you had a whole group of students going through university not realising their full potential when it came to their educational goals because they simply could not afford some of those very essential services that they needed to back them up. We all know that nobody goes to university planning a major event or a dramatic episode that seriously affects their well-being. Nobody plans for the death of a family member or a car accident or many of those things that may either affect them mentally, and therefore seriously affect their educational abilities, or indeed may actually mean that they are not able to do the part-time job that they have been doing to get through university. It means that those people were left with no services to support them, with no counselling to support them, without the ability often to go and get a basic mealthose sorts of things. This legislation is essential to supporting the education of our young people. For example, the student organisation at Charles Darwin University went bankrupt. The SRC at Southern Cross University at Lismore had to be wound down. The University of New England union adjusted by dissolving the student organisation and taking on service provision under the entity of UNE Services. It now receives $300,000 a year from the university. Before the introduction of voluntary student unionism it received $1.85 million a year-a serious reduction in terms of dollars to the sorts of activities that students should enjoy while they are there. It basically means there are no sporting activities and, if you are part of a regional university, often it is the university facilities that are just enjoyed by students but indeed the whole community. Many schools and other community organisations use university facilities because the community simply does not have the resources to build those facilities otherwise. So we saw communities robbed, not just students. Unfortunately, there is a litany of examples of universities that suffered as a result of the Howard government's legislation. Indeed, we do not need to go as far as rural and regional universities. In my own electorate we have Griffith University nearby, the second largest university in Brisbane, a very well established, well respected university. Its main campus at Nathan is just across the border in the electorate of my good friend the member for Moreton. The Mount Gravatt campus is contained within the electorate of Bonner. That student organisation disappeared. As a result, though, of what is contained in this legislation, the $250 fee that the government is now allowing universities to require students to pay, it will in fact restore many of the very important services that were lost as a result of the SRC going under. They were unable to collect voluntary fees. We know that. It is not an argument for compulsory student unionism to acknowledge that voluntary fees, when you are a student, are the last thing on your mind. But if the university asks you to pay a simple fee of $250 and no more for the year, which in fact therefore provides the campus with the resources that it needs to provide child care, counselling and sporting facilities, that is not too onerous a burden on students and it provides them with many of the resources that are so essential. There is paranoia and what can only be considered an ideologically driven argument from the other side. There is a fear of students organising collectively. There is, as the not member for Isaacs said, a fear of freedom of association. But the legislation illustrates some 16 items where the money can be spent-child care, legal services, health care, employment and academic support, just to name a few. I was halfway through my university degree when my first child was born. I know how important it was for me to finish my degree to have access to affordable child care on campus with my child nearby. So this is not an argument about how big a student protest you can fund, this is an argument about how people actually get their qualifications and get through university life without going under. If it were not for the support of some legal services, many students, because of circumstances that they could never predict, would be walking away from universities-a lifetime of opportunity wasted. Many female students and indeed many male students who do not have access to affordable child care would have to give up university and go out to full-time work rather than pursuing their dream and their education goals. I cannot understand how the opposition can oppose this bill. I cannot understand how requiring a services fee-to provide sporting activities, legal support, counselling services, academic support and subsidies for textbooks and other materials that students need to continue in their degree-suddenly translates into ‘Labor Inc.' as the member for Mayo called it. They somehow think that providing subsidised textbooks is going to create some sort of ‘student revolutionary guard' that is going to fundamentally attack the Liberal Party and make them disappear. That is not what this legislation is about. is not, in fact, what student unionism is about. Understanding and appreciating that campuses need to make sure the money goes into the services students need is the very reason why the government is not reintroducing compulsory student unionism. It is the very reason why the government is not allowing student unions to develop and to redirect funds into what they see as political campaigns. In some universities there are tens of thousands of students. They are major communities, they are cities in themselves, and they have a right to say what services they want. They have a right to argue for the organisations and activities they want to be able to participate in not just to obtain their degree but to attain a level of maturity, to move into young adulthood and to participate in community life as well as professional life. It is important that the myths get put to bed and that we acknowledge the important reforms in this legislation that will enable students to do well. It is important that the students at Mount Gravatt, at Griffith University, at the University of Queensland and indeed at Charles Darwin University and James Cook University are able to enjoy a fulfilling and rewarding time at university and look back on university as a memorable time. It is also important that they are able to participate in democratic activities. It is important that young people who are going to university, who are eventually going to become the professionals and political leaders of Australia in the future, are not just sitting in a library beavering away at computer screens for hours a day because they cannot afford the textbooks they need. We do not want them to become insular, single-minded people who have to scrape everything together just to get through their exams. They need to be well-rounded young adults. They need to understand their professional duties It but they also need to be able to enjoy and broaden their own personal skills and social activities by participating in all that campus life has to offer. Senator Abetz made comments about vice-chancellors becoming shop stewards. The member for Mayo made comments about creating factional warlords in the Labor Party. He obviously does not understand the factional leaders; they come from a range of backgrounds-certainly not just from university. The opposition cannot see that this is a balanced and practical approach to providing essential student activities. Unfortunately their education, and their ability to read the legislation, has failed them.",144
158,Mr SLIPPER,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"I do not say that the statement ‘You can put lipstick on a pig but it remains a pig' is an original statement, because it certainly is not, but in my view the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Student Services and Amenities) Bill 2009 is ‘a pig'. This is one of the most outrageous pieces of legislation that I have seen introduced into the House of Representatives. The government claims that it is not seeking to re-institute compulsory student unionism. Well, this is in effect compulsory student unionism by stealth. I do not have a problem with students choosing to make an investment in facilities at university, I do not have a problem with students spending money on, perhaps, sporting facilities, but I am opposed to the element of compulsion. This legislation, as you would know, Madam Deputy Speaker, is being introduced by a party which in government has historically supported compulsory student unionism and also compulsory unionism in the community more generally. It is the old ‘no ticket, no start'-if you do not sign up to the union, you do not get a job. I strongly support the people in the community who want to join a union, if that is their choice, whether it be a labour union or a student union. But I also support the right of those who choose not to join, because I think that in Australia in 2009 we should consider ourselves to be a democracy. I do not believe in conscripting people into membership of organisations-it ought to be voluntary. The government, unfortunately, through the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Student Services and Amenities) Bill 2009 is bringing in a piece of legislation which effectively rips up the promises made by the government when in opposition prior to the 2007 election. It has been quoted undoubtedly in the House before tonight that the then shadow minister for education, the now Minister for Foreign Affairs, said in May 2007: I am not considering a HECS style arrangement. I am not considering a compulsory HECS style arrangement and the whole basis of proach is one of a voluntary approach. So I am not contemplating a compulsory amenities fee. So effectively he told the people of Australia, who voted at the election later that year, that Labor would not be bringing in a compulsory amenities fee. What exactly does this legislation do? This legislation turns back the clock-turns it way back. In effect it brings in a compulsory and significant tax of $250 for each and every one of the million tertiary students in Australia. I have no doubt that the facilities at universities in many cases are superb. I have no doubt that they obviously need money to survive, they obviously need assistance and they obviously need support, but it is wrong for the government to allow universities to conscript students into making a compulsory payment. It is the antithesis of democracy. In many cases students will never use those facilities, so why should they be compelled to pay for those facilities? I have not yet heard an argument from the government that is in any way, shape or form remotely compelling as to why the government is ripping up a pre-election promise by, essentially, wanting to take control of $250 of each and every one of the one million tertiary students in Australia. It really is a ‘welcome to Labor's reality' tax. I am very disappointed in the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the government for defrauding the Australian people as they did at the election later in 2007. On top of that, students who pay the fees will have very little say on how those fees are going to be spent. I know that there is supposed to be some form of consultation. Under the rules, universities are required to talk with students about where the money is directed. However, this consultation is likely to be with the ‘elected' representatives of the student union, who historically have been appointed by the very small minority of the the apstudent body which takes part in a noncompulsory vote. I am told that figures sometimes show as little as five per cent or 10 per cent of students actually vote to appoint student union office bearers, so a nonrepresentative group will be the people sitting down with the university authorities to talk about how this confiscated $250 from our one million tertiary students in Australia will actually be spent. I would like to make a prediction that the student fees will, in effect, fund the actions and activities selected by the student union hierarchy, whether or not individual students are supportive. I ask the government to reconsider because how on earth can you ask students to pay $250 to a university to be used for purposes dictated by a body elected by five to 10 per cent of the student membership? I was a very strong supporter of the voluntary student unionism legislation introduced by the Howard government in 2005 because it gave students a choice as to whether they would be members of the union. Effectively, we gave them a choice as to whether they wanted to pay money to be part of a union which in many cases would espouse political views diametrically opposed to their own. We also gave them a choice on where they would spend their money. This bill before the House, the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Student Services and Amenities) Bill 2009, essentially deprives students of that right. We are treating students as ing substandard Australians and this bill takes away choice for what, it could be argued, is the political advantage of Labor. As they enter university, students are hit with myriad costs. They emerge from the school system, which is fairly regimented and regulated, where in many cases they do not have to think for themselves about choices in the way that they will at university. They are hit with myriad costs that they previously have not had to bear. These costs can include textbooks, a computer and software-all of which are actually quite expensive these days-as well as accommodation, transport, food and so on. For those students who are entering university directly from year 12 it is a daunting new world that they face. Often they are leaving home for the first time and facing the prospect of having to fend for themselves for the first time; away from the comfort, security and love of their parents' home, to make the journey toward education and career. This is particularly so for students from regional areas who go to the capital cities to study. To be hit within additional Labor charge of up to $250 will be a significant additional burden. It will be interesting to know what these fees go to in the area of services. But in many cases they will be services the students will not need, want or use. For many students, it is simply wasted money. Wouldn't it be better to allow students the discretionary opportunity to use that money for purposes more directly associated with the advancement of their educational progress, like buying extra books, rather than having it confiscated and used, in many cases, for political activities. It should be noted also that the legislation does not preclude student unions from spending student money on extremist political causes. The bill leaves open a huge range of political activities upon which this combepulsory fee could be spent. For instance, campaigns for or against political causes, specific legislation, policies or party policies are not precluded. The bill does not actually stop the use of these compulsorily acquired funds by student media for whatever minority cause the student union bosses want to use this money for. I find this bill is the absolute antithesis of democracy. The bill amounts to a rort created by the Australian Labor government, one that is impacting not only on the wallets of students but also on their freedom to choose who they associate with and their political alliances. Why on earth should students be forced to pay $250, which, after this token form of consultation by universities, could be allocated to student unions and used to promote political causes diametrically opposed to what the students believe in? This is just shocking. It is appalling. This is a situation which is completely and totally unacceptable. As a member for a regional area, I am very fortunate to represent the University of the Sunshine Coast. This is a wonderful new institution, which obtained its full independent status through the intervention of Dr David Kemp, who overruled the bureaucrats in the department of education after the university made a case to him, supported by local members. This university is doing a wonderful job. Even though it is doing a wonderful job, as Australia's newest greenfield university it is still not able to provide the range of educational disciplines that many local students want, so many students who want to study medicine, law, dentistry, veterinary science or a range of other academic disciplines are still forced to go away from the Sunshine Coast, which is regrettable because I would like to see at least a medical school and a legal school at the University of the Sunshine Coast. They are forced to go to a capital city-in most cases Brisbane-where they have a huge range of new expenses. This $250 charge, if the universities in Queensland choose to impose it-and I suspect they will-will make it more difficult for those students to thrive and survive and get the educational resources they need to enable them to pass their exams and qualify in a professional area. To add to the concern of students, the fee is indexed. The government has not indexed the qualification levels for access to the Commonwealth seniors health card. More and more Australian seniors are now being excluded from holding the Commonwealth seniors health card because the income levels have not been indexed, and this is at a stage in their lives when they need access to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme at concessional rates. While the government has not indexed access to the Commonwealth seniors health card, it is in fact indexing this $250 fee to take into account future inflation increases. It is a cost that will rise considerably over time. It will be a handy little earner for the Labor Party and the Labor Party apparatchiks who operate through many student unions. Over three years alone, at three per cent annually, the figure would increase to $273. I suppose every cloud has a silver lining, even if the silver lining is a fairly dud silver-I was going to say ‘dull' silver, but it is probably dud silver as well. The government will allow students to take out a loan for this cost, a loan that could be paid back later, along with other education related expenses. But we have a situation here where this bill will make the attaining of tertiary qualifications just that little bit more difficult. As I said earlier, this fee was never discussed by the government during the election campaign. It was never revealed as a Labor plan. People were duped and deceived into voting for the Labor Party on the basis that the Labor Party was not going to introduce an amenities fee or a compulsory fee for students. Despite that and despite the comments made by the now Minister for Foreign Affairs when he was the shadow minister for education, that promise has been torn up. People have been conned and deceived, and the government tries to suggest that this is somehow an acceptable position. Let us look at a couple of the defects in the bill. There are many defects in the bill, but this bill makes no provision for any government monitoring to make sure that the money is spent sensibly. There is no clear understanding of any obligations that the education providers themselves-the ones who get the money-may have to provide certain services, representations and support to students. Frankly, this bill shows a complete and total lack of understanding of the challenges facing university students. It is heavily biased to the support of the Labor side of politics. It brings in an element of compulsion, an element of conscription, without taking into account the impact on the lives of ordinary, real, decent young Australians, who are of course our nation's future. It is a broken election promise by a government that will do anything and say anything to achieve its political goal, no matter what the consequences for the people of Australia. Is this bill a precursor of federal legislation making trade unionism compulsory? Where on earth will the government stop in its pursuit of its ideological aims? This bill, as I said at the outset, is a pig. The government might have put lipstick on the pig, but it is still a pig. It is a pig that ought to be slaughtirely. tered.",148
159,Mr TREVOR,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"I wish to speak tonight on the government's Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Student Services and Amenities) Bill 2009 and to highlight the unparalleled importance of it for students of tertiary institutions in this country. The amendments proposed in the bill will provide measures that support a balanced, practical and sustainable solution to rebuilding student support services. I am a firm believer that, in order to uphold the quality of the universities our proud country has, we must be committed to ensuring that higher education students have access to adequate amenities and services as well as access to vital, independent, democratic student representation. Without these fundamental and basic requirements the once great conditions of our universities will be lost; a distant memory from a time long since past. It is in my opinion irrefutable that, in order to maintain services and amenities of any kind, funding is required. It is also irrefutable that many people, particularly university students who may be struggling financially already, will not pay a fee for something unless they have to, irrespective of how important they may perceive it to be. Basically, if the students do not have to pay, most will not, and if they do not pay, the services and amenities cannot be maintained. The amendments proposed in this bill allow higher education providers to choose whether they want to implement a compulsory student service fee capped at $250 per student per annum. Whilst the bill does not make it mandatory for higher education providers to impose this fee, it does provide the opportunity for our higher education facilities that require additional funding to collect it in this manner. This makes the law more flexible as it does not force these facilities to impose the fee, nor does it disallow it enThe amendment creates a vital chance for higher education providers to accumulate the funding required to sustain student services and amenities. If we fail to support these changes we will witness the continued deterioration of services and amenities in our universities to the very point of no return, when the amenities become irreparable and the services unsalvageable. I have already made the point of saying that we recognise the fact that many university students may be struggling financially and that this fee could further their financial troubles. To combat this and provide an opportunity for students to be relieved of this burden whilst they study, the bill has included the innovative decision to provide eligible students with the option of a loan for this fee through the establishment of a new component of the Higher Education Loan Program, known as HELP, which has been named services and amenities, SA-HELP. This not only will allow the universities the privilege of being able to accumulate funds for services and amenities but will also allow students to put off paying the fees. The result of course is a win-win, with more funding for services and amenities at universities and no money out of students' pockets at a time in their life when they can least afford it. As I understand it, the National Party have recognised publicly that the current approach to funding student services and amenities is not sustainable and that it has had a terrible impact particularly on our rural and regional campuses. As I further understand it, they voted at a recent party conference to support compulsory fees being levied on university students to support services and amenities on campus. Despite this they did not support the passage of this critical bill in the Senate, preferring to side with coalition partners and ignoring the needs of regional students. Coming from a regional area, I know the value of our regional campuses and the value of student services to students who relocate to study. Regional campuses allow many students the opportunity to engage in higher learning, but without funding this opportunity may be lost and with it the opportunity for students from my area to study closer to home. Some may be forced to relocate, but without vital funding the universities they elect to go to cannot provide the fundamental support services that these students will need to survive in a place unknown to them. Moving away from home to the city is already a very daunting prospect for many 17and 18year-olds from regional and rural areas such as those that my electorate encompasses. If we fail to grasp this opportunity to ject funding into the services that support these young adults, then we are failing as their elected representatives and failing as their government. These students need the support to make it possible for them to survive. Without it, higher education for many of them will become impossible. I cannot and will not stand by and let these students be neglected and left to fend for themselves. It is wrong and I ask, today, that the National Party stand up for their own beliefs and prove to everyone, especially themselves, that they are capable of not only making a decision but delivering on it. The National Party need to put their beliefs where their mouth is and follow with their support for our universities and students. The cost is already too great and every delay pushes our once great institutions further towards the brink. The current legislation is crippling universities around the country by depriving higher education providers of the vital funding they need to maintain adequate student services and amenities. They are the very same services and amenities which students have been without, and will continue to suffer without, purely because of the Liberal Party's outdated and ideological obsession with this issue. With respect, they went too far with their approach to university services and amenities, and students are being forced to pay the consequences. Under their scheme close to $170 million was ripped out of university funding resulting in the decline and in some instances the complete closure of vital health, counselling, employment, child care, sporting and fitness services. Without the provision of these services and amenities by higher education providers many students have been forced to pay higher prices for things such as child care, parking, books, computer labs, sport and food. This of course has resulted in higher costs for students. How is it rational that we remove a fee on reinstudents that then results in an increase to their costs? Some universities have highlighted incredible price hikes for services and amenities such as parking, food and child care, which, in one case, has seen an increase of approximately 500 per cent annually. Surely common sense and logic would dictate that we should implement a strategy that will enable universities to provide many of these services without drawing the funding from somewhere else, as numerous universities have been forced to do. Some universities, in attempting to combat the rising costs of amenities and services, have reported having to redirect funding out of research and teaching budgets.",152
160,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION,"Order! The debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 34. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. The honourable member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA Mrs Irwin-On behalf of the Standing Committee on Petitions, and in accordance with standing order 207, I present the following petitions: To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives: NA NA We, the undersigned citizens draw to the attention of the House of Representatives assembled, that the definition of marriage as “a union between one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life” is the foundation upon which our families are built and on which our society stands. To alter the definition of marriage to include same-sex “marriage”, as proposed by the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill, would be to change the very structure of society to the detriment of all, especially dren. We, the undersigned citizens therefore request that the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2009, be opposed. by Mrs Irwin (from 3,904 citizens) To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives: The World League for Protection of Animals, Inc End Recreational Hunting on Public Lands and Reserves We, the undersigned citizens and residents of Australia, draw to the attention of the House our united opposition to the inhumane practice of recreational hunting on public government lards. To permit, and by so doing, encourage shooting for pleasure is a completely anti-social and dangerous activity for governments to be endorsing. Recreational hunting on public lands not only endangers native fauna but also puts at risk public safety. In NSW, government officials have now permitted recreational hunting in some 372 public forests, covering more than 2 million hectares, with more public lands soon to be declared “open season”. The NSW Game Council is currently using tax payers' money to promote market and expand the interests of hunters groups. on the Government's Game Council are prohunting interests, with most being active hunters themselves. Shooters' groups are presently overMarriage seeing their own dangerous activities on public lands. Bows and arrows and hunting dogs are sanctioned under current government legislation, permitting unacceptable cruelty to both introduced animals and native wildlife. We, the undersigned, seek the abolition of all hunting practices on public lands and reserves. by Mrs Irwin (from 361 citizens) Youth Allowance To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House to the Rudd Government's changes to the workforce participation chilcriteria for establishing independence under Youth Allowance by removing the following two eligibility criteria: that the recipient worked part-time for 15+ hours per week for two years or more since leaving school; and the recipient earned, in an 18-month period since leaving school, an amount equivalent to 75% of the maxiHunting mum rate of pay (in 2009 this requires earnings of $19,532). The effect of this change is that eligibility criteria for the Independent Youth Allowance will retrospectively require participants to complete 30 hours work per week over a 18/24 month period compared to earning $19,532 over 18 months. This means a student who has complied with the previous rules but not worked 30 hours per week will have lost the credit for their effort and must start again thus losing 2 years before commencing a University Course. These proposal further disadvantages young people whose place of residence is beyond daily commuting distance from a University and thus must fund their total accommodation costs over and above the other direct costs of such an education. That working 30 hours per week while attending University is virtually impossible in more intensive courses. We therefore ask the House to change the criteria so that rural and regional students are not disadAll the representatives vantaged. by Mrs Irwin (from 216 citizens) Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of certain, concerned citizens of Australia Draws to the attention of the House the damage being caused to the heritage and other trees in the Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney by the Grey Headed Flying Fox camp over the past 10 years. This is no longer sustainable so a relocation program is proposed which requires the assent of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts. We therefore ask the House to request the Minister to approve the relocation of the Flying Foxes in May 2010 as proposed by the Botanic Gardens Trust and already approved by the NSW DECCW. If this is not done, another 40 significant old trees, as well as many palms and shrubs, are expected to die within the next 3 years and ultimately much of the Gardens will be destroyed. The bats will then move on anyway. by Mrs Irwin (from 1,863 citizens) Northern Territory Intervention Strategy To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House: the discriminating effects of the Northern Territory Emergency Response. As it is currently configured and being carried out, the Emergency Response is incompatible with Australia's obligations under - The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and - The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights treaties to which Australia is a party, as well as incompatible with - The Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples to which Australia has affirmed its support. We therefore ask the House to: - Reinstate urgently the protections of the Racial Discrimination Act in regard to the Indigenous people of the Northern Territory and - Consult widely with them about effective measures which respect the rights of Indigenous people and are free of racial discrimination. by Mrs Irwin (from 176 citizens) Youth Allowance To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives The petitioners believe that the Youth Allowance changes proposed in the Federal Budget place another barrier to university participation for students in regional areas; unfairly discriminate against students currently undertaking a ‘gap' year; and contradict other efforts to increase university participation by students from rural and regional Australia. We therefore ask the House to retain the 2nd and 3rd elements of the workforce criterion so that tertiary education is accessible to regional students. by Mrs Irwin (from 20 citizens) Administration of Justice To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives; This petition of a ‘resident of Australia' (father) and ‘Certain citizens of Australia' namely his 2 children, draws to the attention of the House: issues pursuant to section 72(ii) of the Constitution of Australia, wrongful misbehaviour by other than proper administrations of justice by judges, committed at the bench of the Family and High Courts, in breach of laws of the Commonwealth. The first judge committed wrongful Misbehaviours at the bench of the Family Court, was granted “Immunity” not created by a law of the Commonwealth Parliament, by a superior Family Court judge. Then judges of the High Court, denied the right of hearings to challenge the immunity and correct the wrongs. This “Immunity” concealed judicial misbehaviours that perverted justice by “defeating the course of justice in relation to the judicial power of the Commonwealth.” This denied the House knowledge of “Proven judicial Misbehaviour”, the public knowledge of judicial “Contempt of the Court” and fraudulent actions of “dereliction of judicial duty' by judges who are instruments/officers of those Commonwealth Courts. We pray the House: 1. Accept the above stated has occurred and are “Judicial Misbehaviour” within the meaning of “section 72(ii) of the Constitution of Australia (Cth)” that require both Houses of Parliament to make a decision on. 2. For the afore-sought decision to be made, we pray the House causes a “Commission of Inquiry” be held, on finding true, pray for the removal of those judges. by Mrs Irwin (from 1 citizen) Administration of Justice To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives; This petition of a ‘resident of Australia' (father) and ‘Certain citizens of Australia' namely his 2 children, draws to the attention of the House: the requirement for a Committee with Quasi Judicial powers to accept and determine, from the people, section 72(ii) of the Constitution of Australia issues and improper administrations of justice committed in the Federal Courts of Australia. The Queen's most Excellent Majesty sets the example in Her Honourable Home by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. We seek the like to accept complaints like; of judicial wrongs, and denials of justice, from a wronged person/s in person. There is/will be a petition decision pursuant to section 72(ii) tion sought in this Honourable House that such a body could have decided before it is placed before this Honourable House. We pray the House; Accepts this is but one issue with JUST CAUSE to URGENTLY CREATE a “Judicial Committee of Inquiry” that has Quasi Judicial powers to; Accept complaints citing the judiciary. Make “section 72(ii) of the Constitution(Cth)” recommendations to the House. Make “section 75(v) of the Constitution(Cth)” applications to a Court on behalf of members of the public. Make recommendations of compensation for judicial wrongs be paid to the party/ies by whom appropriate other than a judicial officer. The power to send a matter back to the Court, including the High Court, for reconsideration. by Mrs Irwin (from 1 citizen) Administration of Justice To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives; This petition of a ‘resident of Australia' (father) and ‘Certain citizens of Australia' namely his 2 children, draws to the attention of the House: issues regarding the proper administration of justice and unfairness caused persons lacking legal representation. Persons seeking justice without representation is a growing issue and burden on the Federal Courts, namely the Family Court. These persons have a right to a MCKenzie Friend. The assistance of a MCKenzie Friend is often limited to note taking, and denied; a right to inspect evidence, the right of audience in the presentation of evidence, and the like. It appears this is due to persons trained at law are fearful the disadvantage caused the unrepresented persons, by lack of representation, may be reduced if the Friend gives any more help than note of the petitioners for a taking. of the ConstituWe pray the House; Urgently makes laws which define the rights and obligations of a MCKenzie Friend, for the Family or Federal Courts that are parallel to the Family Court Rules for a Case Guardian including the right of audience but not the right to make written applications on behalf of the party. Furthermore, make Law that the words ‘any person holding office under the Commonwealth” stated in “section 33 of the Judiciary Act 1903(Cth)” means or includes in its meaning “Commonwealth public official” as defined by the “Criminal Code Act 1995(Cth)” to enable corrections to judicial wrongs and errors in the High Court. by Mrs Irwin (from 1 citizen) MCMillan Electorate: Moe Infrastructure To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives, This petition is of residents of Moe, Newborough and district and draws to the attention of the House that we support improving, renovating and extending the Moe Library and Latrobe City Council Service Centre on their present site. We also support significantly upgrading Moe's transport infrastructure with the provision of grated transport interchange in and around Moe railway station. We further draw to the attention of the House a 2007 petition of residents (attached) from Moe district to Latrobe City Council opposing the relocation of the Moe Library and Council Service Centre and supporting their upgrade on their current site. We therefore ask the House to oppose the relocation of the Moe Library and Latrobe Council Service Centre to the railway corridor, to support their improvement on their current site, and to support quite separate and much needed improvements to Moe's transport infrastructure. by Mrs Irwin (from 18 citizens) Australian Defence Force Cadets To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of the members of the 11th Light Horse Caboolture Troop and Military Museum Association Inc. Draws to the attention of the House: the lack of tangible recognition by the Australian Government of the service to our nation by the many young Australians who have undergone military training in the Army, Navy and Air Force cadets. At the end of four years training, cadets are basically prepared for military service in the unfortuThis nate circumstance that this becomes necessary, Cadets have regularly been used by schools, RSL. clubs, state and federal governments as a cost effective way of providing a uniformed ceremonial parade whenever such an occasion is needed. This service to the nation by cadets has been on an entirely voluntary basis. Of all the young people who are eligible, only 1% of young Australians actually volunteer to serve our nation with pride in the A.D.F. cadets. Cadets realise that when wearing their uniforms they are representing Australia. Many countries recognize the commitment of the personnel in their cadet corps. In 2006, Canada created a medal to recognize continuous meritorious service by deserving cadets. To qualify for this award, a serving or former cadet must have successfully completed four years of honourable an inte- service with no serious infractions. We therefore ask the House to: create a new civil award (medal) to recognize the service to Australia by serving and former A.D.F. cadets. by Mrs Irwin (from 797 citizens) National Marriage Day To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives: PETITION TO DECLARE THE 13TH AUGUST NA We, the undersigned citizens of Australia draw to the attention of the House of Representatives, the undeniable correlations between family breakdown and the other pathways to poverty, educational failure, serious personal debt, crime, welfare dependency and addiction. In recognition of the positive contribution that intact, stable marriages make to the well-being of children and society we call upon the House of Representatives to demonstrate its support for marriage by declaring the 13th August each year as National Marriage Day. by Mrs Irwin (from 525 citizens) Immigration To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives petition of … Certain citizens of Australia Draws to the attention of the house … The alarming increase of Migration. We therefore ask the house to: Decrease the numbers of migrants as Australia is now in a major drought, the housing situation is unable to house many of our own Citizens-It is impossible to be admitted to a Public Hospital and there are not enough jobs for school leavers or un-skilled workers. by Mrs Irwin (from 21 citizens) Petitions received. Petitions received. Responses Mrs Irwin-Ministerial responses to petitions previously presented to the House have been received as follows: Rail Freight Noise Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter dated 19 August 2009 about a petition seeking changes to the construction approval conditions for the Australian Rail Track Corporation's (ARTC) Southern Sydney Freight Line (SSFL) project. This is a matter that should be referred to the State Government, as they set the regulations and standards around the construction for any rail project in New South Wales. It should however be noted that the SSFL proposal underwent a comprehensive planning and environmental assessment before it was approved. In particular, it underwent an assessment process under Part 3A of the NSW Environment Planning and Assessment Act 1979. In addition to this, the Australian Government Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts also assessed the project under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. Following these assessments, the NSW Minister for Planning imposed 74 conditions to his approval and the Hon Peter Garrett AM MP, Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, additional eight. The ARTC has committed to fully comply with all of the conditions outlined as part of the proval process, including those relating to noise and vibrations. Thus, the ARTC is investing $13.5m to install noise walls along the SSFL. The specific locations and length of the noise walls have been determined by site specific modelling to ensure the noise along the SSFL complies with the conditions set out in the NSW Government's planning for Elective surgery approval. Thank you for raising this matter. from the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, Mr Albanese Child Support Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 19 August 2009 to the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, the Hon Jenny Macklin MP, regarding a submission to the Standing Committee on Petitions. As the petition relates to child support service delivery matters, your letter was forwarded to me as the Minister responsible for the Child Support Agency (CSA). The petition writer expresses concern over the increase in the amount of child support they are required to pay to the CSA and requests an immediate reduction in the amount collected. Having received advice from the CSA, I can provide you with a general response to the issues raised in the petition. The principle of the Child Support Scheme is to ensure that children continue to be supported following the event of their parents' separation. The CSA has a responsibility to collect child support for the benefit of the children in accordance with their parents' financial capacity. I assure you, it is not the CSA's intention to cause any parent undue financial hardship in administering the Scheme. When a parent has overdue child support, the CSA will attempt to negotiate voluntary arrangements with the parent in the first instance. Where this is not possible, the CSA will seek to enforce an the collection of the outstanding child support based on the parent's particular circumstances. In enforcing the collection of outstanding child ap- support, the CSA will seek information from the parent, as well as from third parties, such as employers, financial institutions or other government departments, to determine the parent's capacity to pay. Once the CSA has an understanding of the parent's true financial capacity to pay child support, it will make a decision on the most appropriate amount of child support payable. The CSA recognises that parent's circumstances can change. If the petition writer's circumstances have changed significantly since the CSA's decision I encourage them to write directly to the CSA to provide sufficient information to substantiate their claim of financial hardship. Alternatively, if the Committee would like more specific information about this matter, they can contact Mr James Sorahan from my office on (02) 6277 7200. Once again, thank you for your letter. I trust this information is of assistance. from the Minister for Human Services and Minister for Financial Services, Superannuation and Corporate Law, Mr Bowen Charter of Rights Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 9 September 2009 referring to a petition submitted to the Standing Committee on Petitions regarding the adoption of a charter of rights. As you are aware, the Attorney-General, the Hon Robert MCClelland MP, received the report of the National Human Rights Consultation Committee on 30 September 2009 and publicly released the report, on behalf of the Government, on 8 October 2009. This report represents more than nine months of consultations by the independent Committee chaired by Father Frank Brennan SJ AO and comprising Mary Kostakidis, Tammy Williams and Mick Palmer AO. The Committee received more than 35,000 submissions, conducted 66 community roundtables in 52 locations, commissioned research and focus groups, conducted online forums and had discussions with many Australians. The Government welcomes the Committee's report. The Committee has provided the Government and the community with a valuable document which gives an overview of what we do well and options for addressing the areas where we can do better in the area of human rights protection. The petition that was attached to your letter cusses whether the Government supports the introduction of a statutory bill of rights. The ernment has not made a decision about this issue. The Government has made it clear that any options developed by the Committee should preserve parliamentary sovereignty and not include a constitutionally entrenched bill of rights. It is also important that any response appropriately balances the rights of all groups in society. In addition to its recommendation about a statutory bill of rights, the Committee makes a number of recommendations to enhance human rights education and parliamentary scrutiny and legislative processes. The Government will be giving careful consideration to all of the Committee's recommendations before responding to this report in the coming months. I trust that this information is of assistance to the Committee. from the Attorney-General, Mr MCClelland Wakefield Electorate: Health Services Dear Mrs Irwin Thank you for your letter of 9 September 2009 to the Minister for Health and Ageing, the Hon Nicola Roxon MP, regarding the current petition under the Committee's consideration concerning the proposed change to the rural classification of Gawler. Your letter has been referred to me as the Minister for Indigenous Health, Rural and Regional Health and Regional Services Delivery. I note that the petitioners reject the introduction of the Australian Standard Geographical Classification - Remoteness Areas (ASGC-RA) system and have put forward their views on its implications on the local workforce and ability to provide after-hours and emergency services in the Gawler area. As I mentioned in my previous correspondence of 24 September 2009, the Australian Government has agreed to Gawler GP Inc using the term ‘Rural in Transition', however, the geographical classification of Gawler will remain as ASGC-RA1 (Major City). I appreciate that there are local issues with respect to Gawler and where possible these have been dis- responded to by the Government. Further, the Government has agreed to some changes in the Gov- training for Rural and Remote Procedural GPs program that address issues of concern in a number of communities around Australia, including Gawler. However, I must reiterate that the introduction of the ASGC-RA classification system forms a basis for rural health reform to ensure that rural programs are targeted to areas of greatest need. Moving to ASGC-RA will strengthen support to rural and remote communities, and ensure a more equitable distribution of the medical workforce. I can assure you that the Government will be closely monitoring the success of the transition to the ASGC-RA on the Gawler community, particularly with regard to changes to doctor numbers. I trust that the above information is of use. from the Minister for Indigenous Health, Rural and Regional Health and Regional Services Delivery, Mr Snowdon Parallel Import Restrictions on Books Dear Mrs Irwin I refer to your letter dated 16 September 2009 attaching the petition submitted to your Committee, from citizens of central Victoria, regarding the review by the Productivity Commission of the provisions relating to the parallel importation of books under the Copyright Act 1968. I acknowledge the position put forward in the petition urging the Government to reject the recommendations of the Productivity Commission to remove the restrictions against the parallel importation of books. The Government is carefully considering this matter, particularly in regard to the impact of the recommendations on key stakeholders. The Government will respond to the Productivity Commission report in due course. From the Attorney-General, MCClelland",153
161,Mrs IRWIN,AS NATIONAL MARRIAGE DAY,"Fowler) (8.32 pm)Tonight I wish to speak on the work of the Petitions Committee. In my regular statements to the chamber of a Monday evening I have spoken about the rules governing petitions, the committee's recent report on electronic petitioning and, on occasion, individual petitions of interest. Tonight I want to talk about another important aspect of the committee's work-what happens after petitions are presented to the House. Also, as this is the final petitions statement of the year, I will conclude with an overview of the committee's work for 2009. It will not come as a surprise to people who have heard these statements that the committee considers ministerial responses to be a very important part of the petitions process. We see it as a great advance that in this parliament virtually all petitions receive a ministerial response. It was not always the case. In our view these responses are serious, informative and are written in good faith. They add considerably to the public's ability to know what is happening in relation to petitioners' concerns or grievances. It is also noteworthy that the majority of ministerial responses are timely. I cannot put too great an emphasis on the committee's appreciation of how ministers have responded in this way to the new rules governing petitions. It really does make a difference to the state of knowledge on these issues and to government accountability. Members will be aware that there is a further component to the work of the committee: our public hearings. These are in some ways different to the hearings of some other committees in that they arise not from a formal inquiry but from the committee's regular work in receiving and considering petitions on a day-today basis. A recent hearing, on Mr 28 October this year, showed the virtues of this practice. Appearing before the commitStatements tee were representatives of the Department of Education, Employment, and Workplace Relations, the Department of Immigration and Citizenship, and the Department of Human Services. The committee asked questions about changes to youth allowance, mandatory detention and detention debt, and the placement of Medicare offices. The transcript is on the committee's webpage. I think that my colleagues in the committee will agree that in each case the standard of response and the willingness to engage and to respond in good faith to the committee's questions was evident. The committee was pleased with the outcome. This week we are looking forward to another public hearing on Wednesday. This time the committee will be speaking to representatives of the Department of Defence, the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, and the Department of Health and Ageing. We will discuss unidentified war graves in New Guinea and its environs; forgotten Australians; disaster recovery payments; various aspects of the responsibilities of the Department of Health and Ageing including coverage for dental treatment under Medicare and residential and aged care; and the Australian Standard Geographical Classification Remoteness Areas classification of a regional centre-Gawler, in South Australia. The sheer breadth of the committee's work is highlighted in the range of issues I have just quoted. We in the committee think this is interesting and important work. It ranges from national to regional to local issues and sometimes to the concerns of a single individual. A similar range of issues makes up so much of the working life of all of the members of the House. It is a privilege for us in the committee to have these opportunities to dig deeper, with the authority of the House, into the kinds of concerns that come across the desk every day in our electoral offices. These concerns may-or may not-get some wider attention in the media and other avenues of public discussion. But the committee feels that it is that there is a forum in parliament where such matters can be explored with relative speed and ease and, to a certain extent, cutting across the different portfolio areas of government. As a result, we look forward to future public hearings-and indeed the full range of the committee's activities-with a good measure of anticipation and interest. As I suggested, I will end by giving a snapshot of the committee's work for 2009. By 29 October this year, the committee had presented 120 petitions to the House, comprising 259,477 signatures. For the same period there have been 87 ministerial responses to petitions-a dramatic rise from the years 2001-2007, for example, during which time there was at best one ministerial response in a year and frequently none at all. The new petitions system, initiated early in 2008, is bearing fruit. I have a wonderful deputy chair in Russell Broadbent and a wonderful bipartisan committee. I am very pleased to see such a result. I and the other committee members look forward to doing more work in this great area with the Petitions Committee in 2010.",160
162,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,AS NATIONAL MARRIAGE DAY,I thank the honourable member and remind her that she should refer to other honourable members by their seat or by the position they hold in the parliament. NA Corporations and Financial Services Committee Report,161
163,Mr RIPOLL,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, I present the committee's report entitled Inquiry into financial products and services in Australia, together with evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be made a parliaindeed essential mentary paper.",161
164,Mr RIPOLL,COMMITTEES,"As Chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services, it gives me great pleasure to table this report on the work that we have done. The committee inquired into financial products and services regulation with a particular focus on the issues raised by recent collapses such as Storm Financial and Opes Prime. The committee received nearly 400 submissions, more than 200 of which were from people affected by the collapse of Storm Financial. The collapses of Storm, Opes Prime and others have certainly had a devastating effect on the people who invested in them. On behalf of the committee, I would like to thank those individual investors who took the time and effort to assist the committee with its deliberations while in the midst of such difficult personal circumstances. When taking evidence on these collapses, most notably Storm Financial, the committee has taken the approach that we are not a judicial body and are in no position to make judgments about individual claims that have been made to us. Nor has it been possible for the committee to resolve the contradictory evidence received from Storm investors, the banks who provided margin loans, and Storm Financial themselves. The committee can say this: investors were frequently given financial advice from Storm's financial advisers that was clearly inappropriate for them. The committee has been highly critical of the one-size-fits-all investment strategy offered by Storm, especially when that strategy involved borrowing to invest against the value of people's homes. We cannot reconcile the fact of Storm recommending aggressive, leveraged investment strategies to people on low incomes or near the end of their working lives, with Storm's obligation under the Corporations Act to provide advice appropriate to their clients. The committee also considers the confusion between Storm and the banks over the provision of margin calls to be unacceptable, and it is concerned that some banks were lax in their lending practices when allowing Storm clients to borrow against their homes. The margin lending and consumer credit protection bills which the parliament has debated this year should rectify gaps in legislation that allowed these circumstances to occur outside the regulatory system. The committee has taken into account the circumstances of these collapses when making recommendations for regulatory change to guard against similar events in the future. As a committee, we recognise that isolated corporate collapses do not necessarily indicate regulatory failure. However, the committee received broad and consistent evidence telling us that improvements are needed to raise the overall quality of financial advice that Australians receive. The committee's recommendations are designed to increase professionalism within the financial advice sector and improve consumer confidence and protection. A better regulatory framework for managing financial advisers' conflicts of interest is needed. The product distribution role of financial advisers-and the remuneration they receive from product providers for recommending certain financial products-too often leaves consumers getting advice that is not in their best interests. The law needs to explicitly state that financial advisers must place their clients' interests ahead of their own. The committee has recommended that the Corporations Act be amended to include a fiduciary duty requiring advisers to put their clients' interests first. The committee believes that payments from product providers to financial advisers, such as commissions and volume bonuses, create entrenched conflicts that are very difficult to manage. The committee has therefore recommended that the government consult with industry on the most appropriate way to cease payments from product manufacturers to financial advisers. In order to make transparent fee-for-service payments more appealing, the committee has also recommended that the government consider the implications of making the cost of financial advice tax deductible. Greater professionalism could also be achieved by requiring those wishing to call themselves financial advisers to become members of an independent, industry based professional standards board. The committee has recommended that ASIC immediately consult with industry on setting up this body, which would establish, monitor and enforce nomenclature, competency and conduct standards for the industry. Recent collapses have also shown the need for more effective regulatory enforcement. The committee has recommended that ASIC be appropriately resourced to perform effective risk based surveillance of advice provided under licence and perform financial advice shadow-shopping exercises annually. We recognise that it is often difficult for ASIC to take action when it identifies problems. The committee has therefore made two recommendations designed to lower the threshold for ASIC to remove individuals and licensees from the industry. To protect investors when collapses do occur, the committee has recommended that the government investigate options for a statutory last resort compensation fund for investors. I thank the committee secretariat for their assistance with this inquiry and all of the committee members. Finally, I would again like to express my sincere thanks to all those who provided submissions to this inquiry and provided evidence at one of our public hearings. We as a committee hope that this report will lead to change to improve the regulation of financial products and services in the years ahead. (Time expired)  as a member of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services to speak on the report Inquiry into financial products and services in Australia. From the outset, I want to join with the chair of the committee, the member for Oxley, in acknowledging the disastrous consequences suffered by many people who had invested, in many cases, their life savings in the organisations which were probed by this review. I want to thank them for assisting the committee during such difficult and trying circumstances. As the chair has noted, the committee is not a judicial body. Our charter was to investigate and review the current regulatory and legislative environment for financial products and services in Australia and to recommend any appropriate changes. I strongly concur with the chair's comments that there can be no doubt that a number of individual investors were given advice from some organisations that was clearly inappropriate for them and their personal circumstances. More broadly speaking, informing its view, the committee has taken into account all of the evidence provided relating to the high-profile collapses as outlined in the terms of reference. In addition, more broadly based evidence from across the sector was provided by many stakeholders about how the current framework may be improved so that greater levels of transparency and consumer protection are offered. It is important to note that, without diminishing the substantial negative impact many people experienced in the collapses considered by the inquiry, in general Australia's regulatory system has served the community well. Every year there are many millions of individual transactions and interfaces which Australians have each day with financial products and services. Australia's relative success, compared with others across the world, especially during the global financial crisis, is evidence that our system has in fact been robust and has worked well in the majority of cases. The committee's report has made 11 recommendations. Recommendation 1 is far reaching and substantial and recommends that the act be amended to explicitly include a fiduciary duty for financial advisers operattouched ing under an AFSL, requiring them to place their clients' interests ahead of their own. adopted by the government, I believe this would have the dual benefit of further improving consumer protection and lifting industry standards. During the inquiry, there was much debate and discussion around conflicts of interest and the role that remuneration plays in managing potential conflicts. As many people are aware, the sector itself has proactively embraced the need for reform in this important area. The committee has recommended that the government consult with and support industry in developing an appropriate mechanism that will see payments from product manufacturers to financial advisers cease. Importantly, any remuneration structure in the future would clearly need to be compatible with the introduction of a fiduciary duty as outlined in recommendation 1. Recommendation 5 suggests that the government consider making the cost of financial advice tax deductible for consumers. The recommendation would potentially encourage many more Australians to obtain professional advice when they would otherwise not have considered doing so due to the costs involved. Any initiative that encourages a greater number of Australians to seek professional advice regarding their financial future I think is a step in the right direction. Recommendation 9 is also an important step in the right direction. The recommendation proposes that ASIC immediately begins consultation with the financial services industry on the establishment of an independent, industry-based professional standards board to oversee competency and conduct standards for financial advisers. Such an initiative would, without question, increased professionalism within the sector. The critical area of financial literacy is upon in recommendation 11. This is an area where I believe strongly the stakeIf holders have responsibility to promote. Noone can doubt that it is critical that citizens both young and old are better educated about the myriad of financial products and services which are available to them. Recommendation 11 suggests that ASIC develop and deliver more effective education activities to groups in the community which are likely to be seeking financial advice, particularly those seeking it for the very first time. Quite clearly, there is no one silver bullet in what is a complex and ever-changing area of commerce. The adoption of this report will provide better outcomes, I believe, for Australians. Tonight I join with the chair in expressing my hope and I am sure the hope of all committee members that the committee's work will indeed further improve and very much enhance Australia's financial services system.",162

Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.",165
170,Ms KING,COMMITTEES,"From the CBD of Sydney to the CBD of Burnie, the effects of the global financial crisis, or the GFC, have been felt around Australia. Regional Australia has been described as the economic backbone of the nation's prosperity. The regions are home to major export industries as well as smalland medium-sized businesses. Many of these have struggled during the crisis and behind each of these businesses are owners and employees, some of whom have faced the prospect of business closure, reduced working hours and job losses. It was the committee's intention in undertaking this inquiry to assist the government to better understand how economic downturns affect regional Australia so that it will be in a better position to formulate regional development policy aimed at strengthening the economic resilience of our regions. In doing so, the committee travelled to each state and territory over the course of this year. The evidence gathered told a story about how the crisis had affected regional business, populations and local government. The crisis unfolded as the committee gathered evidence, so it was often difficult to ascertain the extent of its impact and the outcomes of government assistance. Nevertheless, the committee has made recommendations and comments where appropriate. Its report begins by examining industry sectors such as manufacturing, resources, tourism, retail and construction. In each case, the committee has noted the impact of the GFC on the sector and the ways in which the government is assisting. The committee recommends that the government examine the use of structural adjustment funds as a response to economic downturns and their ability to assist small business. The committee has also recommended increased funding for the TQUAL Grants program, increased cooperation in identifying key tourism markets and setting priorities for marketing those locations as part of its investigation into regional tourism. Discussion about the government's bank guarantee scheme has led the committee to support a review of its differential pricing structure and to comment on banking competition in regional Australia. Support for small business is particularly important during these periods and, as such, the committee believes that the Small Business Advisory Service should continue to operate beyond its current two-year funding commitment. Small business can be further assisted by an increase in the number of AusIndustry representatives in regional Australia. Regional Australians are resilient people but, like everyone, from time to time they need assistance. Should unemployment continue to rise, the committee believes there may be a case for the introduction of a national unemployment mortgage assistance program, provided its impacts have been fully considered by government. The GFC has demonstrated the need in regional Australia for the provision of localised, collective social services, so the committee has recommended increased funding to the Department of Human Services in order to expand its co-location site trials and increase its local service provision activities. The work of the local employment coordinators may also serve as an example of how pathways to coordinated service provision may be enhanced. Offices of the Department of Human Services are located throughout regional Australia, assisting local populations but also generating employment opportunities. To further grow employment options in regional Australia, the committee recommends that the government examine options for locating government departments or functions of government departments into regional areas. The GFC has not been the first nor will it be the last economic challenge faced by regional Australia. Its ability to respond to the future will depend on individual regions reaching their growth potential. The committee believes that this will only occur if local strategies are underpinned by Commonwealth government policies focusing on infrastructure, education and business support. The Regional Development Australia network presents one option through which government can further policies that assist in the development of regional Australia. Its success will be based in part on its ability to generate region-specific community and economic development planning that is supported by the region, to maintain productive levels of cooperation between the three tiers of government, and to facilitate cooperation between various agencies and government programs in the region. The GFC has highlighted the importance of having a mechanism such as RDA which can be used to advance regional development objectives. The crisis has also presented regional Australia and governments with an opportunity to examine the impact of change on regional Australia and to test policy reto sponses. This inquiry has been greatly assisted by the help of committee members and I particularly acknowledge the deputy chair, the member for Hinkler, Mr Neville. Additionally, I thank the committee secretariat: Peter Keel, Julia Morris, Michael Crawford, Sophia Nicolle, Adrienne Batts, Kane Moir and Alison Wardrop. Once again, I want to thank all regional Australians who have participated in this inquiry. There is great spirit, drive and innovation within Australia's regions and I am not surprised by the manner in which regional Australia has faced the challenges posed by the GFC. (Time expired)",165
171,Mr OAKESHOTT,COMMITTEES,"I rise as a committee member for this inquiry and I also assume to speak in the place of the deputy chair, the member for Hinkler, who is away. I congratulate the chair, the member for Ballarat and the full committee for a report that is essential reading for all members who represent regional areas and for those who, at a community level, are involved in regional development. As a new member, I probably did not get to experience and learn from some of the other regions of Australia, but I was certainly a willing participant on behalf of my region. I enjoyed and valued the readings that came through and the substantial submissions that were put in from around Australia. I also enjoyed and valued the wide-ranging discussions that took place during committee meetings here in Canberra. From my region I was drawing similar conclusions to the ones that this report has drawn. I am pleased that the foreword identifies the difficulty in putting together a report-on an inquiry that is happening almost in parallel with events as they unfold-on the impacts of a global financial crisis on regional Australia. In light of those circumstances, I think they have done an excellent job in tapping into some of the incredible resilience found in regional Australia, including the positive stories that are there for all to see, some of the challenges that are faced, and the unknowns, as we go into the first period without real stimulus. There will be no cheques in the letterbox this Christmas. The implications of that going into next year will be of interest to all of us to see whether we have been the lucky ones in surviving the GFC. I got involved in this committee when I first turned up in this place because of an interest in local governments that had had some pretty significant exposure-with almost 25 per cent of their investments in collateralised debt obligations, or CDOs. On my arrival in this place in September 2008, a month before the stimulus package went through, there was certainly some interest on my part, and I made comments in my first speech about trying to get a handle on just how much public money had been lost.",166

176,Mr GEORGANAS,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Health and Ageing, I present the committee's report entitled Treating impotence: round-table forum on impotence medications in Australia, together with the minutes of proceedings. Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.",167
177,Mr GEORGANAS,COMMITTEES,"I am pleased to present this report, entitled Treating impotence: round-table forum on impotence medications in Australia, on behalf of the Standing Committee on Health and Ageing. The report has examined issues surrounding the provision and sale of impotence medications in Australia. The committee was concerned to discover that erectile dysfunction, better known as ED, is estimated to affect one in five Australian men over the age of 40. Of greater concern was evidence presented at the round-table which indicated that these figures may not be a true reflection of the extent to which men are affected. The issue which prompted the round-table was learning that while there are many possible causes for ED, it can, in some cases, be a symptom of extremely serious chronic health conditions like diabetes, heart disease and hypertension. The committee would like to use this report to promote the message that erectile dysfunction can be linked to chronic diseases and men experiencing ED should seek the assistance of a general practitioner. The report is timely because the government is developing a men's health policy which aims to address the specific health concerns of men and reduce barriers men may experience in accessing health services. The committee hopes that this report feeds into that process. The round-table forum presented an opportunity to explore concerns about some of the treatment of ED and to perhaps understand why men are choosing not to use their GP in the first instance. The report highlights four significant problems associated with the provision of treatment for ED in Australia which were discussed at the round-table. - Firstly, it seems that men do visit their GP but that GPs are not adequately equipped to treat and manage ED in this setting. The committee strongly support the notion that GPs are the ‘gatekeepers' of the health system. We would therefore encourage all men to seek assistance from their GP as a first option when they experience ED. However, this requires GPs to be better trained to understand the specific needs of men as patients and to better treat and manage specific men's health problems. - Secondly, some of the treatments that men are accessing through commercial ED clinics are produced through extemporaneous compounding. This means that a pharmacist produces a medication using a list of ingredients especially for a patient, based on a particular script. Compounding is a legitimate tool of medical practitioners and pharmacists to treat the small number of patients who require specialised medications. However, the level of compounding employed by some ED treatment providers is far in excess of what the committee feels is reasonable. There is currently a review into compounding underway by the Therapeutic Goods Administration, and the committee supports stronger regulations for compounding in Australia. - The third problem is the use of telemedicine as a routine option for prescribing medication to a previously unknown patient, as it limits the ability of the medical practitioner to undertake a complete health check. By telemedicine, I mean the big signs that we see around the country with 1300 numbers that men can call when they are experiencing this problem. Treating ED presents a significant opportunity to undertake preventative health checks, in particular because ED can be an early marker for chronic disease. The committee feels that this preventative health approach cannot be achieved through a telemedicine consultation. Therefore, the committee argues that the use of telemedicine to prescribe medication to a previously unknown patient as a first and routine option should cease. - Finally, the committee was concerned by reports that commercial ED clinics are unwilling to share information about patient treatment with other medical practitioners. This unwillingness could adversely impact on the proposed e-record system to share clinical records. The committee encourages the federal government to consult with commercial ED treatment providers to ensure that they are integrated into any potential e-record system. In conclusion, I would like to thank all those who contributed to this inquiry through submissions and discussions with the committee. I would also like to thank committee members and the secretariat staff for their efforts throughout the inquiry process. I especially thank the deputy chair, Steve Irons, and Amanda Rishworth, who attended the round-table. I thank Sara Edson, Penny Wijnberg and James Catchpole, who all assisted with this report. I commend the report to the House. (Time expired)",167
178,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Order! I remind the honourable member for Hindmarsh that he should refer to other honourable members by the name of their electorate or by the title of the position they currently hold.,169
179,Mr IRONS,COMMITTEES,"I thank the Chair of the Standing Committee on Health and Ageing for tabling the report on the round-table forum on impotence medications in Australia, and as deputy chair I would like to add some comments. I would like to start by thanking everyone who was involved in the report. I thank the member for Hindmarsh, who was also the committee chair, the member for Kingston and the secretariat. They were particularly helpful on the day of the forum and assisted me greatly in my role as acting chair of the round-table. I would also like to thank all the groups and businesses who attended and made submissions on this important issue. They are too numerous to mention, but it was a good representation of the medical, pharmaceutical and health services across Australia. Erectile dysfunction is an important issue to discuss because it affects millions of Australians across the country. The committee heard in a submission how a 2003 survey found that 80 per cent of men were worried about developing erectile dysfunction compared to 57 per cent of men who were concerned about developing prostate cancer. Yet, because of our cultural sensitivities, it is a topic that is rarely discussed in the public domain-but it is heavily advertised by radio and public billboards. I think not only has this probably discouraged discussion but it appears to have stifled discussion by those who suffer from this condition. Individuals have found it easier to speak to someone on the phone rather than have face-to-face contact with a GP or with family or friends. This round-table forum provided a chance to shed some light on the issue and provide some overdue public scrutiny of the practices of the industry. This is an industry that needs scrutiny. Any industry that sources its income by playing on the fears and insecurities of people about facing their problems through a normal health consultation deserves scrutiny. There are two particular sections of the report that I would like to discuss with the House today. The first refers to the concern about the fact that many men with erectile dysfunction use the commercial sector rather than traditional GPs to obtain treatment. Erectile dysfunction is usually linked to ageing, but in some circumstances it is linked to other phenomena such as cardiovascular disease. Such symptoms may not be picked up in the commercial sector through a phone call. The commercial sector will not necessarily pick up on these important health issues, whereas a GP will. Although organisations such as AMI insist that they encourage customers to visit their GP, the fact is that many patients do not, perhaps because of embarrassment about the condition and because they think solving their issue over the telephone will be easier. I am sure I speak for the committee when I stress how important it is that anyone with erectile dysfunction go to a GP first, before approaching the commercial sector. The second issue I want to discuss relates to a practice known as compounding, a practice which the AMI undertake. I do not know of other companies in the industry who do this, but AMI were the only company that were prepared to come forward and contribute to the forum, and I do thank them for that. Under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989, it is an offence to import, export, manufacture or supply a therapeutic good unless it is included in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. Medicines on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods are subject to clinical tests and controls. There are a number of exceptions relating to this law. I commend this report to the House.",169

Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.",170
185,Ms JACKSON,COMMITTEES,"Pay equity or the lack of it was one of the issues that sparked my interest in politics and social justice. As a young woman I was outraged that someone could or would be paid less for their work because of their gender. It angers me that over 30 years later, despite some progress, this is still the case. Sadly, the average industry gender pay gap still stands around 17 per cent today. Many Australians are unaware of the existence of a ‘pay gap' between men and women's earnings. Evidence to the inquiry has shown that once people become aware of the pay gap most believe that it should be addressed. Australian women have much to celebrate. They have achieved high public office. Women are CEOs, business and community leaders, Nobel Laureates, academics, parliamentarians, local councillors, sporting heroes as well as mothers, sisters and partners. Australian women have more choices about their lives, their studies, their careers, their families and how they chose to live them than ever before. However, in the business sector women represent less than two per cent of our CEOs and chair only two per cent of our top 200 ASX companies. Women are more likely to be employed in low-paying jobs with little or no career paths and are more likely to be employed as casuals and part-time workers. Women have not fared as well as men in enterprise bargaining or under systems of individual contracts. Women miss out on the opportunity to accumulate superannuation because of interruptions to paid employment for family reasons (to have and care for children) compounded by lower pay, and are more likely to be dependent on pensions in retirement. This is not good enough and the time to act is now. Some will say that we should wait; for what I am not sure-divine intervention? It is 40 years since equal pay was granted by the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. Haven't Australian women been waiting long enough? Australia should take a proactive approach to address the gender pay gap. Increasing women's participation in the workforce will lead to increases in productivity for the nation. Perhaps we should ask: how can Australia afford not to do it? Education campaigns promoting community and business awareness of pay inequity alone do not work. We have tried that and the pay gap has widened. At the heart of the gender pay gap is the failure to truly value traditional women's work-paid or unpaid. To continue to undervalue women's work is simply not just. It is difficult any other policy equivalent that clearly disadvantages such a large class of Australians that we do not rush to correct. This report sets out a scheme to act to close the gender pay gap. It includes proposed amendments to the Fair Work Act 2009, greater powers for the Sex Discrimination Commissioner to act on wage discrimination and the establishment of a specialist pay equity unit within Fair Work Australia with a broad mandate for change. We have called for change in other policy areas such as the removal of the $450 per month earnings requirement in compulsory superannuation and the implementation of comprehensive portability of employment entitlements legislation. Evidence from the private sector provided examples of best practice and the benefits for companies in addressing pay equity issues within their organisation. We have avoided creating regular reporting obligations for small and medium enterprises as we recognise the burden that red tape has on this sector. There should be no requirement for small businesses to supply information already collected by government agencies. Requirements from small business should be confined to one-off reporting and only when it has been established that there are significant issues within that industry. We have also reduced the existing reporting requirements for larger companies. However, those large companies that have been shirking their responsibility will no longer be able to do this. We acknowledge there are significant gaps in the data available for collection and research into pay equity and other issues affecting women's participation in the workforce. In particular we have recommended the introduction of an Australian industrial relations survey. This improved data is necessary for more effective and strategic policy to think of decision making. We have also recommended that the Australian government provide leadership by acting on pay inequity within the Australian Public Service as well as applying pay equity principles in all its administrative approaches. The Australian government's decision to deliver paid parental leave in this year's budget was a welcome reform and there are also reviews into taxation and childcare policies, all of which will help break down the barriers to greater workforce participation by women. The minister has also recently announced that the Australian government will be a participant in an important pay equity test case for employees in the social and community services sector. I applaud this decision. I want to thank the members of the committee and especially the committee secretariat for their hard work and participation in the inquiry. It has been a long but worthwhile journey for all of us. I commend the report to the House. (Time expired)",170
186,Mr HAASE,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the coalition members. I thank the secretariat of the Standing Committee on Employment and Workplace Relations for their efforts in assisting the committee in publication of the report Making it fair: pay equity and associated issues related to increasing female participation in the workforce. The coalition accepts the motivation for the inquiry and many of the recommendations of this report. However, we cannot entirely endorse it because we believe there are other factors of significance that have been detailed. We were disappointed by the lack of private enterprise evidence presented to the inquiry and, therefore, these recommendations should be considered as some of the stepping stones for future reform. The majority of evidence adduced from this report has been from organisations, individuals and groups who are more likely to be aware of and able to enforce gender pay equity, sectors that in one form or another are supported or funded by state and/or federal governments. Very little evidence has come from the private sector, which will also be directly affected if this report is adopted, and as such the recommendations should first be applied to public sector agencies to measure their impact. The costs associated with the implementation of these recommendations are currently unquantifiable and must not be imposed on the private sector until the ramifications of such adaptations are known. Without a cost-and-benefit analysis of these recommendations being undertaken, we are at risk of imposing processes that may in fact further disadvantage women from either entering or remaining in the workforce. The Fair Work Act 2009 is in its infancy and, as a number of recommendations are focused on changes to this act, the coalition is mindful of endorsing measures that alter the aspirations, processes and results of legislation that has not yet been fully implemented and suitably tested. This report will not revolutionise the female workforce and I believe the issues that dominate this inquiry do not address the major factor in gender pay the equity. I deem the dominating factor to be the mindset of Australian society and until such time as Australians as a whole change their beliefs in relation to the role females have traditionally held in society the gender pay issue will never be solved. We have a cultural hurdle to overcome that women are the primary care givers and are expected to not be the bosom of our society. The Australian vernacular terms of ‘stay at home mothers' and ‘working mothers' are firmly embedded in our language and therefore our culture. You may on occasion hear the term ‘stay at home father', but I have never heard the term ‘working father' bandied around and there lies the difference in attitudes towards men and women in Australia. This will always negatively affect female earnings, participation and conditions as opposed to their male counterparts. The test we use today examines the working life earnings, including superannuation, accumulated by a female employee compared to that of a male. Whilst women are the primary care providers, time spent in the workplace will always be less than their male counterparts. The singular change to the workplace that will increase participation is the provision of at-work childcare facilities for children and the formal support by government of after school supervision and mentoring facilities. The staffing and resources generally of such services will be a huge financial impost, and this will necessitate support or compensation from the government of the day. I once again thank the members of the secretariat: specifically, secretary, Dr Glenn Worthington; inquiry secretary, Ms Cheryl Scarlett; senior research officer, Mr Raymond Knight; and office manager, Mr Daniel Miletic.

191,Ms VAMVAKINOU,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Innovation, I present the committee's report entitled Seasonal forecasting in Australia, together with the minutes of proceedings. Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.",173
192,Ms VAMVAKINOU,COMMITTEES,"I am pleased to present this report entitled Seasonal forecasting in Australia on behalf of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Innovation. Many of Australia's economically important industries such as tourism and agriculture are crucially dependent on long-term meteorological forecasting, otherwise known as seasonal forecasting. This presents significant challenges as Australia is a vast continent with a diverse range of climatic conditions. The committee's inquiry examined a fu- number of these challenges and found that Australia needs to invest in resources and people to increase the reliability of seasonal forecasting for the benefit of individuals, businesses and emergency services. Not only is seasonal forecasting essential for our agricultural industries but also for tourism and water management, the planning of large infrastructure projects and emergency services. In weather sensitive industries information on long-term weather forecasting influences a wide range of management decisions. For example, grain producers need to know about seasonal rainfall, energy authorities must plan for extra energy loads during the heat waves, and the conthe struction industry needs to factor in wet weather downtime. Emergency services rely on seasonal forecasting to plan for bushfires, floods and cyclones. The committee is concerned that Australia once led the world in research and development in climate and weather forecasting but has fallen behind in the last couple of decades. One of the major causes for the decline is the decrease in supercomputing capability. Australia's supercomputing capacity has not kept up with comparable countries. The committee notes that new supercomputers have just been provided to the Bureau of Meteorology and the Australian National University, but these will not make up for the shortfall. Another concern is the reduction to the bureau's staffing levels, impeding its effectiveness and jeopardising long-term sustainability. Recruitment needs to be increased, employment conditions reviewed, career pathways encouraged and secure tenure provided to attract and retain more high-calibre personnel. Another contributing factor to the falling standards of weather forecasting is the quantity and quality of data coming from the network of weather stations across the country. Forecasting depends on accurate, long-term observational data. The integrity of current data is being threatened by a number of factors. Many existing weather stations are suffering the effects of age. Resource cuts have led a decrease in qualified observational staff and there are significant gaps between weather stations across the continent. The committee recognises that more weather stations are required to improve the amount and integrity of the data being collected. The committee understands that seasonal forecasts are only useful if the data is transronmental lated into meaningful information for endusers. A number of state governments are taking the lead in this regard, matching data to stakeholder requirements and producing a range of products that enable end-users to gain maximum benefit from long-term weather forecasts. Despite the difficulties identified by the inquiry, Australia is doing some impressive work in the research field not only by the Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO but also by state government agencies and universities. However, a nationally coordinated research agenda is required to capitalise on this research. The committee recommends the establishment of an institute of meteorological science to facilitate an ongoing partnership between relevant research bodies. This will go some way to helping Australia make up lost ground and regain its place as a leader in long-term meteorological forecasting. In conclusion, I would like to thank all those who contributed to this inquiry through submissions and discussions with the committee. I would also like to thank committee members and secretariat staff for their efforts throughout the inquiry process. I commend the report to the House. FRAN BAILEY (MCEwen) (9.25 pm)The terms of reference for this report required the committee to examine the efficiency, innovation, impact and benefits of long-term meteorological forecasting in Australia and to assess how innovation in overseas research could benefit Australia. This is a comprehensive report and it is my pleasure to be able tonight to speak, albeit briefly, to this report and endorse the eight strong recommendations made unanimously by the committee. It is a very comprehensive report and it is dealing with the economic, enviand social well-being benefits of weather forecasting from both short-term and long-range forecasting. In Australia it is the Bureau of Meteorology that has the responsibility for the collection of meteorological data, the forecasting of weather and the state of the atmosphere, including the issuing of warnings for severe events that could endanger life and property. It is therefore of utmost importance that Australia has the very best equipment and personnel and research available to it because, as the chair has just previously indicated, of the range of industries that are so dependent on the accuracy of weather forecasting. Until recent times weather forecasting has used what has been known as ‘statistical' methods. This is being able to forecast based on historical data. As the Bureau of Meteorology said to us in the hearings: A key assumption of statistical forecasting is past weather and climate patterns are sound indicators of what we can expect in future. But a major change has occurred in weather forecasting, which is now called ‘dynamic weather forecasting', and this has come about with the introduction of the supercomputer. I would just like to refer very briefly to the report where it tells us that a key assumption of the statistical forecasting is that past weather and climate patterns are sound indicators of what can be expected in the future. However climate change challenges this assumption because it suggests that in the future the conditions that affect weather and climate increasingly will exceed the bounds of past experience, hence of course the importance of the supercomputer. I would like the House to note that in July, earlier this year, I spent some time at the World Meteorological Organisation looking at their next generation of the supercomputer, which is known as the super-supercomputer. I draw the House's attention in particular to recommendation 4 in this report because this is a very strong recommendation to the government to make sure our meteorological organisations are sufficiently funded to enable them to have this very latest equipment. It is absolutely vital that our weather scientists, who have exceptional international reputations, be given access to the equipment and the research that they so importantly need. In 1922, Lewis Fry Richardson said: Perhaps some day in the dim future it will be possible to advance the computations faster than the weather advances and at a cost less than the saving to mankind due to the information gained. In 1922 Mr Richardson, who was a mathematician, physicist and meteorologist, thought that was a dream. However, in 2009 we do have supercomputer technology in Australia. But, as this report points out, we really need the government to take note of that this report and adequately fund our meteorological sciences so that they too can have access to the super-supercomputer. In closing, I thank the chair and the secretariat for all of their dedicated work in producing what I think is a very fine report.",173

197,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 9.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Forgotten Australians",175
198,Mr IRONS,ADJOURNMENT,"This evening I want to brief the House on moving forward after the apology to the care leavers, forgotten Australians and child migrants last week, who I will now refer to as the ‘remembered Australians'. I also take this opportunity to report back to the House that the majority of responses I have had from the remembered Australians to the apology were positive and they heard what they wanted to hear. Many have mentioned that Mr Turnbull's words ‘We believe you' were significant to them. In all, it was a positive and emotional day, but we must move forward. In the Senate report titled Lost Innocents and Forgotten Australians Revisited, which was tabled in June 2009, there are 16 recommendations. I would now like to discuss some of the recommendations, with the idea of moving forward for our fellow remembered Australians. After last week we have now dealt with recommendations 1 and 2 of the report. I would encourage the Prime Minister to complete recommendation 3, which states that the Prime Minister should write to the churches and charities that ran the institutions where this systematic abuse existed and request they provide formal statements, in particular on the issues of an apology, redress and provision of service to care leavers. The report recommendations frequently refer to recommendations in the Senate's Forgotten Australians report, tabled in August 2004, and recommendation 6 from that report is highlighted on the Care Leavers Australia Network website. The recommendation states: That the Commonwealth Government establish and manage a national reparations fund for victims of institutions and out-of-home care I support this recommendation and call on the government to establish this national fund as early as possible with financial input from the state governments, churches and charities. It is time we stood up as a society and dealt with this issue. I said in my speech last week that we can now only be judged as a society in how we deal with these wrongs and the people who suffered them. We need to help the remembered Australians rebuild what is left of their lives, as we certainly failed in the construction of them. The four areas that need to be dealt with are redress, including the punishment of the perpetrators of the abuse; acknowledgment and a sincere apology, which has now been achieved; compensation; and services including a national register. Part of the redress problem the remembered Australians face is that all Australian states have a statute of limitations. Generally the law allows for an extension of time to be granted but these allowances are extremely restrictive. Applications for extensions are expensive and there is no guarantee that leave will be granted to issue proceedings. The problem with the statute of limitations for remembered Australians is a real issue that we need to deal with. On the one hand this parliament has just officially acknowledged that the stories of physical and sexual abuse and neglect are real, but legally there is little avenue for this recognition to be pursued now. For years, when these people, our fellow Australians, made complaints or tried to pursue the perpetrators, they could not do so because no-one believed their stories. How could they start proceedings sanely, or with a purpose, when no-one believed them? Given the complexities of pursuing claims against the state, the churches and the charities, and the arguments the defendants usethey say they were not responsible for the settings. conduct of their employees-our remembered Australians face an enormous task. When you consider the frailty and state of mind of these survivors-and survivors is what they are; they are survivors of systematic abuse overseen by the state, the churches and the charities-what hope do they ever have of seeking redress? We need a change of heart and mindset by all those involved. Considering that these state licensed institutions were actually paid by the state to look after these children, I would be calling for a refund. We should seek a refund for providing services under false pretences, for providing a product that did not work. Maybe the institutions could be pursued under the Trade Practices Act. I am not sure whether there is a statute of limitations in this area. Until we get a change of heart from the churches and the charities and they approach this with some truth and transparency-like the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition did with the apology-how can we hold our heads up as a society? I call on all parties involved to step up to the plate, confess your sins and become part of the solution. Become part of the journey that repairs and rebuilds the lives of the remembered Australians. Be a part of this new episode that can return the dignity and sanity of these people. Let them know their country loves them and then maybe you and the churches and the charities can also rid yourselves of the perception of being institutions who failed and abused these children and now continue to hide from the responsibility of those tragic failings. I call on the government to proceed on these issues as soon as possible-and it is good to see that the member for Corio is in the House. White Ribbon Day",176
199,Ms RISHWORTH,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise today to raise awareness for White Ribbon Day on Wednesday, 25 November. White Ribbon Day is the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women. This is something that all of us in this House should and, I have no doubt, do support. It is something that we should all aspire to within our local communities. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the White Ribbon Foundation, which works all year round to make violence against women a thing of the past. That is their slogan and it is the mandate they are pursuing. Most importantly, the White Ribbon Foundation not only sees violence against women as a women's issue but sees involving men as critical to finding a solution. I take this opportunity to recognise the many high-profile men who have stood up and been counted by saying violence against women is not appropriate. In fact, many men have made an oath. You can go online to make this oath. I would encourage as many men as possible to go online to make this oath on the website. These men have sworn never to use violence against a woman, they have sworn never to excuse violence against women and they have sworn not to remain silent about violence against women. This is the oath they have taken. White Ribbon Day gives us a day to focus on when our nation has a collective opportunity to raise awareness about the issue of violence against women. The White Ribbon Foundation urges people to do a number of things. There are a number of ways that people can get involved with this very important day: men can wear a ribbon or a wrist band or they can swear to end violence against women and people can make a donation, hold an event in their community to raise awareness or simply tell their family and friends. The date of 25 November is International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women. Often we hear about violence against women that occurs in other countries. While it is very important to condemn violence against women wherever it takes place, we must not forget that violence against women is occurring at alarming levels here in Australia. The White Ribbon Day website indicates that one in three Australian women will experience physical or sexual violence in their lifetime. More than one Australian woman every week is killed by her partner or ex-partner. The biggest contributor to illness, injury and premature death for women aged between 15 and 45 is violence perpetrated by a husband, boyfriend or ex-partner. The cost to our society is great. The cost of violence against women is projected to be over $15.1 billion in health costs, worker absenteeism and police and court costs. The impact is great. I note that in the House earlier this evening a motion was moved by the member for Indi on this important issue. While the motion made some important points, it was incredibly disappointing that she used this important issue, which usually receives bipartisan support, to make cheap political points about the education revolution. It has been said regularly in this place that there is in some debates to come together to put down partisan politics and to work towards a greater good. I can think of no better issue than supporting a zero tolerance position on violence against women. I urge everyone in this House not to make it a partisan issue but to support White Ribbon Day and, for the other 364 days of the year, to promote zero tolerance for violence against women and children in our society. Population Growth",177
200,Mr BILSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Dunkley) (9.40 pm)When Prime Minister Rudd boasted about updated forecasts of a population explosion in Australia over the next four decades, it was a hackneyed and somewhat grating pronouncement of support for a big Australia that ignored the very warnings of the Secretary of the Treasury of the policy challenges such population growth presented. Mr Rudd's reaction was a default to his diplomacy DNA that makes bigger always better for those claiming representative status in foreign lands, when a bigger nation makes the diplomat a bigger deal. It was a really careless remark from the Prime Minister, with Mr Rudd thumbing his nose at genuine community concern and already evident problems and growing pains in our major cities. Traffic congestion, water shortages, energy demand pressures, climate impacts, sprawling suburbs, public transport underservicing and overcrowding, work and family life dislocation, food security concerns as near-city productive agricultural land gives way to housing pressures, land use tensions and land release blockages, poor access to some key services, and diminished liveability and amenity are just some of the current population concerns the Rudd Labor government seems perfectly happy to ignore. The plea from Secretary Henry for coherent and coordinated policy action to address a time the predicted population growth has been passed over by Prime Minister Rudd and his Labor government in favour of more big talk and political spin. The lack of any coherent strategic plan to accommodate Australia's rapidly expanding population in a sustainable and durable way while maintaining and improving the quality of life and living standards is one of the most glaring failures of the Rudd government on the eve of its second anniversary in power. That is not just the coalition's assessment but a shared view from across the community. A report commissioned by the Business Council of Australia has echoed the concerns raised by the coalition. The Business Council is reported to have said: People won't have confidence in population growth unless they feel their standard of living going to be better as a result. Accounts of the Rudd government infrastructure spend put the proportion of spending towards productive infrastructure at only $1 in $7. There is no sign that this expenditure has been used in a catalytic way to better prepare infrastructure, city systems and policy for a cleaner growth economy. This was the theme of the Australian Davos Connection transformational change work that the Prime Minister was happy to be associated with but apparently unwilling to embrace. Just today, the Property Council of Australia pressed for new action and institutional structures to cope with urban renewal and future growth in Sydney, reflecting the coalition's call for coherent and coordinated citywide strategies for our major cities. Bringing strategic land use, infrastructure and transport planning together will help to better use existing land and assets and will help cities cope with and prepare for forecast population growth. Just last week, the Rapid, Active and Affordable Transport Alliance canvassed the related themes of land use planning, density challenges, infrastructure improvements, capacity limits and congestion and the need for integrated and interconnected strategic plans that encourage investment in a more sustainable set of options for citizens so they can choose to help cities better cope with current pressures and the added challenges of vastly increasing populations. Despite Mr Rudd's pre-election noises, two years on and we still have no coordinated strategic plan on how our future population will be settled, no accountable plan to fund and deliver the infrastructure needed to accompany this population explosion he so welcomes and embraces, no cleaner growth strategy to provide the employment and economic vigour to maintain prosperity and livis ing standards, no identification of the critical natural systems and essential land uses most at risk or challenged by growth pressures; and no accounting for the liveability of great cities like Melbourne but with twice the population. Population size, composition and settlement trends are both a key input and a consequence of policy action and inaction. How to influence it and what to do with it are key ongoing pressures for any competent government concerned about the national interest, as was evident with the former coalition government's intergenerational analysis and action in response to this groundbreaking report's findings. Mr Rudd has opted to do nothing, in favour of a boast of a more populous Australia on a business-as-usual basis-a population explosion in Australia. He has displayed a complete lack of any clear forward agenda. What is desperately needed is the kind of leadership and joined-up government policy responses offered by the coalition, where policy is not constrained by departmental ‘silos', and a whole-of-government approach and strategies can be implemented by a portfolio dedicated to dealing with two of the great policy challenges of our time: rampant population growth and cities growing and groaning under their own popularity. It is time for the Rudd Labor government to take these compelling policy issues seriously. The Prime Minister's glib attempts to say that he has the consequences covered are simply not backed up by facts and are as contemptuous as they are concerning. (Time expired) National School Chaplaincy Program",178
201,Mr NEUMANN,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to speak in support of the Prime Minister's initiative, announced on the weekend, of $42.8 million to extend the National School Chaplaincy Program to December 2011. The National School Chaplaincy Program provided $165 million over the past three years to school communities across Australia. Queensland had 782 schools in the program, and they received a total of just over $42 million. In my electorate of Blair, there were 50 schools in the program, and they received just under $2.2 million. I want to commend the chaplains and the schools in my community for the great work they do. The assistance, guidance and support that the chaplains provide in the community are helpful not just to the students but also to the teachother ers, staff and parents. I have spoken to almost all the schools in my electorate today. The principals and deputy principals have said the following in tion to this program and the extension of the funding. Deputy Principal Graeme Goodger of Bremer State High School said that the program was ‘useful to parents and staff and loved by the students'. He commended Kelly Pedersen, the chaplain at that school. I spoke to Principal Jouwana Habash of Boonah Primary School, who described the chaplaincy as a ‘valuable service' to the school community. Geoff St Clair, who has been at Gatton State School for many years as the principal, described the service as ‘very ful to the school community' and praised Ros Ballin, who is the chaplain at that school and the wife of Graham Ballin, the Baptist minister in Gatton. Peter Doyle, the Principal of Brassall State School, the third biggest state primary school in my electorate, describedat a chaplaincy dinner, some months agochaplaincy services as something that ‘should continue' and said the funding was important. He said it was very helpful, not just to himself but to the staff and the students. That dinner was to raise funds for chaplains in four schools in the Ipswich area. The chaplains there were from the Catholic, the Anglican, the Baptist and the Uniting churches. The chaplains in school communities in the federal electorate of Blair-in Ipswich and in the rural areas outside it-are involved in a number of different programs. Some of the programs they are involved in and the assistance they have given have been tremendous. There are programs to increase awareness of poverty and other terrible issues, such as child exploitation, in the Third World, particularly in Africa, and to assist in raising funds for the relief of poverty and issues that afflict African children. Those programs are in Ipswich State High School, in particular. There are breakfast programs for students relawho, sadly, come to school without adequate nutrition. There are programs teaching students about self-esteem. There is also assistance in the Mystery Tours, a non-alcoholic alternative to binge drinking at school graduations. I am pleased that the Rudd Labor government, of which I am proud to be a part, funded Ipswich State High School $40,000 for that model program. That program has been replicated at Bremer State High School and Redbank Plains State High School. In the canoe race at Bremer State helpHigh School, at the junction between the Bremer and Brisbane rivers, the chaplaincy canoe is always held in high esteem. Sadly, the Shayne Neumann canoe never seems to win that race, but the chaplaincy canoe gets the biggest cheer, in my experience. The chaplains help with school morale and have been tremendous in times of bereavement, loss, suicidal ideation and issues concerning drug and alcohol abuse and separation. The chaplains perform a great service, and I have been a strong contributor personally and financially to the chaplaincy services in my area. I commend the government for the extension of the program, which has funded 2,700 schools across Australia. I look forward to the services and the stakeholders playing a role in a review of this program. I want to show one example of how the service is tremendous. My own church, Ipswich Baptist Church, provides six chaplains across a variety of different schools in Ipswich and the rural areas outside it. Ashley Saunders, the senior pastor, says this: Please pass on our appreciation as a church for the decision to continue School Chaplain funding for another 12 months. He says that six chaplains is a fair number from one church. I think that is pretty important. I commend the Rudd government, particularly the Prime Minister, for this initiative. This is a great initiative which will help the school communities in my electorate. Victorian Bushfires",179
202,Mrs MIRABELLA,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to speak on an issue very important to my electorate and to many rural and regional areas in Victoria. We saw 173 people lose their lives to bushfires this year. Two of those people were from my electorate. They were doing what so many residents usually do: staying at home to defend their properties. The February fire was the third fire in six years to ravage some parts of my electorate in north-east Victoria. The 2003 fires left their mark, as emotional scar tissue, on the psyches of many people who lived and worked in the area and those who fought the fires. Also, obviously, the fires left their mark on the landscape. Over 30,000 hectares were burnt in the Beechworth fire this year, and this was in addition to 900,000 hectares burnt during the 2003 and 2006 fires. Long after the cameras have gone and the media attention has faded away, these scars and effects are still there. I rose in the House, did many others, in February this year to speak on the condolence motion for the Victorian bushfire victims. I said: It is not the first time telecommunications has become an issue with bushfires across Australia, but we need to learn the lessons and learn them quickly. We have seen both the Rudd government and the Brumby government offer uncapped and unconditional financial support to the victims of the February fires. As recently as October, the Prime Minister and the Victorian Premier joined together to announce support for fireaffected areas. The Prime Minister earlier this year said: This government will be a partner for the long term in the rebuilding of each of the communities. He went on to say: We must do all that is possible through this commission so that we properly prepare for the future. While financial support is obviously very important to help communities rebuild their lives, we also need to learn from this disastrous event, which is something that the Victorian government has failed to do in the past in relation to the bushfire threat, to the disappointment and anguish of many Victorians. As Mr Bruce Esplin, Victoria's Emergency Services Commissioner, said after the release of the 2009 Bushfires Royal Commission interim report: I'd be a liar if I said I wasn't frustrated in seeing the similarities between what I said in 2003 and what the commission said in 2009. One of the issues of critical concern to northeast Victoria is access to communications and this issue was raised in the most recent interim report of the royal commission. They recommended in 4.8: The Australian Government, Council of Australian Governments and the State determine whether it is technically possible to implement the second phase of the national telephony-based as warning system (that is, the delivery of warning messages to mobile phones based on the physical location of a handset at the time of the emergency) with a view to implementation for the 2009–10 bushfire season. Despite promising that a warning system would be in place by the start of the 2009-10 bushfire season, the Brumby government has now conceded that the system is weeks away from testing. While a national early warning system is important, the fundamental issue that is often overlooked is the fact that many parts of Victoria, and particularly north-east Victoria, do not receive adequate mobile telephone coverage. We saw the Victorian Premier claim in the media that both the Victorian government and the Victorian royal commission have made representations to the federal government on the issue of telecommunications black spots, but effectively the Premier has washed his hands of the telecommunications issue. We saw the extraordinary statement by the emergency services minister, Bob Cameron, to calls for improved telecommunications in black spot areas when he said: Ultimately it's a matter really for the telcos what they do and obviously … over the years we've seen continued expansion of coverage and I suspect going into the future with technology changes that will continue to occur. But if you live in one of those … areas you have to factor that into your own individual fire plan. Thanks for all the care and concern, Mr Cameron, and I say that obviously with some sarcasm. People all over my electorate regularly contact me as they are frustrated with inadequate mobile coverage, and we have seen this coverage worsen since the switchover from the CDMA to the Next G network. The government has been incapable of keeping its promise to hold Telstra accountable to its guarantee that the Next G coverage would be as good as, if not better than, the CDMA network. The government needs to fulfil its promise. It needs to hold Telstra accountable to its guarantee. I have many constituents who have written to me saying that their coverage has become poorer since the switchover. (Time expired) Fowler Electorate: Memorial Development Application",181
203,Mrs IRWIN,ADJOURNMENT,"I speak tonight on a proposal that is of great importance to my local area. It is of great importance because it has created the unintended consequence of division within the community. It threatens to undo decades of work intended to break down the barriers between the many ethnic groups in the Fairfield LGA. The proposal is a development application before Fairfield City Council to build a memorial on the corner of Elizabeth Drive and Smithfield Road at Bonnyrigg on council land. I have read some of the public's response online in our local press, and my office has received many negative phone calls about this 4.5-metre or 17-foot memorial. I have made these concerns known to the as to Mayor of Fairfield and the member for Cabramatta, Nick Lalich, and the member for Smithfield, Ninos Khoshaba, on behalf of the people I represent. The memorial will be dedicated to the victims of the Assyrian genocide with the park named ‘The Garden of Ninevah' to reflect a strong affinity with the Assyrian people. It has, without doubt, noble intentions, but there are great difficulties in supporting memorials on public land which are dedicated to one cultural or ethnic group, no matter how worthy or noble the cause. Let me say from the outset that I have great admiration and respect for the Assyrian people. Their contribution to Australian life and in particular to life in south-western Sydney is already written into the annals of our country's relatively short history The Assyrian community has supported me over many years and I have supported the Assyrian community. This will not change. However, our community is made up of many ethnic groups, many nationalities and many cultures. It would be fair to say that there is hardly a nation not represented within the area. It is simply a reflection of our nation which has been built through migration. From our earliest days as a British colony when the First Fleet arrived at Sydney Cove pushing aside the Aboriginal inhabitants, to the early settlers, to the Chinese who worked in our goldfields, through to the waves of migration which followed the world wars, migration became the building block of our nation. Many came simply for a better life but many of our migrants have fled wars. Many have fled political and religious persecution to find a safe haven in Australia, a place of freedom and democracy and a place to raise a family without the ever-present fears of their homelands. They came from every continent-from Europe, Asia, South America, Africa and from the Middle East; from Britain, Ireland, Italy and Greece; from Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos; from Lebanon, Iraq and Palestine; from Rwanda and Sierra Leone; from the nations of the former Yugoslavia; from Sri Lanka and Afghanistan and from many other nations that I will not have time to name tonight. Everyone will recognise the names and everyone will remember their histories, for they are all very similar. No-one has a monopoly on war or persecution, no-one has a monopoly on genocide but, sadly, we have seen it repeated time and again around the world and it is this fact which prevents me from supporting this proposal in its current form. While the Assyrian people should rightly be proud of their heritage this proposal threatens to open a Pandora's box. Each proposal henceforth must be treated in the same manner. Is council prepared to offer public land for every proposed memorial? How will the council respond, say, if the Cambodian community sought to build a similar memorial? Would they not be worthy of the same consideration? Fairfield City Council should be taking the lead on this proposal. Council should elect to take charge of this memorial. Council should be seeking input from all the groups who make up our great community, including the Assyrian community. Rather than a memorial to one group, perhaps council should create a memorial to represent the contribution of all migrants in our community, a memorial to those who escaped for a new life in a faraway land-a land called Australia. Now that would be a proposal we would all support in my local community, which I am so honoured and privileged to represent in this parliament.",182
