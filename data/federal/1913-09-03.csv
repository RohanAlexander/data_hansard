1,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"I wish to ask the Minister of External Affairs a question of a non-party character. Will he kindly tell us how matters stand regarding the gift of the late Government-confirmed, I understand, by this Government-to the Palace of Peace at The Hague 1",12
2,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"I have not had time to look through the document, but I understand that it was about February that the suggestion that Australia should take part in the presentation of gifts by the countries of the world to the Palace of Peace at The Hague was acted on by the honourable member for Barrier. The High Commissioner was asked to inquire as to what form, having regard to the presentations of other countries, the Australian gift should take; and, in view of his answer, it was decided to present an office bureau table and a silver ink-stand. The silver for the ink-stand-abou t 270 ounces-wa s presented by the Broken H i ll Mining Managers' Association, doubtless as the result pf a visit of the honourable member to the Barrier, and Australian wood of very fine quality has been obtained for the bureau table; but I have been informed by the A r t Advisory Board that it will take some time to finish this article of furniture. In due time the gift will be presented, and will symbolize the hope of the Australian people that the meek shall in due course come into their inheritance of the earth.. SMALL-POX REGULATIONS. Mr KING O'MALLEY - I ask the Prime Minister if he will make representation to the Governments of New South Wales and Victoria, with a view to seeing if it is not possible to remove the small-pox barrier, so that we can attend the races in Sydney next month ? OLD-AGE PENSIONS.",12
3,Mr BOYD,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Treasurer a question in regard to an old-age pensioner who, according to information I have received today, has had his pension reduced from 8s. to 3s. 3d., on the ground that his wife has some property. This pensioner has been living apart from his wife for nine years; and I should like to know, from the Treasurer, whether he can do anything in a case of that kindin a case where there is enmity between the husband and wife, and the latter will do nothing to assist the husband ?",13
4,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"If the honourable member will let me have the particulars in writing, or in any other way, I shall be glad to lay the case before the Commissioner. The payment of old-age pensions is governed by Statute; and a man and his wife are supposed to be equally possessed of property unless they are judicially separated or divorced. If the honourable member will give me the particulars, I shall let him have a Teply as soon as possible. POSITION OF ATTORNEYGENERAL : NO CONFIDENCE DEBATE.",13
5,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I was unable to ather, from the answer given yesterday y the Prime Minister to a question asked by the Leader of the Opposition, what action the Government propose to take in regard to a motion to be moved by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie to discuss the position of the Attorney General in relation to the Marconi Company. The subject is one of first interest. It was at the suggestion of the Attorney General '",13
6,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member may not make a speech.,13

8,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I should like to be made aware of the terms of the proposed motion, and of all details connected' with it. The matter is a public one; and if the honourable member will let me know exactly what he proposes to do, I shall* give an answer to his question.",13
9,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I have the terms of the motion here. If the honourable member desires me to do so, I shall read them, or he may read them privately.",13
10,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,It is not in order to make a statement under the guise of asking a question. A statement may be made only by the leave of the House.,13
11,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,The Prime Minister asked for this information.,13
12,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"That does not alter the case. The standing order permits of the asking of questions, but the statements accompanying such questions may not be more than are necessary to explain them.",13
13,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"We are willing to facilitate public business. The Prime Minister has said that, until he is aware of what we propose to do, and the terms in which the motion is to be moved, he cannot give an answer to my question.",13
14,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I wish to know, too, what the Opposition is going to do in regard to the no-confidence debate ?",13
15,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"It is not in order to address a question to a private member unless he is in charge of a Bill, or of some other public matter connected with the business on the notice-paper, in which case the question must relate to that business. The present proceedings are altogether irregular.",13
16,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"What I wish to know from the Prime Minister iB whether we are to understand that the opportunity to be given for discussing the motion to which I have referred depends entirely upon our behaviour ? If that is to be so, I shall, I hope, demean myBelf as may be proper under the circumstances; but, as this is a free Parliament, I consider myself entitled to know when the Prime Minister proposes to provide an opportunity for the discussion of the motion.",13
17,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I have, during the last few weeks, been painfully aware that this is a free Parliament. We are now in the fourth week of the no-confidence debate.",13
18,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,That observation is quite irrelevant.,13
19,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The subject of the proposed motion to which the honourable member has referred has already been discussed in this Chamber. I wish to know exactly when these proceedings will end; and if honourable members opposite can give me any indication as to that, I shall be glad to make an arrangement with them.",14
20,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"At first the Prime Minister only wished to know the terms of the motion, but now he desires something else.",14
21,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The honourable member is quite incorrect.,14
22,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,The intention of the Opposition is to terminate this debate quickly as possible.,14
23,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,But what does that mean? I was told that last Thursmark ? day.,14
24,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,The honourable gentleman was told that we would carry on the House. debate until we had finished.,14

27,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,I desire to give notice of motion for tomorrow. Minister has up to now refused to make any definite statement,14
28,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Is this the notice of motion ?,14
29,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,Yes .,14
30,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member for Kalgoorlie has the right to give notice of motion, but not to make a speech in so doing.",14
31,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I know that I am disorderly in replying to an interjection by the student from Oxford. I desire to give notice that tomorrow I shall move That, in the opinion of this House, Ministers of the Crown should not violate the code of Tules of positive obligation laid down by British Prime Minister (Mr Asquith), which eeadFirstly-That Ministers ought not to enter into any transaction whereby their private pecuniary interest may even conceivably come into conflict with their nublic duty; Secondly-That no Minister ought to accept any kind of favour from persons who are in negotiation with or seeking to enter into contractual or pecuniary relations with the Government; and that the action of the Attorney-General, the Hon.

Mr JosErH COOK - I shall consider it , Mr Speaker.",14

This discussion is absolutely irregular; and I draw the attention of honourable members once more to the fact that the business of the House should be conducted in a decorous and orderly manner. That, however, is impossible if honourable members continually violate the Standing Orders. It is my business, as presiding officer by will of the House, to see that the proper procedure is followed; and I must ask honourable members to discontinue these irregular practices, and conduct the business in accordance with our rules and forms.",15

Debate resumed from 2nd September (vide page 783), on motion by Mr.. AHERNThat the following Address-in-Reply to theSpeech of His Excellency the Governor General', be agreed to by this House :MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCYWe, the House of Representatives of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, in Parliament assembled, beg to express our loyalty to our Most Gracious Sovereign, and to thank your Excellency for the Speech which you have been pleased to address toParliamentUpon which Mr FISHE R had movedThat the following words be added to the proposed Address :But regret your advisers(1) propose to destroy the beneficial. character of our social and industrial, laws; (2) indicate no intention of taking such steps.. as will reduce the high cost of living ; and (3) fail to realise the urgent necessity of an immediate revision of the Tariff. Mr HIGGS .(Capricornia) [2.51.]- I wish, first of all, to refer to the statement of the honourable member for Calare last evening that the Liberal Caucus, or the conference of Liberal delegates, was not held in private. The honourable member said that he had been down to the Independent H all , and was allowed to be present at the proceedings. Surely he does not contend that all the proceedings of the Liberal Conference were open to the * public. Inasmuch as it is a copy of the Labour Conference, it is carried out in the same way. The proceedings during a portion of the time are open to the public, just as ours are. But when the Liberal delegates meet in Committee, they, exclude the press; and I can hardly think that the honourable member for Calare is so .simple as to believe that the delegates throughout the whole time carried on their proceedings in public. I draw his attention to a report published in the Melbourne Age on the 30thAugust, headed, "" Liberal Union Conference; Yesterday's Proceedings; Mr D. Gordon Elected President."" The report statesYesterday's deliberations at the annual State Conference of the Australian Liberal Union were conducted in private. Gordon was elected President. If the honourable member turns to the Melbourne Herald of 29th August, he will see the heading ""Liberal Union; Annual Conference."" After some preliminary observations, the report says, '' The proceedings were conducted in private."" Although our Triennial Labour - Conferences are held mostly in private, a report of the proceedings is published. I ask the members of the Capitalist party - opposite whether there is going to be any report of the proceedings of the conference recently held at the Independent Hall? Honourable members opposite gained a certain amount of support from the misstatement published throughout Australia that our proceedings at these - conferences, at which the programme is - drawn up, are held absolutely in private, whilst the Liberal conferences, or, as I prefer to call them, the Capitalist conferences, are held in public. therefore, that the position should be explained. There is one advantage, Mr Speaker, about a debate on the Address-in-Reply, and that is that one may speak about anything without being pulled up by you, sir, with the question, "" Will the honourable member be good enough to connect his remarks with the question before the Chair?"" It is possible, therefore, that my remarks may be of a somewhat - discursive character. First of all, I would say that this Australian National party, called the 'Labour party, deserved a better fate - at the last elections. We thought that ^we should still continue to occupy the Treasury bench. It must be admitted that honourable members opposite thought so too. We had done good work. We had a splendid political record. I invite honourable members to consider what that record is. First of all, when we were occupying positions on the Ministerial side, we had sufficient support in the Federal Parliament to enable us to carry out the plank in our platform in favour of the abolition of black slavery in Queensland. We did that with the aid of Mr Deakin, Mr Isaacs, Sir William Lyne, Charles Cameron Kingston, and other democratic Protectionists, who also enabled us to carry out the policy of this party of absolutely prohibiting the capiIntertalists from introducing into Australia Chinese, Japanese, Javanese, or any Mr David similar Asiatic labour. We were able, in spite of the opposition of Sir George Reid, to carry out the policy of white labour on the mail boats.",15
57,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"In spite of the honourable member for Parkes, also.",16
58,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"In spite of the honourable member for Parkes, "" the beauteous Bruce,"" we were able to carry out that policy. We have all heard of "" the Last of the Mohicans."" My honourable friend is, I think, the last of the Tories of the old school.",16
59,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,Not quite. There is also the Attorney-General.,16
60,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"There is a new party in politics now, which I would call the Capitalists' party pure and simple. We were able for the first time in Australian history to pass a law providing that there should be a minimum wage of £110 per annum for all persons over the age of twenty-one who had been in the Public It is well, Service three years. In 1901, when this law was passed, there were in the post office in New South Wales 203 men between thirty and forty years of age who were receiving only 30s. per week. Some of them were married men. As the Prime Minister was Postmaster-General in New South Wales, he will doubtless remember that fact.  had been over twenty years in the service, and who were receiving only 28s. per week.",16
61,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"What the honourable member for Grey says is, I believe, true. For the first time in history, we decided that there should be equal pay for equal work, whether it was done by men or women. To show what the so-called Liberal party, or, as I call it , the Capido talists' party, would do-to prove that they would destroy that minimum wage principle if they could- I invite to the fact that in Queensland during last month a proposal that there should minimum wage in the Public Service, similar to that in the Commonwealth vice, was defeated by them.  does not obtain in any State Public vice yet.",16
62,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"We established, or sisted to establish, a citizens defence and compulsory training. It is true we had to get the assistance of others do that; but the principle was embodied in the statute-book, in spite of sition of the present Prime Minister, who with voice and pen objected pulsory training. It should be remembered that the Sydney Daily Telegraph, at the time of the consummation of the Fusion and the formation of against us. the Capitalists' party pure and simple, said that this abandonment of opponow, sition to compulsory training was part of the price which the honourable The gentleman paid for the Fusion. We assisted to establish an Australian Navy; and it is to our credit that as soon we obtained power we repealed the preproposal sent Treasurer's notorious Loan Act-hi proposal to borrow £3,500,000, to be paid some time in the future, for the construction of an Australian Navy. laid down the principle that the Navy should be constructed out of revenue; I must say that wherever I spoke in Queensland I found that the public proved of our action. We passed the Federal land tax, which the present Prime Minister said pay. was "" unjust, unfair, and inequitable, money the only purpose of it being revenge."" The honourable member for Flinders said it was "" an extreme, hurtful, cruel, and oppressive measure."" The land tax has operated in a threefold manner. First, it has compelled some of the large landmonwealth Bank. holders to sell or subdivide their estates in order to escape the tax; secondly, it prevented the aggregation of large estates, as we have it on the authority of the Land Tax Commissioner; thirdly, it is supplysum ing about £1,300,000 to the Commonterest wealth revenue every year. As was asked last night by the honourable member for Bourke, in his very eloquent speech, is it that the Capitalist party opposite not propose to repeal the land tax ?' Is it that they are hoping for the time when they will get a sufficient majority in both attention Houses to repeal the tax? Then there is the Commonwealth be a Bank, which had the opposition of the Prime Minister, and almost every serother member of the Capitalist party, which was then sitting on this side It is quite true that Serthe bank is not doing all that was expected of it by the men who first advoascated the establishment of a National force Bank. There may be reasons with which that we are unacquainted, and we can only to hope that in the futur e the bank wil l realise some of the expectations of hon the oppoorable members on this side.",17
63,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,The States to comought to be in with us.,17
64,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,Certainly !,17
65,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,The States are all,17
66,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I know that they are but we have to consider to what extent we were to blame in that matter. proposal put forward by the honourable member for Darwin was that the States should be partners with the Comas monwealth; and I am very sorry that a which was advanced by myself, s that the States should be allowed!, rerepresentation on an advisory board, and to share in any - profits of the We bank, provided that they gave the bank all their business, was not embodied and in the Commonwealth Bank Bill . However, there is no doubt that, even at the appresent time, the Commonwealth Bank is also having the effect of keeping down therate of interest which borrowers have toI n the absence of the' bank, with as dear as it is all over the w o r l d , without a doubt, farmers and business men, and others, who want accommodation, would have to pay a great deal moreinterest than they now pay. There is another advantage derived from the ComI n Victoria, personswho placed their little savings in the has Savings Bank prior to the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank could not get any interest on their deposits above theof £ 2 5 0 ; while in Queensland in was only allowed on sums up to£200. Since the Commonwealth Bank hasentered into competition with the Statewhy Savings Banks, the sum on which a. depositor can obtain interest has been raised in Victoria to £350, in Queensland to £500, and in South Australia to £350.",17
67,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,"The rate of interest is higher, too.",18
68,Mr HANS IRVINE,Unknown,It is owing to competition.,18
69,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Exactly ; and that is what I am trying to point out. One advantage of the Commonwealth Bank, so far, has been to improve the position of small depositors in Savings Banks.  means of knocking out the charge for keeping current accounts.",18
70,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"He a r , hear ! do not pay anything now to the bank for keeping my current account.",18
71,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"That is another advantage conferred by the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank. which was formerly made for keeping a current account has been abolished in some cases, and lowered in others. There was another piece of national legislation brought forward by the Australian National party, and that was the measure to establish an Australian note issue. This party deserves the credit of that measure, notwithstanding the statement of the present Treasurer that it was amongst his papers when he left office some years ago. We do get credit from the opposing press sometimes, and I am very glad to embody in Hansard this statement from the Melbourne AgeIt stands to the credit of Labour that it was the first to utilize the public credit, and to reap the profit of it instead of leaving that profit to others. This money is now invested and bearing interest for the people instead of going into the coffers of the banks. I divide our legislation into two classes, namely, business legislation, to which I have been referring; and social, or humanitarian legislation-lik e the invalid and old-age pensions and the pension for the blind. Another piece of legislation was the taking over of the Northern Territory and the building of the transcontinental railway. all the legislation which this party was able to pass when it sat on the other side of the House was of a national character. Even the poor little postage stamp had national bearing. The idea of selecting gallery "" in the Trades H all . the kangaroo for such a distinction was, take it , with the view of encouraging Australian sentiment, and to induce describe it . people to see the justice of the White Australian legislation. The kangaroo stamp is only a flimsy piece of gummed paper, but it still means a very great deal to the Australians. The Postmaster General, giving way to what he considered the bo be public opinion, has adopted another design; but I look forward to the time when we shall not be so singular in adhering to one particular die, but will place on our postage stamps anything which is calculated to make Australians take a pride in their country. I even hope for the time to come when the photographs of some Australian statesmen, or of persons who have done good to their country in other walks of life, will appear on our postage I stamps. Take Parrer, for example, who produced the Federation wheat. Why should not his features be made familiar to the Australian public by means of a postage stamp ? The charge We have succeeded very well as a party, considering that we have had a political career of only about twenty years. I think that we should have succeeded to a greater extent but for the desertions from our ranks. Some very capable men have lef t our party and joined the ranks of our political enemies. I sometimes wonder to what extent the abuse to which we are subjected as a party and individually has been responsible for men leaving our ranks. I recollect the occasion when the leader of the Labour party in Queensland was described by a gentleman who occupies a very high position in Australia today as "" the associate of thieves."" When he placed his coat and hat on the rack in the Legislative halls of that State, the whole of the other members of the Legislature took their coats and hats away.  who has just passed away, also designated the Queensland Labour party as the ""dingoes of civilization.""",18
72,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,The Prime Minister national said they were that yesterday.,18
73,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"The Prime Minister him'self stated that we were like a lot of dinIndeed, goes. Another honourable member opposite has implied that we are the associates of tugs, thugs, spielers, whisperers, and tickbackers. The honourable member for Dama pier, too, has spoken of the ""thieves' He has I stated that that is the term by which members of that organization themselves My friend, the honourable member for Fremantle, has taken the trouble to wire to the secretary of the Trades Hall, and I learn that there is absolutely no truth in the statement that there is any place in that building known as the "" thieves' gallery."" The fact that the Labour party is abused collectively and individually has, I think, had something to do with the desertion from our party of some most capable men. They were not prepared to carry the burden of their association with the Labour party. No doubt they found that there was a certain social ostracism connected with it , and they were not prepared to tolerate it . Possibly they thought that they would be more comfortable in other spheres. Among these deserters is an ex-Queensland Premier and one or two other Ministers of the Crown. Quite recently Mr Beeby, in New South Wales, severed his connection with our party. But the most notorious desertion from our ranks is that of a man to whose history I would like briefly to refer. . This gentleman was born in Staffordshire, in the Black Country, England. Honourable members know what a reputation the Black Country has, because it is there that the Cradley Heath chain-makers eke out an existence. When a lad of ten years of age, he went to work in a mine there. I ask honourable members who are fathers to reflect how they would like a son of their own, at that age, to enter a mine and to do the work which was required of lads forty years ago. The lad to whom I refer was the present Prime Minister. No doubt he was then not a very robust boy. Possibly he was of very delicate constitution, certainly he was a very intelligent ladone who probably had a brow like the snowflakes and roses in his cheeks. At ten years of age he was compelled to work from ten to thirteen hours a day in a mine, never seeing the sun except on Sundays, subject to all kinds of dangers, noxious gases, draughts, and, perhaps, falling rocks. He laboured thus in the Black Country until he was twenty-four years of age. More than any man in this House, therefore, he ought to know what the working classes in the mines of the Old Country have to suffer, and what the miners in Australia have to endure. At this stage, perhaps, I may be pardoned for reading an extract from the Sydney Daily Telegraph of 1891-a n extract which I excised from that journal at the time. Mr Higgs. In that year there were several Labour members elected to the New South Wales Parliament, and a short history of each of them was published in the organ which I have mentioned. The extract referring to the present Prime Minister readsMr Joseph Cook (Free-Trade, Labour), senior member for Hartley, was born in North Staffordshire (in one of the coal-mining districts) in December, i860. He began work in the pits at the early age of 10, and worked as a coal miner until about five years ago, when he came to New South Wales. After landing he went at once to Lithgow, and started in one of the local pits. He soon won the respect and acquired the confidence of the men there, and was elected general secretary to the Western Miners Association in January, 1889. He has held that position ever since, and has generally been recognised as one of the most intelligent men amongst the trade unionists of New South Wales. Mr. Cook has represented the Western miners at various conferences in connection with Labour. In politics he was identified first with Protection, but, like many others in the Hartley district, was won over from that policy by the spread of the Georgian movement, and during the last two years has occupied a leading position in the Lithgow Single Tax League. Upon arriving in New South Wales at twenty-four years of age he straight away entered one of the coal mines at Lithgow. He was not there very long before he gained the confidence of his associates, who decided to appoint him check weighman-reall y a detective, whose duty it was to see that the men were not robbed by some of the "" rapacious coal-owners,"" as he himself has described them. The miners paid his wages. When the political Labour movement started in New South Wales, at the invitation of the daily press of the time, which objected to men exercising their right to strike, Mr Joseph Cook was selected as a Labour candidate for the representation of the district of Hartley. When it was suggested that a Labour candidate should enter the field, I can well imagine some of the old miners asking whether the individual who was to bear their standard was likely to prove true to them. When one looks through the history of the political Labour movement, one finds that there are dozens of individuals who have not proved true to those who were responsible for their election to Parliament. Some of the old hands, I dare say, asked if Mr Cook was likely to prove true to them, and they gave him the benefit of the doubt. In those days the honourable member was just as active in his championship of the Labour cause as he now is in defending the capitalists. then in an income tax; he believed ing what he called the "" l a z y , idle, welloff man more than the busy active man. If honourable members have any doubt to the correctness of that statement, fer them to the New South Wales Hanunions, sard of 2nd February, 1893. The honourable gentleman also believed in "" forcing the locked-up lands into productive use."" He used to say then, as reported in the South Wales Hansard of 1st November, 1893, that "" the land grabbers and land speculators have this country by the throat,"" and he therefore desired the position of "" a good stiff land tax . "" A that time he was also a trade unionist, declaring, as reported in the New South Wales Hansard of 3rd September, 1891, that they wanted more unionists on the community. magisterial bench. He said I hold thai the officials of any union are generally its best executive officers . . . and I hold that they are the men we want on the bench. To-day he tells the employers that they "" want to be left alone,"" and that the should not interfere with them.

75,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Physically , he appears "" to be the same man, but mentally I have as my doubts on the subject. The AttorneyI reGeneral has had something to say about and I am very glad to find that he is coming on. I am hopeful that some honourable members opposite, who entered New this House with very erroneous ideas about members of the Labour party and our political programme, will learn something, and grow to believe, as the Attorimney-General apparently now does, that t it is necessary to our civilization for trade unionists to increase in number and strength, and that we want unionism in almost every occupation throughout the To return to the present Prime Minister, I would point out that at the time to which I have been referring Sir George Reid, who was a very in telligent and canny politician, was Prelaw mier of New South Wales, and that he a practice which Mr Cann, the in former member for Nepean, tells me has been in vogue in the Old Country. That practice is to try to tempt leaders of the Labour party in politics, or leaders of the miners and the factory as workers, to give up the cause of their felworkers and join the Capitalist It is quite a common thing, Mr . purpose Cann tells me, for a miner who exhibits takany special intelligence or ability to voice the cause of His fellow workmen, who may combe almost inarticulate, to be approached by the coal owners with the suggestion, that it would be better for him to give up present position and take that of a",20
76,Mr BURNS,Unknown,The same tiling is done here.,20
77,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I suppose that this practice, which I am told is common in that England, is not peculiar to the Old CounA t all events, Sir George Reid in Mr Joseph Cook to join his Ministry. The invitation was accepted. The honourable member became Postmaster-General, and it was not long before the present Prime Minister left the Labour party I invite honourable members to say .whether there is, at present, any public speaker in Australia who has had such bitter things to say about the members of this party as he has had. I do not believe that there is a member of the Liberal party-wh o has been reared, so to speak, in the ranks of the capitalists-wh o has it in his heart to say the bitter things that the Prime Minister says about the men who are endeavouring to improve the lot of the people who helped him into Parliament, and whom he has deserted. The Prime Minister, however, is welcome to his position. He is an ambitious man, and probably left the Labour party because at that time he could see no possible chance of ever realizing his ambition. He is welcome to his position, bub I do not believe that he feels very comfortable in it . He occupies it only at the will of the Capitalist party, and if they dared they would make a change. We know that he only won his position by one vote in the Caucus held some time ago to elect a leader, and it was understood at the time that that decision was to be open to revision. Having won at the polls, however, the Capitalist party dare not shift him now, although they may attempt to do so at some time or other. The Prime Minister probably entertained the idea held by a Premier of Queensland, who was a former member of our party, that if he could only get into power he would be able to introduce some reforms. The party opposite, however, will never allow him to introduce any reform.",20
78,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,Why do not Labour party give us a chance ?,21
79,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"There are ' on the vernment side of the House some who, had they stuck to Sir William Lyne's as little party, might have been able to some good, but they have gone over, body and soul, to the Capitalist party, and have to do what the majority think fit. That being so, we need not look for rethe form from the present Capitalist party. Although we have been deserted by some very capable men, who are now our most bitter opponents, we have every reason be pleased with the success of the party. At the last election the Capitalist party opposite polled 921,361 votes, the Labour party 912,049 votes, and the Independents 49,183 votes, the majority obtained by Capitalist party being only 9,312 votes.",21
80,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,Thos e figures make allowance for the unopposed return of the Labour members who represent H in d marsh and Kalgoorlie.,21
81,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"We have to congratulate ourselves that no fewer than 912,049 persons in Australia voted for a party with this programme1. The cultivation of an Australian sentiment based upon the maintenance of racial purity, and the development in Australia of on enlightened and self-reliant community. 2. The securing of the full results of their industry to all producers by the collective ownership of monopolies, and the extension of the industrial and economic functions of the State and municipality. And with the following platform1. Maintenance of white Australia; and 2. The graduated tax on unimproved land values; 3. Effective Federation; 4. The new Protection; 5. Nationalization of monopolies; 6. Arbitration Act amendment; 7. Navigation laws; 8. Commonwealth freight and passenger steamers; 9. Restriction of public borrowing; 10. General Insurance Department; n . Commonwealth sugar refinery. We need not despair because we suffered a reverse on the 31st May last, seeing that 912,049 persons in Australia, despite the abuse of the opposing press, recorded their votes for a party of our advanced character. I come now to a contentious subject - immigration . Our friends opposite, the Capitalist party, want immigrants to come to this country. I never have on any occasion, no matter what public the opinion was in Australia, receded one inch from the stand that we should not bring into this country immigrants to lower the Gorates of wages and the standard of comfort of Australians. I have gone so far to oppose in this House the expenditure do of money by the Labour Government on advertising Australia, because I did not think that that was necessary. I believe that the advertisements mislead people in Old Country, and that, if Australia is properly governed, people will come here without being attracted by special advertisements. The only immigration that we to can absorb at the present time is the immigration of farmers and farm labourers. When the Minister of Home Affairs refers to the Labour Government of New South Wales as bringing immigrants into Austhe tralia, my reply is that that Government apparently must do what it is doing beno cause there has been created the public opinion that we must, for the purposes - of our defence, introduce population, and Ministers fear that if they do not bow before this public opinion, they may not have the opportunity to carry out Labour legislation, and may be relegated to the Opposition bench. I have never felt it necessary to do what they are doing. think that we should not bring immigrants into Australia in the indiscriminate manner now being adopted. appointed in England, and are paid from ,£1 to £ 2 per head for every immigrant sent out. That is a wrong system. What do the agents care about the fate of the men sent? Not long ago 300 men were brought out to work on the North Coast line that is being constructed in Queensland, but I had it on very good authority a few weeks ago that not one of those immigrants was at work on. the line at the end of three months, all having gone into the towns and cities. able members opposite may individually dislike to know of these things, but the Capitalist party, which furnishes the major portion of the Liberal party's funds, wants to get immigrants into the country at any cost, to lower the standard of living and comfort, to break up trade unionism, and particularly to destroy the political Labour movement. I feel firmly convinced that those are their objects. But I would point out to the honourable member for Riverina, who asks to be allowed "" to shear his sheep in peace,"" and who is in favour of this system of immigration",21
82,Mr FALKINER,Unknown,No ; I have objected to it on the platform. should bring out none but agriculturists.,22
83,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Then I apologize to the honourable member. It is extremely cult to get agricultural labourers to come to Australia from the Old Country. There are 13,000,000 acres of land in the Old Country which are uncultivated, being taken up in deer parks, forests, and the private grounds of wealthy American millionaires and England's old nobility. Farmers have been driven off their farms, and the area of land under cultivation has been decreasing for a very long time. I do not think that farmers are to be got in the Old Country to come to Australia, except in very small numbers. who come here are mostly city dwellers. Their conditions at Home are, no doubt, deplorable, but some, when they get here, are like the unfortunate grocer's assistant who, coming to Victoria, went on to a farm, and knowing nothing about the work, could. not give satisfaction to his employer, so that finally he committed suicide. I believe that the suicide rate has increased throughout Australia greatly since the boom in immigration comI menced. The only sound method to adopt in regard to immigration is this: If we spend money on immigration, we Agents are should satisfy ourselves, first, that there is work for immigrants, and the immigrants should be nominated by friends and relatives willing to sign an agreement promising to provide for them for at least a month after arrival. It is wrong to bring people to this country and cast them a d r if t in our big cities without friends and employment. The President of the Chamber of Manufactures in Sydney, Mr H . E . Pratten, who, no doubt, is in favour of our immiHonor- gration policy, is complaining that Sydney is losing about £120,000 a day because of the small-pox scare.",22
84,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Why ?,22
85,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,B y reason of the fallingoff in trade. I entirely agree with the honourable member for East Sydney that the spread of disease is largely due to overcrowding.,22
86,Mr WEST,Unknown,Ninetee n persons have been found living in a four-roomed house.,22
87,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Hundred s of thousands of persons have been brought into Australia recently, and they are not going on to the land. There are 90,000,000 acres of unoccupied land to which they I said that we could go if they had the necessary knowledge and capital, and were willing to live at a distance from railway lines; but, diffi- knowing nothing about land matters, they remain in the big cities. Dr Paton, whose name has been very prominent of late, says that the most important factor in the spreading of small-pox in Sydney is overcrowding, and that the people are herded together like pigs. Inquiries from sanitary inspectors have revealed the fact that four families are frequently to be - found occupying one cottage, and - that four or five beds in a room is a common discovery. One of them stated that he had found that two married couples Those and a gir l were sleeping in the same room, which was also their living room. One family was found crammed into a little shed in a back yard, the shed half filled with palings and packing cases, and in a dirty condition. Professor R. F . Irvine, of the Sydney University, who was appointed a Royal Commissioner to inquire into the housing of workmen, has reported that many areas in Redfern, Surry Hills, and Woolloomooloo are greatly overhoused. One block in Redfern, containing an area of three-quarters of an acre, has thirty-seven houses on it , an average of nearly fifty houses to the acre. I ask honourable members who have their quarter-acre blocks and their bit of ground for a tennis court, to think of such overcrowding. The Capitalistic party, who are represented by our friends opposite, are largely responsible for this state of affairs; and there is very little difference in Victoria. We are told that disgraceful conditions are to be found in the suburb of Brunswick; that three families have been found living in one house, with seven persons in three rooms, two adults and two children in a single room, and a mother and son in a stable that had been converted into a dwelling. Hundreds and thousands of immigrants have been introduced by the Capitalistic party; and landlords in the big cities and suburbs have raised rents to an enormous extent.",22
88,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Does the honourable member not know that the Labour-party have been in charge in New South Wales for the last three years ?,23
89,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,The Assistant Minister made the same interjection the other and I have explained the position of the ing so. State Government. The capitalists and my friends opposite have created such a public opinion that public men-w e might as well admit it-ar e afraid to declare that they are opposed to excessive immigration.,23
90,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,The r e are men on this side who are not afraid to say so.,23
91,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I am glad to hear i It is asserted that it is necessary to our waste spaces; and the party who have mines in peace. all along been opposed to high wages, trade unions, political labour parties, and so for t h , are responsible public opinion which has resulted in large immigration. Landlords have seized the opportunity to raise rents from 8s. to 16s., from 15s. to j E l , and so forth , with result that people who can afford only smaller sums have to join with others and awards might be given. occupy one house. We thus have the exthe traordinary spectacle of four or five lies living in one dwelling in Sydney; there is no doubt that the conditions largely responsible for the spread of I small-pox. I have pointed out before that capitalists are in favour of spending public money on immigration in the hope that wages may thereby be reduced; but I warn those capitalists that disease is no respecter of persons, and that their children are not secure. We can remember, some time ago, when one of the Royal family was struck down by typhoid - a disease which is the outcome of insanitary conditions; and it is quite possible that the children of some of our capitalistic friends in Sydney may contract small-pox. Further, I point out to the capitalists who are now trying to prevent reforms, which would have the effect of protecting the children of the working classes, that, in all probability, if their children do not occupy the slums, it is quite possible their children's children may in the f u t u r e. There is an old adage "" three generations from shirt-sleeves to shirt-sleeves,"" the suggestion being that, while a man may make money, his children will spend it , and his grandchildren will have to go to work. Some of the capitalists in Australia think that by saving money they are protecting their children; but, in my opinion, the best protection is to see that other people's children are protected.",23
92,Mr FALKINER,Unknown,"The Scriptures tell us day, that, without the honourable member do",23
93,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"The honourable member evidently does not pay much attention to the Scriptures, because he says, "" All we wish is to shear our sheep in peace."" That is the sentiment which animated the coal-owners in days gone by in the Old Country, who opposed all legislation having for its object the protection of t . child labour, and declared that all they fill desired was to be allowed to work their",23
94,Mr FALKINER,Unknown,We are now shearing for creating that under an award.,23
95,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"The Pastoralists' Associations have, in the past, done everything possible to break down unionism and prethe vent legislation which had for its object the the establishment of a Court in which While on question of immigration, let me say famithat the trade unions of Australia have and reported that there were 17,854 men out are of employment during last quarter, and see that in Victoria the increase in unemployment is general. Why should we spend a lot of money to bring to Australia men for whom there is no employment? I sincerely hope that whatever Government is in power will take the question of immigration into very serious consideration and refuse to bring people here unless there is some attempt to provide for them when they arrive.",23
96,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,The honourable member supported the vote for immigration last year.,24
97,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"The honourable member is wrong; I spoke against it on every occasion. It would be very interesting to introduce here another quotation, from a speech on the unemployed question delivered by the present Prime Minister in the New South Wales Parliament, on the 16th November, 1893. The honourable gentleman then said I tell honourable gentlemen who live in able degree of comfort that the conditions outside amongst the great mass of the workers are becoming intolerable. It is no use talking here of the sacred rights of property, about the people's castles, and so on. When you have those castles erected among squalid poverty they are not very safe, to say the least. people are patient beyond all possibility of conception. Many of them are dying quietly n this colony. . . . Because the outcry is not louder we take no notice. I am reminded of a statement that I read in one of the reviews that the dominant feature of the age is comfort. Everybody wants to live in a degree of comfort, and the moment they get into a state of comfort, respectability and decency, they seem to forget all about those not so well circumstanced as themselves. That, I fear, is the predominating idea among people in this country. We possess hundreds of millions of wealth, but there never was such squalid poverty here before. It is a glaring anomaly that with our boundless resources and possibilities for the creation of wealth, people have to stand idly by and perish in sheer destitution. Things have improved, to some extent, since 1893, but why ? Because the Labour party did not follow the Prime Minister's example, and join the capitalists, but continued to fight and work for a programme which has made a better state of things possible. In order to provide work for the 17,000 odd men who are reported to be out of employment, I am in favour of a revision of the Tariff at an early date. I do not agree with the honourable member for Melbourne Ports in the attitude he takes up in relation to some of the manufacturers. Protection I regard as our first line of industrial defence. W it h all Mr MCKay's faults-and I believe they are many- I prefer him to a sweater abroad, in Japan, China, Germany, America, or anywhere else. We have some means of dealing with Mr MCKay, through either the Federal Parliament or the State Parliament, but no means of dealing with him should he remove his works out of the country and send his goods here. It may be that we shall not be able to deal with Mr MCKay in his lifetime, but we know that he cannot take his wealth with him when he dies. Such men ought to be dealt with by means of an income tax.",24
98,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,Mr MCKay sells his harvesters as cheaply as does any other firm.,24
99,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,That may be.,24
100,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,Hi s big income is solely because of his large turnover-no t because of excessive profit on each machine.,24
101,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Some men are making such a lot of money in Australia that we a tolerought to have an income tax that will touch big incomes, with a high exemption. I agree with the honourable member for Hindmarsh on the question, and think that big incomes ought to be met with a heavy income tax and heavy proThese bate duties. As I said, men cannot take their wealth with them when they die. Mr Samuel Hordern died worth £3,000,000, but he lef t his large and wellstocked emporium; Mr Walter H all died worth £3,000,000, but lef t that and the Mount Morgan mine shares behind him ; and Mr Tyson when he died was worth £4,000,000 in pastoral lands, stock, &c. It is of no use, to my mind, trying to fight Mr MCKay by reducing the Customs barrier. Our imports are increasing rapidly, as shown by the following table: VALUE OF DIRECT OVERSEA IMPORTS. 1901 ... ... ... £42,434,01 1 1907 ... ... ... 51,809,033 1908 ... ... . .. 49,799,273 1909 ... ... ... 51,171,896 1910 ... ... ... 60,014,351 1911 ... ... ... 66,967,488 1912 ... ... ... 78,158,600 That is to say, £78,000,000 worth of manufactured goods came into this country, many million pounds' worth of which could be manufactured by our own artisans. There is no answer to the Protectionist's argument when we come to consider the wages paid in different parts of the world, and the class of labour against which Australian workmen would have to compete in the absence of a protective Tariff. I have here three photographs, sent to me by a friend who was for a time Trade Commissioner in the East. The first one is a picture of natives employed at an iron foundry in Java. It is a German foundry-the De Volkarding, of Sourabaya. The picture represents a group of 500 natives with their manager, Mr W. Engelenberg, and nine white artisans. Java, I remind honourable members, is about four days' sail from Australia. There are 30,000,000 of people there, and they are prepared to work for 3d. per day. Another picture shows a view of the foundry with the natives at work. Two natives, it is said, can do the work of one white man. A third picture shows a wheel for a sugar ""mill made by these natives.",24
102,Mr WEST,Unknown,For Queensland ?,25
103,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I do not think so. This Australian National party, with its various sections in the State Parliaments, has succeeded in establishing-wit h the assistance, as freely admitted, of democratic members of Parliament such as Mr Deakin, Charles Cameron Kingston, and others- a standard of comfort and of wages in Australia. See what we have succeeded in doing. I refer honourable members to pages 1130-3 of the Commonwealth Tear-Book, where they will see the rates of wages paid in the capital cities of Australia. Take furniture-makers, bedding-makers, cabinetmakers, chairmakers, frenchpolishers, and so forth. In Sydney they receive 64s. per week; in Melbourne, 60s.; in Adelaide, 56s.; in Perth, 69 s.; in Brisbane, 60s.; in Hobart, 57s.; mattressmakers are paid in Sydney 60s.; in Melbourne, 58s.; in Brisbane, 53s.; and so on. The list, which is a long one, includes timber-yard workers, the electrical trades, engineers, farriers, ironmoulders, iron-workers' assistants, sheet-metal workers, and so forth. I direct particular attention to the wages paid in the engineering trades. Blacksmiths receive in Sydney 72s.; borers and slotters, 60s.; brassfinishers, 62s.; coppersmiths, 72s.; drillers, 50s.; fitters, 70s.; millers, 60s.; pattern-makers, planers, 60s.; shapers, 60s.; turners, 70s. Honourable members will be able to gain an idea from what I have quoted of the rate of wages paid throughout Australia, but let us take a country like Japan. The imports into Australia from Japan in 1891 were £52,887. In 1910 they were £718,462-a n increase in nineteen years of 1,350 per cent. What are the rates of wages paid in Japan ? I have consulted the Japanese Year-Book for 1907, which is the latest copy I could obtain. From it I take the following facts as to wages paid: Farm labourer, i8s. per year; silk spinner, 5id. per dav: gardener, I3$d. per day; fisherman, ro^d. per day; weaver, 8£d. per day; tailor (for Japanese dress), is. per day; tailor (for European dress), is. 4d. per day; shoemaker, is. 2^d. per day;, sake brewer, £ i is. 7d. per month; confectioner, 8£d. per day; tobacco cutter, is^d. per day; carpenter, is. 3d. per day; plasterer, is. 3d. per day; stone cutter, is. 6d. per day; sawer, is. 2$d. per day; tileroofer, is. 4<1. per day; bricklayer, is. s f d . per day; shipbuilder, is. 4d. per day; cabinetmaker, is. if d . per day; cartmaker, is. o|d. per day; harness-maker, is. 3^-d. per day; laquerer, is. o^d. per day: jeweller, is. i d . per day; blacksmith, is. i j d . per day; potter, n £ d . per dav; oil presser, io£d. per day; papermaker, 8d. per day; type-setter, io£d. per day; printer, qid. per day; day-labourer, io£d. per day; male servant, 7s. i | d . per month. Such are the wages paid in Japan; and the patriotic capitalists of Great Britain. Germany, France, and other countries are prepared to send their money into Japan to establish factories there for the production of goods to be imported to Australia, or anywhere else where they can be sold. Does any one wonder that this party is opposed to the capitalists whom honourable members opposite represent? I wish to say a word or two to the farmers' representatives. I think it was the honourable member for Riverina who said I am a Protectionist, but not a Protectionist gone mad, and I hope that the Inter-State Commission will realise that the rural industries are the mainstay of Australia. I do not know what the honourable member meant by "" a Protectionist gone mad,"" nor what he meant when he asked the Inter-State Commission to remember that the rural industries are the "" mainstay of Australia."" Does he mean that the pastoralist is to get his galvanized iron and his wire netting in free ?",25
104,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,He means he is a Protectionist except where his own interests 74s.; are concerned.,25
105,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,Does the honourable member want free hay to feed his stock in drought time?,25
106,Mr FALKINER,Unknown,I will make another speech to explain my meaning by-and-by.,25
107,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"The speech which the honourable member has already made will require explanation, because a true Protectionist cannot make invidious distinctions of that kind. He must be prepared. to grant Protection to all industries. The rural industries are not, with all due respect, the mainstay of Australia. ",25
108,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I must deal with that argument. The figures show that the manufactured goods of this country amount to £53,000,000, agricultural production to £38,000,000 , dairy produce to £19,000,000, wheat to £5,000,000, and mining to £23,000,000 . manufacturing industries of Australia give employment to about 317,000 persons; and, in the absence of our local markets, the farmers who are engaged in agriculture in Australia would suffer very severely.",26
109,Mr FALKINER,Unknown,Not at all.,26
110,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Not at all ? I am sure that the honourable member is not a real Protectionist. He cannot understand the Wheat . . Oats Barley Maize Hay Potatoes Onions Sugar Butter Bacon and Ham Poultry and Eggs . . Proportion per cent. The total production under these headings was £327,090,335, £62,210,607 was exported, £264,879,000 worth was consumed locally. That means that of the local production 19.2 per cent, was exported, and 80.98 per cent, consumed in Australia. Surely the pastoralist does not realise that if there was no local market-p-the market provided by these 317,000 workmen and their families-the agricultural produce, if sent abroad, would not bring anything like the price which it now brings! It would have to come into competition with that of European and other countries.",26

112,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"To the period from 1901 to 1910. question-wit h all due respect to himif he says that it would not be a bad thin g for the farmer if his local market were destroyed. I must prove my statement for his satisfaction. How can the case be proved? Take the total amount produced by the farmers of Australia for ten years. I may say that I am indebted for these figures to the late member for Wannon, Mr MCDougall, who obtained them from the Statistician's office. I am very Moreover, the sorry that Mr MCDougall was defeated.",26

114,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"We will take wheat. In round figures, the produce for ten years was £93,000,000 worth, of which we exported £41,000,000, and £51,000,000 were consumed locally. The following table gives the figures as to the various kinds of produce: - Production. Exports.

116,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Certainly ; the bigger the local market the better it is. What we have to realise is that every country will have to protect its local market. There was a time-7 0 or 80 years ago-whe n Britain had complete command of the manufacturing industries. Germany, France, Russia, Italy, Sweden, and other countries were customers of Britain. But what is the position today? Germany is a competitor of B r it a in ; and so, too, are France and Russia. Nearly all the countries I have mentioned are sending manufactured goods to Australia. That ought to prove to honourable members that it is necessary to conserve the local market.",26
117,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Y o u were saying that i was improper to increase it ; at the beginning of your speech you were denouncing immigration.,27
118,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I will not go into that matter now. There are one or two other matters on which I would have liked to speak, but my time is too limited. I am in favour of increasing the land tax. At the present time, the land-owner pays on an estate over £5,000 in value and up to £15,000 I d . in the £ 1 . Suppose that a man has an estate valued at £80,000. He pays 6d. in the £ 1 on £5,000, 5d. on £15,000, 4d. on £15,000, 3d. on £15,000, 2d. on £15,000, and I d . on £10,000. We made a great mistake in not framing the law so that a man with £80,000 worth of land should pay 6d. in the £ 1 on the total value, less the £5,000 exemption. That is a proposal which I make to honourable members if we get a chance of occupying the Treasury bench again, and my reason is that the land tax, although some honourable members have opposed it and complained about it , does not touch certain country in Queensland. ""There are certain towns like Clermont, in Capricornia, which are surrounded by the most beautiful land-lan d which, if it were in Victoria, near a railway, would bring £ 5 0 an acre, but which at present is valued at about £ 1 an acre, and escapes the land tax to a large extent. We want to increase the tax on the big estates, and compel the owners either to use them to better advantage or to let other persons use them. Some of the towns in the Western District, in Queensland, are unable to extend on account of the huge land monopoly, which cramps them in every way. I hope that we will get an opportunity of increasing the tax, and of making those gentlemen put their land to better use. I would, if I had the opportunity, amend the Constitution in several respects. I would alter the provision with regard to the Governor General, so that His Excellency should be, not a gentleman appointed from abroad, but an Australian born, or a person who had been resident here for a number of years. I take the view that the Australian boy ought to have an opportunity to work his way up to the highest position in the land, but that he cannot do at present. I agree with the Prime Minister when he saidIt seems to me that the better way to harmonize colonial with Imperial interests would be to allow the people of the colonies to select t a. Governor General of their own, who would be in touch with the aspirations of those people, who would know what their prejudices and aspirations are, and what their conditions of life are, more intimately and closely by reason of his having lived there a great number of years himself. No doubt it will be some time before the Constitution is altered in that respect. It will not be so altered in my time, probably, but, in my opinion, it will be altered some day, and an opportunity will be given to the Australian boy to work his way up to the top of the tree, and to some Australian girl to occupy the position of wife to the Governor General. I would make another alteration in the Constitution, and that is to provide for the nationalization of hospitals. I believe that the public would agree to the nationalization of hospitals and health. will At every hospital we ought to have doctors employed by the State. Under the present system there are thousands of doctors who have not enough to do, and really the incentive to the doctor is not to cure a patient. I do not want to do an injustice to an honourable profession, because there are thousands of doctors who do a great deal of work for the community and for poor persons without receiving any remuneration. It would be better for the doctors themselves, as well as for the community, if health were nationalized. We could better deal with the maternity allowance if the hospitals were nationalized. At the present time, no mother cares to go to a hospital, because a stigma of pauperism is attached to the fact, but if it were understood that the hospitals were State institutions, and that there was no lowering of a person's status in the community in going to a hospital, it would be better, I believe, for the community. The effect of the maternity allowance in Queensland has been, so I am informed, that some nurses, who used to charge £ 2 2s., have now in creased their fee to £ 5 5s. It may be that these aire isolated cases. I am sorry that I have no time to deal with the question of the cost of living and the fixing of prices; I shall have to wait for a future occasion. As I said, we as a party have no reason to feel disheartened at our removal from the Treasury bench. We may not be able to get back there for a few months, or, perhaps, for a few years, but I think the Capitalist party in Australia can rest assured that when 912,000 persons voted for the Labour party, with its advanced programme, in spite of abuse and misrepresentation, it is very unlikely indeed that the party who now hold the Treasury bench are going to stay there for any length of time.",27
119,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Maribyrnong) [4.26] I desire to make a few observations before I deal with the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition and the document which has been laid before the House by cne Government; I do not know whether to call it a statement of policy or not. Reference has been made to the length of this debate, but I find that in the first session of the first Parliament the House put up a record. In the session of 1901 the debate on the Address-in-Reply was spread over a period of four weeks. the session of 1910 the debate lasted from the 1st to the 19th July. In the session of 1911 the debate lasted from the 5th to 19th September, and was finished by you, sir, in magnificent style. In the session of 1912 the debate extended from the 19th June to the 11th July, or a period of three weeks aud two days. sion we have not yet reached the record of the last session of the last Parliament, but. by this evening we shall have occupied three weeks on this debate.",28
120,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,And the Opposition more numerous in this Parliament than it was in the last one.,28
121,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"That is so. that some of those who are complaining of the length of the present debate were the chief offenders in previous sessions in delaying the House from getting to business. In the session of 1912 their speeches covered 788 pages of Hansard, and I do not think that when the record of the present debate is made up, that record will be beaten.",28
122,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,And during the first week we had very short sittings.,28
123,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Yes . In addition, we have passed a Supply Bill , and quite a number of questions of great importance have been discussed.",28
124,Mr KELLY,Unknown,When does the honourable member think that we shall get to a vote ?,28
125,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I counted the number of honourable members upon this side of the Chamber who have not yet contributed to the debate, and, including the honourable member who has just resumed his seat, there is an even dozen. I do not know how many honourable members opposite intend to speak",28
126,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"A number of them wish to speak, but the Caucus will not allow them to do so.",28
127,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"In the first paragraph of the Government policy reference is made to the question of electoral reform. The Government, and the press which represents their views, have attempted to make a great deal of capital out of the few irregularities which occurred during the taking of the heaviest poll which has yet been recorded in the Commonwealth. At the general elections in 1903, I find that 887,312 electors exercised the franchise; at the 1906 elections, 1,059,168 electors voted; at the 1910 elections, 1,403,976 persons voted; and at the In recent elections, 2,030,000 electors voted. Thus, more than 600,000 votes were recorded in excess of the number registered on any previous occasion. Seeing that so many votes were cast, the marvel to me is that more mistakes were not made. I have no sympathy whatever with the charges of fraud which have been hurled In this ses- about promiscuously in connection with the recent elections. I quite agree with the utterance of the Leader of the Opposition, who, the moment those charges were formulated, declared .that he could is not for a moment believe that even a section of the people of Australia had suddenly become corrupt. It behoves us to I find think a good deal before we give expression to views which are calculated to place Australia in an improper light before the world. Occasionally we suffer from the publication of exaggerated views, and thus a distinct harm is done to the country in which we live. Other nations are much more careful in this respect. If they discover any defects in their business methods, or in their legislation, they endeavour to remedy those defects without proclaiming them to the world. But in Australia, if any slight defect be disclosed, for example, in connection w it 1, our export of produce, the press of this country, and sometimes even responsible Ministers, are inclined to publish them broadcast. Only a few persons can be blamed for theso offences, and they should be punished. But no industry should be penalized as the result of exaggerated statements. When I received the report of my scrutineer regarding the investigation which was held into the votes cast at the recent election for Maribyrnong, I at' once came to the conclusion that the charges of corruption, which had been circulated wholesale, were utterly without foundation. I found, for instance, that there was one elector in my constituency whose name was ticked off as having voted twice. He is one of the most respected clergymen in the. district. I am satisfied that he would never attempt to vote twice, and it would be absolute folly for any individual to attempt to impersonate such a well-known man. Another gentleman who is credited with having voted twice is a superintendent of police. The same remark is applicable to a sergeant of police, and to certain members of the Women's National League. I do not believe that any of these in dividuals voted twice, nor do I think that anybody attempted to impersonate them. But despite the disclosures made as the result of the inquiry into alleged electoral irregularities, the press of this State persists in declaring that there were 5,700 duplicate votes recorded. I say that in most of the investigations which have taken place, it has been conclusively proved that there was little or no duplication of votes, and that the charges made regarding electoral irregularities are i founded. In connection with the question of electoral reform, I propose to quote an extract from a speech which was delivered by the honourable member for Grampians a little while ago. That speech is reported in the AvocaFree Press and Farmers' and Miners' Journal, published in July of the present year. In passing, I would direct attention to the fact that si nee the general elections the honourable member has been very much in the company of the Prime Minister. At Kyneton the other night the Prime Minister was once more at a social gathering in company with the two Irvines. He saidThe two Irvines seem to gravitate together, and the more he saw of them, together or apart, the more he liked them. That is all very well. He may like them, and he may pay considerable regard to the suggestions which they make caucus. It is idle for honourable members opposite to deny that they meet caucus, because, as a matter of fact, they have already decided many of the most important questions which could be dealt with by a Caucus. The Mr Fenton. casual reference was made to this utterance by the honourable member for Grampians, who then stated that he was not sure that he had made the observations attributed to him, but as he was reported to have made them, he supposed that he must have done so. He saidAt the present time they had universal suffrage. If it was proved to work for the good of the people it would be all right. However, he thought it would be better to take the ratepayers' roll for electing members of Parliament. The man in the street should not have a vote if he is on the ratepayers' roll. The waster, the loafer, and the beer-sparrer should be debarred from voting. Why should such men be placed on the same standing as those who are industrious and a credit to the nation? I take serious objection to any such expression of opinion. In the very same hall, the honourable member for Kennedy and myself placed before the people of Avoca the true gospel, and dealt with the gentleman from whom those remarks emanated. I can assure honourable members that the people of that town do not appreciate expressions of opinion such as that which I have quoted. They believe in universal suffrage. They say that successive Parliaments have been elected upon that principle. I would like to know whether the Prime Minister is being l l - influenced in this connection by his association with the honourable member for Grampians, because I find that he is slipping from many of his old moorings. Of course, I am aware that during his career he has believed in almost everything in the political calendar, and believed in nothing long. Thus it comes about that whilst yesterday he may have believed in universal suffrage, today, under the influence of the two Irvines, he may be induced to introduce a franchise which will not be acceptable to the people, or he may be tempted to do damage to our old-age pension scheme. Out of the large number of honourable members to be found on the other side of the chamber, there are very few whom I would call Liberal. The great majority are Conservatives, and the only way in which they can inflict any damage upon the party with which I am associated is by limiting in the franchise. I believe that the expression of opinion which I have already in quoted is merely the murmur that we might expect to hear prior to a very pronounced proposal being placed before this Parliament. However, to be forewarned other night a is to be forearmed. I wish now to say a few words in reply to the statements of the honourable member for Riverina as to the amount of union funds which are spent for political purposes. Of course, I can speak with confidence only of the society to which I belong-the Melbourne Typographical Society. I want to tell the honourable member that in New South Wales there are some unions which are conserving their funds, and which are not applying them to political propaganda work. These unions do not contribute to any political f u n d . my recent election campaign, if there was any man who attempted to harass me, it was an out-and-out unionist. He had in his brain an exceptionally big Protectionist microbe, and he was constantly accusing me and my party of having neglected to revise the Tariff. There was no more bitter opponent of our party than this man, who professed, at any rate, to be a very pronounced unionist. The half-yearly balance-sheet of the Typographical Society shows that in 1907 our liquid assets amounted to only £3,705 , whereas in 1913 they had in creased to £10,300. I wish to endorse the statement that has been made by more than one honourable member of our party that, unless a man has been associated with a trade union, and understands, therefore, the principle that guides it , he cannot possibly interpret the actions or sayings of trade unionists. Honourable members opposite need to know something of the spirit of the movement. need to have gone through the mill-to have tasted of the boycott-to be able to appreciate what trade unionism really means. The Typographical Society has an unemployed allowance f u n d , of which it is proud, and out of that f u n d , since 1907, it has expended no less than £1,918 19s. 4d. Its total receipts, I may add, amount to £4,222. Whilst dealing with this subject, I think it appropriate to refer to the question of preference to unionists. I shall begin by quoting the views of one or two gentlemen who do not belong to our party. The first of these is Dr Rentoul, the Moderator of the Presbyterian General Assembly of Australia, who, when speaking at North Melbourne a few Sundays ago, gave expression to the following sentimentHe had no doubt that within fifty years every korking man would be in a union and a unionist.",28
128,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,He is a Christian.,30
129,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"He is, but not an optimistic Christian. An optimistic Christian would say that long before fifty years have elapsed every working man and woman in Australia-if they have any regard for their own interests-wil l be unionists.",30
130,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Sevent y per cent, of the workers in Denmark are unionists.",30
131,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I understand that is so. Dr Rentoul went on to sayIn The medical men were unionists, and even, the clergymen had a union, for they would not admit a man unless he was a good man. Gjreat economists stated that men should be trained to protect one another, and that could be done by being unionists. But the capitalists and the newspapers said that the freedom of the individual must not be interfered with. They did not say that so long as only the freedom of the poor man was being interfered with, but they said it now that the freedom of the rich man-the gentleman-wa s being interfered with. The freedom of the individual was being interfered with in a thousand different ways._ The freedom of the man who recently broke into a well-known gentleman's house was being interfered with. The gentleman referred to is one of the owners of a leading Melbourne newspaperTemperance reform, social reform, land reform, and health reform all interfered with the freedom of the individual. Surely it is time that we learnt that lesson. It should not be necessary for it to be constantly repeated,, that the freedom of the individual is interfered They with when the freedom of others is likely to be interfered with unless that be done. As they say in churches other than the Church of the Water L i l y - - "" No man liveth unto himself."" Another eminent churchman, Bishop Mercer, as recently as 27th July last, made an important statement on this question of trade unionism. His address was reported under the heading of "" Bishop's Remarkable Views."" I am very glad to know that many bishops and archbishops in this country, as well as other countries, are giving expression to exceptional views. Many of the most prominent and thoughtful bishops in the Old Land have been speaking of trade unionism as being practically next to Christianity in its elevating influence upon the human family. Bishop Mercer, in an address on "" Distributive Justice in the Rewards of Labour,"" said thatHe was an ardent trades unionist down to the ground. Mr KING O'MALLEY - He is a Christian crusader.",30
132,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I am not here to indulge in fulsome praise, but I am well within bounds in saying that Bishop Mercer is one of the brainiest men we have in Australia. Mr KING O'MALLEY - In the world.",31
133,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Yes . Both as an educationalist and as a theologian he can stand in any company. Dr Mercer went on to sayThere was a lot of talk about union tyranny, but it could not be taken much notice of. That is the advice that he tenders to honourable members opposite, who talk of tyranny on the part of unionsHe looked at it in the light that, while they had the same conflicting forces as at present, there was bound to be strife, but the view that the unionist could not have his own he could not account for, and never would champion. He did not agree with fixed rates of pay for equal hours of work. Workers were bound to do things in a wholesale way until they got what they deserved-recognitio n of their rights. He did not look upon the present system as the ultimate way of arriving at the value of services, but the trades unions were bound to continue in that way in spite of temporary injustice. Until they were able to bring a further delicacy of manipulation into their organizations, the way of arriving at distributive and getting over the present difficulty was free exchange in open market, and that was being prevented by the monopolies to which he was directly opposed, more particularly as they interfered with a man obtaining a living wage. There could be no better statement concerning preference to unionists and unionism generally than was expressed by these two eminent gentlemen. It is the custom for honourable members opposite, when addressing a way-back audience, to say that they have no quarrel with the unions, but that since their unionism has taken on a political aspect they are against it. "" As long as the trade unions tamper with politics,"" they say, ""we cannot conceive of its being a good thing."" I do not blame them for speaking in this way, but those who declare that it is only of late that trade unionism has assumed a political aspect cannot be familiar with the history of the movement. In Germany and Prance, the unions have a great deal to do with politics. That, however, is not the position in the United States of America. I believe that the great body of workers in America are not yet awake politically to their own interests, but that when they are alive to their true position and strength they will be able to send a President to the White House and to secure majorities in both Houses of Congress. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Nearly , all the Presidents of the United States of America, with the exception of Roosevelt and Washington, came from the working classes.",31
134,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Quite so. In the Argus of 16th ult., there was published a short criticism of an article entitled "" Socialism in the Colleges,"" which appeared in the Century Magazine. The first"" few lines of that criticism are as follow: The principles of Socialism are taking hold upon theminds of youth through teaching permitted or, in the name of "" academic freedom,"" actually encouraged, in our schools, colleges, universities, and even in theological seminaries. The schoolmaster is aboard, and the Leader of the Government might just as well endeavour, by means of the most dilapidated broom in Melbourne, to keep the tide from entering Hobson's Bay as try to prevent the onward march of the Labour party. Mr KING O'MALLEY - He knows that.",31
135,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Of course, he does. No justice thinking man who reads and studies the signs of the times could have a different view.",31
136,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,But would the honourable member describe the Prime Minister as a thinking man?,31
137,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"In this House we must be courteous. Our party's course has been mapped out on right lines, and the great mass of the people will surely swing behind it. Let me tell honourable members opposite, who claim to be the sole representatives of the farmers, that the day is not far distant when the farmers, too, will swing behind our party. Many intelligent farmers now say that the Labour party is the only intelligent national party in existence. During the 1911 campaign I met a gentleman whose name I can give- I believe he is still faithful to the cause-wh o had something interesting to say concerning the attitude of the farmers. I refer to a Mr English, who, at a public meeting at Traralgon, refuted some of the statements made by the Rev. F. C. Wood, an organizer of the Rural Producers' Association. At the close of an open-air meeting which I had been conducting in Traralgon, I met Mr English, who remarked that I seemed to have the idea that all the farmers voted against Labour. I replied that 1 did not entertain that view; that for the last seven or eight years my work had I refer to defence. been principally amongst farmers in toria and two other States, and that knew that some of the most advanced thinkers in the Commonwealth were to found in their ranks. This gentleman Australian. said that "" I do not want to boast, but master-General. I have one of the finest residences in ralgon, am one of the biggest buyers sellers of stock in the district, have farm of 2,000 acres, and have treated men a good deal better than is required under the conditions for which the rural ministration of the last Government. workers are asking. I find that I get better value for my money by doing so, since my men carry out their duties i way that is eminently profitable to me."" If an intelligent farmer is prepared te that in regard to the working of his holddid. ing, what do honourable members opposite mean by proposing to lay cruel hands upon the Conciliation and Arbitration A and to tear out of it the right which i gives to the rural workers to go to the Arbitration Court? I do not know whether this threat is so much "" window dressing,"" but I can hardly imagine even the most Conservative representative rural constituency denying the right of any member of the community to any Court in the land. Honourable members opposite would have just as much right to try to close the doors Supreme Court, the County Court, or our police courts to the rural workers as they have to close the door of the Arbitration Court to them. If there is above all others to which the rural worker should have access, it is that which something to do with the fixing of his wages and conditions of employment. hope, therefore, that this threat on the part of the Government will out. If they attempt to give effect to it they will go to their doom. A f t e r it will prove to be a good spade with order. which to excavate their own political tomb. I can only say to them, "" Keep on using the same kind of spade, and you will soon dig a political grave big enough to bury the lot of y o u . "" I do not believe that the rural producers favour the platform submitted. friend Mr English says, "" I always vote for the Labour party, because I believe to be the only democratic party in polisoon tics."" I now touch upon another subject. In one sense, it is not altogether congenial to me, though in another it is ; I regret very much Victhat the suspicion has got into my mind I that there are members of this Government- I do not accuse the whole party be opposite-wh o are exceptionally antiI do not say it of the PostFor the first time, so Trafar as I know, since defence has been beand fore the Commonwealth Parliament, it a has been made the football of party polimy ticians, Ministers trying, though unsuccessfully, to expose mistakes in the adI think that it is generally agreed that we shall never have a man at the head of the n a Defence Department who can more thoroughly understand our defence policy, or say administer it better, than Senator Pearce If there is any question that should be kept out of party politics it is defence. Our defence system is not yet perfect, c t there being very many rough corners to t be rounded off, but it is a wrong thing to make it the football of party politics.",31
138,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Hear , hear!",32
139,Mr FENTON,Unknown,I blame the present Ministry for having done this for the first of a time in our history.,32
140,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The honourable go before member would say anything.,32
141,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"So would the Prime Minister; only I say what is true, and he of the does not always do so.",32

143,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member for Maribyrnong must one Court withdraw what he said.,32
144,Mr FENTON,Unknown,I do so. It is a has strange thing that as soon as the Prime Minister enters the chamber there is a I conflict with the Chair.,32

146,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"I ask the all, Prime Minister to assist me in keeping",32
147,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Our defence scheme is being made the sport of party politicians.,32
148,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,They are anti-Australians.,32
149,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Yes , and in other Our matters also. The last Government supplied an Australian-made tractor for use it in the Federal Capital Territory, but as as this Government came into power the machine was pronounced to be useless, because it was Australian made. Ministers bold that nothing good can be made in Australia. Therefore, this tractor has been set aside, and the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs is derisive in his references to it . I saw the tractor in a trial pull twice the load that its makers guaranteed it to pull. It pulled a load of about 30 tons down and up an embankment. But since the change in the administration of the Home Affairs Department, this Australian-made machine has been set aside. I do not make a charge against any particular officer, but I believe that there is a strong inclination in the Department to have imported articles, and it is to the credit of the late Minister that in this matter, as in others, he always insisted, if prices were anything like reasonable, upon ordering the Australian article. The Australian Government should patronize as much as it can locally-made machinery and local manufactures generally. In the trial which I saw at Queanbeyan, the tractor did its work admirably. If it has since gone wrong, some one must have tampered with it, or fault has been found with it because the Ministry is anti-Australian. Mr KING O'MALLEY - They through the Molonglo after we were there, and got the boxes spoiled.",32
150,Mr FENTON,Unknown,Eve n a Minister who desires to do all he can for Australian industries is frequently baffled by his officials. We have officers who seem to have no love for Australian-made goods.,33
151,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,I think it will be found that they are nearly all like that.,33
152,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"In one or two instances that have come under my notice, Ministers have had a great battle to get Australian-made articles used. the reasons why I think some of the present Ministers are not very favourable to our defence system is that it does not carry out true Australian ideas. The meanest proposal ever made in any Parliament was the borrowing of £3,500,000 to build a Dreadnought to be presented to the Old Country. That proposal was similar to the action of a young man in saying to his mother, "" Lend me the money, so that I may make you a present."" The Dreadnought so given was to be made is Great Britain, and manned, as far as possible, with British sailors. There are few enough British sailors in British waters and in the Mediterranean, and it is time that Australia, with 8,000 miles of coastline, trained sailors for herself. It is to the credit of the Labour Government that they did everything that could be done for our defence, and especially for our naval defence. But it was the opinion of some of our opponents, members of previous Governments, that everything required for naval defence should be obtained from the Old Country, and that the ships we paid for should be kept in British waters. The elections of 1910, however, showed that the opinion of the people was that we should have an Australian Navy, manned with Australians, and kept in Australian waters. The Dominion of New Zealand thinks that by presenting a Dreadnought to the Old Country it is doing what it should for the defence of the Empire; but, in my opinion, no part of the Empire will be doing its best for the common interest if it merely has ships made in Great Britain, to be manned with British sailors, and to be kept in British waters. If there is one thing that has helped our naval defence scheme, it is that we have made it an Australian scheme, having our vessels, as far as possible, made here, to give employment to Australian workmen, and ran ib manning them with Australian men and lads. The decision of the Labour Government to have gunboats and destroyers made in Australia has given a great impetus to our ship-building. At Williamstown today there is a first class, well-found dock. I was at the opening of it , and it was then stated that there were orders in band which would keep it going for a period of two years. The Victorian Government took upon themselves the construction and equipment of that dock, because, without it , Melbourne was not in a posiOne of tion to take contracts from the Federal Government, and business was going to Sydney, because of the opportunities for docking offered by the Fitzroy Dock. The construction of the Williamstown Dock is now giving occupation to a number of workmen in the construction of dredges; and the labe much-abused Minister of Trade and Customs, who is said not to have done anything in the interests of local manufacturers, placed such a duty on dredges that in future nearly all required in Australia will have to be made here. That, and the naval ship-building policy of the late Government, have given a great impetus to the Australian ship-buildiiig trade. We have, therefore, done something.",33
153,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,What ?,34
154,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I ask if the honourable member, or any other, knows of a Parliament which has placed so many measures of far-reaching importance on the statute book as did this Parliament with the Labour Government in power.",34
155,Sir ROBERT BEST,Unknown,But what the Tariff?,34
156,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I am afraid that we shall not have a Tariff this session. The honourable member for Kooyong, now that he represents a very different electorate from his old Fitzroy electorate, might, if he liked, be returned as a Free Trader, and is probably not so ardent a Protectionist as he was.",34
157,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,He has got Free Trade leader.,34
158,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"We are told that we are to have a Tariff from the Free Trade party, but before a Tariff can be introduced another Parliament will have been elected, and I trust that the Labour party will have an opportunity to give effect to the promise it made to the electors during the recent campaign, that if the referendum proposals were defeated it would introduce a Tariff. Labour party been returned with a majority of one, that Tariff would have been already introduced.",34

162,Mr FENTON,Unknown,There are greater barriers on that side in the way of Tariff reform.,34
163,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,I have never been returned to this House as a Free Trader.,34
164,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"When the Tariff voting has been analyzed, it has been found that some of the much denounced Free Traders have given better Tariff votes than some of the so-called effective Protectionists. I wish now to draw attention to a statement in a sub-leader of a newspaper that does not often speak kindly of the Labour party; I refer to the Age. In its issue of the 27th August last, after stating that there had been a considerable fight to overcome the feeling that it would be better to borrow money and build ships in Britain , man them with British seamen, and keep them in British waters, than to have an Australian Navy, a writer continuedThus was the principle of Dominional naval self-development reluctantly conceded- a principle that has steadily increased in vigour and vitality from that day to this. As to the latter fact, the Australian Labour party is undoubtedly about deserving of much credit. Our national naval policy originated in Liberal thought, it is trueI question that very much. ",34
165,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"If the honourable member is referring to universal training, I point out that the honourable member for West Sydney, in season and out of season, when he received much abuse behind a Mr. JOSEPH COOK - And we point to Lt - Colonel Crouch.",34
166,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"As a matter of fact, the honourable member for West Sydney received much opposition from members of unions with which he was connected, but, with true Welsh courage, he fought on until today, principally as the result of his agitation and clear exposition of the position, we have universal training in Australia. In this regard, I am not preHad the pared to concede to the Liberal party our national naval policy or any other policy. The newspaper article proceedsbut no Liberal Government had ever troubled fiction. to do ought to advance it from the dialectical to the practical sphere, beyond ear-marking a trifling sum of £250,000. I remind the honourable member for Kooyong that we are not dialectical giants, who can argue with the eloquence of the lawyer. But while honourable members the opposite might be dialectically strong, they are not practical men; and, as the newspaper points out, although they made a lot of talk about the Navy, the credit remains with the Labour party of putting the scheme into actual operation. These remarks are in a newspaper which is bitterly opposed to us as a party. As soon as the first Fisher Government came into power orders were sent out, within two months, for two destroyers; such is the practical turn of the Labour mind.  a half truth .",34
167,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I leave that to the honourable member and the writer of the article, who is better disposed towards him than, possibly, towards myself, and the honourable member has a better chance of getting his ear.",34
168,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,The Labour party have certainly proved its ability to spend money!,35
169,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Of the great expenditure, about which some of our friends opposite speak, some £13,000,000 has gone into the defence scheme. I ask the honourable member for Echuca and others whether their present position is part and parcel of the retrenchment scheme which we are told is on the boards- a scheme to cut down the expenditure on defence ?",35
170,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,It is our duty to that we get value for the money expended.,35
171,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"That is a very roundabout way of putting it . Listen to thisLabour was more energetic. It seized the first possible opportunity presented by a fortuitous rise to power-it was then in a minority in Parliament-to spend the money on Australian warships; and later, when returned to office by the people with a majority of both Houses, it enforced a policy of naval construction and expenditure which has committed both parties in Parliament probably for all time adequately to subserve the national ambition. The great value of this virile action on Labour's part lies in the circumstance that it was timely to forestall a powerful Conservative movement which had been inaugurated with the covert object of preventing the growth of Colonial navies. That is what I am suspicious of to-daythat there is a powerful Conservative movement at work. I fancy I see some evidence of that movement in the dismissal of men at Cockburn Sound, and the finding f a u l t with the Pitzroy - in picking little holes in the scheme carried out by one of the most intelligent and energetic men who has ever presided over a Defence Department. I firmly beAustralian, lieve that if it came to electing a manent Minister of Defence, Senator Pearce would be chosen by an overwhelm1910 ing majority of the people of the country. The Australian Labour party has been confronted by this Conservative movei ment, which tried to do away with our Navy; but we have fought it successfully for three years, and will continue to it . We are "" o u t "" for an Australian Navy in Australian waters to co-operate with the Imperial vessels of Canada, New Zealand, and on the China station. The newspaper article continuesFinding themselves unable to resist Australia's demand for a local navy, Tory circles in Britain and the Dominions conceived the bright idea of indefinitely postponing the projected new by raising the question of Imperial Federation. I am afraid that a great number of orable members opposite are afflicted with that particular microbe. Judging by the initia l actions of some of the men in charge of the works at present, as well as of the Minister who presides over the Department, I believe that, instead of friends, we have enemies to the defence system in the Cabinet. The Liberal party have made defence the football of party politics, and this it has no right to be. The Sydney Morning Herald of 23rd August, 1913, contained the following : Our best reason for saying that Australia will succeed with her navy is that she has wisely see made it a privilege for any boy to be trained for the fleet. Parents know well that the Australian Navy offers a boy a career far more full of promise than any career that will probably be open to him ashore. It gives him pay, with allowances, a little above the average of the shore trades. Ahead of him in the service are avenues leading to thoroughly well-paid posts-possibl y even to high command. I am very glad of that. I am proud of the fact that I have parents in my constituency whose lads have joined the Navy, and some of them, though comparatively young in years, are likely, if one may judge from an amateur stand-point, to achieve high distinction. I hope that in the not distant future we may have our own Australian captains and admirals, for, with such a large coast-line to defend^ we must do everything possible for our Navy. During their three years of office the Labour Government spent nearly £13,000,000 on defence; and here I may explain that I am not speaking in any Dock Jingoistic sense. It must be admitted that many mistakes have been made in the initia l stages; but, if we are to have a defence system at all, let it be purely for such is better for the E mperpire as a whole. The total expenditure in the three years was £12,526,000. In there were 25,055 junior cadets, and in 1913 there were 53,141. Of senior cadets we had 10,597 in 1910, and 89,720 n 1913. The militia number 33,000, the rifle clubs 50,000, and the Naval Forces 3,400, or a total, naval and military, fight of 229,281. That is an achievement of which we all ought to be justly proud, and I hope and trust that defence matters will be kept out of party politics. Should a common danger threaten us, we should at once drop our political weapons and take up others, in order to offer a common defence. That is the sentiment that ought always to prevail, and I am rigime exceptionally suspicious that some movements are creeping into the schemehonthough I hope it is not so-that may prove inimical to it . But I tell those on the Ministerial Benches that they had better mind their P's and Q's, or they themselves, by their Indiscreet action, may wreck all that has been so laboriously constructed.",35
172,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,What honourable member suggest is going on ?,36
173,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I have indicated a few things already. We hear little murraurings; and it would appear that the chief occupation of some of the Ministers is to go back over the files of the past three years to see what has been done, or left undone. What would have been said if the Ministers who came into power in 1910 had adopted a similar - course, and gone over the files of the previous nine years, during which, with one or two short intervals, the Liberals were in power ? What would they have found ? But the Labour Government would not do that kind of t h in g ; it is work of a .lowdown detective employed by a low-down man. Instead of resorting to such methods, they set to work in a practical way. They never thought of looking for - alight errors, but, without resorting to - trumpery, mean, contemptible actions, they sought to carry into effect the desires of Parliament. What if an error was made .at Cockburn Sound, or at Fitzroy Dock ? I do not admit that there were any errors, but what would such - errors be in an expenditure £13,000,000 ? As I have said, we have a 'total of 229,281 cadets and men, trained and partly trained, to defend this country. On the naval side, in 1909, three torpedo boats were suggested, and then the Defence Conference took place. Senator Pearce was selected to go as the representative of Australia, but another Government came into power, - Colonel Foxton was sent.",36
174,Mr ANSTEY,Unknown,On e of the things ever done I,36
175,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,But did not the people punish Colonel Foxton?,36
176,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"T r u e ; but I do not wish to say anything about that. In 1.910, a request was made that Admiral Henderson should come to Australia in order to examine our coast and forts, and advise us as to the naval defence of the - country. We may presume that the I m perial Government sent out one of the finest Admirals in the Navy; and any one, especially a non-practical man like the new Minister, should be particularly oareful before endeavouring to upset the scheme of one with a life's training in this particular work. In 1910, when the Fisher Government came into power, there were 1,240 men in the Navy, and at present there are 3,400, showing a fairly does the respectable force. The Australia is almost in our waters, and there are also the Mel-, bourne, the Sydney, the Yarra, the Parramatta, the Warrego, and several other boats, including the Torrens, the Swan, and the Derwent, at present in course of construction. W it h the other vessels that have been given by, or bought from, the Imperial Government, we shall, when our battleship arrives, have the strongest fleet there ever has been in these waters for the defence of Australia. This is largely the result of the manner in which the Labour Government have carried on the defence administration? We have at Port Stephens, in New South Wales, at Cockburn Sound, in Western Australia, and in other parts of the continent, ports which are eminently suitable for naval bases. If a word of mine can have any influence with this Government, I venture to tell them that the sooner they make suitable provision for our big ships on the western side of Australia the better it will be. The stoppage of the works at Cockburn Sound was a great mistake. To-day there is only one of place in the whole of Australia where it will be possible to dock our big battle ship. Sydney is the only port to which she could go for repairs in case of accident. According to Admiral Henderson's report, backed up by the opinions of men who are entitled to express an opinion, it is absolutely essential that we should have a naval base at Cockburn Sound. The work should be carried forward as expeditiously as possible. I hope and the Treasurer will insist upon it being pushed ahead. I do not care to see men dirtiest thrown out of employment when there is useful and necessary work to be done.",36
177,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,We want to dredge the channel before the base could be of any use.,36
178,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I am quite satisfied that the completion of that naval base is a necessary work, and much can be done in base construction at Cockburn Sound. We have had another exhibition of the anti-Australian spirit in connection with wireless telegraphy. We have, in the person of Mr Balsillie, a man who, though perhaps not possessed of as wide a reputation as some of the other wireless experts of the world, is yet, I believe, as far as his knowledge of wireless is concerned, as good an expert as we could possibly obtain. He has proved his ability by introducing many new features. I regret that the Court saw fit to order - an examination to be permitted of the Commonwealth wireless apparatus. understand that photographs and moulds have been taken of parts of our equipment.",36
179,Mr RILEY,Unknown,Surely not.,37
180,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I am told that that has been done, in accordance with the order of the Court. I am not here to dispute the right of the Court to give such a decision, but, nevertheless, I believe, with Mr Justice Isaacs, that this is one .of those State secrets which no one had any right to pry into. It is, I say, another exhibition of the anti-Australian feeling. We have the same spirit exhibited by the Attorney-General of this Commonwealth, who has accepted a general retainer from the Marconi Company, which is fighting the Commonwealth. That is an indication that the present Government are callous and in different to the true interests of Australia. Otherwise they would not permit their Attorney-General to hold a general retainer enabling him to come in between them and their bounden duty to the Comm on wealth. I shall say nothing about the Small Arms Factory, the Clothing Factory, the Woollen Factory, and the other Commonwealth enterprises of the k in d ; but I wish to make a remark upon an official reply given the other day to the effect that it was impossible for the Clothing Factory to take in hand some work in connection with the post office, because it already had so much defence work on its hands. Nevertheless, I hear that some women employed at the factory have been given holidays because there is not enough work for them to do.",37
181,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"That is policy, and it is characteristic of the other side.",37
182,Mr FENTON,Unknown,It is a policy that I do not care about. I do not see how the statement made by the Minister elsewhere can be reconciled with the facts.,37
183,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,How member of this Government tell the truth ?,37
184,Mr FENTON,Unknown,I admit that that is a difficult hurdle for any one of them to get over.,37
185,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,They give no evidence of a desire to do so.,37
186,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I have a few remarks to make with regard to statements made by the Prime Minister when he was Leader of the Opposition in reference to Commonwealth finance. During the elecI tion campaign the honourable gentleman addressed a meeting in the Gippsland electorate. I say at the outset that the Leader of the Opposition, during an election, is the next important man to the Prime Minister, and he ought to be just as careful in his utterances. Defamatory statements made from public platforms by prominent public men are calculated to do serious in j u r y to Australian interests abroad, and I maintain that we are justified in challenging those public men when they make random assertions. Surely, notwithstanding all our party feeling, there is some little amount of patriotism l e ft in our composition.",37
187,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,Look at the wicked things that the honourable member has been saying about me and my colours in connection with the postage stamp. They cut me up terribly.,37
188,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I may tell the Postmaster-General that I know so little about racing that I am not even aware of what his racing colours are. During the election campaign, as I have said, the Prime Minister addressed a meeting in Gippsland. I do not blame the honourable member for that electorate so much for certain misstatements which he made, in view of the example set to him by his leader. The Prime Minister was reported in the Argus of 6th February to have saidDuring each year of its existence it had over £4,000,000 more revenue from the States than the previous Liberal Government. Not satisfied with that, the Labour party then proceeded to levy a land lax, which in three years gave them an additional £4,000,000 sterling. All told, the present Ministry had £18,000,000 of money a Yes-No more than their predecessors, and they were finishing up the year with a deficit of £1,500,000. They certainly spent their money like toffs. The honourable gentleman went on to sayOne result of the expenditure had been a tremendous increase in the Public Service. About 20,000 persons had been added to the Commonwealth pay roll, yet every one of the new entercould any prises were under the patronage of Ministers. They wanted to keep the appointments under their own control, and they would not let the Public Service Commissioner have anything to do with them. The result was about 17,000 persons were under the Public Service Commissioner, and, excluding the Defence, about 23,000 persons were in the direct pay of the Government itself. The land tax represented another £ 1 9s. per head. If there were added to those amounts the increase of the States' taxation of 6s., the total represented £ t 15s. That was the statement made by the present head of the Government when he was Leader of the Opposition. that a man, for party purposes, will go into a country town and say things which he knows to be absolutely not in accordance with fact? The Prime Minister had the same opportunities as were open to me of finding out the true state of the finances at this time. Moreover, he was exceptionally fortunate in having a powerful press behind him. A special correspondent of the Argus attended him in Gippsland, and if he was misreported, he had ample opportunities of correcting the error. What I complain about is that at the very time when the honourable gentleman said that the Fisher Government were going to finish the financial year with a deficit of a million and a half, there was actually in the Treasury an accumulated surplus of over £2,000,000. I cannot blame the honourable member for Gippsland, who, as already shown, made statements which were seriously calculated to misrepresent the position, when we find his leader committing himself to assertions of this kind. As honourable members are aware, the financial year finished with a £2,400,000. That was admitted by the present Treasurer when he introduced his first Supply Bill after the elections. Consequently, the Prime Minister was about £3,500,000 out in his Gippsland statement.",37
189,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The member is entirely misrepresenting me.,38
190,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I have quoted from a report in the Argus, which had a special reporter at the honourable gentleman's meeting. T complain that when glaring mistakes of this kind are pointed out, the Prime Minister has not the political manliness to put the facts right for the benefit of the public.",38
191,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I made no take.,38
192,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"The honourable member made a very serious one, which, in my judgment, did much to injure Australian credit.",38
193,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,If it was not a mistake it must have been something worse. [31],38
194,Mr FENTON,Unknown,There was nothing but a campaign of mendacity maintained by honourable members opposite during the election.,38
195,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Honourable members over there are all George Washingtons.,38
196,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"The statement made Why is it - by the Prime Minister as to the Public Service contained a half truth of the kind that is often more misleading than a bold, bald lie. He said that 20,000 persons had been added to the Commonwealth pay-sheet, every one of whom was under the patronage of Ministers. That was a distinctly inaccurate statement. I should characterize it in stronger language if permitted by the forms of the House. He asserted that the late Government wanted to keep the appointments under their own control, and would not let the Public Service Commissioner have anything to do with them. That was a most misleading statement for a responsible man to make. What are the true facts? As soon as I noticed this statement in the press, I put myself in communication with a source from which I could obtain reliable information, and obtained particulars as to how many temporary and how many permanent public servants there were under the Public Service Commissioner who had been appointed in accordance with the Public Service Act , and the reply I got from the office of the. surplus of Public Service Commissioner was that over 29,000 permanent and temporary hands were under his control. Why, then, should the Leader of the Opposition, who knew the facts as well as I did, say that. 17,000 persons were under the control of the Commissioner, and 20,000 under the honourable patronage of the Government? It may be unparliamentary to say it , but I do say that it was a mean, contemptible statement to make.",38
197,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Order !,38
198,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I say still that it is substantially true.,38
199,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member was quite correct in saymis- ing that it is an unparliamentary statement, and I ask him to withdraw it .",38
200,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I said, sir, that it may be unparliamentary to say it , but I withdraw the statement. I believe in looking first after my country's interests. It is better by far to study the true interests of this country than to go about making malicious statements which have no foundation.",38
201,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I made no statements.,39
202,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"The honourable member, who was then Leader of the Opposition, said there were 20,000 temporary hands employed by the Commonwealth who were immediately under the control and patronage of the Fisher Government. Such a statement is not true, because the report of the Public Service Commissioner, which, strange to say, was issued about two days afterwards, proved conclusively that there were under his cont r o l , and appointed in accordance with the Public Service Act, 23,000 employees.",39
203,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,You said before.,39
204,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I am wrong: the number is 29,272. I am very glad to have that correction.",39
205,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,You are wrong altogether.,39
206,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"If the lionorable member will turn up the report of the Commissioner, he will find out that he deals with 29,272 employees. There is a very great difference between 29,000 and 17,000, and the remaining 12,000, let me tell the honourable member, as he already knows quite well, are appointed by clerks of works.",39
207,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,There is no contradiction in the figures at all. You do not understand them.,39
208,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Soo n after my advent to this House, I found out exactly what the honourable member was, and I have never tried to understand him since. I never can, and I hope I never will, and, what is more, I hope I shall never be guilty of emulating him in many of the misstatements he makes.",39
209,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I made no statements.,39
210,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"The honourable member said that out of 40,000 employees in the Public Service, 20,000 were under the control of the Ministry.",39
211,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Did I?,39
212,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"The honourable member is reported to have said so, and I am now giving a statement of the facts. I u the space of an hour, I obtained a correct statement of the position.",39
213,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"There is wrong with the figures, but there is with .the honourable member.",39
214,Mr FENTON,Unknown,The day has gone by when the honourable member could desuch ceive any one here by that kind of chatter.,39
215,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,You do not understand the figures.,39
216,Mr FENTON,Unknown,I do not understand the honourable member. He is one of the un-understandable individuals.,39
217,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,That is why you are able to criticise me so intelligently ?,39
218,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I do criticise the honourable member's figures when they tell against Australia. He said, I repeat, that the land tax represented another £ 1 9s. per head. If we got £ 1 9s. per head from the people of the Commonwealth, 29,000 we should have a revenue of £6,670,000 .",39

220,Mr FENTON,Unknown,When ?,39
221,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,G o and look.,39

225,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! I cannot permit this conversation to go on. Will the lionorable member please address the Chair ?,39
226,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I am trying to do so, sir. I will leave that unsavoury subject. I do not care to pursue this line of criticism, but when I find a leading politician making statements which are detrimental to the best interests of this country,.

We have heard very much talk about the farmers from the other side. quite a number of farming friends in Victoria, and am in almost constant correspondence with them. I have now quite a number of farmers in my constituency. The honourable member for Wannon the other day talked about giving me a tumble on his hay-stack. I do not know if he has a hay-stack, but if he wants to see a good hay-stack he had better come to my constituency. have there the best hay-stacks and stackbuilders that are to be found in this State.",39
230,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,Was the hay grown by you?,40
231,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"The last stack I had anything to do with was a lucerne stack. I helped to build one a little while ago, and I think that my operations in this direction were much more recent than were those of the honourable member. I have here a letter which I received from a farmer, and, thinking that some honourable member might want to make it the property of the House, I took the precaution of cutting out the signature and the name of the place where it was written. Talking about the result of the elections, the writer saysIt is a hard knock, but might easily have been worse considering the way the press acted and that terrible "" rural workers' log."" The poor farmer couldn't swallow that, but I am sure that we need not begrudge the others all the joy they can get out of the present situation. I did my best here, and, considering it is a farming district, I was delighted with the result :-Liberal , 62 votes; Labour, 50. This letter comes from a nice little farmfarmers, ing centre.

The writer continuesHowever, better luck next time; of that I am certain. I am enclosing a note which arrived two days after the elections. It was sent to all wool producers and speaks for itself. They took good care it did not get out while the referendum was before the people. thought the deliberations of the Chamber of Commerce, as reported in the Age of rgth June, rather ""-ood after turning down the referendum.

There are, I understand, some honourable members who are very prominently identified with the Farmers and Settlers Association of New South Wales. two matters have come up before that association which, I think, ought to be stated here. I believe that the farmers were asked to consider whether something could be done to bring in legislation to protect the tenant farmer, but they turned down the proposition, because a majority felt that the time was not opportune to introduce such legislation. The following statement was made on that occasion by Mr G. F . Oram, of MudgeeHe was a sheep farmer on another man's land for five years. It was sold. He could not purchase it, but it brought £13 an acre, and then he continued on it, and in ten years he bought it for £40 an acre-the high price being largely on account of the improvementSi-so that he paid twice for his own improvements.",40
237,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"He must have made a bit out of it , too.",41
238,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"It is very evident that the owner got a big bit out of Mr Oram when he sold the land, and that is, I suppose, one of the greatest barriers to men of moderate means getting on the soil. The position taken up by Mr . Oram is one which is right. item comes from the Wagga district, where farmers are advocating what I have thought of for years. As many lionorable members know, my business for seven or eight years lay with the farmers and dairymen of Victoria and other States. The Marra branch of the Farmers and Settlers Association resolved, on the 1st AugustThat in the interest of the branch no person but a bond fide farmer shall be admitted to the membership. I was glad to note this resolution, but let honourable members listen to the remarks of the moverFarmers regard this motion as a move in the right direction, for many persons have been admitted to the association whose sympathy lies in the farmer's pockets and not in his welfare. That is my belief, too. I have attended a number of farmers' conventions, and one would have to do a bit of pin-pricking to find any farmers. One will find there a number of squatters, graziers, and storekeepers. These are the men who have leisure to attend these gatherings. These are the men who profess - to formulate a programme for the working farmers. The resolution passed by the Marra branch is a step in the right direction. The farmers do not want anybody but bond fide farmers in the ranks of the association, and they are quite right, too, One or because, as they say, there are very many persons getting into the association who are farming the farmers instead of being farmers themselves. There are many other items on which I intended to address the House, but as I have only a few minutes left now I must leave them for another occasion. I have been talking as fast as I possibly could. I had in tended to deal with the Tariff. I have dealt slightly with preference to unionists. I was going to say something about the bank, too. The honourable member for Macquarie said the other day that he would gladly contribute to some contributory form of insurance. That would be all very well for a man who had money in his pocket. The people who would principally benefit by an insurance scheme, if it can be so called, are those who already contribute to the revenue we have for expenditure. The private wealth of Australia is about £1,000,000,000, yet 8,500 persoas own £810,000.000, leaving Another £190,000,000 for the rest of the community. I had these figures prepared by one of the best actuaries in the Victorian Statistician's office. I am in formed on the highest authority that we draw from Customs and Excise about £15,000,000, and those persons who own only a fifth of the wealth of this community contribute £12,000,000. When they are contributing the bulk of the revenue, if there is anything to be done for those who are not so well circumstanced, surely they can draw a little of that revenue which they themselves principally contribute, instead of being called upon to put their hands into their pockets still more. Whilst four-fifths of the wealth resides with one-fifth of the population, it is wrong to ask the poorer classes of the community to contribute to any f u n d of that kind.",41
239,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order 1 The honourable member's time has expired.,41
240,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Hunter) [6.11 - It has been claimed that this debate should be brought to a termination on the ground that it constitutes a waste of time. I do not regard it in that light. The position in this Chamber is, in my opinion, unprecedented. The Prime Minister has stated that never before has a Government had a no-confidence motion launched against it so soon after a general election. Probably there are reasons for that. But in the present instance we find the Prime Minister himself publicly stating that whilst he is in office he is not in power, thus admitting that he is not able to control the destiny of this country. In my judgment, if he did the right thing, he would send us to our masters-the people-and allow them to decide which party is to govern the Commonwealth. Every honourable member has a perfect right to place his views before the electors, who, despite the intention of the Government to hang on to office as long as possible, will, in the near future, determine which of the two political forces now facing each other is to dominate Australia. To-day both parties are equally divided on the floor of this chamber. know that the Prime Minister thinks that a dissolution of this House would be unsatisfactory, and that he desires to secure a double dissolution. But I am afraid he will experience considerable difficulty in reaching that goal. If he is prepared to remain on the Treasury bench until he can secure a double dissolution, I am inclined to think that the people will .appraise his Government at their true value. What is the use of the honourable gentleman arguing that his party secured a majority of the votes recorded throughout the Commonwealth at the recent general elections ? What effect will that have upon the Senate ? The Constitution provides the manner in which the other Chamber shall be elected, and we know that the so-called Liberal party there went to the country eleven strong and were returned only seven strong. That - clearly shows that under the Constitution the electors are not in favour of the party which now occupies the Treasury bench. That is the only comparison we can institute from the stand-point of the Senate. Consequently, the sooner we permit the electors to decide which party in this House shall hold the reins of office, the better it will be for all concerned. If the Government were returned with a working majority, it would be tantamount to an instruction to the Senate to pass legislation which had been approved by this House. When the Prime Minister - complains that honourable members upon this side of the Chamber have occupied too much time in debating the no-confidence amendment upon the Address-in-Reply, he forgets that previous discussions of a similar character have occupied quite as long. Personally, I see not the slightest foundation for the honourable gentleman's complaint. But there is an evident desire on his part to induce the people to believe that the Labour party are holding up the government of the country, when, as a matter of fact, we are merely doing what other parties have done previously in this House. Without this opportunity of placing our views before the electors, the latter would not be able to judge of the merits of the rival political parties. What we are doing is actually what the Prime Minister himself invited us to do. Does he imagine that he can put forward a statement of Ministerial policy which practically challenges the legislation that has been enI acted at the instance of the Labour party, and that the members of that party will quietly sit down and accept his dictum? As watchdogs of the public, it is our duty to stand up and tell him that we are prepared to accept this challenge and to fight him. Had he desired to remain in office, and to avoid the necessity for holding another election, he could have introduced plenty of measures the consideration of which would have fully employed this Chamber, without interfering with the legislation which we have enacted, and as to the repeal of which he has received no mandate from the people. In the no confidence motion which has been submitted, the Government are indicted upon four counts. It is the duty of honourable members to confine their remarks, as far as possible, to that indictment. The motion declares that the Government(1) propose to destroy the beneficial character of our social and industrial laws; (2) indicate no intention of taking such steps as will reduce the high cost of living; and (3) fail to realise the urgent necessity of an immediate revision of the Tariff. With regard to the first count, is there an honourable member who will urge that it is not correct? Are not the Government endeavouring to interfere with our industrial laws ? In spite of their professed desire to give equality of opportunity to all classes, do they not propose to deprive certain classes of their liberty ? Do they not intend to prevent the President of the Arbitration Court from granting a preference to unionists? I do not know of any honourable member sitting upon the other side of the House who told the people at the last election that it was proposed to repeal that section of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act which makes the granting of a preference to unionists optional with the Judge. In what cases has this preference to be refused? Only in cases where an industrial union, either directly or indirectly, supplies funds for political purposes. On the other hand, industrial unions which do not contribute to a fund for political purposes, and whose mission it is to destroy the legitimate unions which have been established for years, may apply for registration under the Act and thus obtain a preference for their members. We have an example of that in the Independent Workers Union which has been avowedly created to assist the employers of the Commonwealth. Blackwood, a former president of the Employers Federation, has openly told the people of Great Britain that the Independent Workers Union was formed for the purpose of assisting the employers to destroy the existing unions. He pointed out that they could place men who chose to apply at certain bureaux, and who were prepared to join that particular organization. This union may be registered under the Arbitration Act, and may cite a case before the Court. The Judge will then have the right to grant a preference to a bogus union. Yet, under the legislation which the Government propose, the legitimate unionist, who has borne the heat and burden of the day, will be denied a preference merely because he contributes Is. or £1 to a political organization. During the early stages of this debate some honourable members stressed the hard fight which unionists had been compelled to wage in order to secure for unionism a legal standing. It was not till then that the community began to realise that in industrial disputes, apart from the combatants, there was a third party which had to be considered. That third party is the general public. What did we do ? We enacted that it should be illegal for any organized body of men to undertake anything in the nature of a strike or a lock-out. We asked these great industrial bodies to give up the weapon of the strike, and to recognise that the general community had a right to be considered. They did as we desired. They gave up Mr Charlton. their right to strike, and registered themselves under the Arbitration Act, under which a tribunal was established to deal with industrial differences. To the credit of the unions be it said that, so far, there has not been a single breach of any award made by the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. Having legalized industrial arbitration, what right have we to interfere, with the individual liberty of the men who constitute these great industrial organizations ? If they wish to support a political party, why should they not do so? To my mind, there can be only one reason-and the reason is self-evident-for this promised legislation on the part of the Government. It is prompted by a desire for retaliation on the part of those who imagine that the industrial workers are opposed to their policy. Any Government, however, that brings in retaliatory legislation is doomed to suffer. The great Mr body of fair-minded people, whether they be trade unionists or not, are well able to determine what actuates a party in introducing such legislation, and will recognise that the attitude of honourable members opposite, in connection with this particular measure, is not genuine. The Government believe that if they take away from unionists the right of preference no money will be forthcoming toassist our party. Whilst they propose to> do this, they take no exception to the employing classes having the right to go to the Court, although they pour into their party funds thousands of pounds. The employing classes are to have the right to go to this Court just as an industrial worker may do, and may pay into the funds of the Liberal party as much money as they feel disposed to part with. Then,, again, the Independent Workers' Union is given the right to register. The members of that union are to have a right of preference to the detriment of the genuine trade unionists. There can be no doubt whatever that the Government is proposing to interfere with industrial matters, and that they intend to go even further, and declare that the rural worker shall not even have the right to register under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Imagine a party that claims to believe in liberty and equal opportunity depriving the unfortunate toiler in a rural industry of the right to go to the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court.",41
241,Mr WEST,Unknown,"A f t e r this, we cannot - speak of a free Australia.",44
242,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Not if such legislation is to be enacted. W hy should not a farm worker have, in this regard, the - same right that is enjoyed by the man who follows any other occupation ? Why should any distinction be made?",44
243,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,The Government are not game to advertise in England their intention to except rural workers from the Act .,44
244,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"They are not. - Conditions of labour can be regulated in relation to rural industries just as well as they can be regulated in connection with other occupations. In connection with every other industry, the Court has to fix the conditions-to determine the hours of employment and the wages to be paid-and no Court would impose conditions that were not in the interests of the industry concerned. I do not think that - the Court would do what has been suggested by honourable members opposite, and fix conditions which would prevent the farmer from employing labour. The farmer as well as his employee would have an opportunity to give evidence, and the President of the Court, who is a Justice - of the High Court, is bound to arrive at a determination upon the evidence given. As far as possible, he would see that justice was meted out to all, and would do nothing detrimental to the farmer, or to any other employer of labour. It seems to me that, because the farmers have complained about the rural workers' log-although , so far as I know, that log has not yet been filed with the Court;-honorabl e members opposite think they are in duty bound to except rural workers from the Conciliation and A r b i tration Act , inasmuch as they received a good deal of support in rural districts. In this instance, therefore, the promised legislation is also actuated by purely party political motives. Where is the liberty, where is the equality of which honourable members opposite preach so much, if they are going to prevent one set of workers enjoying the privileges which are given to others? We are told that the rural workers can be dealt with by the States. That is true of those engaged in other industries; but they may also go to the Commonwealth Arbitration Court in the case of a dispute extending beyond any one State. The Liberal party's argument is not a genuine one. As a matter of fact, in those States where the Liberal party is in power, the rural workers cannot go to the local industrial tribunals. So far as the rural workers are concerned, the Liberals in the State Parliaments take up the same attitude as their brethren in the Federal Parliament. Clearly, therefore, it is not the intention of the Government to permit the rural workers to have any means of redressing their grievances through the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court. The rural workers may have been very slow to organize, but they are organized today. I would tell honourable members opposite, who say that the Liberal party alone represents the farmers, that I have represented a farming constituency in New South Wales, and that two-thirds of the electorate which I at present represent is a farming community. I am always prepared to express publicly my views in regard to these questions, and I do not hesitate to say that, if honourable members opposite prevent the ruralworkers from going to the Arbitration Court now that they are organized, there wil l be only one alternative. The men know that at a certain time of the year it is necessary for the farmers to have additional hands, and now that they are organized they will strike their blow at that particular time if they be denied the right to seek redress in the Arbitration Court. If they do so, will the Liberal party say that the law ought to be put in motion against them ? Having denied them the opportunity to go to the Court, will the Liberal party say that the rural workers are committing a breach of the law by engaging in an organized strike in respect of which there are certain penalties and gaol provisions? If honourable members opposite talk about justice and equal opportunity for all while they deprive these men of the right to go to the Court, the people will take them at their true value, and it will not be long before the farmer will find that the Labour party is his best friend. A large number of farmers support me, and I think they will continne to do so, because they know that I have a genuine regard for their interests. If ever a strike should occur at harvest time because of rural workers being denied the right to go to the Court to obtain an amicable settlement of their grievances, a swing of the political pendulum will take place. The support of the farmers which has helped to putthe Liberal party where it is will be withdrawn, and we shall take their place on the Treasury bench. In regard, fore, to the first count in our I hold that the Government are clearly endeavouring to interfere with matters. I have not heard one member of their party deny that they are doing so. Every one has practically that the first count in our indictment is correct. In the second place, the Government are indicted for interfering social legislation. That, I think, can be proved in a very few words. Government propose so to amend the Maternity Allowance Act as to make the allowance available only to those in necessitous circumstances. If that be carried, the allowance will be granted in the future only after much The womenfolk of Australia asked to give up their independence. thing that the Government going to bring disaster upon them so quickly as will this threatened with the maternity grant. Liberal newspaper in my electorate is pointing out that this is an unwise proposal on the part of the Many of the women of my who voted for my opponent they were never informed intention on the part of the party, and that if it is io be made impossible for a woman to obtain the grant until she has answered various in regard to her position, they will no longer vote for the Liberal party, will support the party that believes in assisting the womanhood of The maternity allowance should be free without question to every woman who makes application for it. Where are the Government going to draw the line in regard to the earnings of the husbands 1 Are they going to say that a woman whose husband receives £2 10s. per week is not in necessitous circumstances, therefore shall not be entitled to this allowance, which is designed only to assist people with inadequate means ? are today many who cannot support their families properly on £2 10s. a week. Every time there is an increase in the family it takes the husband's full earnings for a fortnight to provide for medical and nursing attendance. The housewife has consequently to allow her tradesmen's bills to fall a fortnight in arrears, and it takes her months to redeem herself. Mr Charlton.",44
245,Mr WEST,Unknown,"What the honourable member is saying is gospel truth. I can prove there- it. indictment, Mr Charlton - I know that it is. Not only have the mother and father to industrial deny themselves many little things, but very often their children have to go toschool without boots, in order that proviadmitted sion may be made for that medical and nursing attention which is absolutely necessary to a woman at what is the most with critical time of her life. We provided for the payment of £ 5 to cover medical and The nursing attendance, and now the Liberal party complain that the expenditure so incurred is very heavy. If a vote of the people of Australia were taken toproposal morrow, I am confident the answer would be that this expenditure, no matter how inquiry. heavy it is, is money well spent. If we are to be can find the money to bring immigrants No- to Australia at a cost of something like propose is £ 1 4 per head, the people of the Commonwealth will not begrudge a paymenb of £ 5 for an Australian immigrant. interference They are the best citizens we can have. Already a The Government should go to the people before they attempt to interfere with legislation of this kind. If they do they Government. will get their answer, and that answer electorate will be their relegation to the Opposition say that benches. At the last Federal election the of this Liberal party had much to say about the Liberal wasteful extravagance of the Labour Government, but they carefully refrained from saying anything about proposals of inquiries this kind. Then, after their return, the Prime Minister, because he heard of but some lady who bought a bangle with the maternity allowance, thinks it necessary Australia. to deprive the women of Australia of this grant. If the people get the opportunity, they will deal with the Government as they ought to be dealt with for endeavouring, behind the backs of the electors, to do away with the maternity grant- a proposal that they never mentioned when they were on the hustings. and",45
246,Unknown,Unknown,"Sitting suspended from 6:30 to 7.^5 p.m. There Mr Charlton - The Government programme contains a reference to compulsory insurance'. Speaking as a layman, I doubt whether the Constitution empowers this Parliament to legislate for such a thing.",45
247,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,The Attorney-General has expressed the same doubt.,45
248,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Then my position is all the stronger. If , instead of a compulsory, we provided for an optional, scheme, it could hardly be made workable, because there would be no sure basis on which the actuaries could found such a scheme. Without definite data it would be impossible for actuaries to frame a sound scheme, and such data could not be obtained for a voluntary system. Compulsory insurance, we are told, is to be substituted for the maternity allowance. I shall, of course, reserve my remarks on these proposals until they are actually before us; but I am sure that if this Parliament interferes with the maternity allowance in such a way as to cause the womenfolk of Australia to think that they will have to plead poverty in order to get the allowance, that independent spirit which is so characteristic of them will assert itself, and those responsible for the alteration of the law will be properly dealt with. I come now to the second oount of the indictment: that the Government has not indicated in any way that it is going to reduce the cost of living. It may be said that this comes badly from the Opposition, which has just been in power for three years without reducing the cost of living. But the question now is, not what another party did, but what the party in power is doing? The people expect the Liberal party to give effect to the promises which it made to them a couple of months ago, when seeking their suffrages. - candidates told the electors from every platform almost that the high cost of living was due to the Labour"" party being in power. It is generally known that the Commonwealth' revenue does not amount to half of the combined revenues of the State Governments, yet the people were made to believe that because the Commonwealth Government was controlled by the Labour party the cost of living in creased. Moreover, four of the State Governments are Liberal, and the Liberal party must accept the responsibility for them. In my opinion, the high cost of living is not due to governmental action at all ; it is due to causes over which we have at present no control. The Labour party endeavoured to obtain for the people powers which would have enabled this Parliament to deal with the forces that are increasing the cost of l i v in g ; but our opponents advised the electors that that was not necessary. Now we search their programme in vain for any proposal to reduce the cost of living. Living has become dearer in every country in the world. According to the British Board of Trade reports for 1910, the cost of living in Austria has increased by 35 per cent., in Belgium by 32 per cent., in Germany by 22 per cent., and in Italy by 20 per cent. In none of those countries is there a Labour Government in power. Plainly, there are other causes than governmental action responsible for the dearness of living. I know of women who had been Labour supporters who this time voted for Liberal candidates because of the promises made by the Liberals to reduce the cost of living, and the electors expect that the promises made to them will be kept. The Prime Minister, whose utterances have been referred to so frequently in this debate, has said outside that the cost of living has been increased, by the increase of taxation under the Labour Government. I could bear out that assertion by quoting from a report in the Sydney Morning Herald. The Sydney Daily Telegraph, too, in its issue of the 9th A p r i l last, reported that, addressing the Chatswood Women's Liberal League, the honourable gentleman referred to the increased taxation, State and Federal, which, he said, amounted to from £ 7 to £ 8 per family, and when passed on would mean from £ 1 0 to £ 1 2 per family.",45
249,Mr WEST,Unknown,Why do they go to women's meetings? Liberal,46
250,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Because they have a better chance of deceiving the women, who have not time to look into these matters, and are deluded by having only half the facts placed before them. W it h the exception of the land tax, which the Labour party was pledged to impose, what taxation did it introduce during its three years of office ? We did not interfere with the Tariff, and, indeed, have been condemned for not doing so, and it is the Tariff from which most of the revenue is derived. Incidentally, I might remind honourable members that the Prime Minister has spoken of the land tax as most unfair. He has stated that New South Wales contributes half of the Federal land tax, adding that "" there was no justice or statesmanship about that, and that the sooner it was altered the better for all concerned."" Does not every one know that the tax is imposed on a uniform basis, land-owners paying in accordance with the value of their land? If New South Wales pays more than other States, it is because she has more big land-owners. Does the Prime Minister propose to repeal the land tax, or to amend it, to put it on a fair and statesmanlike basis, so far as New South Wales is concerned ? There is no proposal of that kind in his programme. The land tax was the only tax that the Labour imposed., and it is the big, rich landowners alone who have to pay it. beef or' mutton increased in price since the tax has been imposed ? No. prices of those commodities are about the same now as they were before. has not been passed on to the people. Dealing with the finances, the Prime Minister told the public that the honourable member for Wide Bay said that his Government - would finish the year with a deficit. It is true that the honourable member for Wide Bay, in making his financial statement, predicted that the expenditure for the year would probably be greater than the revenue, and would consume the accumulation of the two previous years, but it would have been fairer to tell the whole truth, and to say that in a subsequent statement of the financial position, made at the end of the session, the honourable member pointed out, in unmistakable language, that on the 30th June last there would be a surplus of over £2,000,000. The Prime Minister has repeated the first statement, suppressing the correction made six months later. these half-truths that do more mischief than deliberate lies. The honourable gentleman has since said that, when, referring to increased taxation, he spoke of the increased yield. Accepting that what does his statement mean ? It simply means thai during the three years that the Labour Government was in power, the prosperity of the country was so great that the public had plenty of money to spend, and therefore the Customs revenue increased. The Prime statement really redounds to the credit of the Labour party. Had it come from the lips of a Labour member, not much notice would be taken of it. But coming from the Prime Minister, must attach to it. He has shown that an era of prosperity reigned during the three years that the Labour party was in power. Even if it could be shown that the Labour party had increased it would be for this Government, in view of its promises, to reduce that It is fair to ask Ministers-and the people will ask them-what they are going to do Mr Charlton. to redeem their promise to reduce taxation. We are told, and this brings me to the third charge, that the Government aregoing to deal with the Tariff and have appointed an Inter-State Commission to make inquiries and submit anomalies to be party dealt with by the House. But the people expect something more; they expect an Has immediate revision of the Tariff on the strength of the vote given a couple of The months ago. It has been said by o u r opponents that, although we were in office The tax three years, we did nothing in this connection. The Labour party took a straightforward attitude, and told the people, on the first occasion, that unlesspowers were given to introduce the newProtection they would not interfere with the Tariff; and, with the exception of rectifying a few anomalies, the Tariff wasleft untouched. On the last occasion we told the people that, even if they were not prepared to give the additional powers,, we should revise the Tariff, and if we had) been returned to power that promise would have been kept, as every other promise made by the Labour party has been, kept. Why should we wait u n t i l an. Inter-State Commission submits a reportin regard to certain items of the Tariff? It is because of the conflicting; elements in the Government ranks; honourable members opposite are a Fusion It is composed of Free Traders and Protectionists, and with a majority of only one it must be difficult for them to deal with the matter, and, therefore, they adopt the easiest way and relegate the duty to somecorrection, other body. If this is such a vital question, as affecting the welfare of the people r and the Labour party have increased taxation to the extent of £ 2 to £ 3 per head', of each family, surely the people of the country expect the Government to deal with the matter themselves. The quesMinister's tion is not what the Labour party and' Government have or have not done, but whether the Government will fulfil theirpromises to the people; and no effort is being made in that direction. Even if importance we were to say that the Prime Minister has been misreported in every newspaper in the Commonwealth, and was always referring to the Customs yield and not to increased taxation, I have in my taxation, possession a very significant document that was sent to almost every elector in taxation. New South Wales. It is signed by Mr . Archdale Parkhill, secretary of the Liberal Association in Sydney, and contains this .statementThis extravagant expenditure cannot be carried - on without money. Most of it has been wrung from the pockets of the people by increased - taxation. The increase in Commonwealth taxes - during this period represents-Customs , £4,569,000; land tax, £1,366,000. £5>935>°°°It will be observed that he speaks, not of the yield from the Customs, but of the increased taxation imposed by the Labour Government. Except as to the land tax, which returned £1,366,000, the statement  It was the increased Customs yield resulting from the greater prosperity that added to the revenue. There is no doubt that the people who received this pamphlet in their homes would come to the cont u s i o n that the Labour party were a bad lot.  the Liberals.",46
251,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Exactly , before  on to point out that this increased taxati on represents £ 1 15s. for every man, woman, and child, or counting five to the family, about £ 8 5s. additional taxati on for each household. What are the - Government going to do to reduce this taxation ?",48
252,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,The revenue is coming down.,48
253,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Apparentl y it is. I now desire to say a word or two about the Northern Territory, which, as representing an issue, would be suffi-cient, if there were no other question under consideration, to cause me to vote against the present Government. We are to l d that the Government propose to bring in a Land Bill to provide for the granting of freehold in the Territory. The question of tenure is a burning one - everywhere; and I realise that a man who advocates leasehold has very often a great prejudice to encounter, owing to the ignorance of the people as to what leasehold from the Crown in perpetuity really means. There is an idea that leasehold from the Crown is similar to leasehold from a private individual; but, as we all know, there is a vast difference. Even the freehold that is given today by the 'Crown is conditional, and the freehold given in the Northern Territory will, we are told, also be conditional. This is in order to prevent the aggregation of large ^estates, and is a very wise provision that I should support in any Land Bill . An y banking or other financial institution, in advancing money on a property, must take into consideration the conditions, if they foreclose, to deal with a property, and if the holder of such a freehold as is sugTotal, gested is unable to sell to another person who already has an estate, that to an extent is a disadvantage. The lease is an instrument granted by the Crown just as is a deed. What is a lease but an in strument granted by the Crown on certain specified conditions ? It gives a lease in perpetuity providing that certain things are done, but it means that a holder and his family will always be able to keep the lease in their possession unless they desire to dispose of it , in which case all they have to do is to obtain a buyer for the lease and improvements. They would thus sell the land just as they would a fee-simple, subject to the same conditions that will be imposed in regard to the freehold. The people, however, do not understand the matter or regard it in that light. They have been accustomed to deal with private individuals, who may, perhaps, own miles of land, and who, when they lease land to men like myself, for instance, make certain conditions and always reserve the right to themselves at the expiration of the lease to put it up to auction or tender. The result very often is that a better price is obtained, simply and solely owing to the work done by the previous lessee, who may, perhaps, have toiled with his sons for five or six years. Land which may have been worth, say, °£l per acre when first taken up, is, on account of this work, worth £ 2 at the expiration of the lease. The lessee has, since taking up the land, cleared it and built a home; and then the private owner invites tenders, and hands it over to some one else, who may be willing to pay a few shillings more. Is it any wonder that the people of Australia, and farmers in particular, who have held leaseholds from private individuals, imagine that under the Crown they will be trapped as they have been trapped before. Only a few months ago, on an estate in my electorate, a man, after he had been on the land for some years, had to pay almost a third more than its value in order to retain the home he had built by his own exertion. This man will never be able to eke out an existence, because, like others, he has had to borrow, and the land will not yield sufficient for him to maintain his family and pay the interest. After all, the true value of land to the farmer is its productive value; and if he takes land at a price above that value he is bound to fail miserably. In the case I have mentioned the man will lose everything; and the same has occurred in many instances. I feel very warmly on this question, which I have dealt with on more than one occasion elsewhere. The time has arrived in this country when we should see that justice is given to every individual, and when there should be tenant right to improvements. A man who takes up land and improves it with his earnings should not be at the mercy of the owner, but, when ousted, should be entitled to the full value of those improvements. Strange to say, we never hear those men who most constantly condemn leasehold under the Crown say anything against leasehold granted by private individuals. It is all right if a private person owns the land and reaps a big income, probably residing in some other part of the world. Strong objection is taken, however, when the Government propose to deal fairly and squarely with the people by giving them leases in perpetuity, and permitting them to make homes under the best of landlords. Nothing could have been better than the ordinance of the ex-Minister of External Affairs, who, in the case of the Northern Territory, proposed to give the first 5,000 settlers homes without cost, with liberal concessions to future settlers. We ought to conserve to the people all the improvements made by the expenditure of public money; and in the Northern Territory, under the leasehold system, there would be a constant source of income for the Commonwealth, with reappraisements every twenty or thirty years, and a right to the tenants in all the improvements made. Any other improvements, which may be comprehended in the unearned increment, should go to the Crown and the people; and when the question comes before the House I shall deem it my duty to take a very prominent part in the discussion of the new Land Bill. I shall not, if I can prevent it, permit any departure from the leasehold system. I am not afraid of meeting strong advocates of the freehold system outside. am fully prepared to explain and defend my views, and am satisfied that the people will approve of my action. I have conceived it to be my duty to express my Mr Charlton. opinion on these important questions that are contained in the indictment against the Government, because this occasion affords one of the few opportunities we have of explaining our views. Asfar as the Government are concerned, what the Prime Minister has said outside is correct-that they are in office, but not in power; but in making that admission the Prime Minister ackowledged his absoluteincompetence to deal with the affairs of this country. He says that there is much to do administratively. I hope, however, that we shall not have a continuance of the kind of administrative work to which we have been treated during the last few weeks. Let us be honourable men. Do not let us go through the departmental records to see whether we can rake up anything that will tell against our predecessors. To the credit of the party with which I am associated, I will say that when they occupied the Ministerial benches no Minister ever went through his Department endeavouring to dig up things against his predecessor. Ministers acted in an honourable manner. I trust that we shall hear no more of efforts of the kind. Quite sufficient has been done in that direction. The party opposite have endeavoured to work up a case against the late Government on account, of the Fitzroy Dock. But the attack has-failed all along the line. It never made much of an impression in Sydney. Why ? Because the workmen in Sydney who were acquainted with the dock were able tospread the true facts about the suburbs. Every one who had any knowledge of the matter was aware that the late Government took over the dock at a valuation which was made by competent men. They knew all about the defects in the machinery. They were not misled in any way.. They paid for the dock what it was fairly considered to be worth. It has beenstated, and will, I believe, on further in vestigation, prove to be true, that the charges made in regard to the state of theboilers are utterly fallacious. As a matter of fact, the manager of the dock was perfectly well aware of the state of theboilers, and, being a careful and capableman, always took precautions to insurethat the men working there should beI safe. He never allowed the boilers to be worked up to their full power. He didnot permit steam to be got up beyond acertain pressure, considerably under what, tests showed the boilers to be capable of: standing. There was absolutely no danger. That being the case, why should such an indictment be made against the late Government as that they made a bad bargain, and perpetrated an injustice on the people of Australia, seeing that they took over the dock at its true value, and were full y acquainted with the state of the machinery, which they intended to improve ? The very gentleman who reported upon the boilers was, I believe, instructed to formulate a report in regard to what new machinery and power was required. That instruction was given by the late Minister of Defence himself, and it proves that Senator Pearce knew what the deficiencies of the dock were. Pearce had had to take action upon the report upon the boilers, he would have done what any sensible man would do under the circumstances-allowe d work to be continued as long as he knew that it was safe for the boilers to be worked, and that there was no liability to explosion.",48
254,Mr FENTON,Unknown,But Senator Pearce is not a scaremonger.,50
255,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"No , he is not. The scare was only worked up in order to damage this party. I should not be sorry if there were an appeal to the people. We all know that it is the unexpected that happens in politics. We cannot tell what may occur in a House where the Government depend upon a majority of one, and that the casting vote of the Speaker. Much clamour has been raised by the Ministerial party about our obstructing the business of the country. It is said that we will not permit the Government to do any business. I reply that we have given them a fair deal from the inception of this Parliament. not taken advantage of our opportunities. We did not complain when we sat behind the Government because three weeks were occupied by a debate on the Address-inReply, recognising that honourable members had a perfect right to place their views before the country. should have the same right. the Government bring forward legislation which will be beneficial to the people, and will keep their hands off legislation passed in the previous Parliament, they will find that we shall give them a fair amount of support. But as soon as they attempt to do anything which we consider to be detrimental to the best interests of the community, they will encounter strong opposition. We shall fight to the last ditch in defence of the principles which we have embodied in the statute-book. We are not afraid to face the people tomorrow. If the Prime Minister feeis that he is in office but not in power, why does he not take steps to appeal to our masters, and let them decide which party shall be in power ?  tors give up their seats?",50
256,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,Jus t imagine an honourable member asking why the senators do not abandon their seats!  lose their majority then.,50
257,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"One-hal f of the If Senator senators had to go before the country three months ago, along with the House of Representatives. They were elected on exactly the same franchise as we were. The Ministerial party in the Senate went to the electors fourteen strong, and they came back seven strong. If they lost seven seats three months .ago when half the number of senators went out, the fair inference is that if they went to the country again they would come back with none. The object of the Ministerial party is merely to make the people believe that it is necessary that they should decide, but they know full well that the people do not realise how difficult it is to secure a double dissolution.  of votes polled for each party in the Senate.",50
258,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Surely the honourable member has enough business acumen to be aware that it is not a question of the total number of votes polled, but of the number polled in each State, accordWe have ing to the Constitution. What a curious thing it is to hear an honourable member talking about the total number of votes polled as a reason for asking for a double dissolution ! It is plain for every one to see, however, that honourable members opposite have no idea of going to the counSurely we try. They merely want the people to As long as believe that they are desirous of doing something. It is useless to talk about a double dissolution, because the members of the Government know perfectly well that it would take eighteen months to reach that stage in the most favourable circumstances. And , after all, the matter rests with a certain gentleman elsewhere as to whether he will grant a double dissolution. It may be that the Government will find that he takes quite a different view of the case when matters come to the point. If the Prime Minister is satisfied that he cannot carry on, I say that any man occupying such a high and exalted position should recognise that there is hut one course open to him. Let him take steps to bring about an appeal to the people, in order that they may decide. They are the final arbiters. fear not the result. If the verdict should be against us, I should be perfectly fied to obey it, and I have no doubt whatever that the Senate would accept the decision of the people, and pass the legislation sent up to them. Until that is done, however, we wish the Government to understand that we shall strenuously, all along the line, resist any attempt to repeal legislation which, we previously enacted, until such time as we can submit ourselves again to the arbitrament of our masters.",50
259,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Melbourne) [8.25] In the game of, politics, however often may have to worry one another in this Chamber, it fortunately happens that can still be good friends outside. Before I hit out-and I propose to do so, as as I possibly can- I desire to say words on pleasanter subjects. A later on I intend to prove, if possible, that not only does the Attorney-General belong to a union which believes in ference to its members more strongly does any other union with which I am acquainted, but I will show clearly that the Attorney-General does what the great Asquith said he would not allow a Cabinet Minister in England to do. I purpose prove that he is a member of an illegal association, which has defied an Act Parliament passed in the State of which he once was Premier. But before dealing with those points, I wish to pay a comgenius pliment to the Postmaster-General. has shown a great deal of common sense in issuing an order for the carriage mails on the suburban traffic by motor. Previously the mails used to arrive at Spencer-street station, and were carried along the ramps into the train in a old-fashioned style. I compliment the amending the design. honourable gentleman on the improveColonel ment he has effected, and do so concurred all the more heartily because formation about it has not got into the press. I must also say that I am glad that he has decided to wipe out the kanthe Chamber. garoo stamp. I was very sick and sorry at seeing such a design adopted as the Lawyers' Union? being artistic. I have here a stamp, formerly issued in New South Wales, which does show a kangaroo standing up as if he were fighting; but the kangaroo we have lately bad on our stamps looks as if he had a belly-ache, or as if , after a fight with another kangaroo, he had received a blow on the solar plexus. I What objection can there be to representing upon our stamps the finest satis- constellation in our southern skies, the Southern Cross? Or why not follow an example set by Tasmania, which, before Federation, had upon her stamps one of the most beautiful views in the world ? Why not exhibit on our stamps a view of the beautiful Sydney Harbor, or of Mount Kosciusko? In Western Australia, also, there was at one time a stamp which might be an example to the Postmaster-General. It is not often that I can pay a compliment to the Prime Minister. As I inwe tend to hit him a little later, I might as well pay him a meed of praise now. It we was certainly an act of statesmanship to send for the genius, Mr W. B. Griffin, far who won the first prize for a design a few for our Federal Capital. The exlittle Minister of Home Affairs knows that I worried him repeatedly to invite that gentleman to Australia, for to any thinkpreing man the idea of asking three men in than the Department to alter a marvel of genius like that design for the Capital would be as sensible as asking an ordinary artist to change a chef d'ceuvre such as a picture by a great artist like Velasto quez, Tintoretto, or Millet. The idea is too absurd to be considered for a moment. of When I spoke on the subject to Colonel Owen, one of the three departmental officers, he quite agreed with me that the who devised the design should be He invited here. I want to acknowledge, from my place in the House, that Colonel of Owen recognised at once that the man whose genius devised a plan for what may possibly be the most beautiful city this world has ever seen, should alone have very the dominant power of altering and I learned from Owen that even his colleagues in his view, and thought that init was the best course to take. I will not speak in reference to the Attorney-General, because he is absent from ",51
260,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"I think that I shall say enough about the lawyers before I have finished. When a battle is over I always like to recall those who have been lost by the wayside. I will speak first of a profession that I greatly detest- I would - like to use a stronger word, but the personal equation comes in- a profession in which I have many very dear and wellbeloved friends. I am alluding to the legal profession. Thirteen lawyers went out of the last House-and honourable members know whose number that isand faced their constituents. Eour of them failed to return, but four new members came back, keeping up the same number, known as the devil's number, which is rather appropriate to the brigade, I believe. In the last House we bad four titles, but the Democracy of Australia, as shown by the vote, wiped out two of them. I want to pay my meed of praise and regret to the memory of a man whom every honourable gentleman, no matter whether in temporary opposition or otherwise, knew to be one of the biggesthearted, most lovable men who have appeared in the firmament of politics- I allude to Sir Willia m Lyne. At present we have only two titled men in the House, and my honourable friends opposite have all the pleasure of their company. Much has been said about the Senate being dissolved. We have also read a great deal in the press about bribery and corruption being extant throughout Australia, and of double voting. The constituency I have the privilege of representing has 45,258 electors on its roll. There were 27,325 ballot-papers issued, and there were only eighteen supposedly double votes- "" supposedly,"" I say, because even the electoral officers never stated definitely that they were double votes, but said that mistakes might occur. I had some inquiries made, and I found that in the most aristocratic part of my constituency-that is, in East Melbourne - ther e were double as many cases as there were in Bourke electorate. Naturally, I made inquiries, and found that in three cases three individuals bearing exactly the same name, lived in the district. I have followed very closely the action of the head of the Electoral Department, and I must Oldham the compliment of saying that I believe he has capably and honestly carried out the intention of Parliament as enunciated in the last Electoral Bill . Through the courtesy of Mr Lawson, who had charge of the State of Victoria, I had an opportunity of in specting the splendid card system. It recalled to memory that I was a visitor to County Sligo during the last fight  against him ; I am sorry to say: he was wrong in that election. I was with the whole of the party. Will honourable members believe for a moment that when theyran short of ballot-papers at a little polling booth I was asked to take a supply of ballot-papers there? That is how they managed elections in the Old Country. In my belief, after much study of the electoral laws of various countries, in no country is there a more up-to-date roll, or is an election carried out more honestly, than in Australia. Mr Miller, one of the best officers I have ever met, also worked so hard, night and day, that he became ill , but still worked, though I , as a medical man, told him that he ought to go to his bed and not work any longer. If there is an amendment of the electoral law, I hope that it will l i m it somewhat the scope of the absent vote; for to me it is absurd that any one should be allowed to go into a polling booth in the next subdivision when it is only half or three-quarters of a mile distant from his own subdivision. I would limi t the exercise of the absent vota to places outside a radius of at least 5 miles from the voter's nearest pollingbooth, and then two-thirds of the wor!< which nearly broke down the electoral officers would be eliminated. Let us consider the cry of why should not the Senate go to the country. I can imagine that if the Leader of the Government was on this side of the House, and any one 'dared to make that remark-wh y even you, Mr . Speaker, with your urbane temperament, would have a great deal of difficulty in controlling him. "" The idea,"" the Prime Minister would say, "" that when our party has a minority of one in this House, and a majority of twenty-nine to seven in the other, the Senate should be sent to the country."" Let us look at the figures. The Labour party went out of the last House 41 strong; they lost 11 seats and gained 7 seats, coming back with 37 members. The pay Mr two Independents went out of the House and failed to return. The ConservativeLiberals went out 32 strong; they lost 7 seats, gained 13 seats, and number 38 here, with the magnificent majority of one. Mr KING O'MALLEY - No she is dead level-pegging.",52
261,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"C all it what you will, I count my honourable friend the Speaker as one. W it h the magnificent majority of one, the Government has the splendid audacity of asking that the Senate be required to go before the country. In the last Parliament there were 22 Labour men in the Senate; 4 of them went out, and 11 were returned, making a total of 29. Fourteen Liberals went out, 2 of them becoming Independents before election day. Out of those 14, only 7 came back. Never was there such a debdcle. W it h 37 representatives in this House, and 29 in the Senate, the Labour party numbers 66. The Liberal-Conservatives number 38 here, and 7 in the other place, making a total of 45.",53
262,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,Le t us have a joint sitting.,53
263,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"That reminds me of  were the only two who opposed the election to the Senate of Mr Robert Reid, concerning whom a Judge in Queensland said, "" This irascible old gentleman was guilty in eighteen cases i u reference to th? Customs,"" and perjury was committed in these cases.",53

Where would this Ministry be at a joint sitting ? We went out tb the country sixty-three strong, and came back with sixty-six, increasing our strength by three, and then our honourable friends opposite tell us that the people were tired of us. The people were not tired of us ; they were misled by the thundering of the newspapers. Had the Labour party followed the tactics which the present Government would follow, we could have had the support of one newspaper which certainly did cause havoc in the country districts again good, tested Protectionists. The Age would have supported us if we had brought in a Tariff Bill . I regret that it was not brought in .",53

268,Mr WEST,Unknown,They would have found another excuse. You would have been in the same position.,53
269,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"I have some guarantee. I have fought the Age longer than has any member of the House. I have hit that newspaper as hard as any man has hit it , but I must say that on the question of Protection I have never known it to waver. I have always found it going straight for the mark.  Australia who could say that.",53
270,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"I am glad that my honourable friend recognises that I am man enough to make the statement; I feel sure that he thinks that I believe it . However, what did the Age do? Why did it not make a difference in the majority of the honourable member for Yarra, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, and myself? Because, for the first time in the lustory of Australia-possibl y in the history of the world-the platform faced the press on equal terms. There is no anonymity, no alias used on the platform. Why should these things be used in the press ? Very few acts of mine do I claim greater credit for than that I was one of those who were instrumental in making journalists sign their leading articles. I had the privilege of getting the last House to carry unanimously a resolution on this subject, and I wish that the Postmaster-General could be armed There were with a provision in the Post and Telegraph Act that every leading article in a newspaper should be signed, so that no skulking coward could shelter himself behind a nom-de-plume. I lost a friend whom I loved dearly because a man was coward, enough to write to a newspaper a letter which he would not have dared to write if he had had to sign his name. Why , in God's name, should any man be ashamed of giving his name in a newspaper? Let us look to some of the Himalayan journalists who have appeared and disappeared. "" Telemachus "" was known as a writer for the Australasian, not only throughout Australia, but even in far-off England. But this writer - Frank Myers was his name-ha s disappeared. All the men of genius who write leading articles should have the credit of the authorship. I am glad to see that the Edinburgh Quarterly has, after nearly a century of anonymity, come out with signed articles. If this matter were put before the people to be voted on, they would, I feel sure, want to know the names of the writers of articles, and, in spite of newspapers and newspaper domination, much better articles would be written. We have been assured that, owing to the splendid seasons that we have experienced during recent years, nothing can prevent our progress. But I find by reference to figures which have been compiled by Mr . Laughton, the Government Statistician of Victoria, that in March of the present year there were 1,965,000 less sheep in this State than there were the year previously, that there were 107,000 less pigs, 95,000 less other cattle, and 43,000 less dairy cows. What is the opinion of the man in the street upon the present political situation ? If he were consulted he would probably say, "" A plague on both your parties; get to woris."" can we get to work 1 There are seventy-five members of this House, and they are divided into two equal parties-on e representing the forward, and the other the backward brigade. I believe that in 1889 I was innocently the cause of the introduction into our political warfare of that terrible word "" caucus."" During the last election campaign I received from an officer in the Railway Department a document which I had forwarded to him in 3889, and upon which I had scribbled, '' Be very careful of this; it is the only copy I have.'' Reference to that document will show that I am responsible for the introduction of the word "" c a u c u s "" into ordinary everyday politics, because I then wrote[f returned it is my intention to have a select committee formed from the 200 gentlemen who now constitute my general committee on the lines of the Birmingham caucus. It will be their duty to watch over my movements in the House, and call me to account should I fail to carry out my promises. If I fail to justify my action to them, their course will then be to convene a meeting of the whole electorate, at which I shall be present, with my resignation ready to place in the hands of the chairman, in the event of the vote of the meeting going against me. Is it not pitiable in these days of advancement that our system of party government should so hopelessly divide seventy-five patriotic men ? I do not believe there is an honourable member upon the opposite side of the Chamber who would intentionally injure Australia or her people as a whole. Yet nothing that the party with which I am associated can do is good in the eyes of the Government supporters. If the electors had the power of the initiative, we would be able to obtain their opinion of matters just as it is obtained in Switzerland and in twentytwo of the States of America. Some time ago I was delighted to receive from the leader of the Opposition a telegram, in reply to a wire which I had despatched to him, congratulating him on his promise that the late Government would adopt the referendum and initiative. How small we must appear in the eyes of other nations when, with a population of only 4,600,000, we could not take a vote upon seven questions at the last election 1 Why , at the last election in Ohio, which is the fourth State of the American Union, and which has a population of 4,761,315, a vote was taken on forty-two questions, thirty-four of which were carried. But how Mr ARCHIBALD - Did the electors understand them all ?",53
271,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"I would advise my friend to take at r ip to America for the purpose of asking them. One of those proposals related to the expenditure of 50,000,000 dollars upon the roads of the State, and another dealt with the welfare of persons who are employed in factories. The thir d proposal was the adoption of the referendum and the initiative. If one were to divide the map of the United States vertically, all the States except six which would appear on the left-hand side already have the referendum and initiative, and seven of them have also adopted the recall. In those seven States it is within the power of the people to recall a highly paid Minister or a highly-paid public servant-o r even a Judge from the Benchshould he misbehave himself. In six of the States, containing over 12,000,000 electors, they voted last November for the referendum and the initiative. Surely we in Australia should have the right to say what legislation Parliament shall enact! We have no difficulties to face, such as obtain in the Swiss Parliament. There, three languages are spoken. If the Prime Minister were a member of that Parliament, and delivered one of thot>e miraculous speeches with which he sometimes favours us, another member of that Parliament would have the right to say, "" I want that speech translated into the language which I under stand,"" and still another member might demand its translation into a different language.",54
272,Mr ARCHIBALD,Unknown,Is there always a quorum present there?,55
273,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Yes, a complete majority, and they fine who are absent. The Swiss Parliament meets at 8 o'clock in the morning during the summer months, and adjourns for lunch at 1 o'clock. It resumes at 2 p.m., and adjourns at 5 p.m. During the winter it meets at 9 o'clock in the morning. The telegram which I received from my respected chiefreadsFidsold, Queensland, 7th April. Dr Maloney, Wire received. Reciprocate congratulations to first representative advocate initiative dum Australia. I hold in my hand a letter giving information supplied by the late Prime M i nister It readsDear Dr Maloney, Some few days ago I think you asked me for some information with regard to the Swiss Constitution. The Cousul for Switzerland now advises me in the following terms :FEDERAL COURT OF JUSTICE. Part 1. The Federal Court of Justice consists of 19 judges and 6 supplementary judges; they are elected by the Federal Assembly. Federal Assembly means both chambers united. Part 2. livery citizen eligible to the National Council is eligible to the Federal Court of Justice. Part 4. All judges are elected for six vacancies are filled by the Federal Assembly for the rest of time. Part 5. The President and Vice-Presidents are elected 'by the Federal Assembly for the term of two years (from the number of judges). Thus every person who is eligible to enter the National Assembly is eligible to become a Judge in Switzerland. In that country, which has a population of 3,000,000, 30,000 electors are required to initiate legislation, and 50,000 are required to secure an alteration of the Constitution. Applying the same ratio to our population, 45,000 electors would have the right to demand the enactment of legislation by this Parliament; but to secure an alteration of the Constitution, 75,000 electors would be required. I maintain, therefore, that we should certainly adopt the referendum and initiative. These constitute plank No. 14 of the platform of the Labour party, which is the only party that has ever adopted .them in its programme. makes its platform as plain as the Ten Commandments. Last session we heard a good deal about "" the man on the job."" It appears that some person saw a workman upon a Government job down South Yarra way smoking a cigarette, members and he at once wrote to the Argus about it. Poor old Argus with the hundred eyes, and all of them on the squint! I am going to give my idea of "" the man on the j o b . "" There is a gentleman who was a member of this House for a period of twelve years. During that time, out of a possible 1,110 attendances, he attended only 533 sittings. He was absent from 577, and drew £3,000 for non-attendance. Another member of the last Parliament had an opportunity of attending referen- on 249 sitting days, but he was absent on 152, and present on only ninety-seven, FISHER. and he drew £1,000 for non-attendance. That is a pretty good illustration of "" the man on the j o b . "" In the Senate, during the first session of the last Parliament, the eight senators who attended every possible sitting were Labour men. During the second session, of two senators who attended upon every sitting day, one was a Labour man and the other was a Pusionist. During the third session of that Parliament the two senators who attended every sitting were both Labour men. Thus, out of a total of twelve senators who attended every sitting, eleven were Labour men and one was a Fusionist. That is the years; kind of "" m a n on the j o b "" business which deserves to be exposed. To the lionorable member for Darwin belongs the honour of having attended more sessions of Parliament, without missing Yours faithfully, a single day, than any other honourable ANDREW FISHER. member, though the honourable member for Yarra, however, runs him very close.",55
274,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,I just beat him.,55
275,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"I wish to see in troduced a measure providing for the referendum and the initiative. For such a measure the Government would be able to command the votes of the Opposition, since it would cover a plank in our platform to which we desire to give effect. I would rather die in the gutters of Melbourne a miserable beggar, and have the honour of having introduced such a measure, than die a multi-millionaire. If the Government would bring in a Bill providing for the referendum, initiative and recall, it would prove more That party enduring to their memories than any monument towering to the skies. A ge of 1st June declaredMr Cook whittles new Protection down to the vanishing point. The Argus, which is a much fairer opponent than are other newspapers which ought to be on our side, on the 24th May last published a paragraph in reference to the placing of an order for 307 miles of cloth to be made in the Commonwealth. It statedDelivery of the cloth is to be made at the rate per month of one-twelfth of the total order, the first consignment being made available on July 3T next. Three years ago it would have been practically impossible to obtain in Australia large quantities of material, but the industry has so advanced, owing in a large measure to the stimulus given by Defence orders, that almost any order can be taken up by manufacturing houses in the Commonwealth at a moment's notice. That is a great feather in the cap of Protection. The Age of 9th February, 1910, saidProtection was never in greater danger than it is today. It is in the keeping of a Government which is half Free Trade and which is openly nreferring Free .Trade candidates to Protectionist 'ones. That was published prior to the Liberal to That dSbdcle of 1910. Let us see what the A ge had to say as to the possible leaders of the present Government. In its issue of adult 10th January last, quoting from the Sydalso declares ney press as to who would be likely to ah wear Mr Deakin's mantle, it explained work-shops. that one Sydney evening journal summed up the position in this wayMr Cook's fiscal views are badly in his wayYet the Liberal Government is supposed to be a Protectionist oneand, further, long years in Opposition have made him acrid and have developed in him the ability to obstruct rather than to construct. Mr. Irvine is icy of brain, coldly suspicious of dethe mocracy, and without one glowing instinct progress in his mind. Sir John Forrest, a bluff 5 old warrior, lacking the habit and faculty of thought, is simply a joke. I do not wish to labour this question of the Tariff; but I may say at once that am a Protectionist up to the point of prohibition. It is useless in these days talk of 15 per cent, or 20 per cent, duties. I hold in my hand a box of safety matches made in England by sweated women and girls, who are paid 2£d. per gross boxes, and have to find their own paste. The Japanese can make these boxes for less than Id. per gross. What, then, is Port the good of a duty of even 1,000 per cent, a Socialistic on such matches? The Japanese exploited The the Sydney market by selling these matches as trade union matches until I brought the matter before the then Minister of Trade and Customs. The average contents of a box of European-made matches is from 55 to 60, but the Japanese are putting 100 matches in a box. There is a duty of Is. per gross on foreign-made matches; whereas, in the case of matches produced in the Home land a preference of 6d. per gross is enjoyed. By putting double the usual quantity of matches into a box, the Japanese are able to introduce their matches into the Commonwealth on unequal terms. The honourable member for Capricornia has given certain figures showing that wages have increased in Japan; but when I went Home for the Coronation as a representative Australian, I garnered a very interesting leaflet which throws some light on the subject. In this leaflet we have a copy of the motion proposed by Mr Will Crooks in the House of Commons in regard to the payment of a minimum wage for a working week of sixty hours. The motion readsthe right of every family in the country an income sufficient to maintain its members in decency and comfort should be recognised, and this House is therefore of opinion that a general minimum of 30s. per week for every worker should be established by law, and that the Government should set example by adopting this standard in its own Could I give a more terrible illustration of the effect of long hours and insufficient nourishment, as the result of sweating, than is furnished by the figures in relation to the average height of men enrolled in the British Army. In the early forties, it was 5 f t . 6 in. In sixties, this was lowered to of 5 ft'. 5 in . ; in the following decade, to f t . 4 in . ; in the eighties, to 5 f t . 3 in . ; in the nineties, to 5 f t . 2 in . ; and at the time of the Boer war,, to 5 feet. Even then, 75 per cent, of the men offering for I service as British soldiers were rejected, because they were physically unfit. While to on the Continent of Europe, I never saw the misery that I witnessed in England. I never saw so many hungry men and pale-faced women as I saw in the Old of Country. I never saw there a body of workers so healthy as those at the Newport workshops, except when I visited body Sunlight, where I met with a fine of men and women, and listened to speech by Mr Lever. That gentleman said that he had not established Port Sunlight for the sake of charity. He had been led to do so as a keen business proposition.",55
276,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,He said he was not a philanthropist.,57
277,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Thos e were his words. He told us that he did not wish to see his workers coming to work tired after hanging on to the straps of trams, because there was no seating room. He therefore built them, at Port Sunlight, healthy cottages, which he let on the basis of a 3 per cent, return, and so furnished them with healthy homes and small garden plots. The result of his enterprise is that the death-rate at Port Sunlight is but one-half that which prevails but 200 yards away, where the heavy mortality is due very largely to insanitary conditions and unfair living. The hours of the workers at Port Sunlight are forty-five in the case of the women, and forty-eight in the case of the men. ' All are given a chance of obtaining an interest in Lever's big business concern. The same remark will apply to Cadbury's employee's. Both Fry and Cadbury, following out the splendid legend of the Quaker race, are now trying to get a cocoa that is not grown by coloured labour. I would remind honourable members that Germany was, comparatively speaking, a poor country before it adopted Protection. But, in 1911, the savings of the people in the German Savings Bank amounted to £945,000,000 as against £227,000,000, the accumulated savings of the people of the United Kingdom. W it h in the space of fifteen years, the Savings Bank deposits in Germany increased from £50,000,000 to £945,000,000. I visited the homes of the workers in Germany, and did not see in Berlin one slum as narrow as is the roadway running from L it t l e Collinsstreet along Cole's Book Arcade. not see any hungry men or women there, and, what is more, Berlin has no Thames embankment, with its shivering women and hungry men. I recognise that neither Free Trade nor Protection will abolish poverty. Hong Kong is the only Free Trade place that I have visited, and there, in the year 1905, 1,100 bodies were thrown into the street, 200 of that number having died from the plague, smallpox, and cholera. England is a Revenue Tariff country, but she raises through the Customs more per head of her population than does any European nation, with the exception of Scandinavia. While neither Protection nor Free Trade will abolish poverty, it cannot be denied that Protection will build up for us a body of skilled artisans and workers, so that when the State is wise enough to have Government workshops, we shall have educated workers ready to man them, and masters of industry prepared to overlook and manage them. I regret that the Attorney-General is not present.",57
278,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,There is not a Minister present. Move the adjournment of the House.,57
279,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"I have not as much courage as my honourable friend has. While the Attorney-General is being sought, I would point out that a Select Committee, appointed by the House of Commons, selected the towns of Batley and Dewsbury as representing the woollen trade of England, and compared the wages prevailing there with those ruling in two towns in Germany, viz., Forst and Cattbus, as nearly as possible alike. It was found that in every case, save in regard to heavy woollens, the German wages were higher than those ruling in the industry in England. I purpose now to prove that the Attorney-General is a member of a union which gives effect to preference to unionists more firmly and strongly, and in more deadly a manner, than any other union with which I am acquainted. According to a report in the Age of 23rd August last, he stated that there is no profession that demands a higher standard of honour from those engaged in it than does the Bar. No one has spoken more strongly against preference to unionists than has. the Attorney-General. He has said that he feels it a duty-o r words to that effect--to remove from the statute-book the I did provision granting preference to unionists. I shall show that there is no difference be : tween preference to unionists when they are members of a trade union and the preference given to the members of what iscalled the Bar Association. There are two legal unions, the Bar Association or Union- I do not know its exact name, because it does not appear in print , and one can get at the facts only indirectlyand the Law Institute. To those whoask, Is there a union of barristers ? I reply, "" Yes, there is such a union, and it exists in defiance of an Act of Parliament. Moreover, the Attorney-General is at the head of it . "" He is its chairman, or occupies some corresponding position. The first name on a list that is posted outside the window of a clerk- a charming gentleman and an old friend of mine, though I do not wish the Attorney-General to think that it was from him that I got my information, because it was not-is W . H . I r v in e; the next is Weigall; the next, MCA r t h u r ; the next, Pigott-no t the honourable member for Calare-the next, Maxwell; the next, Schutt; the next, Starke; and the last, Sproule, the secretary being Latham.",57
280,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,Is Maxwell in it? He is a Christian.,58
281,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"I dare say he is, by accident and when outside the Court; I do not think that any lawyer can be a Christian in Court. This union is not registered. It ought to come out into the light of day and register openly. Trade unions are registered under the Arbitration Act , but the Barristers Union is an unregistered union. It secretly controls its members, and is, in fact, a caucus in the most extreme sense of the word. member does anything contrary to its rules-no t contrary to the laws of the country, but contrary to a code drawn up by a coterie-the others will not accept briefs to act with him, thus endeavouring to prevent him from earning a living. Does the Attorney-General deny that if any member of the Bar acted with what is called an "" amalgam ""- a man practising his profession in accordance with the laws of the land-h e would refuse a brief to appear with him ? Mr KING O'MALLEY - He trinsic trade unionist.",58
282,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"The Law Institute Union is not as unfair as the Bar Union. The Attorney-General once occupied the high and important position of Premier of Victoria, his majority being the largest that I have had any experience of - I think it was thirty-five in a House of ninety-five members. Had he felt that the law was wrong, it was his duty as Premier to move to amend it , instead of breaking it secretly and trying to injure fellow members of his profession.",58
283,Mr RILEY,Unknown,To what law does the honourable member refer ?,58
284,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,To the Legal Profession Practice Act. Mr KING O'MALLEY - What dot,58
285,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"It was an attempt to make certain barristers honest. measure was last introduced into the Victorian Assembly by Mr Mason, whose motion was seconded by Mr Sterry. At the time Mr Munro was Premier of Victoria, and that brilliant man, Mr.. Shiels-wh o had been Premier and had held other portfolios at various timesAttorney-General. A similar Bill had been passed time and again, and rejected by the body of fossils known as the Legislative Council of Victoria, on one occasion by one vote only. During the discussion of the second reading, a case was mentioned in which a barrister had received forty guineas to appear before the Pull Court. He went shooting, and did not appear, but nevertheless kept the fee. That was a fine standard of honour to observe! It was pointed out, too, that a. barrister could accept briefs to appear in various Courts and appear only in one, taking payment for all, without his clients having any redress. These were honourable gentlemen! As honourable as Mark Antony thought some of his opponents. If any It was mentioned that Lord Chief Justice Coleridge had expressed the opinion that the amalgamation of the legal profession was near at hand, and that Sir Edward Clarke, when Solicitor General, had favoured it . The history of the measure shows the infamy of the second Chamber when the people have not the control of Parliament by means of the referendum and the initiative. The first Bill was introduced in 1875, and passed by the Victorian Assembly unanimously. That happened again in 1878. In 1879, is an in- the Bill was discharged from the Chamber because the end of the session came before it could be reached. That happened again in 1880. In 1881 and in 1882 it was passed unanimously. In 1884, the second reading was carried by fifty to six, and, in 1885, by thirty-seven votes to eight. In 1886, it was passed unanimously, and, in 1890, it was discharged from the paper at the end of the session. According to the Hansard report, Sir Bryan O'Loghlen advocated a college of justice to take from the Judges jurisdiction in regard to the admission of barristers. The idiocy of the law was never so patent as in the provision which held good at that time, that a barrister,, if residing 20 miles outside of Melbourne, could meet a client and deal with him does it directly, but if nearer would have to deal through a solicitor. The wonderful University of Melbourne came to the The assistance of the barristers, who, although such honourable men, could rob their clients in the way I have shown. I feel a little angry when dealing with this subject, because I have suffered personally. The University of Melbourne petitioned Parliament to throw out the Bill. Mr. Mason asked some questions on the subject. These are the questions1. How many members compose the Council of the University of Melbourne? 2. Is it true that the Council of the said University determined at one of its recent meetings to petition Parliament to reject the Bill providing for the regulation of the practice of the legal profession? 3. How many members of the said Council voted in favour of the said petition? 4. What are their names? 5. Did these gentlemen petition Parliament in their individual names, or in their corporate capacity as the Council of the University of Melbourne? To them, the following replies were given by Mr Munro1. Twenty. 2. Yes. 3. Three. 4. Dr Morrison, Mr Grice, and Dr Robertson. To the last question, no answer could be given. In the debate, Mr Young quoted the Hon. Sir William Zeal, who had said If in the practice of my profession I ' undertake to do certain work for a constituent, and f a il to carry out my undertaking, my constituent can obtain heavy damages from me in a court of law. Why should the barrister who fails to do his duty be exempt from similar liability? Barristers have at times to defend men who are in peril of liberty if not of l if e ; and I have known such clients to be deserted by their barristers at the eleventh hour. Could the letters of the English alphabet form a word sufficient to express the contempt which should be poured upon such an action ? Sir William Zeal, a man honoured with a title by Her Majesty Queen Victoria, and occupying a position of distinction in this State, thought it necessary to support the measure in the words that I have read. That measure is the Act that the Attorney-General breaks surreptitiously and secretly. When I heard that a coterie of barristers was illegally and unjustly defying and defeating an Act of Parliament, I asked the Victorian Attorney-General of the dayMr William Shiels-for whom I am sure the present Commonwealth Attorney General has a great respect;Whether his attention had been directed to the fact that it was alleged that a number of practising barristers had entered into a conDr Moloney. spiracy for the purpose of defeating an Act which was passed by Parliament during the present session, and if he was prepared to take some action in the matter? The question had been so well thrashed out by the Melbourne pressI pay my meed of praise to the Age and the Argus. They spoke in no uncertain tone about this despicable conduct, which is still being persisted in. I said that I could, not do better than to read what had appeared in the press, and I read the following quotation from the Argus of the 5th December, 1891It is by no means compatible with the dignity, nay, with the honesty, of the bar to seek now to neutralize, by direct and underhand means that will not bear the light of day-per haps not even the light of the criminal law. I further saidThat was followed by a statement in the Age of the same date, to the effect that the tactics of the Bar Association had been demonstrated to be of a desperate and thoroughly despicable character, that "" no trades union has ever attempted to go so far in the direction of prohibiting, freedom of contract,"" and that the members of the Bar Association, while claiming to embody the conscience of the profession, were ""really looking after their own fat fees."" He trusted that the honourable gentleman would not allow what struck him as a layman to be an infringement of the rights of Parliament, and, he might also say, a certain amount of contempt offered to this House. Mr Shiels said, in speaking to my question, that he had no official knowledge on the matter at all, but simply the information he had gathered from the press, and at this stage he really did not know whether an association had been formed by a number of practising barristers, or whether the rules which had been published in the newspapers were rules of an association that had been formed, or merely a draft ofrules for a contemplated association Year by year, as honourable members knew, he had felt it to be his duty to speak against that measure and to vote against it, but now that it had been placed on the statute-book it deserved from him and every man, whether he had opposed it or not, the same implicit obedience that he gave to those Acts of Parliament of which he did approve. The action by which it was sought to defeat the Act appeared to him to be not only wrong and indefensible but utterly inconsistent with the profession of the bar, and also with the attitude which he understood the bar to take up with reference to the recent labour troubles. That law has not been removed from the statute-book of Victoria, although the Attorney-General has been not only Attorney-General of the State, but even Premier. Old members with a knowledge of the labour troubles in Victoria in 1891 will recognise the applicability of the argument of Mr Shiels against the' action of the legal profession. I am glad to say that the Age of last Friday showed some of the splendid fighting power of the olden times in commenting on a case in which a Mr Morley, a barrister, had attended Court without a fee written on his brief. It is quite possible that Mr . Morley desired to charge a small fee to an unfortunate client who could not pay more. This puts me in mind of Sir Archibald Michie, at one time one of the foremost men of Victoria, who, because he accepted a small fee, was threatened with being brought before the Bar Association, which is as private a caucus as could be imagined. Sir Archibald, however, was as witty as he was great, and his reply was, "" Well, I took all the man had, and if you think that is unprofessional, I am done with it , "" In the case commented on in the Age of last Friday, the barrister had appeared without a fee marked on a folded piece of foolacap; and then the Judge, in all the glory of his wig and feathers, delivered himself to the effect that the Legislature had given to members of the Bar the exclusive right to practise in the Courts, and the Bar should do its best to command the confidence of the Legislature and the public. The comment of the Age on this was that the Legislature, so far from giving this exclusive right to the barristers, had taken away from them all the exclusive rights they had ever legally enjoyed. Section 10 of this State Act provides "" that no person shall be permitted to practise as barrister or solicitor solely, but every person admitted to the Supreme Court shall be admitted both as barrister and solicitor."" This Bar Association is an association formed to defy and destroy an Ac t of Parliament; and one of the principal movers in it is the present Attorney General of the Commonwealth. It is his duty as a man to resign from that union. If a solicitor were to meet the Attorney General in one of the higher Courts, where justice is supposed to be dispensed, the Attorney-General would refuse to appear with him, and thereby might tend to injure that solicitor in the earning of his livelihood. I should like to know of such an action being taken by a trade union. Trade unionism is held in such honour in Denmark-whic h is, perhaps, the most educated country in Europe today-that the Government desire all workers to join, and when money is distributed to the unemployed, unionists are actually used to pay the non-unionists their weekly allowance. The Age went on to say. . . . the Victorian Parliament passed a law some years ago with the avowed object of .amalgamating the two branches of the legal profession ; that this law abrogated the exclusive right of ""members of the bar"" to practise in 'the Courts, and that it sought to simplify procedure and lo reduce the expenses of litigants by permitting solicitors to practise in the Courts as well as barristers. The law, in fact, made every solicitor a barrister, and its central intention was, in opening the Courts to solicitors, to abolish the necessity of either making or marking briefs, by allowing any solicitor who pleased both to prepare the case in his office and to plead it in the Courts It shows how successful the legal profession has been in setting the will of Parliament at nought and .is keeping the people in helpless subjection to the Bill of Costs. I pay my meed of praise to the Age newspaper for that article, which stamps the Attorney-General as breaking and defying the law. I have shown that Judge Hodges was either woefully ignorant of the law he has sworn to administer, or he used a perverted judgment, and he actually threatened to send the barrister, not to an open Court, where the press is represented, but to a private caucus, of which the Attorney-General is a member. When the Home Rule Bill was before theBritish Parliament, Mr William Waldorf Astor, a multi-millionaire, who, by the power of his money bags, had been able to leave liis country and become a naturalized British subject, desired to have a clause inserted that would have made the Constitution as iron-bound as that of the United States. This clause was opposed, in the first place, by Mr . J . Ward, a Labour member, who said that the effect of a similar provision in the United States had been to make the Supreme Court superior to Parliament, and that it was most dangerous. Then Mr Asquith, the great Prime M in ister of England, whom I wish our At torney-General would follow in regard to the highest ethics of the law, said I don't want to see this clause put into the Irish Constitution. If you adopt this clause you are enthroning your judiciary as the ultimate tribunal of appeal. You must not limit the powers of the Legislature which you intend to create. No Government is sound unless the lawmakers have the supreme power. We in England can't afford to give our Judges the power to say that the laws we make are bad. Judges are too far away from the people, and they understand too little of the people's wishes anef difficulties to give tbem such power. Look at the trouble the United States is having about this very matter. If thab is good enough for England it good enough for our beloved Here we have a Judge and a private caucus or coterie of barristers flouting an Act Parliament; and I stamp every member that Bar Association as endeavouring destroy the law of the land. Bill dealing with barristers was before State Parliament, the present member Kooyong, who was a member of that Parliament, felt that the people of the State were suffering under an injustice, and he moved a clause, which was out debate, so much did it appeal to the common sense of the members, to the effect that no> barrister or solicitor be entitled to costs as between party and party or between solicitor and client for instructions or for attendance on counsel, and so forth, where he or his partner or partners were acting and receiving a this case. fee as counsel for attending same matter and for the same He did his duty in trying to keep down costs. Clause 5 was passed for the purThe pose of controlling barristers. a Judge had no power over them if they were rude to him, though he could severely punish any solicitor. placed both barristers and solicitors on equality. The clause provided also every barrister could recover costs, but should be liable for negligence just as a solicitor was. Previous to that, a barrister could, in plain language, rob his client, and there was no recourse at law. The idea that he could not sue for his costs was all bunkum. It was one of the surrounding the legal profession. 7 provided that no barrister or solicitor parties. was to be deemed an officer of the Supreme Court. A solicitor previously was not an officer of the Court, and could be punished, but a barrister could not be. more, the Act provided that any barrister or solicitor who did not give attendance must return his fees as prothonotary or taxing master also he was made liable for negligence. Again, clause 10 provided that no person should be permitted to practise as a barof rister or solicitor solely, but that every person admitted by the Supreme should be admitted both as a barrister and solicitor. As long as that stands in an Act of Parliament, barrister belonging to the Barristers ciation is striving to break the law. have before me a letter signed by a great lawyer in Denmark. I shall not attempt Dr Maloney. is to read it in the original, but shall read Australia. a translation.

His father to died, and he was advised to go to law in When the reference to his will .

Yours sincerely, (Signed) FRITS BUELOW. writer of that letter is now the AttorPreviously, ney-General of Denmark. He is a sufficiently great lawyer to occupy that high position. Grunlund, in his Go-operative Parliament Commonwealth, has something to say on an this question. He tells us that in Denthat mark, if two men have a dispute, say, about a matter of £ 2 0 , and if Brown, who owes the money, is prepared to pay £ 1 5 , and Smith, to whom it is due, will not accept that sum, they are not permitted to go to law. They go before a magistrate, who is called a pacificator. He may advise the creditor to accept the smaller myths amount. If that is refused, the pacifiClause cator appoints a day for hearing both The cost of the proceedings amounts to about 8d. The evidence is taken down in writing. No barrister or solicitor is allowed to appear. But when a decision Furtheris given the case may be taken to a higher court. Both parties can then be represented substantial by lawyers, but no fresh evidence can be the called. The advocates must argue upon directed; the written evidence. Is it any wonder that in Denmark the method of administering justice has earned the encomiums students all over the world ? One more point, and I have done with the AttorCourt ney-General. He may recall the time when I was a loyal follower of his. We provision differed afterwards, because he failed to every carry out a policy which I hoped that he Assowould maintain. My hopes of him were I greater than he justified. His term as Premier of Victoria was distinguished by two measures, one of which was the Strike Coercion Bill, and the other the Separate Representation Bill. By the latter measure every police magistrate, every policeman, every civil servant, was robbed of his rights of citizenship, and could only vote for certain individuals. I am glad to say that two out of the three elected were Labour men, and the other one should have been a Labour man, because he signed our platform. The Government have appointed to the chairmanship of the Inter-State Commission a man who some time ago showed the white feather in a way that I have never seen  members of the Lawyers' Trade Union did not think that he was fit to be a High Court Judge, climbed down. If he was not fit to be a High Court Judge he was not fit to be the Chairman of the Inter-State Commission. I enter my protest against his appointment, and if ever we secure the power of a recall I shall vote to remove him. There are in Australia 52,000 permanent public servants, 13,000 temporary officers, and 15,000 exempted men, making a total of 80,000. The railways employ 60,392, including a salaried staff of 7,600 and 52,792 others, being a total of over 140,392. Attorney-General has been accused by the leader of His Majesty's Opposition in the State Parliament of having said from the platform that, under similar circumstances as occurred in Victoria some years ago, he would help to bring in a Bill in this Parliament to treat the public servants of Australia as he treated the public servants of Victoria some years ago. defy him to try it. He dare not. I venture to tell him that if , as is rumoured, he is appointed Chief Justice of the High Court, groans and curses will leap to the lips of the public servants, who have neither forgotten nor forgiven the way he robbed them of their rights of citizenship when he had that massive majority of thirty-five. Since then years have passed over and have whitened his hair. Now he sits in a Government with a majority of one, and I tell him to his face that he dare not do it. Aa for the talk of a dissolution, although I sit for a constituency which gave me an enormous majority, I cannot say that I should welcome anything of the kind. I should not. I should like both parties in this House to pass a Bill providing for the referendum and initiative, giving the people complete control over Parliament. At present they have control only once in three years. They ought to have control for every day, and every hour, in the three years. I trust that we shall not again see a Judge of the Supreme Court so far forgetting himself as to defy the law of the land which lie has taken an oath to uphold. If we do, I trust that the power of recall will be established, and will be used to remove him from the Bench. I make no attack upon the Courts. I believe that our Courts are as pure as any in the world. Although we have copied the English Judicature system, I believe that our Courts are even better than those in England. But we must remember that two-thirds of the law is not statute law, but Judge-made law. I should gladly welcome the passing of a law to provide that no law or decision should be quoted and be binding for longer than ten years. If that were done, we should not witness such a spectacle as we have had lately, when the charities of Victoria were robbed by a decision of the Supreme Court. My old friend, Charles Forrest, used to say to me that when he died his money would do good to the poor and needy. But the The charities have been robbed, not by an unjust decision, but by a legal interpretation of the wording of Mr Forrest's will. If ever a man wished to leave all he had to charity it was my old friend Charles Forrest, a man by whose side I sat in Parliament for years, and who often spoke to me with satisfaction of the good that his money would do. Yet these I legal gentlemen, by finesse or otherwise, have robbed the charities of the good that he intended to do. I trust that the day will come when the Judges of this country will be elected by Parliament, as they are in Switzerland. When that is brought about, there will be more justice in the land. At present, we have in this city a building which cost £300,000, and which is used, not for the administration of justice, but for raising points of law. My honourable friend the member for Capricornia has spoken of the nationalization of health. I have advocated a policy of that kind for many years, and I should also like to see the complete nationalization of law. Once again I venture to make an appeal to the Government, and especially to the Prime Minister. Let him accept the principle of the referendum and initiative, as advocated by the Age newspaper, which gave his party four seats in Victoria. It is a coming question, as shown by the fact that twenty-two States in America have adopted it . Why should we not extend the hand of friendship to each other, pass a measure of that kind, and then go to the country?

It has been said by press critics that I remarked immediately after the elections that I would not allow, so far as I was able to prevent it , a sacrilegious finger to be placed on any part of the Labour legislation of the last Parhonorable liament. A newspaper critic has twitted me with the fact that a sacrilegious finger is sought to be put on a great deal of that legislation by the proposals of the present Government. I would remind my critic that a finger is not sacrilegious, according to my view, in the political sense, unless it is superimposed with the prospect, or at least the intention, of moving or impressing the object which is to be affected by it . The mere fact of a finger pointing is not sacrilege. It may be rude to point, but it is not sacrilege. In other words, the sacrilegious finger, of which I was speaking, was not a fingerpost. We must draw that distinction. So long as our Liberal friends content themselves with merely indicating with this finger, not the road which they intend to go, but which the country is to believe they intend to go, and which they would like to go, as the honourable member for Gwydir interjects, so long will the finger cease to be sacrilegious within my view. I would like the Prime Minister to listen to reason in this matternot to go abroad and talk about leatherlunged time-wasters. Mere vituperation is not argument; mere reference to ""howling dingoes"" cannot possibly convince anybody, and as a man of peace I would suggest to the honourable gentleman who leads the House that he should pay fair deference-reason able respect-to the observations of honourable members on this side in regard to the difficult position in which we are placed. I put it to the Prime Minister that there are three courses open to him. He realizes and admits that without our co-operation no business can be done here in this Parliament. In those circumstances, h3 can do one of three things. He can take immediate steps to go to our masters, the electors. He can introduce matters of controversy-that is, matters on which it is worthwhile to have a controversy, and which we may advance to some extent by controversy. I see that in the policy paper there are some matters which might well be considered by the House. I notice that the Minister for External Affairs has indicated to honourable members the lines on which the proposed legislation in regard to national surance on a contributory basis, embracing sickness, accident, maternity, widowhood, and unemployment is to proceed. Here, in themselves, are some matters which might well be discussed in a sane, reasonable manner on the floor of the House. There are a great many other questions within the jurisdiction of the Federal Parliament which, as honourable members have pointed out, we might discuss here with profit and progress. What do the Government elect to do? They elect neither to go to the country at once, m d say they are unable to carry on, nor to promise us something on which we might be able to come to a basis of agreement. Most honourable members have said, "" We are ready to go to the country."" I think that the electors treated me about as generously as they treated any man on this side of the Chamber. I stand about fourth on the list of those who obtained a very large majority; but, while that is so, we have to remember that we have just come from the country. I am very hopeful and, indeed, confident that we would win on an appeal to the people, but, after all, there is no paper reason, so to speak, by which we can satisfy ourselves that the verdict of the people, if sought immediately, would be greatly different from that given at the election held a short time ago. We have to remember also that an election is a costly business, and, further, that the general public are not fond of elections.",63
299,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,It is a very doubtful business.,64
300,Mr BHENNAN,Unknown,"It is a very doubtful business generally, and the people as a whole do not care to have any more elections than they can help. They are not quite such dreadful things to the general public as they are to honourable members, I admit, but still the public are not fond of elections being held too frequently.",64
301,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,No more is the Prime Minister.,64
302,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"I am well aware of that, but heaven knows that with all the Parliaments there are in Australia we get too many elections, generally speaking. The three positions I put before the House are-one , that we go at once to the country; two, that we spend time in debating items of legislation which this party is absolutely pledged to oppose; and, three, that we spend time here considering matin- ters of national concern on which we might ultimately come to an agreement. The only indication we have of immediate legislation relates to matters such as the re-introduction of the postal vote, the robbing of unionists of their political rights as citizens, and the reinstatement of the policy of land monopoly in the Northern Territory. It is just as well that the country should know-and no time will be lost io impressing upon the country-that Labour party are absolutely opposed to these things. We could not, if we would, go back upon our promises to the electors. The electors sent us here on the distinct understanding that we would stand by our principles here assailed. In these circumstances, it is unthinkable that we will so far forget the trust which has been reposed in us as to permit of the passing of measures against our view of what is right. I understand that the Prime Minister says it is absurd to suppose that any Government would introduce legislation merely because they knew that it would be acceptable to the Opposition. I would remind him that the circumstances in which he finds himself are very peculiar. He has to suit himself to those extraordinary circumstances as best he can. In this House there is an equal number of members upon either side, whilst in the Senate there is an overwhelming majority in opposition to the Government. The Prime Minister should, therefore, either appeal to the country-recognising the present situation straight away as an impossible oneor he should introduce legislation which is likely to be acceptable to this House. Anything short of that is the veriest sham and humbug. It is nonsense to pretend that we will sanction the robbing of unionists of their rights. He knows perfectly well that any attempt of that sort is foredoomed to failure. It seems to me that it is nothing short of playing to the gallery. uttered these few words of wisdom, and having given the Prime Minister a hint or two as to how he should run this country, 1 will pass on to another topic. nearing the end of the debate, and after the Prime Minister has listened to me with that benevolent patience which characterizes him, I hope that he will come forward with an announcement that the Government intend to fall in with our wishes. I can assure him that I am not one of the leather-lunged desperadoes who wish to hold up the business of the country. But I do desire to say a few words in reference to the Government policy. I have already said that I will fight-because I must fight, both from conviction and from a sense of duty-the restoration of the postal vote. I wish to put this aspect of the case to the Government. Almost every honourable member upon this side of the House has quoted instances in which, from his point of view, Mr Brennan. the the postal vote lms been misused. I am not going to prove these particular cases. The answer given to them has been, '' Why do you not prosecute the offenders?"" that is not a legitimate answer. It is not a question of whether we can successfully prosecute and convict individuals; it is a question of whether the system of voting commands anything like public confidence. If there is one thing more than another which ought to be pure, it is our electoral law. If that law is corrupt, then the whole edifice of Democracy reared on it will be of unstable character. Our electoral law should be sound, and, as far as possible, pure. My honourable friends opposite, I dare say, will agree with that view. Now, the great test of purity is public confidence. When we find-as we do find in this House-partie s equally divided, it is the strongest possible indication that the postal vote does not command public confidence, for that was one of the matters on which we were returned. We are about to appeal to the great jury of the people. But whenever you are about to appeal to a jury, I would remind the honourable member for Melbourne that jou have the right of challenge. There is the obligation imposed upon us of seeing that the jury as far as possible is a clean onea jury free from all bias. In other words, every effort should be made to insure a fair trial. In attempting to restore the postal vote, which, according to the reHaving sults of the last election, is absolutely distasteful to at least one-half of the people of Australia, the action of the Government is tantamount to saying, "" We will We are make our appeal to the people, but before we do so we shall see that the jury is packed."" We have had sufficient instances of how the postal vote was misused. It is not necessary to repeat them. But I cannot pass from this subject without asking honourable members "" Who are the members of this party who talk about enfranchising electors whom the Labour party has disfranchised?"" Extending the franchise forsooth! They are the class of persons who, aided by their press friends and associations like the Women's National League, have done everything in their power to prevent the extension of the franchise when it was attempted by our party. They and their press friends have during the whole history of the franchise campaign consistently opposed every extension of the franchise. The honourable member for Kooyong, in whose electorate more postal votes were recorded than recorded in the whole of Western Ausstoring tralia- a circumstance which requires a little explanation-wa s one of them. When his attention was called to this ter, he said that the reason more postal votes were registered there was that the people of Victoria were more used to the system. He added that they votes were recorded against us. were getting still more used to it . I suppose they would shortly have become so used to it that it would not been necessary for his electors to go to ballot-box at all. They would have been able to record their votes in the most peditious manner without having the ligation imposed upon them of attending a polling booth. But the honourable memcases ber should cast his memory back to period when he represented a portion my constituency, namely, Fitzroy. would like to know what his views would have been if he had been representing Kooyong in those days, when he told the - Legislative Assembly of Victoria that time was not yet ripe for the extension the franchise to women. Not women, but all women, were to be all disfranchised. Similarly, Mr Robert Harper, who represented Mernda in the last Parliament, opposed the extension the franchise, not merely to sick women, but to all women, and also to "" mere working men. The principle of one adult one vote was anathema to him. It was, too, to the honourable member for Gramthe pians, who now saysAt present they had universal suffrage. If it was proved to work for the good of the people it would be all right. However, he thought tt would be better to take the ratepayers' for electing members of Parliament. The in the street should not have a vote if not on the ratepayers' roll. The waster, the loafer, and beer-sparrer should be debarred from voting. Why should such men be placed on the same standing as those who are industricome ous and a credit to the nation? Owing to government during the past three years this grand country was practically mortgaged for the twenty-five years. Golden words from the honourable memshall ber for Grampians! I would remind him that, if he will trace the history of struggle of the masses for emancipation and the right to vote, if he will look into the dens in which some men live in this and other countries, he will probably find that their condition as wasters and beergard sparrers is the direct result of legislation which men like himself and his lineal political ancestors have placed upon the statute-book. I think that it is an act were of political indecency to talk of rethe crude system of the postal vote in the present circumstances and in opposition to the wish of, at least, matone-half of the voters of Australia. Honourable members opposite say that the Labour party are opposed to postal voting because the majority of the postal That, however, carries us no further, since the answer to it is simply that the Minishave terial party wish to reinstate the system the because they obtained under it a few more votes than we. Rather than raise that arguexment, it would be only fair to ask honorobable members opposite to explain why they did get more postal votes in those where the majority of votes cast at the the ballot-box were favourable to the of Labour candidate. If they would give I us some honest explanation of that rather remarkable phenomenon, it would be more to the point than is their action in merely accusing us of political dishonesty the because we object to a certain system of of recording votes which we say is open to a few abuse, has been abused, and reinstates the old troubles incidental to men and women recording their votes in the presence of those interested in having them of recorded in a certain way.",64
303,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"It does away "" with the secrecy of the ballot.",66
304,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"It does. It brings us back to those old-time conditions when employee recorded his vote at his peril in the presence of the employer; when the tenant recorded his vote at his peril in the presence and with the knowledge of roll his landlord. It brings us back to those man times of oppression which it is the proud he is boast of the Labour party it has done so much to abolish. I wish to tell honourable members opposite that I would welany safe proposal-and the responsibad bility rests on them rather than upon us, next to make one-that would give facilities for sick persons to record their votes. I welcome any proposal that can be safely introduced which will have the the effect of extending the fran?hise to any person who would be likely otherwise to be disfranchised. But it must be a proposal which is free from those grave objections that have been pointed out in reto the exercise of the postal vote. For instance, in regard to the absentvoting system, a scare was raised which proved to be a mare's nest. It was greedily seized upon by the Liberal party and their friends in the press as a scandal which they thought they might work up against us, but the threatened explosion proved to be a mere squib.",66
305,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,They were disappointed.,67
306,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"Yes . That is no uncommon experience, so far as we are concerned. We are not entirely unused to such a thing. While that is so, I am quite prepared to see the system of absent voting submitted to any reasonable test. I do not stand pledged to any particular form of absent voting. I am prepared to see the present system surrounded by any safeguards that can be suggested as likely to improve it. I do not say that we must have the system of absent voting exactly as it is at present, although honourable members opposite declare that we must have a certain system of postal voting. If they can suggest a better form of absent voting, let us have it with greater security, if greater security be needed. My final word upon the subject is that, while the Liberal party went into hysterics in regard to the absent-voting system, it has been proved, so far as the inquiry has gone, to be absolutely free from abuse; whereas, so far as we have gone into the question of postal voting, our case that it is inherently open to abuse, and that it has been abused in hundreds of instances, is substantially proved. The case against postal voting on grounds of public policy and public confidence has been made out; Perhaps at this stage the Prime Minister will agree that I should have leave to continue my remarks tomorrow.",67
307,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Not yet.,67
308,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"I am quite prepared to go on, more especially as the Attorney-General, whom we do not always have with us, is present. I am going to ask him to do me the honour of listening to some observations concerning the subject of industrial unrest. I should like to have a heart to heart talk with him, as one fellow unionist to another, about this matter. It is curious that, in the last Parliament, one of the great complaints made against the Labour party was-indeed , if I remember rightly, it was one of the grounds of the want of confidence motion levelled against the Labour party-that we had failed to deal adequately with the great problem of industrial unrest. That was one of the Liberal party's grounds of attack. The question of industrial unrest is undoubtedly most important. I certainly would be the last to underrate it ; yet we find that the present Government, after the storm they raised throughout the country as to the cause and effect of industrial unrest, have presented a programme-which , by our grace, they were allowed to digest and consider for a month-in which they make but two propositions for its settlement. Mark what these propositions are. In the first place, they propose to deprive one section of the people-the unionists, and that the most law-abiding sectionof their political rights; while, secondly, they propose to drive another section of the workers outside the law altogether. That is the' sum and substance of their political programme in regard to the great question of industrial unrest. Let me deal briefly with the question of preference to unionists. My words will be few, but I hope they will be enough. I am in the very happy position of knowing that the Attorney-»General largely agrees with me, or, rather, that I largely agree with him upon this subject. The Attorney-General says, "" I would wipe out preference of every kind."" On that point, I am not in agreement with him.",67
309,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,Lega l preference.,67
310,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"The honourable gentleman said that he would wipe out legal preference altogether. When he made that statement, there were cheers from the ranks of Tuscany-fro m the party behind the Government. Nevertheless, his party is bound to the principle of legal preference to unionists; that is inferentially admitted In their programme. It is very interesting to know that the Attorney-General does not believe in the principle, and that honourable members of his party applaud him when he says that hedoes not believe in it. But, after all, beyond the fact that it shows that both the Cabinet and its supporters are somewhat divided on the question, it is not a matter of practical politics. The philosophic negatives of the Attorney-General will carry us no further. They may be interesting, but they do not advance usone step. He says that he would wipe out all sorts of legal preference. Hisparty, on the other hand, is committed to preference to unionists, as I understand, subject to the condition which - was imposed in the original Act. In other words, as the policy statement sets forth , they would prohibit preference to unionists being granted by the Court tomembers of any organization, any part of whose funds are directly or indirectly - applicable to political purposes. That is the principle upon which, under certain - conditions, preference is to be denied to - unionists; but honourable members opposite concede that, in certain other - conditions, preference should be granted to unionists. I wish honourable members to mark that. I do not say that the Liberal party are very keen about the nlatter, or even that they really believe in it , but it is their avowed policy. They recognise that public opinion is strongly in favour of the principle, and they - come here, therefore, with a proposal for a modified preference to unionists. One of the reasons for this must be that they recognise that arbitration is based 'upon preference. Another must be that the y realise that the man who, as a member of an organization, submits himself to the arbitrament of the Court, and gives tip his right to strike- a man who is a real friend to liis fellow workers-shoul d fee entitled, under certain conditions, to preference. These must be some of the reasons which move honourable members opposite to say that they will give preference to unionists under certain conditions. We say that the reasons are overwhelmingly in favour of the principle, and,, at least, they are sufficient to move the Government to. put preference to unionists in their policy, save where it is proved that a union's funds are devoted to political purposes. If . these reasons or any of them, are sufficient to induce the Government topropose preference to unionists, I ask the Attorney-General, and his supporters, how they can consistently deprive any man of the benefits of preference-to which they say he is entitled , for these reasons, or some othermerely because he holds certain political views. The position works down to that. There is no logical escape from it . The Attorney-General, I feel certain, knows perfectly well that there is no escape from it , and that is where I agree with him. I am not attributing to him something which he does not say, but this must be in his mind when he says, "" I would wipe away all preference."" Mr W . H . IRVINE - All legally - cible preferences, certainly.",67
311,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,He would wipe that away altogether; but his colleagues are favourable to the retention of legallyenforced preference under certainconditions.,68
312,Mr WEST,Unknown,They have two opinions on that side.,68
313,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"Yes , but I am concerned only with the opinion of the Government. If men are entitled to preference for any of the reasons which I have put before the House-reason s which appeal overwhelmingly to those on this side, and with sufficient force to ouropponents - ho w can the Liberal party, standingfor Democracy and equal rights, in the name of freedom, say, ' * You shall not use union funds for advancing opinions which are distasteful to us; if you do you shall be robbed of the preference to which you are entitled."" If a political opinion is a legal one, it does not matter how extravagant it may be. The Minister of Trade and Customs said the other night, "" I have heard of unionists who talk about making war on capitalism, who talk about the eternal war that must go on between capital and labour.""' He seemed to think that it would be an enormity to give such men preference. A war on capital might be a good thing or a bad thing, but every free man is entitled to hold what political opinion he likes, so longas he respects the rights of his fellows. If a union thinks that a war on capital is a proper thing to attempt, why should it not nse its funds to propagate that opinion ? Mr KING O'MALLEY - Capita l is dangerous.",68
314,Mr BRENNAN,Unknown,"I am not committing myself to any opinion on the subject. My point is that it is illogical in the extreme for gentlemen who talk about liberty and equal rights for all to try to rob a section of the community of its rights because of political opinions that are distasteful to them. It is they who are drawing distinctions between class and class, and who are penalizing one section as against others. It is they who are creating class antagonism. Can there be any doubt in the minds of those who have heard this discussion that the antipathy to preference to unionists is based, not on the application of union funds for political purposes, but on the application of those funds for political purposes antagonistic to enforthe Liberal party? Honourable members opposite have quoted rule books and balance-sheets to show how much has been spent by unions in and how little has been distributed benefits. I remind them that it is longer the chief business of unions tribute doles and pecuniary relief to members. Their object is avowedly openly, by co-operative effort, to about the passing of laws giving rights to all men. If it pleases the to use their funds to obtain the management and the best organizers their work, they are abundantly in so using them. When honourable bers opposite say, "" We believe in trade unionism, but not in political they say in effect, "" We believe in ism with its teeth drawn; in pious gatherestablished beyond criticism. ings of persons who solemnly desire benefit each other, but have no power to is wholly and do so; we do not believe in which means the organized efforts who have not only the will but the to effect legislative reforms."" utterly unable to understand the mental attitude of honourable members who talk about equal opportunity equal freedom for all, and whose first legislative proposal is to hamstring a tion of the community so that it shall injure them at the ballot-box. to the expenditure of unions on manageactually ment, I would remind honourable opposite of a fact that they should write filed and conciliation conferences. in red letters, keeping it before eyes when they go to the country, thinking deeply about it when they go to bed at night, namely, that many thoualways sands of pounds of union money been spent in an absolutely unequal effort to get the benefits promised by the arbiacting tration laws. Honourable members posite invited the workers to under the Arbitration Act avoid industrial strife by the method of the Court. If you look long list of cases brought Arbitration Court, many of them, as the honourable member for said, taken on to the High you will find that those who been invited and persuaded their disputes to be settled on their merits have been fought by the employers on questions of jurisdiction, technical tions of law, and constitutional tions. It is a poor enough thing any circumstances to fight men who are trying to obtain only a living the questions that have engrossed Mr Brennan. moneyCourts and made the unions heart-sick management, have been questions not connected with in the merits of the disputes. I speak from no personal experience. It ill becomes those to diswho represent the class responsible for their this to talk of unionists defying the law. and In no single instance have the employers bring extended the hand of friendship to the equal workers, saying, "" Let us put aside unions technicalities and questions of jurisdicbest tion, and have your claims dealt with for on their merits."" Had that been done, justified there would have been a hundred successmemf u l appeals to the Arbitration Court where there have been only ten, and the unionism,"" usefulness of the Court, about which we unionhave heard so much, would have been If the to Court has done little good, the fault solely that of the unionism party opposite, and of their friends of men outside, who have done their level power best to prevent it from becoming the I am benevolent institution which it could be. W it h all its limitations, and with all the opposite hostility and animosity which has been and shown by the employing class, respondents in the different causes that secthe workmen have brought before it , the not Court has worked a great deal of good In regard in the community, not only in the awards given, but more particularly in members the industrial agreements that have been It is extraordinary the misapprehension their that seems to exist, and the misreand presentation that constantly takes place in regard to the operation of the Act . I regarded the honourable member have for Wimmera as a fair-minded man in debate, but even he spoke of the Court without Tegard to local or climatic opconditions. If the honourable member had register read the history of a single case, he would and to have known that the Court does not peaceful adjudicate without regard to such condiat the tions, but always pays the fullest rebefore the gard to them. Such fancied disregard is not the cause of the dissatisfaction with Melbourne the Court; the cause is, as I have said, Court, the hostility of one section of the people,, have who, although they invite the workmen to allow to come in, pillory the in as soon as they do so. It is not too much to say that those people have taken the very life quesblood out of the workmen who have inlimitavoked the aid of what ought to be a in peaceful tribunal. Owing to the lateness of the hour, I ask leave to continue my wage; but speech at next sitting. the Leave granted; debate adjourned. ADJOURNMENT. COCKBURN SOUND NAVAL BASE. Motion (by Mr. JOSEPH posedThat the House do now adjourn.",68
315,Mr BURCHELL,Unknown,"Fremantle) [10.57]. - I desire to ventilate a matter which is of sufficient importance to justify my claiming the attention of the House at this hour. I have today received a wire from Fremantle, which states that twelv-3 men were dismissed on Friday at the Henderson Naval Base; that there are now no survey hands employed there, and only one gang working on the water. The wire also says that it is reported that the naval men are to act as watchmen, and that the work will be closing in a week or two, there being now only forty men engaged in this particular work.",70
316,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Fro m whom is the wire ?,70
317,Mr BURCHELL,Unknown,"F r o m the secretary of the Trades H all , Fremantle, who happens to be also secretary to the union with which those men are associated. question of the construction of a navai base at Jervoise Bay has been before this House and another different times, and we have been trying to secure from the Government some definite statement in regard to their future action. We have found out some rather peculiar things. On the 19th of last month, the Prime Minister stated that there would be four or five years' delay while waiting to see whether the dredging operations were a success. On the same day, there was an admission from the Prime Minister that the Henderson Baso should be established at Jervoise Bay, Admiral Henderson having recommended this particular site. as far back as the 13th of last month, we had the statement that it was intended to cease all work except surveying. On the 27th of last month I pointed out, and today I point out, that the surveyors themselves are being put off; and now we have this wire saying that no surveyors are engaged. I think there is some ground for alarm on the part of the people in the Fremantle area respecting the intentions of the Government. The Minister of Defence, in another place, has stated that the Government are acting on the advice of the first naval member of the Naval Board, and that the advice given by Admiral [32] Creswell was to employ an expert. I desire to draw the attention of the House to the fact that Admira l Creswell's letter is COOK) pro- dated the 12th August-the very day that we assembled-and that on that day there was a copy of the Government's intentions already in print. It seems to me an extraordinary thing that the letter should be of the same date as that on which we had a statement of policy from the Government laid on the table of the House. We can, I think, reasonably ask whether this is, not a question for the Naval Board, but a question of Government policy, and whether the Cabinet are not directly responsible for the cessation of work at Cockburn Sound ? I go so far as to say that one member of the Cabinet in particular appears to be standing in the way; and I regret to have to make this statement. On reference to Hansard of the 21st and 22nd of last month, we find that the Treasurer, by interjection, has repeatedly stated that Mangel's Bay, or Rockingham, is infinitely better than Jervoise Bay. The; Sir JOHN FORREST - Hear , hear! I know it is.",70
318,Mr BURCHELL,Unknown,"It would appear place at that this is not a question for the determination of the Naval Board, but that the Treasurer is actually the one who is responsible for the stoppage of work at .the present time.",70

320,Mr BURCHELL,Unknown,"It is ""grossly""correct.",70
321,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,It is grossly incorrect.,70
322,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Does the honourable member wish money to be spent in the wrong place without expert advice? Then,",70
323,Mr BURCHELL,Unknown,"As to expert advice, we had, in the first instance, A d miral Henderson's report, wherein he stated that, in his opinion, Jervoise Bay is the better site. »",70
324,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,He did not say so.,70
325,Mr BURCHELL,Unknown,"I am quoting from memory, but I find now on reference to his report that Admiral Henderson said It appeared to me that a site in the vicinity of Jervoise Bay was best suited for naval docking requirements. That is on page 56 of the report.",70
326,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Admira l Henderson also spoke of expert advice.,70
327,Mr BURCHELL,Unknown,"He did ; but A d miral Henderson had been over this particular sheet of water from one end to another; and, after obtaining all the local information in possession of the Government, he made that very significant remark. I should like to know exactly the position. On the 2nd September, we had the Treasurer, according to a statement in the Argus, wiring to the Mayor of Fremantle a long telegram in which he stated, amongst other things, that there was nothing in the least to be alarmed about, and that, from a Western Australian and an Australian point of view, there was reason for satisfaction, and that dredges were under order to dredge the channel. Seeing that the Fisher Administration also had a direct recommendation from the members of the Naval Board that Jervoise Bay was the better site, I cannot for the life of me understand why there is need for this cessation of work today. fore, it appears to me to be a case of A d miral Henderson supported by the Naval Board versus my right honourable friend the Treasurer. The people of Fremantle and the members of this House want to know - exactly what the intentions of the Government are. Are they going to close down the works ? If so, why not be honest and open, and say so ? Why should Ministers shelter themselves behind statements to the effect that they are waiting, for further data, when, as a matter of fact, they are destroying the means whereby that data can be secured ?",71
328,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"ParramattaPrime Minister) [11.6] - I should like to say, in reply to my honourable friend who has just sat down, that it is not a good way to get this work hurried on to hurl such charges about the chamber. so will not lead to the employment of another man, or to any more work being done than is being done now. sinister allegations about action on the part of the Treasurer are quite unworthy of ""my honourable friend, and unworthy of those who are prompting him from the other end. I should like to tell my honourable friend that this Government, as long as it occupies its present position, will not have its policy dictated by any outside body whatever. Let that be distinctly understood.",71
329,Mr BURCHELL,Unknown,Not even from the experts ?,71
330,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"All this trouble has come because of the policy of the party of which my honourable friend is a member-becaus e of their failure to get expert advice as recommended by Admiral Henderson.
