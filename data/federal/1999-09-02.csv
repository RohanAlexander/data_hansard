(2) How many case managers employed by employment service providers, undertaking work behalf of the Commonwealth pursuant to the contracted Government's employment service which was announced on 9 November 1998, are performing duties in, or concerning persons who are unemployed or are seeking employment assistofficer ance in, the electoral division of Barton. (3) Is the number of clients who receive service pursuant to the Government's service delivery customers. model a relevant factor in determining the success of the model. (4) Will the Minister establish how many clients in total have been assisted through the new service delivery model in the electoral division of Barton since 1 July 1998; if not, why not. Mr Reith-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (l) The electorate of Barton (NSW) was serviced by the Rockdale and St George (formerly Hurstville) CES outlets. On 1 July 1996 St George and Rockdale had 34 and 32 officers respectively responsible for serving members of the public. (2--4) Centrelink's new service delivery model announced by the Hon Warren Truss MP, the then Minister for Community Services, on 9 November 1998, is not about case management. Case management was provided by government and community sector organisations to job seekers prior to the introduction of Job Network in May 1998 whereas the new one-main contact service is now being implemented by Centrelink. Centrelink's service improvement will mean that each customer service officer takes responsibility for a pool of customers which ensures that the NA customer has continuity of contact within Centrelink with a customer service officer who is known to them. The one-main contact officer takes responsibility for all ongoing business relating to the customers in their pool. Simple customer enquiries continue to be handled by Centrelink Call Service or reception staff in customer service centres. Under the Job Network, the Commonwealth has contracted around 300 private, community and government organisations to find jobs for unemployed people. The Commonwealth does not contract organisations for certain numbers of staff. Staffing levels are a matter for Job Network members and would depend on the services they on are providing, the number of clients they are to assist and their individual approach delivery model to service delivery. I have arranged through the Office of the Minister for Community Services for a Centrelink to contact Mr MCClelland's office to offer him a personal briefing about how one-main contact works and the benefits it provides to Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business: Grants to the National Farmers Federation (Question No. 652) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, upon notice, on 1 June 1999: (1) Has the Minister or a department or agency administered by the Minister provided grants to the National Farmers' Federation (NFF) or bodies related to the NFF since 2 March 1996; if so, (a) in each case, (i) what was the nature of the grant and (ii) for what purpose was it provided and (b) what total sum was provided.

Discrimination on the basis of race, colour, sex, sexual preference, age, physical or mental disability, marital status, family responsibilities, pregnancy, religion, political opinion, national extraction or social origin is prohibited. There is only one area of recruitment activity where preference is given to certain citizens: the department employs four Indigenous Australians under the program arrangements authorised by section 33 (4) (b) of the Public Service Act 1922 and Public Service Regulation 7lB (1). Special programs authorised by these provisions are open only to Indigenous applicants who are not current APS officers. The merit principle is applied when assessing Indigenous applicants against selection criteria for these positions. (b) The salary ranges for these four positions are: APS 3 $33,925-$35,688 Executive Levell $55,460-$59,891. NA Austrade has four programs that may be categorised as positive discrimination programs: Indigenous Cadetship Program The Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs (DETYA) through its Training for Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders Program provides assistance to agencies for indigenous cadets that they employ. The student cadets must be studying an approved full-time undergraduate degree course at an Australian tertiary institution, and must participate in a work placement within the employing agency during the long break at the end of the academic year. On successful completion of the cadetship they advance to a position in the employing agency that requires specific professional qualifications. Austrade currently employs one indigenous cadet under this scheme. This person completed the second year of a Law/Commerce Degree at the University of Melbourne in 1998 and undertook the work experience component of the program in the Invest Australia unit located in Austrade's Melbourne office. DETYA supports Austrade and the cadet by providing academic salary support, books and equipment allowance ($350 per annum), compulsory course fees, fares for travel from the cadet's permanent address and place of study, and recruitment assistance. Austrade is responsible for paying the cadet under the general conditions of service which apply to Austrade employees and for providing a work placement for the indigenous cadet during the long academic break (from November to Februaryapproximately 8 to 12 weeks of employment). Austrade is also responsible for paying the annual HECS fees incurred throughout the course of study. Funding Commitment Austrade funding commitment is approximately $18,000 per annum for the gross salary component and approximately $4000 per year for annual HECS fees. Total yearly commitment $30,000 on average. Assistance to Indigenous Exporters Australian Indigenous Exporters Program Austrade began the Australian Indigenous Cultures Export Program in 1995, with financial assistance from the Aboriginal and Torres .Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC). The program delivers targeted Austrade assistance to indigenous clients to assist them to achieve exports. Under an arrangement with ATSIC, Austrade's export assistance to indigenous clients can be provided with ATSIC subsiding up to half Austrade's standard fees. Similar assistance from ATSIC is available to support indigenous clients' participation in selected International Trade Displays. Australian Indigenous Export Products Directory Austrade publishes the Australian Indigenous Export Products Directory. The 1999 edition was launched in January 1999. Ethnic Exporter Program Austrade recognises and actively responds to the cultural and language requirements of its clients.

A database of foreign language skills within Austrade in Australia has been prepared and has been made available to all Austrade offices throughout Australia. Austrade offices continue to work with a wide range of bilateral and ethnic business chambers and organisations to support them and their members in export-related activities. Women in Export Program Austrade is a regular organiser and sponsor of seminars and workshops around Australia that support the specific needs of businesswomen entering the export market.

Goods and Services Tax: Price Rises (Question No. 797) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 9 August 1999: Did the Government's modelling of the impact of the Goods and Services Tax and its other tax changes on consumers reveal that prices will only rise by 1.9%; if so, did the modelling include the impact of rises in parking meter fees by local government.

International Labour Convention: Child Labour Ban (Question No. 809) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, upon notice, on 9 August 1999: Amount ($OOOs) 14,005 11,880 l3,661 12,866 13,514 l3,963 14,220 14,254 14,289 19,983 Is he able to say what views were expressed by (a) government, (b) worker and (c) employer representatives at the 8- session of the Internationby al Labour Conference in Geneva, 1 to 17 June 1999, concerning a new convention aimed at an immediate universal ban on the worse forms of child labour. Mr Reith-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The delegate representing the Australian Government on the Conference Committee on Child Labour made the following statement to that Committee: The Australian Government strongly supports the adoption of new instruments aimed at the suppression of the most extreme forms of child labour. The Convention should be flexible and capable of universal ratification, but should impose clear obligations on each ratifYing State to take actions appropriate to the gravity of the worse forms of child labour as well as appropriate to national conditions. The Convention should therefore be concise, principles based and clearly focused on extrerne forms of child labour. These characteristics would help ensure that sufficient onus is placed on Members to make continual progress towards achieving the aim of the Convention. Australia also supports a Recommendation that provides guidance on the way in which the Convention could be implemented. The Recommendation should not however, be regarded as the only way in which the Convention could be implemented, nor should its provisions be regarded as compulsory. Australia believes that the proposed text of both instruments meets these requirements, subject to some modifications which we intend to propose for discussion. As is the custom at International Labour Conferences, the Employers' spokesperson and the Workers' spokesperson each made an intervention on behalf of their constituents, and were supportive of the new Convention and Recommendation. Consequently, the Australian worker and employer representatives did not separately express views on this matter. Both the Convention and Recommendation were unanimously supported by the Conference in plenary session. The four Australian delegates (ie two government, one employer and one worker) voted in favour of the adoption of the new Convention and Recommendation. UNESCO Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict (Question No. 834) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 10 August 1999: (1) Was the lOOth anniversary of the first Hague Peace Conference celebrated at The Hague on 17 May 1999. (2) As part of the celebrations did the Government of the Netherlands stage an opening for signature ceremony for the Second Protocol (The Hague 1999) to the Unesco Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict (The Hague, 1954). (3) Who represented Australia at the ceremony. (4) Which countries have become parties to the Convention since his answer to Question No. 586 (Hansard, 7 June 1999, page 4982). (5) Which countries have signed the Second Protocol. (6) Which department is responsible for the Protocol. (7) Which Ministers must approve the Protocol (8) What is the timetable for Australia to sign the Protocol. Mr Downer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) Yes. (3) Australia was represented at the ceremony by Australia's Ambassador to the Netherlands, H.E. Mr Ted Delofski and the Third Secretary in the Australian Embassy in The Hague, Ms Natalie Toohey. (4) None. (5) Thirty States have signed the Protocol as at 25 August 1999. They are: Albania, Austria, Belgium, Cambodia, COte d'Ivoire, Croatia, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Germany, Ghana, Greece, Holy See, Hungary, Indonesia, Italy, Luxembourg, Madagascar, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Oman, Pakistan, Peru, Qatar, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Syria and Yemen. (6) The Protocol is a more complex instrument than the Convention, in so far as its substance relates to the laws of war, which is relevant to the Department of Defence, to regimes for the protection of heritage which fall within the portfolio responsibilities of the Departments of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts and Environment and Heritage, to international cooperation in criminal matters which is the responsibility of the Attorney-General's Department and to aspects of international humanitarian law which are the responsibilities of the Attorney-General's Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. At present, Australia's response to the Protocol is being managed through an inter-departmental committee involving all these Departments chaired by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. (7) The Ministers for Foreign Affairs, Defence, Environment and Heritage and the Arts and the Centenary of Federation, and the Attorney-General. The Prime Minister would also be informed. (8) Ministers have not yet taken a decision to sign the Protocol. An obvious deadline for a decision whether or not to sign the Protocol would be the Protocol's own closure for signature on 31 December 1999. The inter-departmental committee will report to relevant Ministers on the committee's recommendations as to further action concerning the Protocol by the end of September. If the outcome of Ministers' deliberations is that Australia should sign the Protocol, this would most likely take place between October and December. If Australia does not sign the Protocol by the date of closure for signature, this would not prevent Australia becoming a Party to the Protocol at a later date.",175
