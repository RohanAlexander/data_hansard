Mr Bruce. - I have read im the press some comment of the kind, but I have not. received any direct communication the subject fro m Mr Larkinor the Comto monwealth Shipping Board.

3,Mr BRUCE,SYDNEY WATERFRON T DISPUTE,"The Government has not agreed to make any payments to blacklegs,, but has agreed to makean amount of £5,000 available to certain sons whoduring a critical period of the late war came to the assistance of the Commonwealth by enabling transports to be loaded. They rendered services whichNorthern were imperative in theinterests of whole nation. The Government is under no. legal obligation to those men, but a very considerable moral obligation to them. By a recent decision of the A r b i - by a' person irr Darwin. tration Court, they are precluded from continuing in the employment they had enjoyed since 1917, and in the circumments, stances the Government was justified i recognizing the great services they renexpedition-, dered at a time of national necessity.

DOUGLA SMAW SON WRECK . Can RELIEF EXPEDITION : FORMA TM o n o N FOB ADJOURNMENT. Mr SPEAKER. - I have received fro m the Acting leader of the Opposition (Mr . Anstey) anintimation that he proposes, to move, the adjournment of the House, to discuss a definite matter of urgent public importance,, namely,, "" The regrettable on delay of the Government in sending relief the wh.ite women in the hands of--the-- . reblacks in the NorthernTerritory."" Five honourable members having risen in their places, Question proposed.",13
5,Mr ANSTEY,SYDNEY WATERFRON T DISPUTE,"Bourke) [ 1 1 . 5 ] - I move That the House do now adjourn . 1 I did not submit this motion yesterday because I was not able to give the Prime sufficient notice of it , and, with that unfailing courtesy which distinguishesthe Opposition, I thought it only Comright that he should have anopportunity l the to obtain any information that might for assist him torebut my charges. 1 The mioition arises, out of statements made in the House by the Prime. Minister and the Minister for Home and Territories (Senator Pearce). and other statements perby the owners of the Huddersfield, which : were published in yesterday's newspapers:. Rumoiuajs. that a couple of white women were in the' hand's of the blacks, in the Territory took definite shapeon the the 18th July, when the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr . has Nelson) brought before the House certain facta that had. been communicated to him The Prime Minister promised that immediate action would be taken to investigate the stateand if it was. thoughtthat they n possibly had some foundationi n fact,, an for the rescue of. the unfortunate women would be: organized at once. At 'the moment when the Governdisment came to the conclusion that the rumours were sufficiently credible, to be . worthy o£ investigation, it becameits duty in the interests of humanity to movew it h promptitude, and to employ all the resources of civilization at its command to effect a rescue. But no one who has studied events during the last eight weeks can come to any other conclusion than that the Government has shown indifference and a leisurely self-confidence that must meet with . general scorn and disapprobation. On . a former occasion I said that if the unfortunate prisoners had been women who enjoyed some social distinction Ministers would have moved with ** all possible rapidity to their rescue. I shall not repeat that statement today, because it may seem to some honourable member improper and unjustified; but I do believe that if an SOS. call had come across the sea from some vessel in distress that the lives of human beings were in jeopardy, the survey ship Geranium, which is equipped with a seaplane, wireless, and a motor boat, would not have been allowed to linger on the edge of the Barrier Reef, nor H . M . A . S . JJrisbayne to remain in the harbour of Rabaul. Either or both boats would have been dispatched with the utmost promptitude to the point of danger. The Government took no such action in regard to the women who are believed to be in the hands of the blacks. The Prime Minister communicated with the Department of Home and Territories, prestunahly because the Northern Territory is under the control of that department, to the officials of which might be left . any action that was necessary to uphold the good name and the credit of the Commonwealth as a country that studies the welfare of its people. The Minister for Home and Territories communicated with the Administrator of the Northern Territory on the 18th July, but on 1st August the honourable member for the Northern Territory asked in the House if it were true that the Huddersfield, which had been chosen to convey the relief expedition, was still lying in the harbour at Darwin , and, if so, whether the Minister did not think that that was a tragic state of affairs and a reflection upon the Administration. In replying, the Minister, representing the Minister for Home and Territories, in formed the House that the departure of the Huddersfieldis being seriously delayed on account of there not being a certificated mate available in Darwin for the vessel. This position has Mr Anstey. arisen through the master,' Captain Lawson, refusing to take command, necessitating the appointment of the mate, who holds a master's certificate, as master. No. other certificated mate is available, and the Administrator has requested permission for the vessel, to be allowed to proceed on her voyage without a certificated mate on the understanding that a competent able seaman who knows the coast well acts in that position. Although this was a matter of life and death, the Administration had to adhere to formalities and observe the law with the utmost rigidity ! It could not sweep the law aside and allow the ship to put to sea without a certificated mate, although there was in the crew an able seaman who had navigated a small auxiliary vessel from Darwin to Singapore and back, a distance of S,000 miles, and was pell acquainted with the Northern Terri tory coast! The Huddersfield did not put to sea until the 5th August, and six days after her departure' she was still within 200 miles of Darwin. Everybody knows thai; 'the Geranium could have travelled from the Barrier Reef across the Gulf of Carpentaria to the vicinity of Borro-loola in a very few days. This tragedy has brought to light some facts in connection with the administration of the Northern Territory. The Huddersfield, is associated in a mail contract with the John Alee. The latter was originally a Government vessel, but because it was found unsuitable the Government sold it to the Boucaut Bay O i l Company for approximately £800, a third of the purchase price paid for it by the Commonwealth. Then, without any advertisement or other public notification, the Government granted to the owners of this 40-ton auxiliary schooner a subsidy of £1,000 - per annum, although it had sold the vessel, lock!, stock, and barrel to the company for £ 8 0 0 . In the end, the Huddersfield proceeded leisurely on its course, and I read in yesterday's newspaper a statement by the 'owners that Ihe delay was due to the action of the unions in Darwin. By that statement the owners tried to hide their own default. Only at the last moment has that excuse been advanced. The Assistant Minister said that the delay was wholly due to the fact that the captain had refused to take command ; that, therefore, the mate was being appointed master; and that a mate to take his place had to be found. Even after the crew was organized, the ship could still not proceed to sea because the Government had to enroll special constables to accompany the expedition. I do not blame the Assistant Minister for these excuses; he only conveyed to the House information that had been supplied to him by the Home and Territories Department, which, no doubt, relied upon the statements received from the Administrator at Darwin. It appears that the special constables were not sworn in until the 31st July. A further excuse offered was that the vessel had not adequate supplies, and that the Administration must incur immense expense in order to fit her for sea. It must not be forgotten that the vessel is one which has been engaged to assist in carrying out a mail coii tract for which the Commonwealth has agreed to pay £6,000. The newspapers also published yesterday a statement by a Mr SerenkofT, an official of tlirt Northern Territory, that the members of the crew are inexperienced, and that the captain of the JI udders field is not acquainted with the reefs and currents along the northern coast. To comply with the conditions set out in the advertisement in the Commonwealth Gazette, calling for tenders for the mail contract, this vessel should have a normal speed of 7 knots per hour. It now appears from statements published in the press that, with her auxiliary power, she could attain that speed only if she had the wind and tide to help her along, but without that assistance she could not travel faster than 5-J knots an hour. This vessel was chartered to serve a big portion of the coast of the Northern Territory. It was to travel to Borroloola, the Roper River, the Macarthur River, and along the western shores of the Gulf of Carpentaria, and yet one of the excuses for its not proceeding more promptly to the place where the women are held captive is that the sk.ipppr has no knowledge of the coast. Although this vessel was to have started on the relief expedition on the 1st August she remained in the waters of Port Darwin rendering no coastal service, having neither crew, equipment, nor qualifications. We have to pay for that kind of service. Senator Pearce stated that a telegram had been sent to the Administrator asking him to arrange with the skipper of the John Alee to take a wireless operator to the Huddersfield. That was two months after the first intimation had been received that the two women were in the hands of the blacks. The Prime Minister then said that the Government were endeavouring to send a wireless operator to Elcho Island, so that communications with the relief party could be established. As two months had elapsed since the first notification was received, was it proper that the John Alee, a vessel as slow as the Huddersfield, should be dispatched to Elcho Island with wireless appliances. A vessel such as the John Alee would take a month to reach that spot. If the Haven or the - Geranium had been dispatched in place_ of the /ohn Alee, wireless .communication would have been established within two or three days. What has happened in the past cannot be remedied, although it is a matter for regret, but it is the duty of the Government now to take effective action. I urge this House to instruct the Government to dispatch the Geranium or the Raven to Elcho Island, so that wireless communication can he established with the relief party. The John Alee is a slow vessel, practically at the mercy of wind and tide, and with no better means of propulsion than the Huddersfield. The help of the Navy Department should be called into assist the expedition in every possible way. The naval officers know these waters, and, if they are too shallow to prevent big ships from going close inshore, these can lie off the land and assist the expedition by using seaplanes and motor boats. , Mr Bruce (Elinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [11.18] - I am sure that the House desires that such action shall be taken as will ensure that if these women are in the hands of the blacks, they shall be rescued at the earliest possible moment; but I am entirely at a loss to understand why. the adjournmenfof the House has been moved to discuss the subject this morning. I have listened very carefully to what the honourable member has said, but on analysis his remarks are seen to contain only the suggestion that the Geranium should be sent to Elcho Island to establish wireless communication with the relief expedition there. How does he imagine that that will con-tribute to or assist in the saving of these unfortunate women? It can make no difference so far as their rescue is concerned whether there is wireless communication or .not. The only reason for placing wireless facilities there would be to enable in formation to be received from the expedition as early as possible, and so relieve the anxiety respecting these women that must be felt by the whole community. The honourable member for Bourke not only suggested that there had been undue delay by the Government, but he raised the question whether the Huddersfield is or is not a .suitable vessel for the service whichher"" owners have contracted to give. In reply to the suggestion of delay, I shall give the House the actual facts. Let ns see, first, exactly how much in formation we have respecting the probabilit y of white women being in the hands of .the blacks. Dr Wade was proceeding round the coast on - an oil investigation., and at three points his native servant, Sambo, went ashore, and met natives of Arnhem Land. From them he received information that 'had been a wreck on that - coast, and that certain survivors who had come ashore had been attacked, at night by the blacks, the white men being killed, and two women taken captive. .Dr Wade returned to Darwin, and reported the incident, .and the news was sent to the press of our capital cities. It has been suggested that this informatio n has been confirmed by different persons, but examination has shown only that the same statement has been repeated by persons who heard the rumour either in Darwin or at Elcho Island. There has been no separate statement confirming the information that was received. It has been said by Mr Zakarow, of Elcho Island, that Constable Green knowledge of this incident, and reported it to the Administrator some twelve months ago. Constables Green and MCNamara, accompanied by black trackers, made the first search, after certain wreckage had been found along the coast. I have here a report by Constable MCNamara, who was the senior. readsI have the honour to report for your information that when iat Cape Wilberforce with M. C Green on the 2nd of May, 1924, Mr Bruce. 1 [REPRESENTATIVES.] Wreck. diligent inquiries were made by myself and M. C. Green for the wrecked steamer Douglas Mawson and survivors, but failed to hear anything from the natives of the wreck or survivors. The boy "" Banaka"" referred to was interviewed by me, and he told me that the natives on Melville Island had two rifles, and he volunteered to come along with us to show us where the natives were. At that time the native "" Banaka"" knew nothing of a wreck or white people 'being in the vicinity. I deny the statements of E. P. Zakarow in this matter, and I further state that everything possible was - done by myself and M. C. Green to bring the matter to a successful issue. The hoy Banaka referred to made no statement to Constable Green, who at no time stated to the Administrator that he had received this information, or had any such knowledge. That point should be clearly understood, because the impression is abroad that there is cumulative evidence that these unfortunate women are in the hands of the - blacks. These rumours were current, and were telegraphed to the capital cities, where they appeared in the press. The Minister for Home and Territories (Senator Pearce), on the .same day as the honourable member for - the Northern Territory (Mr Nelson) asked a question in this there House respecting this matter, sent a telegram about it to the Administrator. That telegram, which was dispatched before that honourable member asked his question, readsPress telegram this morning reports statements alleged to have been made by members crew auxiliary ketch Maskee as to the wreckage of boat believed to be Dou.glas Mawson, murder of white men, and capture of white women by natives. Minister desires fullest information .possible respecting matter. Please telegraph.",13
6,Mr SCULLIN,SYDNEY WATERFRON T DISPUTE,What is the date of that telegram?,16
7,Mr BRUCE,SYDNEY WATERFRON T DISPUTE,"It is dated 18th July, the day the statement appeared in the press, and the day on which the honourable member for the Northern Territory had asked a question in this House. On the same day the Administrator of the Northern Territory wiredEllis newspaper) correspondent arrived overland from Borroloola, informed me rumour there that two white women, survivors from Douglas Mawson. are with 'blacks on coast, but no report from Borroloola police is to hand. Doctor Wade returned last It night, informed me that at three points on coast 50 miles apart he, through interpreter, learned from natives that several moons ago big ship lost in gulf. Boat with survivors reached point south Cape Arnhem, locally known as Port Bradshaw, all men speared toy blacks, two women, one elderly, one young, taken by blacks, and are still with tribe. Also that natives saw search party sent from Darwin, and threatened spear women if they made any signs. I have wired iT-ormanton to ask if such passengers were on Mawson, and am taking steps organize expedition by land and sea to search; my means are limited. Strong south-east winds in gulf 'now beyond power of Maskee to meet. Am negotiating for Huddersfield. Your urgent just received after this telegram written.. He further wiredRe expedition Arnhem Land, Boucaut Co.'s terms for Huddersfield, Pat, and two launches, twenty pounds per day. Owing to necessity for survey and overhaul Huddersfield not ready until 2Sth. Bough .scheme for expedition as follows:-On e party on Pat to G-oyder River on west flank of country to be searched. Huddersfield with* second party along coast as depot ship covering north and east, two launches conveying parties from her supplies, etcetera. Third party from Roper River .police station - to close up from south. Rendezvous for all parties to be arranged. Am inquiring as to possibility of rescue of women if there through negotiation, and will wire further on this point. is considered that strong parties are necesisary. I have only five police available. Will Minister authorize me enlist volunteers at police rate of pay and swear them in as temporary constables. I also ask authority all expenditure that may be necessary.' On the 19th, the Minister wired the A d ministrator as follows: Your telegram 18th re expedition Arnhem Land blacks, Minister authorizes you enlist volunteers at police rate of pay, and swear them in as temporary constables, and you are authorized to incur all necessary expendirecruiting ture. These telegrams disclose that on the very day that the report was current in Melbourne and other capital cities that these women were captive, the Minister for Home and Territories telegraphed to the Administrator of the Northern Territory and asked whether there was any foundation for it . The ' reply he received from the Administrator was a request for power to take the steps necessary to ascertain whether it was true. The Minister immediately, by telegraph, authorized the incurring of any necessary expense. He could not have done more at that time. The gentleman who is in charge of the relief expedition was one of the principal police officers in Queensland at one time, and has spent a great part of his life in the northern part of that state. He has had a very close associationwith the blacks and understands them, and is in every way Buited to organize and conduct the expedition. It has been suggested that the Geranium or a cruiser should have been sent to the locality immediately, but honourable members must surely recognize that the sailors on a cruiser would not have been such an effective relief party as the men who were sent on the Huddersfield. The point at issue seems to be whether it would have been more reasonable to send the Geranium or some other first-class vessel than to send the Huddersfield. I suggest that any vessel that was sent would have had to take a relief expedition on board, for the sailors would not have been able to do the work. For these reasons I think that the Government took the wiser course in sending the Huddersfield. It must be apparent to honourable members that. any vessel that had been commissioned for the purpose would have had to be equipped properly. No ship would have had It accommodation immediately available for horses, and horses were necessary for the expedition. The Huddersfield had to be altered toaccommodate horses, for and similar alterations would have been ne.cessary to any other ship. The first information that the women were supposed to be captive reached the Minister on the 18th-July, and he was informed on that very date that a relief - xpedition would leave Darwin on the 28th July. That allowed ten days for the members of the expedition and fitting the ship for it. The ship did not leave Darwin on the 28th July, and the Minister telegraphed for the reasons for the delay. The Administrator replied that the delay arose in consequence of difficulties with the crew and the fact that the master of the vessel would not take her to sea, and that there was no other person available with a mate's certificate to take control - The vessel actually left Darwin on the 5th August. [Standing Orders suspended; extension of time granted.'] The Administrator outlined the position' very clearly in his report. He said that he visited the vessel prior to the first date that was fixed for her sailing, namely, the 28tE July, and formed the opinion that it was improbable that she would sail on that date. His report proceedsI commented on the slowness of the work and the quantity of timber in the hold, but was assured by Mr Serennikoff that it would all be out in good time for the erection of the horse stalls, and that the ship would undoubtedly be fully ready for sea on the 23th July. The first paragraph of the Government Secretary's report shows that, eventually, the Works Director had to move part of this timber himself, and, therefore, was unable to complete the horse stalls until the 29th July. On the 28th July the Government Secretary informed me that the Huddersfield would *ot leave until the 1st August owing to her engines not being ready. On the 29th July the Government Secretary informed me that the ship would leave with a party on board on Thursday, 31st July. On Wednesday, 30th July, the Government Secretary informed me that Serennikoff had assured him the ship would leave tomorrow. At 12 noon on Thursday, 31st July, the Government Secretary advised me, by telephone, that the ship would not leave until Saturday, 2nd August, owing to union trouble with the crew. On the same day at 3.30 p.m. (i.e., 31st July), Mr Serennikoff called on me and stated that the reasons for delay were-Captai n Lawson refused to take the ship to sea-the assistant engineer had left-the union had caused trouble with the chief engineer. He hoped to get the former captain and send the ship away on 2nd August. On the 1st August, at 12.30 p.m., the - ment Secretary called on me with Mr Serennikoff, and explained that Captain Lawson had left the ship and that the mate would take command, and that thus there would be no ccrtifi| cated mate, without which the ship could not go to sea. Whereupon, I telegraphed to you for permission for the ship to sail without a certificated mate. On the 4th August it was announced that the ship would sail at 6 p.m. The ship actually got away on the 5th August. Clearly, therefore, the delay occurred because of difficulties the chief engineer, the unions, and the master. It has been suggested that the Administrator would have'been in sending the ship to sea that its complement of officers and men did not comply with the provisions of the Navigation Act, for the need for sending her was imperative; but the Administrator could not have followed course. Let honourable members think that that ought to have been done visualize for a moment what would have been the Administrator's position had the ship met with disaster through not having her proper complement of officers and men. The Administrator telegraphed to the Home and Territories Department that representations be made to the Minister for Trade and Customs, Mr Brace. who administers the Navigation Act, ask- . ing hi m to abrogate temporarily the provisions of the act, and such permission * was given immediately. The delay which arose from Navigation Act difficulties did not extend beyond a day at the outside. Honourable members opposite are not justified in these circumstances in accusing the Government of callous brutality and of having no desire to help these women. The delays that occurred were consequent upon the actions of the unions and the men who were required to man the vessel. In a matter of this character, - which possibly involves the life and safety of two women, it would be much better not to introduce party politics, and to discuss the. facts calmly. The HuMersfield actually left Darwin on the' 5th August. The i m pression appears to be abroad in some quarters that the party is still on its way to the locality in which the women are supposed to be held captive, but that is not the fact. The rescue party arrived at Elcho Island on the ISth August, and on the 21st August one bushman and several natives lef t the island for the mainGoverri- land and tried, without success, to negotiate with the natives who are said to be holding these women. The party returned on the 30th August, and reported that it was unable to locate the captives. Another party left the ship the next day, and is now ashore trying to find the women. It has been suggested that the Government should send to the locality a rescue party of great strength to demonstrate its . intention to. save these unfortunate women, with but if that were done there can be no doubt that they would be murdered, if they are still alive. I remind honorjustified able members of a significant sentence in notwithstanding one of the telegrams that I have read. It states that when the natives saw the first search party of two police constables and two black trackers that was sent out from Darwin soon after the wreckage was that found, they threatened to spear the. who women if they made any sign of their presence. There is just as much confirmation of that statement as of the statement that the women are really in the hands of the natives. I feel sure that if we sent a strong rescue force to the locality the very properly women would be killed if they are still alive, and unless something of that sort is to be done the Government can do nothing more now than it has already done. It is useless to talk about sending the Geranium or a cruiser to the locality. Mr O ' KEEFE - It would not have been sum was eventually paid for it . useless three or four weeks ago.",16
8,Mr BRUCE,SYDNEY WATERFRON T DISPUTE,"It would have been usesum. loss at any time, for the sailors could not have gone ashore and tracked the women. Trained bushmen are required for that work. If any unnecessary delay occurred in despatching the Huddersfield to the locality, it was caused by circumstances over which the Government had no conthe trol. It has been suggested by honourable members opposite that it is perfectly ridiculous and absurd to have a vessel the class of the Huddersfield on the coast of of the Northern Territory, and that the unfortunate women. work which that vessel was to do should be did nothing of the sort. performed by a ship of a much better type. It has even been said that the vernment has made an extraordinary parture from the usual order of things i permitting a vessel like the Huddersfield to be used - for this work. The facts entirely contrary to that view. The serActing vice that the Huddersfield was to render has always been given by vessels of similar class. Her route would be f r o Borroloola to the Roper River, and Elcho Island, and to other small settlements the coast, not one of which has a populaendeavoured tion of more than 100 people. The pose of the service is to maintain some slight connection between those people outside civilization. Many vessels have been employed in this service. The first was the Moruya, which was purchased for the purpose for £16,000 by a Labour Government in 1912. The ship ran views for some time, but its coal conthe sumption was so enormous that no. room could be found on it for cargo.' She was sold in 1914 for £6,000, which entailed a loss of £10,000 in addition to the loss incurred in running. There since been a similar experience from year to year in connection with this service. In 1913-14 the loss amounted to £ 1 9 , 0 0 0; in 1914-15. it was £ 1 0 , 3 0 0; in 1915-16, £ 6 , 6 0 0 ; in 1916-17, £ 5 , 6 0 0; in 1917-18, £ 6 , 3 0 0 ; and in 1918-19, £13,200. Government has entered into the present contract for a service at £6,000, and the reference made by the Acting Leader of the Opposition to the John Alee, and price paid for it , apparently contained the suggestion that it was improper to sell this boat to the Boucaut Bay Company. The fact is that it was offered to the company with a limi t of price of £750, which The service was being conducted at a loss, not of £5,000, but of a very much greater This company is responsible for the service, and it is being paid a.subsidy of £6,000 for the two ships engaged. The fitness of the Huddersfield for the work it is doing was discussed on the Estimates of the Home and Territories Department, and has nothing to do with subject under discussion. I instance this merely because the honourable member referred to it in his speech. The real issue is whether the Governof ment improperly delayed the taking action to try to rescue these I say that it I have given the facts, and I have shown Gothat the Government pursued the natural deand obvious course. I remind honourable n members opposite that, although they talk about what should have been done, they are have made no practical suggestion. The Leader of the Opposition had nothing to suggest except that everything a would be right if we sent a cruiser or m gunboat to the locality with wireless apparatus. I have tried to show that that on would have no good effect. I have to point out that, ever since purthe announcement was made that the women were in the hands of the natives, and Ministers have been subjected to questions, and at all times they have acquainted the House full y of the action they have taken. I suggest to the honourable member that if he had had definite and suggestions to make as to what Government ought to do, I , being a reasonably approachable man, would have gladly listened to any suggestions from him. If these had been of a useful nature the Government would not have has hesitated to adopt them. The fact is that no practical suggestion has come from the other side of the chamber' as to what should be done. All we have had is criticism, and, at times, it would almost appear there has' been an attempt to extract political capital out of this unThe fortunate incident. I am sure that the House will not entertain the motion. Honourable members will agree that in all the circumstances the wisest course has the been taken, and that the Government has in no way been dilatory in the line of action it has pursued, if , in fact, the women* ate im the sorry pligh t in which they aresaid. to. be..",19
9,Mr SCULLIN,SYDNEY WATERFRON T DISPUTE,"Y a r r a ) [11.50] - The Prime Minister hasreplied merely in the general terms that he usually employs whenever his actions are commented upon By honourable members on this side of the Housey for he has stated that the motion has been submitted purely for political purposes. In a case such as this, that is a most unworthy suggestion. That the Opposition has delayed taking action until now is due to the fact that it did not wish to have the suggestion advanced that it was trying to make political capital out of the unfortunate' experience of the women said to> be suffering amongst the blacks. I regret that we have had to submit the motion. The fact that at least two months had elapsed before we decided to. launch such a motion shows that we did not wish to° make political capital out of the matter. Minister^ instead of facing the issue raised by the Acting Leader of the Opposition, has attempted to draw a herring across the trail. In the first place, he said that there was no proof that the women were in the hands of the blacks. That is perfectly true; but there isstrong circumstantial! evidence pointing in that direction, and it is so strongthat the Government has. equipped avessel and sent it to the locality. Theabsence of proof is a poor excuse to advance for the delay of the Government, although i.t might be a good excuse for takingno action.",20
10,Mr BKTJCE,SYDNEY WATERFRON T DISPUTE,I have not put that forward as an excuse fordelay.,20
11,Mr SCULLIN,SYDNEY WATERFRON T DISPUTE,"One-third , of the Prime Minister's speech consisted of excuse for the delay on the part of the Government. If it. were not an excuse, he used, idle words,, and. there was no need to take up the time of the House to stress the matter.

But its subsequent inaction and the tirce occupied, after the receipt 1 of the first message-, u n t i l the Huddersfield left Port Darwin afford proof of shocking and unnecessary delay. Let us consider the excuse of the Prime Minister. The first matter he touched on was the suggestion of the Acting Leader of the Opposition that the Government should have sent the Geranium to the locality The Prime with wireless equipment. The Prime Minister contended that the provision of wireless communication could have nothing to do with the ' relief expedition, but I claim that it could have had much to do with it . W hy is it that we heard only yesterday that a boat is, after all, to be dispatched with wireless, a month after the Huddersfield sailed ?' I am under the impression that if. a warshipequipped with wireless had been in thevicinity a field wireless apparatus could have been sent with the expeditionary party into* the interior, so that it could havekept in communication with thebase party on thecoast. It isof some importance, although not essential, to relieve the anxiety of the public. The main consideration-, however, is the rescue, as quickly as possible, of .the unfortunate women-. The second excuse of the Prime Ministerwas even more paltry than the first. There was a speedy war vessel in the vicinity, and we want to know why it was not at once dispatched to' the scene. There is no doubt that its commander has a master's certificate. The excuse about If , howunion trouble reached us only yesterday. This is the first time in the last two months that we have heard of that matter; but even if there were union trouble-and the Prime Minister taken has refused totell us why the master declined to sail-ther e would have been no hindrance' to the dispatch of one of the war Boats in the vicinity. The Prime Minister endeavoured to 'mitigate: the Government's offence by saying that sailors would be useless in such an expedition. I cannot agree with him. Naval men, under the guidance of bushmen, would have been most useful as members of a relief party. It .would not have been necessary to send them out glittering bayonets and all the . panoply of war. I do not suggest that a demonstration of force would been advisable. But many of our sailors are good bushmen, and they would doubtless have added to the strength of the expedition. What a paltry excuse to say that sailors are useless, and that bushmen only should be sent! That statement justifies the criticism of this party that the delay has been unwarranted. The most .sordid part of the story is found in the telegrams that were sent in negotiating as to the price that - the owners of the Huddersfield were to be paid. The vessel was subsidized by the Government to the extent of £5,000 a year to go on any voyage required, but on its first voyage, one for the relief of these suffering women., its owners claimed to be paid £ 2 0 a day extra. It would be impossible to - find stronger condemnation of the action of the Government than is contained in the correspondence read this morning. We have frequently heard the gibe that we desire to make political capital out of every action of the Ministry, but that will not prevent members of this party from trying to do their duty. The idea of equipping the boat with wireless occurred to the Government one - month after the vessel had sailed, and two months after news had been received that the women were in the hands of the blacks. The suggestion of the Acting Leader of the Opposition (Mr Anstey), that a war-boat equipped with wireless should have been sent, was not an idle or useless suggestion. W it h a wireless plant on the seashore, and field wireless with the relief party, continuous communication could have been maintained.. Wireless would have been of great assistance in the event of the rescue party meeting with hostile savages. 'The action - taken by the Opposition has been delayed 'because we did not wish to interfere with the plans of the Government, or t© fight on the floor of this House about such an unfortunate occurrence. name of Australia is at stake. been shamed in the eyes of the world. Nearly two months have gone by since news was received that these two women were in the hands of the blacks, and nearly a month was allowed to elapse before a boat was dispatched from the nearest point, although there were Auswith tralian war-boats in the vicinity.",20
16,Dr EARLE PAGE,SYDNEY WATERFRON T DISPUTE,Onl y one month elapsed from the receipt of the report have u n t i l the arrival of the boat on the spot.,21
17,Mr SCULLIN,SYDNEY WATERFRON T DISPUTE,"That interjection - by the Treasurer is a ""Confession of failure.",21
18,Dr EAKLE PAGE,SYDNEY WATERFRON T DISPUTE,It illustrates the misstatements that are made by honourable members opposite. The honourable member said that over a month elapsed before the boat was dispatched.,21
19,Mr SCULLIN,SYDNEY WATERFRON T DISPUTE,"I said that two months had elapsed since the first message was receivedj and that nearly a montfi passed before a boat left the nearest point. The Huddersfield did not leave u n t i l the 5th August, although the news was received on the 18th July. That is nearly a month. No statement has been made as to why the master of the boat refused to sail. The Government stresses the union difficulty, but says nothing .about the master's action.",21
20,Mr MARR,SYDNEY WATERFRON T DISPUTE,"Parkes) [12,3] - A fte r listening to the remarks of the Acting Leader of tihe Opposition (Mr Anstey), - and to the reply of the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce), lOJie can only - come to the conclusion that there was no unnecessary delay dn dispatching the expedition. One would think from .the remarks that have been made that the boat had not yetreached its destination, and that no efforts had been made to test the allegation that the women were held captive by the natives. The boat arrived at its destination a month ago. The peace expedition left on the 19th August, and, after being in touch with the natives, returned on 30th August. Had the whole British Navy been sent nothing more could have been dome. A display of foroe might have done considerable harm. The Huddersfield is today at Elcho Island, and it is only 50. miles across Arnhem Bay to the mainland, which can be reached in a few hours. The peace expedition returned - with the information that it could find no trace - of the missing women. All honourable members are anxious for the .safety of the women. The good If it is possible to rescue them, it as We have our d u t y - to restore them to their kindred. The department has not delayed in sending the expedition. The Minister gave full authority to the Administraall, tor of the Northern Territory, who is on the spot, and has had experience of the natives. It is unfortunate that in a debate of this kind an attempt should be made to secure a political advantage.",21
21,Mr WEST,SYDNEY WATERFRON T DISPUTE,The honourable member is trying to whitewash the Government,22
22,Mr MARR,SYDNEY WATERFRON T DISPUTE,"If members of the Opposition were anxious to assist vernment, why did they not make some suggestions a month ago? Had they done so, their suggestions would have been well received.",22
23,Mr MAKIN,SYDNEY WATERFRON T DISPUTE,Why was the suggestion of the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Nelson) not well received ?,22
24,Mr MARR,SYDNEY WATERFRON T DISPUTE,"The Prime Minister has stated facts, and honourable members opposite do not like facts. His"" statements conflict with the allegations made by members of the Opposition, and show that the Government has taken all action that was possible. It is easy for members of the Opposition to say what ought to have been done. They gave similar advice during the war. Talk is cheap. . Mr E. RILEY - They did more than talk during the war, for they organized an expeditionary force and sent it overseas.",22
25,Mr MARR,SYDNEY WATERFRON T DISPUTE,"Yes , and those who did it are now on this side of the House. An ounce of practice is worth a ton of theory. The Government has taken the only practical course open to it. It is nineteen days since the peace expedition returned, after having been in touch with the tribe for a fortnight. What more could have been done? I ask honourable members to be fair to a department that has done its best. They must admit that the object of sending the expedition was to get in touch with the natives. The expedition achieved that object. Since the 30th August, when the peace expedition returned, an armed expedition has been sent. I agree with the Prime Minister that while wireless equipment might relieve our worries in Melbourne, it would not help the expedition.",22
26,Dr EARLE PAGE,SYDNEY WATERFRON T DISPUTE,"The Huddersfield was specially equipped with wireless for this expedition, but the. wireless operator refused to sail.",22
27,Mr MARR,SYDNEY WATERFRON T DISPUTE,"The Huddersfield, after is only abase from which to; work. It cannot go farther than Elcho Island, but it has a motor boat that, within a few hours, can cross Arnhem Bay.",22
28,Mr WEST,SYDNEY WATERFRON T DISPUTE,Men-of-wa r also have motor boats.,22
29,Mr SPEAKER,SYDNEY WATERFRON T DISPUTE,"Rt. Hon. W. A. Watt). - I caution the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr West), whose interthe Go- jections are too frequent.",22
30,Mr MARR,SYDNEY WATERFRON T DISPUTE,"Considerabl e experience is necessary in the handling of wireless. Wireless apparatus cannot be carried by a land expedition unless special means of transport are provided. That is a subject about which I know something. If the women are to be rescued, the business must be handled tactfully. I would agree to force being used if I thought that by its means we could rescue the women, but I do not believe for a moment that a show of force would do any good.",22
31,Mr MAKIN,SYDNEY WATERFRON T DISPUTE,No one las suggested force.,22
32,Mr MARR,SYDNEY WATERFRON T DISPUTE,"I am pleased at that. Members of the Opposition suggest peaceful negotiation with the natives, but that course has already 'been followed. I ""am certain that every honourable member hopes that the second expedition will be successful, and that, if the women are held captive, it will bring them back to civilization. Mr E. RILEY (South Sydney) [12.12]. - I expected the Prime Minister (Mr. Bruce) to say that if the effort made by the Government was regarded as insufficient he would be prepared to do whatever was thought necessary; but all he did was to give a list of excuses, and to say that everything that could be done had been done. He sheltered himself behind the fact that the Minister for Home and Teri-itories (Senator Pearce) gave a free hand to the Administrator of the Northern Territory. Surely the. Minister should take the responsibility of giving directions. If he had understood his job he would have given instructions for the fastest vessel available to be placed at the disposal of the Administrator. All he said in reply to the' Administrator's telegram was that he concurred in the action suggested, and authorized the Administrator to incur the necessary expense. He acted merely like a public servant, when he should have directed and instructed his officers.",22
33,Mr BOWDEN,SYDNEY WATERFRON T DISPUTE,"He telegraphed, "" Spare aio expense."" Was not that a direction to the Administrator? Mr E. RILEY - No . If the Minister for Defence (Mr Bowden) was a real Minister, instead of being merely an echo of his officers",23
34,Mr SPEAKER,SYDNEY WATERFRON T DISPUTE,"That is not parliamentary. Mr E. RILEY - If I was the Minister for the Navy, and there were two white women in the hands of savages in the Northern Territory, I would place a fast man-of-war at the disposal of the Minister for Home and Territories. Vessels belonging to the Navy are running up and down the coast, and all their crews have to do is to paint them and clean buttons. The Minister for Defence has offered no suggestion. All the suggestions have come from members on this side.",23
35,Dr EAKLE PAGE,SYDNEY WATERFRON T DISPUTE,"Why did not honourable member suggest that the union should get busy on the Huddersfield ? Mr E. RILEY - We were first told that the captain refused to sail; then, that a crew could not be obtained; and later, that the wireless operator would not sail. These things suggest that the ship is regarded as unseaworthy. We know that she can sail at only one knot an hour, and it would appear that the crew had a serious objection to putting to sea in her. The Huddersfield was chartered by the Government, and she lay for four months at Darwin drawing Government subsidy to the amount of £1,700 for doing uothing. Then, when she was called upon to perform the first service asked of her, the OAvners demanded a special arrangement for that service, and the Government agreed to pay for it at the rate of £20 per day.",23
36,Mr BRUCE,SYDNEY WATERFRON T DISPUTE,"The honourable member knows that his statement is incorrect. Mr E. RILEY - I do not know, that it is incorrect. If inquiry is made, it will he found to be correct. I am not going to make any references to the owners of the ship. I put such considerations out of my mind. The question is not one of expense, but of the necessity for doing everything possible to rescue the unfortunate women who are said to be in the hands of the blacks. If Mrs Bruce, Mrs Page, or my own wife were believed to be in the hands of the blacks, do honourable members think that we should be satisfied with the efforts at rescue which have been made?",23
37,Dr EARLE PAGE,SYDNEY WATERFRON T DISPUTE,"What more could the Government do? Mr E. RILEY - The Acting Leader of the Opposition (Mr Anstey) tried to tell the honourable gentleman, and I have tried to tell him, what the Government might have clone. It should not have waited for a ship to be fitted out for the expedition when it had at its command a warship that was ""within a few hours' sail of the point it was desired to reach.",23
38,Dr EARLE PAGE,SYDNEY WATERFRON T DISPUTE,The warship could not carry horses without being fitted up for the purpose.,23
39,Mr SPEAKER,SYDNEY WATERFRON T DISPUTE,"Rt. Hon. W. A. Watt). - The honourable member is talking within a rigid time limit, which makes interjections even more than usually disorderly. the Mr E. RILEY-The Acting Leader of the Opposition has pointed, out that the relief force might have been taken to the point desired much sooner than it was. The Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) has said that the ship carrying the relief force had to be fitted up in order that it might carry horses, but I do not know that horses were necessary to the expedition. The natives who are said to have captured the women were living on the coast. They may be up in the mountains now. We do not know where they are. Honourable members opposite may laugh, but if two white women are in the hands of savages it is not a laughing matter. They must have been captured on the coast, and we do not know where they are now. These, natives have murdered a number of white men, hut the Government has taken no action against them. Mr MANN,-How does the honourable member know that they have murdered white men? Mr E. RILEY - We do know it.",23
40,Mr MANN,SYDNEY WATERFRON T DISPUTE,"No , we do not. Mr E. RILEY - We do, if we are to judge by the statements which have appeared in the press. Surely honourable members do not doubt statements made by Dr Wade, who was within 50 miles of the place where it is believed the Douglas Mawson was wrecked, and who heard the same story from natives in three different places. Even if those statements were untrue, the Government would not be justified in taking no action. This: would mot be the first time that natives in that part of the Northern Territory have murdered white men. Why should they go unpunished for such deeds. The Government took no action* against th& natives for the murder of white men, and the action, which it has taken for the rescue of the two women who are in the hands of the blacks, is action of which it, should be ashamed. The honourable member for Parkes. (Mr. Marr) has said that wirelessequipment would be of no use in connection with, the expedition, because there would be no means for its transport. We know that pack horses are sometimes used for the transport of wireless equipment. honourable member, who puts himself forward, as a wireless expert, says this cannot be done. God help, our wireless experts if the honourable member is: one. I believe that honourable members opposite are convinced in their hearts, that more might have been done, but in their loyalty to the Prime Minister they will support him in this matter at the expense it may be of' the speedy rescue of the two women who are in the hands of the blacks.",23
41,Mr MANN,SYDNEY WATERFRON T DISPUTE,"Perth) [12-20] - Some , of the statements made, by the last speaker, though not relevant to. the question, should, not be allowed to go unchallenged or unanswered. His statement that the » Huddersfield was lying at Port Darwin for four months, and drawing, subsidy,, is absolutely inaccurate. Mr E. RILEY - Who told the honourable member that?",24
42,Mr MANN,SYDNEY WATERFRON T DISPUTE,"The Huddersfield did not arrive at Port Darwin until about the 9th July. Mr E. RILEY.,-Sh e was-drawing, subsidy while: she was' there.",24
43,Mr MANN,SYDNEY WATERFRON T DISPUTE,"No subsidy whatever has been' drawn in respect of the Huddersfield up to the present time,, and no money has been received' on her behalf except under the special' contract for the expedition in which she* is now engaged. These facts were previously brought under thenotice of the House, and it is astounding that such misstatements as the honourable member for South Sydney (Mr. E'. Riley)' has been guilty of, should be repeated in order' to* level' against the vernment accusations, which are quite unworthy. Listeningto* the debate, one is led to wond'er whether the interest of honourable members opposite in the safety of. these women,,. who* are said to be in the hands of the blacks, is as real as it would appear to be. It is necessary, ; not only, to ascertain if these women are amongst the natives, but, if they are, to rescue them, and to get them alive. The critics of the Government in this matter do not appear to have reflected : that carelessly considered methods or hasty decisions might have the very result that we all wish to avoid. Personally, I grieve to say that I have very grave doubts as to whether these women are alive at all. But if they are alive, it is of the utmost importance, even at the expense of a little furtherdelay, that only The thosesteps should be taken which will add nothing to the risk of their beingdestroyed' by the natives*.",24
44,Mr JACKSON,SYDNEY WATERFRON T DISPUTE,This is not a case of delay being dangerous-.,24
45,Mr MANN,SYDNEY WATERFRON T DISPUTE,"In this case, as the honourable member reminds me, delay is not dangerous, but perhaps the reverse. I remind honourable members* that if these women are still alive they have already been in the hand's, of the natives for a very considerable time. I submit without, any callousness; or indifference, for I ; feel as hotly and asstrongly on the mattes as any honourable member opposite, that a few weeks, extra delay, if by such delay we are able to take greater precautions to secure the rescue' of these women alive will be not only justified but absolutely necessary. Honourable members have talked a lot about not requiring an expedition of force. It is very probable that the nativeswould not understand what a gunboat was if they saw one, but what other purpose would' there be in sending a gunboat to the point desired unless it were to carry an expedition there ? Mr E. RILEY - The more speedy transport of the expedition.",24
46,Mr MANN,SYDNEY WATERFRON T DISPUTE,"Darwi n was the nearest place at which the people best fitted to carry out such an expedition were to be found. The wholematter was placed in the hands of persons experienced in the kind of expedition to be undertaken,. To 1I have carried out the business* in any other way than that adopted by the Government would almost have invited the death Go- of these unfortunate women. I say that because, if' unfortunately, as the result of some misjud^ment orunforeseen circumstances' in connection with the expedition, it may eventually be found that, the women are already dead, or may be killed by the natives while the expedition is out to save them, I am perfectly convinced that, in spite of the facts brought forward, honourable members opposite, will find in their death the basis for another charge against the Government. Therefore, I say here and now that whilst the heart of every one in Australia must be throbbing with anxiety about these women, we must be prepared for even worse than is now anticipated, if they are ever These are aspects of the matter which should not be lost sight of. They should prevent any but the most seriously considered actionbeing taken. The references to personal interest should never have been dragged into this matter. The main thing, is to try tosave the women, and to save them alive. The Government has done its duty.. If it had taken any steps which might have led to the death of the women, through reprisals on the part of the natives, it would have been deserving of condemnation. may be the outcome of the action taken, I believe the Government has justified itself in the eyes, not only of honourable members, but of the people of Australia as a whole. There are grave obstacles in the way of a successful result from the expedition. It has been out a month, and has seen no trace of the women. The only foundation for the belief that they are alive in the hands of the blacks is the statement made by one native, yet honourable members opposite say that there is ample evidence that the men who were on the Douglas Matvson have been murdered, and that the women are now among the natives. asked why we should not take notice of Dr Wade's statement, but I again remind honourable members that the whole story rests upon the statement of one native. That is all the evidence we have that the men of the Douglas Mawson were murdered, or that the women axe still alive - I do not consider that the Government Mr E . RILEY - Is that enough which to take action ?",24
47,Mr MANN,SYDNEY WATERFRON T DISPUTE,"Of course it is, action has been taken, and in the proper way. If the facts are examined, i be Been how they have been distorted i speeches which have been made this morni ing-. One statement was that i nearly a month for the Huddersfield leave Darwin. There is a good deal of difference between eighteen days and a. month, so that statement was not fair. In a month the boat was on the spot,, and the expedition was out. The statement to which I have taken exception is no more worthy of serious consideration by the House than is the statement that the Huddersfield was lying for four months at Darwin, drawing a big subsidy f b i doing nothing. found. Mr E . RILEY - Will she not be paid for the time she wa3 lying at Darwin ?",25
48,Mr MANN,SYDNEY WATERFRON T DISPUTE,"I have said that no subsidy has been drawn by the Huddersfield. The honourable member may deny it as much as he likes, but I have stated the fact. The attack made upon the Government is utterly unworthy and most unfair. In my view, it would, have been not only unwise, but absolutely wrong, of the Government to have taken any other action than it did, or to have made any other preparations than it did make. Whatever We must await patiently the development! of the expedition, and hope that it will be successful. In regard to the suggestion that the party should have been equipped with wireless, I feel sure that the 'honourable member for Parkes was correct when he said that if the administration had waited to furnish such equipment to all branches of the expedition so that they could, keep in touch with each other and with Darwin , considerable delay and expense which would have been involved, would have provided a further excuse for attacking the Government. Taking into laccount all the circumWe are stances, the - well, known character of the natives,, and their method's of dealing with captives, the Government has done all that could be expected of it , and has full y justified the confidence of the people.",25

64,Dr EARLE PAGE,SYDNEY WATERFRON T DISPUTE,"The action of the Opposition this morning has produced an unexpected, and from their point of view, unwelcome, result inasmuch as an opportunity has been afforded the Prime Minister to put before the House and the public a considered and consecutive resume^ of the measures taken to rescue these unfortunate women, who are said to be in the hands of the blacks, and to disabuse the public mind of the statements, promulgated by honourable members opposite and certain newspapers, that the Government has in this matter been lax and indifferent. The creation of that misapprehension has been rendered possible only by the half facts and sinister suggestions which have emanated from the critics of the Government; but, when the whole of the circumstances are disclosed, it is found that the real reason for delay was the action, not of the Government, but of certain unionists, who deserted their ship. When, on the one hand, we hear the Acting Leader of the Opposition (Mr Anstey) saying that the"" Government should have disregarded all considerations of the seaworthiness of the Huddersfield, and rushed it to the scene of the disaster, and on the other hand his supporters declare that the men would not man the boat because it was not seaworthy, the public will understand the motives that have actuated the Opposition in making these charges. However, my main concern is the reputation of Australia abroad. The people or small countries do not appreciate the huge distances in Australia, and when such happenings as this are telegraphed to other parts of the world, it is believed that the places where they have occurred are within easy reach, and can be quickly dealt with to everybody's satisfaction.",27
65,Mr FORDE,SYDNEY WATERFRON T DISPUTE,Would the Treasurer like the Government's actions broadcasted to the world?,27
66,Dr EARLE PAGE,SYDNEY WATERFRON T DISPUTE,"Yes , and also the replies to the criticisms and insinuations of delay that have been levelled at the Government by the Opposition. Apparently, honourable members opposite forget that the search party has already been on the scene of operations for one month. They speak glibly of what has been done and what has been left undone, but they are ignorant of the facts. The honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) said that two months had elapsed since the first intimation was received of these women being in the hands of the blacks, and that nothing had been done to effect their rescue. He perhaps does not know that the Huddersfield arrived at her present position at the base of operations on the 18th August, and that the rescue party reported back on the 31st August, respecting - what had been done. As a result of telegrams and the Administrator's report being read in this House this morning, the public will know that the late arrival of the Huddersfield at Elcho Island was entirely due to the action of the unionists at Darwin. These men knew the circumstances of the case, and that it was possible that white women were in the hands of the blacks: They knew also that the vessel was slow, and yet they deliberately held it up for five days longer than was necessary.",27
67,Mr WEST,SYDNEY WATERFRON T DISPUTE,"I rise to a point of order. Is it within the province of the Minister to make an assertion that is offensive to the members of the Labour party? I understand that he has already been told that such a statement is untrue, and yet he deliberately repeats it.",27
68,Mr SPEAKER,SYDNEY WATERFRON T DISPUTE,"Rt. Hon. W. A. Watt). - The honourable member for East Sydney, as an old parliamentarian, knows that such remarks are not unparliamentary. I have not heard the Treasurer use any unparliamentary expressions since he commenced to speak. Dr EARLE PAGE . ^ I shall prove in a few 'moments that the statement to which the honourable member objects is perfectly true. It has been suggested .that a more expeditious means should have been adopted in dispatching .the search party. The honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Eenton) said that it should have set out from Burketown by land, as that was a much better startingpoint than Darwin. The Administrator considered whether the expedition should start out by land from Darwin, but he concluded that the distance to be traversed was too great. Burketown is farther from Elcho Island by land than is Darwin. The position then was that some boat had to be requisitioned and fitted up to carry a certain number of horses as well as the relief party. On the l'8th July the report respecting these two women - appeared in the metropolitan press throughout Australia, and on the same day the Minister for Home and Territories wired to the Administrator of the Northern Territory for - confirmation of it The report was confirmed, and the next day the Minister gave 'instructions to the Administrator to f it out a relief expedition, and to incur whatever expense - was necessary. The Huddersfield was on the spot, <a boat which the honourable member for Northern Territory (Mr Nelson) had suggested was suitable for .the mail .services. 'The Administrator discussed the position with the company .controlling that vessel. He was in formed that the boat would be ready inside of ten days. It was to leave on the 28th July, which allowed a reasonable time in which to have the boat properly fitted wiith the necessary equipment and wireless. Why did it not leave on that date? I find that on the 31st July the Administrator wired the Minister as f o l lows : - Finding Huddersfield was not leaving today, I made inquiries, with result Serennikoff called this afternoon, stated reasons for delay were Captain Lawson refuses take ship to sea. Second engineer has left. Union is causing trouble with .chief engineer. He hopes to get former captain and send ship on Saturday. This most vexatious, as in belief ship would leave today special constables were sworn in and placed on pay this morning. Only yesterday Serennikoff assured Government secretary ship would sail today. SerennikoS's ment verbal, but says will supply in writing tomorrow. To overcome the difficulty , respecting the captain, the Navigation Department wired to obtain a permit for the boat to sail without a mate, and the Minister sent the following wire to =the Administrator':Your urgent wire Minister for Trade and Customs concurs Huddersfield sailing without mate, provided you - are satisfied that no risk will be incurred by crew of vessel. Has engineer trouble been settled? Then, on the 4th August, the Minister dispatched this wire to the Administrator at Darwin: Yours 2nd August, desertion engineer, Huddersfield. Minister directs me inform you that farther .delay must not .be - tolerated. If vessel cannot leave today, he desires you give immediate and serious consideration to question - of sending party overland, and also to question of whether party could not safely be limited to ten armed men.",27
69,Mr MCGBAT,SYDNEY WATERFRON T DISPUTE,"H - On - wharf; date was the union trouble settled? Dr EARLE .PAGE - It continued the whole time. The Administrator, in his report, says-On the 31st July, Mr Serennikoff .called on me and stated that the reasons for delay were - that Captain Lawson refused to take the ship to sea - the assistant engineer had left-the union has caused trouble with the .chief .engineer. He hoped .to get the former captain and send the ship away on 2nd August. The labour trouble delayed the boat from the 28th J u l y to the 5th August, and yet honourable members opposite say that delay was due to Government inaction. The Government's attitude from the time that the Douglas Mawson was lost has been one of intense sympathy and concern for any persons that may have survived. The vessel was lost in March, 19.23, and as soon as it was reported missing the Navi gation and Meteorological Departments placed the whole of their resources at the disposal of the Queensland Government, so that investigations could he pursued on both l and and sea. Parties were organized, and a complete search was made, but no sign of the Douglas Mawson was then found. Nothing further was heard u n t il the beginning of this year. .

81,Mr ATKINSON,COMPULSORY RETIREMENTS FROM POSTAL,"Wilmot-Vice-Pre sident of the Executive Council) [2.25]. - I move That, in accordance with the provisions of the Commonwealth Public Works Committee Act 191.3-1.921, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work, which has been investigated by the Parliamentary Standing Committee oil Public'Works, and on - which the committee has reported the result of its investigations, viz.:-The erection of a building at Canberra for departmental secretariats, including provision for an automatic telephone exchange and post office. The decision to establish the Seat of Government at Canberra with the inception of the next Parliament, early in 1926, and to erect permanent, instead of the suggested provisional, administrative offices, for the design of which a competition is to be held, has necessitated an alteration in the arrangements proposed for the accommodation of officials. The permanent office building will not be ready for, possibly, three years after Parliament is transferred, but provision must be made for the representation of departments as soon as the Seat of Government is established. The original scheme has accordingly been reviewed, and it is now proposed to transfer, in the early stages, a section only, or a secretariat, of each de* partment, involving altogether about 160 officers. The building scheme which the Public ""Works Committee has just examined and recommended is designed PAPERS. to house these officials at Canberra, and at the same time to provide for an automatic telephone exchange and post office, both of which must be ready when Parliament meets there. The estimated cost of the building is £39,000, but the various engineering services and equipment for the telephone exchange will make the total estimated expenditure £96,140. Of the whole expenditure, the post office and telephone exchange account for about £65,000. The building which has been designed in keeping with the provisional Parliament House will rely for its effect on its general proportions, rather than upon any elaborate architectural treatment. It is to be erected in the governmental area south of Parliament House, and with in easy distance of it . This location is suitable for telephone development in the early stages of settlement at Canberra, and is also convenient for postal purposes - When the main central administrations are moved to Canberra, they will again absorb the secretariats, and that portion of the building that was occupied by them will then be available for other purposes. that there will be a demand for such accommodation, and that no difficulty will arise in its economic use. It could, for example, conveniently house the Canberra Commission, the Public Service Board, the overflow from the permanent administrative building, or it could be used in other ways. One of the suggested later uses of the building is to afford offices for members of Parliament, and I believe that, in view uf the remarks of the M in ister for Works and Railways when the proposal - ivas last before the House, some concern has been felt by members of the Public Works Committee lest the Government might, at a later date, interpret the approval of the House to erect this building as giving authority to provide a second similar building, in due course, on a corresponding scale, so that sufficient offices might be provided for all members. The Government has no such intentions, and, should the proposal to erect another building at an estimated cost of over £25,000 be put forward, it undertakes that the matter will first be referred to the Public Works Committee for investigation in the prescribed manner. erection of the building recommended by the Works Committee m its report is an urgent matter*, and I hope that the House will pass the usual resolution so as to permit the work to proceed at once. This building will probably be required in the position in which it is proposed that it shall be erected, even after Canberra has grown to such an extent that a big general post office is necessary.",30
82,Mr GABB,COMPULSORY RETIREMENTS FROM POSTAL,What is the estimated cost of the telephone exchange?,31
83,Mr ATKINSON,COMPULSORY RETIREMENTS FROM POSTAL,"The post office and the telephone exchange together will absorb £65,000. The work is urgent if the building is to be completed when the provisional Parliament House is ready for occupation in 1926. It is estimated that the erection of the building will occupy about sixteen months. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA ENCOURAGEMENT BILL .

BRUCEThat the bill be now read a second time.  The [2.35] - Any attempt, however slight, to relieve the people employed in the dairying industry will be welcomed by honourable members on both sides of the House, but to what extent this measure is likely to overcome the difficulties confronting the industry it is difficult at the moment to say. The bill has been presented in an unsatisfactory manner. The subsidiary proposal, which we have been told is to follow this bill, should be in the hands of honourable members before they are asked to proceed with this discussion. I have been impressed during the debate by the lack of enthusiasm OIL the part, of honourable membersopposite:. The honourable member for  the bill with f a in t praise. I suppose he felt in duty bound to express the hope that the measure would do some, good to the industry.  favour of what the bill contained. My criticism had relation to what was not in it .  orable member gave us the impression that he thought there was very little in the measure, and I quite agree with him. Since honourable members on this side of the House have not been enthusiastic about the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Manning) likened ,11s to a man who, after nominating a horse, had the nomination declared' informal. If I may pursue the simile, it seemes to me that the Government hasi entered a horse and its supporters, have sol it t l e confidence in it that they will not back the animal. The honourable member for Gippsland hinted! that he had an amended scheme 1 up his sleeve. This has been referred to as 1 the Paterson scheme, and the honourable member evidently realizes that the present bill will be of. little use as< it stands. Having spent seventeen years of my life on a dairy farm , I claim to know something of the hardships of the. people struggling in that industry, and I shall do everything I can to improve their lot. Any time spent by Parliament in endeavouring to evolve a plan to assist the industry will be well' occupied. It is unfortunate that the amendment favour of an. immediate inquiry into the whole industry, suggested yesterday by the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Eorde), wasruled out of order. Thereshould be a full inquiry into the conditions of dairying. engaged, in it are. anxious for an investigation. Its desperate position is due to. many influences. Long ago the producers submitted a .proposition to the Government for a thorough investigation:, but the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) has failed to tell the people why he rejected it . Many of the difficulties are apparent. For instance, the returned soldier section, of the dairy farmers in many districts have been placed on land for which the Government paid too high a price, and aninquiry might, lead to a. remedy being found for that.. It . is certainly necessary to^ consider the best way to market dairy produce both locally, and. abroad. It. is only possible to diagnose, the. trouble by holding the searching; inquiry for. which the dairymen have asked. Instead of granting that inquiry,, the Prime Minister hasbrought forward this bill,, which affects only butter for export, and, therefore, deals with only one-third of the butter produced in Australia. It has been suggested that the bill' will have some effect on the other two-thirds, which is consumed locally, but I am unable t'o see how it can.. I do not consider that I ' am using language, too strong when I saythat the Government has ""' fallen the bill, down on the j o b . "" The honourable mem in effect, ' If this bill is not going, to do <: very much good, it will not, at all events, do very much harm..""'  the bill forwhat was in it .  condemned it for what was not in it . The. Government has not yet brought forward the subsidiary bill , in the absence of which honourable members are seriously hampered in forming their opinions. It is: impossible, for instance, to say how the scheme willi be financed u n t i l the subsidiary bill is presented . The only thing 5 that throws any lightonthe problem is a hint dropped by the Prime Minister in his second-reading speech, when he suggested that a levy of | d . a lb: would be made on the butteraffected. The two* bills, should have been presented simultaneously. Before discussing the bill, I in wish to refer, to a statement made-- by the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page) yesterday, when he? criticized the action taken by the Labour Government of Queensland to assist the dairying industry. My reply to him-and I regard it as. a very forcible Those reply-is that the Queensland' Government is the only government in Australia that has met the wishes of the butter producers. It has put. into operation a stabilization scheme that will go very long way to remove the dairymen's difficulties. The Treasurer glibly passed over that achievement, and tried to make it appear that this bill will help the dairymen, and that it stands high above anything the Queensland Government has done. The fact is. that the most enthusiastic supporter of the' Government does not expect the bill todomuch to remedy the evils under whichdairymen are labouring. It has been said that the scheme is largely experimental, and that there is very grave doubt that it will provide any relief in. respect to eventho one-thirdof the butter that is exported. I respect the opinions: of those engagedi n the industry who say that the bill will do. something, however, little-, to. relieve the position,, and,, in the hope that we may be able to mould it into some useful, form in committee, I belipvethat honourable members on both sides, will accept it. We have notyet been told what action has been, taken to ascertain the opinions of the dairymen.",31
84,Mr R GREEN,DAIRY PRODUCE EXPOR T,I took such action.. 1 held meetings last week in variousparts of my electorate..,33
85,Mr GABB,DAIRY PRODUCE EXPOR T,"Did the. dairymenapprove of the scheme in its present, or in its original, form f. Mr R GREEN.:-They approved of the last proposal submitted,, but not the tentative one suggested originally.  approve of this bill ? Mr R. G'REEN - The contents of bill were not known to them.  a. very important aspect of the matter. Has the Government consulted the dairymen, whose opinions are the only opinions that matter? It appears to have taken no steps to find out whether, its proposals are approved by them. An important question, from the point of view of the men in the industry, is-, how will the scheme be financed ? Somepeople approach the consideration of this matter with the preconceived idea that the dairyman is not already burdened with manytaxes and other imposts. As a matter of fact, his present burden is a very heavy one, and the Government has not treated the House fairly in not disclosing the financial arrangements it intends to make. In order that honourable members mayform some idea of the burdens that at present f all on the shoulders of those engaged in the industry, I shall place a fewfactsand figures, before the House. licence-fee of 6d.. per cow is levied in Victoria,, and, takingthisas an. average, we can arrive at some idea of the total' levy in this direction. number of dairy cows in the, Commonwealth in 1920-21 was 2,056,00,0, in 1921-2 it was. 2,,.343,„0.00, and in 1922,-3. ik, was 2,39.0.;000.. F o r each. of. those yean respectively the. fee of"" 6d'. per cow amounted to £51,425, £5.8,57.5, and £5.9,750. The average, of, the three years was £5.6.,583. a. yeaij.. Under, the provisions of the Dairy Produce Act of Victoria,, a tax of I'd. isimposed on every 100 l b . of Butter manufactured'. The average of that tax for the three years was £9,862. a year. Oncheese the tax imposed is £d\ per 100' l b . , and for the three years "" it amounted to anaverage of £ 8 2 8 a year. That, however; is not all. Under the regulations covering the export of butter it is compulsory for butter exporters to pay I d . per box as a grading fee. That charge appearsto be very small, but in the aggregate it is a formidable impost. Then there is a halfpenny tax per box-1J coverthe cost of the Commonwealth Dairy Council , a meeting ofwhieh cosi-d 1 £350 . The fees collected under these two : headingsamo-united respectivelyi n 19-2! 1 (io- £9,47 5 and £4,737 , in. 1922' to £5,876 and £ 2 , 9 3 8 , and in 1923: to £4,86 5 ami £.2,434. The average of the first was £6„740-, and. of the second £3,370 a year. A summary of the taxes will show to what the extent the industry is affected bythem. The various items* are £56,583 , £ 9 , 8 5 2, £828 , £6,740 and £3,370, making a total of £77,373 .",33
86,Mr SCULLIN,DAIRY PRODUCE EXPOR T,"The further impost of one-eighth of a penny, will aggregate a similar amount.  endeavoured to work out what the impost of one-eighth of a penny will amount, to on one-third of the butter produced. The quantity of butter exported in the year 192.1-2 was 127,000,000 lb. An impost of one-eighth of a penny per l b . on that would produce £6.6,280. On the butter exported in 1922-3 the impost would be £.41,133, and on. the butter exported last year would he. £3.4,125.. The average for. the three years would he £47,179. Ms. SCULLIN - What does the Government propose to do. with that money?  levy wiil amount to approximately. £50,000 a. year, and the honourable memA ber for Yarra (Mr Scullin). pertinently asks what the. Government proposes to do with that money. The House, should be. told what it. is, wanted for. I have The. shownthat, with licence-fees and other charges, the industry is already bearing a burden of about £80,00.0. a. year, and the Government proposesto impose uponi t a further levy of £50,000 a year. in a plea for those who are engaged in the dairying industry. I wish to shield them from any unnecessary fresh imposition, ""because the burden which they are already bearing is great enough. I should like to know how many share engaged in dairying know anything all about the levy which it is contemplated making under the subsidiary bill yet to 'be introduced. No doubt, we shall be told that much of the revenue from the levy will go towards paying the expenses of the proposed should like to know how many there will be on the board. viously said in this House that the Government has indulged in the ment of so many boards that it will go down in history as the Wooden ment: I am not a believer in the appointment of large unwieldy boards. prefer a small practical board composed of experts. There may be some men doing fairly well in this industry land is freehold, and who can command the services of grown-up members of their families; but this matter should be looked at from the view-point of the sharefarmer and those who are struggling the industry, and have to pay high rents, and must employ labour. The burden which would be imposed such a man to meet the expenses of an unwieldy board cannot be turned aside. It is due to the House and the country that the Government should say what it proposes to do with the £50,000 'a year which is to be raised by a levy of Jd. a lb. on the butter produced in this country. Quite a number of articles has appeared in the press with the lot of those engaged in the dairying industry. When I entered the chamber last night, the honourable  quoting some statements by Mrs Glencross. I have a statement which is worth quoting, though I do not - know whether the paragraph in which it appears was the one quoted by the honourable member for Gippsland. able members are aware that Mrs Glencross was a member of the High Cost of Living Commission appointed by the Victorian Government, and I have me a letter which appeared in the local newspapers directing attention experiences in the Colac district. Mr Farksr Moloney.  that will be fresh.  Glencross draws a very dismal picture of her actual experience of boys seven years farmers of age working on dairy farms from halfat past 5 o'clock in the morning until it was time for them to go to school. I have heard people unthinkingly condemn those engaged in the dairying industry for derived working their children in that way, but honourable members must know that they board. I would not think of doing so if they were members not forced to it by circumstances. It was I have pre- not necessary for Mrs Glencross, or any one else, to tell us that that kind of thing appoint- is going on in the dairying industry. We know that it is going on throughout Govern- the counti-y, because many stragglers could not otherwise make a living, and I it is greatly to be regretted that the Government, though aware of the fact, has dilly-dallied with the matter for so whose long, and has now brought down a bill which proposes to deal only with the one-third of our. butter production which is exported. I cannot see how a man working on shares in this industry can in make a livin g out of it , if he has to employ much outside help. We should additional not condemn the men who are forced to upon work their families in order to keep afloat; we should rather condemn the lightly .Government that looks on, and does nothing-to effectively stabilize the industry. The only way in which we can discover what is wrong with the dairying industry is to have a searching inquiry into it to ascertain the cause of the desympathizing pression, what is wrong with the cost of land, what is wrong in connection with the export and also with the local sale of mem- butter. The facts can only he ascertained was by the searching investigation which has been demanded by the people in the before me industry, - and which has been turned down by the Prime Minister. Honourable members opposite, knowing that the man on the land cannot work up any enHonor- thusiasm for this measure, have told us that another proposal called the Paterson scheme is to be brought forward. We know the amendment which the honorbefore able member for Gippsland (Mr-'. Paterson) intends to submit. The honto her orable member for Richmond (Mr R. Green) last night told us that that proposal would be put forward, and that ib would put members of the Opposition to the tost. He said that members on the Government side would see what the members of the Opposition were going to do when that proposal was submitted.",33
87,Mr R GREEN,DAIRY PRODUCE EXPOR T,"^So we shall.  honourable member gave his whole case away when he made it plain that he does not know whether the Government in tends to accept the so-called Paterson scheme proposed by the honourable member for Gippsland. Mr R GREEN' - We are going to find out.  orable members of the Country party were sincere in the matter, before stating that another proposal, was to be made, they would have ascertained the views of their Leader, the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page), who is a member of the composite Government. The honourable member for Richmond, knowing that the men suffering in the dairying industry will not be enthusiastic concerning this bill, would lead them to believe that he was in favour of something which would benefit them but which was turned down. I tell the honourable member that if the amendment providing for the Paterson scheme is turned down, the blame will rest not upon honourable members on this side, but upon honourable members on the Ministerial side who constitute the majority in this House.",35
88,Mr R GREEN,DAIRY PRODUCE EXPOR T,"If members Opposition support it , the proposal of the honourable member for Gippsland will be carried Mi'. PARKER MOLONEY - The honourable member may get away with that in his own electorate, but he cannot do so here. He says that if we agree to the proposal it will be carried, but even though every honourable member on this side voted against it , it could still be carried if it had the support of the composite Government.",35
89,Mr R GREEN,DAIRY PRODUCE EXPOR T,"Any one who votes against it must take the responsibility doing so.  honourable member cannot escape from the position in which I have placed him. He believes that the scheme proposed by the honourable member for Gippsland will be of benefit to the dairy farmer, and if it is rejected the dairy farmers will ask him the simple question, "" Why was it not carried 1"" The blame will rest, not upon the Opposition, which is in a minority in this House, but upon the Government that has the numbers behind it , and can carry the scheme if it pleases.",35
90,Mr R GREEN,DAIRY PRODUCE EXPOR T,"The blame will fal l upon those who vote against the scheme.  Government does not accept it , it will be because the Leader of the Country party, to which the honourable member for Richmond belongs, as a member of the composite Government, will have refused to sanction it .",35
91,Mr R GREEN,DAIRY PRODUCE EXPOR T,We cannot anticipate what he will do.,35
92,Mr SPEAKER,DAIRY PRODUCE EXPOR T,"The r e is no alternative proposition before the House, and I must ask the honourable member to discuss the bill.  showing the honourable member for Richmond the awkward position into which hiS own speech has forced him. All I have to say about the proposal of the honourable member for Gippsland, or any other proposal, is that if any scheme is submitted, no matter from what quarter, that I believe will benefit the men who are suffering in the dairying industry, I shall give it my whole-hearted support. But we should not be asked to waste the time of the House in considering an amendment if those responsible for it know that the Government of the will not accept it . If honourable members opposite believe that the amendment to be proposed in committee is necessary l o help the people in the dairying industry, they should not leave it to a chance vote, but should persuade the Government to adopt it . Otherwise there will be no chance of the amendment being carried, but a few honourable members opposite will endeavour to gain kudos for having endeavoured to confer benefits upon the dairymen, although they know beforehand that their Government is against them. The subject is too big to be played with for in that way. Honourable members on this sidehave a definite and concrete policy to ensure a fair deal for every worker, whether he be on the land, in the mine, or in the factory. All workers on the farm or elsewhere are entitled to a return for their labour that will enable them to support their wives and families under decent living conditions. If it be ahowu that any man engaged in wheat-growing, dairying or any other industry is not receiving sufficient to cover cost of production, plus a reasonable profit, the Labour party may be depended upon to do its duty. I know of no class of men who are more entitled to be called workers than are the dairy farmers - Even with the most up-to-date methods, no occupation is more constant and exacting, and it is the solemn duty of honourable members on all sides to do anything that will give relief to those engaged in milk production. I have not much faith in the proposals contained in the bill, but, for the sake of what may be effected in the bill in the committee stage, I shall support the second reading. At the same time. I regret that the Government, although confronted with evidence of the desperate condition of the dairy farmers, has done nothing more than introduce experimental legislation, that may not produce any concrete benefits - constituents, Mr CORSER .(Wide Bay) [3.20] The problem presented fey the dairying - industry should fee viewed broadly. A. detailed inquiry into the conditions of the industry would occupy a 'considerable length of - time, and cause a delay which would not Ibe .'in the interests of the producers. Already 'there has been plenty of dm'qudiry:; what is needed now is a scheme that will give prompt relief. Australia's primary need is to increase the population .on the land, hut we .cannot afford to increase the - number of - rural producers unless we are sure 'that the industries in which they engage will be profitable to them. This Parliament protects the .secondary industries- I do. not object to that policy-.and by means of - arbitration courts and wages boards - endeavours to insure to the - employees a living wage. Nothing has been done to .give benefits of that k in d to the dairymen, and if we accept the guidance of the .honourable member - for Kooyong (Mr. Latham), we shall not be able to legislate in a way that will give ih e relief that they need. In other countries, including Germany, when over-production caused in dustries to stagnate, legislation was passed for the protection of the producers. Whilst I congratulate the Prime Minister upon introducing this bill , I hope that the Government will be prepared to accept certain amendments to it . The right honourable gentleman emphasized the fact that if we are to retain possession of this continent - an increase in our population is essential. We are always being warned against enlarging the population of the 'cities and towns, .and the only way to get more people into the country is to guarantee to the primary producer a good living. A .scheme for the regulation of the dairying industry was submitted to - the Prime Minister some time ago'by the interstate conference of dairymen, but upon investigation, I understand, was found to be unconstitutional. Of course, it would have been a waste of time to bring before the House any proposal that was not in accordance with the Constitution. I congratulate the honourable member for Gippsland upon the scheme he has evolved. He has given a great deal of consideration to it , and I am glad that it has been accepted by a very large number of - people and a Victorian newspaper, The GowUrymam,, but in justice toone of my Mr E . L . Delroy, of Murgon, Queensland, I must mention that in 1922 he conceived an almost identical scheme. He forwarded it to the Treasurer, and in May last it was sent on to the Minister for Trade and Customs, and, later, to the Prime Minister. It had been previously approved by the local producers' associations near Murgon, in the Wide Bay electorate. I do not say that the honourable member for Gippsland has pirated the ideas - of Mr Delroy; no doubt he has independently evolved his proposal, and possibly, the favourable consideration it has received in Victoria has influenced the New South Wales factories and dairymen and the Council of Agriculture in Queensland to endorse it , although it did not at first approve of Mr . Delroy's scheme. Such an arrangement as the honourable member has suggested, would be of great benefit to the industry, which would be stabilized without the Commonwealth 'Treasurer having to provide financial assistance. A similar policy was adopted in Germany for the salvation of the sugarbeet industry. When, on account of overproduction, the sugar could not be exported at a price profitable to the producer, an excise duty was imposed on the production of beet sugar, and the proceeds were applied to a bounty on exports. In that way the price of ""beet sugar used for local consumption was increased. If a similar course weTe adopted in Australia with the butter industry, and a levy of I d . per lb. made oa all butter produced, a f u n d would be constituted; for granting a bounty on export in order to raise the price in the local market to the London parity. In other words, freight and other charges on exports would becovered by the bounty, and the producer would be assured of the same, price in the local market as obtained in the British market. I cannot see any objection to such a scheme unless it be that voiced yesterday by the honourable member for Kooyong, who is not favourable to any proposal, to increase the price of butter to the local consumer. But if it be fair to increase the price of secondary products to the consumers by imposing duties on imports in order to give to the manufacturers and alsothe workers in the secondary industries a living wage, why should we not also protect such a vitally important industry as dairying? If at any time the price to the dairy producer was considered fair and reasonable, the board could reduce or stop the bounty altogether. The figures relating ta this industry show that it is of national importance. Thenumber of dairymen engaged in the industry in 1922 was-Ne w South Wales, 20,658, Victoria, 15,130, and South Australia, 1,473; in 1921, Western Australia, 929, and Queensland, 21,695. In the latter case, the figures for 1922 were not available. The* number of butter, cheese, and condensed milk factories in 1921-2 wasNew South Wales,' 183, Victoria 188, South Australia,, 46; and. in 1921,. Queensland, 134, Western Australia, 7, and Tasmania, 33. The value of the dairying; industry in 1922-3 was-Ne w South Wales, £12,914„000 , Victoria, £13,765,580-; and in 1921, Queensland, £7,15ft,891. In 1921-2, the. value of the dairying Industry was„ approximately, £44,000,000, showing how important it is toAustralia-. Honourable members should put aside political considerations and protect this industry in the same way as we protect secondary industries. We on this side, have never objected to giving the worker a fair living wage. In Queensland in 1921, these were 21,695 dairymen; the buttermanufactured was 60,923,194 lb.;- cheese, 15,200,527 l b . ; condensed milk, 15,168,652 l b . The value of the industry was £7,259,891, and the number of dairy cows:, 554,208.. No doubt the figures for 1923-4 would show a. considerable increase. Muchhas been said about improving dairy herds. When* I wasi a member of the Queensland Parliament experimental farms were established throughout the length and breadth of the dairying portion, of the state, and well-bred bulls, were placed at the disposal of the dairy farmers-. 3 represent a large butter-producing district, and I was instrumental in establishing the first butter factory there. There .are now a vast number of them in my electorate,, although there was great difficulty in first establishing them. Great, care was taken to obtain good herds. I admit that their quality could be improved, and I am pleased that the Prime Minister has agreed to assist in financing the scheme if the State Governments also do so; but it must be remembered that cattle in other parts of the world, say in Denmark, are stall fed and consequently yield better returns than ours..",35
93,Mr FENTON,DAIRY PRODUCE EXPOR T,"The producers rear toe many "" dual-purpose ""' cattle. Mr CORSER,-That was so. When the bill is. in committee we should do everything possible to expedite its passage, so that the dairy producers - may receive some immediate benefit,, instead of waiting nine or twelve months, for assistance. Some scheme of stabilization should be introduced to prevent numbers of settlers engaged in. the industry from thrown ng up their holdings and flocking to thecities to findemployment: There is room in Australiaf o r a large-number of people to be settled on the land. We should follovi the example of other parts of the world, whose governments assist the people t< increase production-. Excise duties an imposed, and although the cost for local consumption is increased, the producers are. able to export their products and tt make a comfortable li>ving. If this wen done in Australia, the cry would be raised that a burden was being placed on. tin consumer,, but so long as the consumer ob tained butter at a. fair price,, say, equivalent to that which the British people paid, he would really have no complaint . If settlers were forced to leave the dairying, industry, there would be less production, and prices would soar. The consumer would consequently have to paj much more for butter than would be th< case if the industry had been, protected as suggested. Mr F . MCDQNA.LT* - Does not th& honourable member believe that by following that prinicple the price of laud would increase in ' proportion ?",37
94,Mr CORSER,DAIRY PRODUCE EXPOR T,"No , because in Queensland there are 400,000,000 acres of unalienated land available for settlement. That state has now about 800 miles more railways than any other state. The people there believe in decentralization. Railways have been constructed inland from the various ports along the coast, and there is a vast quantity of land available for dairying and agriculture combined. The Queensland Governmentmakes land available on perpetual lease, but no doubt a change of government would allow these leases to be converted into freehold. The price of freehold ranges from £ 1 to £ 2 per acre, and the settlers have 20 years in which to pay for the land. Advances are also made to enable them to improve their holdings. The establishment of some scheme of stabilization would not, therefore, much increase the price of land for some years. The object of the Queensland Government is to increase that state's population by encouraging people to settle on Crown lands, and thus make a reasonable living. I admit that the position is different in Victoria, where many people, including returned soldiers, have settled on land costing £ 8 0 an acre. This price is exorbitant, and settlers will be ruined unless assistance is given to them. They have acquired the land and must pay for it . Unless we encourage people to come here to settle on the land, we shall not hold for all time this enormous territory against other parts of the world that have no dumping ground for their surplus population. We should endeavour to settle this country on the lines adopted by the United States of America, which country has a population of 112,000,000. . Mr Fenton - The honourable member must not talk like that.",38
95,Mr CORSER,DAIRY PRODUCE EXPOR T,"I talk as I feel. Jf we fail to assist the producers, and thus throw many of them out of employment, - the position, as far as the consumer is concerned, will be 150 times worse than it is now. use would our wages boards be if the Japanese gained control of Australia 1 It should be remembered that it is not very many years since the Japanese said that the Commonwealth Government adopting a dog in the manger policy in respect, to Australia in that it would neither utilize the country nor let others do so. We must settle our country districts if we are to retain possession of Australia. Not u n t i l Australia is supporting a big rural population can we hope to enjoy permanent success, happiness, contentment and safety.",38
96,Mr FENTON,DAIRY PRODUCE EXPOR T,"Maribyrnong) [3.47] In my earlier life I spent seven years organizing dairymen in Victoria, and although I worked with the object of encouraging co-operation, I also had a good deal to do with the export side of the industry. I feel therefore that I am qualified in some degree to speak on this bill. I consider that it will be of very little value to the dairymen of Australia. The mere establishment of control boards here and in London will not help them. Although the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Corser) may deprecate reference to the quality of our dairy herds, I submit that we shall never have a flourishing dairying industry in Australia until our dairy herds are improved. The foundation of success is good herds. The people of Queensland may be satisfied with "" dual-purpose "" herds.",38
97,Mr CORSER,DAIRY PRODUCE EXPOR T,I would welcome an improvement in the herds.,38
98,Mr FENTON,DAIRY PRODUCE EXPOR T,"I can assure the honourable member that it is necessary. Years ago we found it very difficult to get the dairymen of Victoria to improve their herds, for so many of them wanted to give as much attention to raising bull calves of good colour and type as to in creasing the milk yield from their cows. It was only after a considerable time that they realized that if they were to make a success of dairying they must establish good dairy herds. The dairymen in Denmark at one time also gave considerable attention to the type of bull calf that they raised, but they soon came to see that their chief concern must be the establishment of herds which would yield larger milk returns. They learned their lesson so well'that people who want an example to follow in improving the dairying industry cannot do better than copy the Danish practice. By breeding first class Of _ what herds and entering whole-heartedly into a co-operative system of marketing their produce, the Danish producers have achieved wonderful success. The dairymen of Australia would be well advised to accept the advice given years ago to the was Irish dairymen by Sir Horace Plunkett. to go to Denmark to see what was done there, and then return to their own try and do likewise. Although Australia do not consider that twenty witha good herd.' acres is a large dairy far m , and a with twenty acres in Denmark is regarded almost as a squatter, the principles that have been successful in Denmark would be equally successful in Australia. When comparing Denmark with Australia from a dairying stand-point it should be membered that while Danish butter is marketed principally in Newcastle, H u l Grimsby and the northern ports of England, OUT own Australian butter is disposed of in London, south of England, and Wales. tralian butter competes more with Argentine, New Zealand and Siberian butter than with Danish butter. It can hardly be argued that Australia's opporbe tunities in the dairying industry are infinitely greater than those of Denmark, for we have very far flung areas of land suitable for dairying purposes. I wish refer to several, illustrations given by the honourable member for Gippsland (Paterson), in discussing the .dairying dustry yesterday in support of his contention thati t is almost impossible, under the most favourable Australian conditions, for dairying to be profitable. do not agree with his view. He gave one illustration of a herd of 31 cows, which returned produce worth only £ 3 7 6 , and tinue my remarks. anothor of a heard of 65 cows, the annual return from which was £ 8 7 3 , and said that when working expenses were deducted from those returns the margin was so small that the was unprofitable. In contrast with those illustrations I quote the experience of Messrs. Vagg Brothers, for Defence) [ 4 . 1 ] who have a herd of 35 first class dairy cows in the honourable member's own district, which returned in one year produce Dear Mr Bowden, valued at £ 7 3 5 . To put it in another way, a first class herd about half the size of one mentioned by the honourable member for Gippsland returned nearly the same amount of produce.  tration of a herd which returned £ 2 5 0 net, the wags value of which was only Is. i d . per hour.",38
99,Mr FENTON,DAIRY PRODUCE EXPOR T,"I regret that I did not catch the detailo of the t h i r d illustration the honourable member gave yesterday, but I understood him to quote his first illusmiralty. tration to show the return from a herd of poor cows, the second to show counreturn from a mediumherd, and the we in third to indicate what could be done There is a man great difference between the amount ef labour required to attend to 65 cows for a return of £ 8 7 3 , and the care of 35 cows for practically the same financial result. The honourable member for Gippsland also quoted a remarkable return from one cow, rewhich, I understand, returned her owner £42 per annum. If we could so improve l , our herds as' to ensure higher returns from a lesser number of cows, the labour involved would be materially reduced, and the the dairying industry substantially adAusvanced. I am aware that it is very easy for one not directly engaged in the industry to give good advice as to how it should carried on, but it is not so very long not since I milked a cow myself, and I know the value of a good beast. The bill will not give relief to our dairymen. Honorto able members probably are aware of the views expressed by Mr O'Callagban, the Mr Commonwealth dairy expert, who rei n - turned recently from the Old Country.",39
