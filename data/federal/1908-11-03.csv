1,Mr HALL,VISIT OF MINISTERS TO,"I wish to know from the Treasurer if there is any truth in the report that he and the honorary Minister contemplate making a trip to England shortly. If so, I should like to be informed what they are going to do when they get there.",11
2,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,VISIT OF MINISTERS TO,"I thought that no honourable member would take the rumour seriously. As I like to be short and decisive, my reply is that there is no truth in it. PAPER. Mr GROOM laid upon the table the following paper:High Court-Judgmen t in the Appeal from the President of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration in the case of the Jumbunna Coal Mine and another and the Victorian Coal Miners' Association. LEAVE OF ABSENCE. Motion (by Mr DEAKIN) agreed toThat leave of absence for twg months be given on account of ill health to the honourable member for Eden-Monaro. LITHGOW IRON INDUSTRY.",11
3,Mr THOMAS BROWN,VISIT OF MINISTERS TO,"Has the attention of the Prime Minister been directed to a reprint from the Lithgow Mercury, of 14th October, headed, "" Iron and Steel Production in Lithgow. Statement by the Government Testing Engineer""? article commencesThe following statement regarding the manufacture of pig iron, wrought iron, and steel, at Lithgow, New South Wales, has been supplied by Mr W. F. Burrow, C.E., Testing Engineer to the New South Wales Government. Will the honourable and learned gentleman have the report authenticated and laid on the table, as it seems to contain informathere tion which would be of value to honourable members ?",11
4,Mr DEAKIN,VISIT OF MINISTERS TO,"I believe that I have a mentcopy of the report. It shall be looked into, with a view to complying with the before honourable member's request, if the paper upon appears to deserve re-publication. PROTECTION OF UNIONISTS.",11
5,Mr TUDOR,VISIT OF MINISTERS TO,"The Prime Minister promised last week to ascertain whether the Arbitration Act protects the unionist miners of Jumbunna and Outtrim. Has he done so, and is he aware that the companies are now compelling unionists to send to them their union tickets, and. to forward their resignations to the secretary of the union?",11
6,Mr DEAKIN,VISIT OF MINISTERS TO,"I have taken steps to give effect to the promise, but have not yet received a report. When one arrives I shall inform the honourable member. NA COMMUNICATION.",11
7,Mr CARR,EUROPEAN CABLE,Is the Prime Minister prepared to support Mr Henniker Heaton's proposal for a rate of i d . per word for cable messages between Australia and the Old World?,11
8,Mr DEAKIN,EUROPEAN CABLE,"For some time past we have been endeavouring to arrange, through the Pacific Board, for such a reduction in charges as would cheapen the Australian rate.",11
9,Mr CARR,EUROPEAN CABLE,What about the Atlantic service ?,11
10,Mr DEAKIN,EUROPEAN CABLE,"Tk.at appears to have excluded competition, our main hope being in the Pacific service. The negotiations are still proceeding. The representatives of the Commonwealth .are using every endeavour to induce the other members of the Board to take the steps necessary to obtain a reduction. But. our Utmost hope has not gone as far as aÂ«rate of ad. per word.",11
11,Mr FISHER,EUROPEAN CABLE,Can the Government get a rate of is. per word?,11
12,Mr DEAKIN,EUROPEAN CABLE,We should regard a rate of is. a word as a substantial advanThe tage. It is at that we have been aiming for the last two or three years. OLD-AGE PENSIONS.,11
13,Mr JH CATTS,EUROPEAN CABLE,"Has the Treasurer seen the statement in today's Age in regard to Federal old-age pensions? If so, I wish to know if he supplied the representative of the newspaper with the information set out, and whether the statements there appearing are a correct expression of his views? Does he agree with this stateIndeed, it is likely that the Federal Treasurer will find in the power of bringing applicants thea pauperizingmagistrate, the one sufficient check tendencies of a section of the Federal Parliament. If the Minister agrees with that, I wish to know what section of the Parliament is referred to. Sir WILLI AM LYNE - The information published in the Age was not supplied by me, and I was as much surprised as the honourable member could have been to read it this morning. I am not responsible for a word therein contained, and intend to say something in regard to old-age pensions this afternoon. COINAGE.",11
14,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,EUROPEAN CABLE,"Has the Treasurer considered the advisability of acting on .the report of the Select Committee, subsequently adopted by the House, in favour of a system of decimal coinage ? I do not wish the Minister to answer now if he is not prepared to do so. Possibly he may deal with, the subject in his reply to the debate on the Budget. If so I shall be satisfied.",12
15,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EUROPEAN CABLE,I do intend to say a few words with reference to the subject in my speech this afternoon. COMMONWEALTH AND STATES: FINANCIAL RELATIONS.,12
16,Mr WISE,EUROPEAN CABLE,"I desire to ask the Treasurer, without notice, whether his attention has been called to a statement published in the Brisbane Courier of 30th September, reporting utterances alleged to have been made by the honourable member for Moreton with reference to the relations between States and the Commonwealth ? If so, will the honourable gentleman state whether the allegations are correct? paragraph is rather long, and I will hand it to the Treasurer. Honorable MEMBERS - Rea d it.",12
17,Mr WISE,EUROPEAN CABLE,"The paragraph readsIn the course of conversation yesterday, Mr. Hugh Sinclair, M.H.R., touched on the question of State rights. "" The relations of the States to Federal finance require the most serious consideration,"" he remarked. "" The protection of the Braddon clause will expire in 1910, and, judging from the Estimates now before the Federal Parliament, large encroachments will be made on the three-fourths of Customs and Excise revenue hitherto returned to the States. In fact, we have no guarantee that for the next three years the whole of the three-fourths will be returned. The recent High Court decision on the Surplus Revenue B i ll permits the Federal Treasurer to take retrospective action.",12
18,Mr SPEAKER,EUROPEAN CABLE,I could not allow the honourable member to read the whole of the article from which he is quoting.,12
19,Mr WISE,EUROPEAN CABLE,What I have stated convevs a good idea of it.,12
20,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EUROPEAN CABLE,"The paragraph, to which the honourable member has referred was brought under my notice this morning. The statement that he hasquoted, namely, thatThe protection of the Braddon clause w i ll expire in 1910is of course true. But the statement proceedsJudging from the Estimates now before the Federal Parliament, large encroachments w i ll be made on the three-fourths of Customs and Excise revenue hitherto returned to the States; in fact, we have no guarantee that for the next.' two years the whole of the three-fourths will be returned. I cannot understand any member of Parliament making such a. statement as that.. It is not correct. I said in my Budget speech, and I think that I have stated at other times, that until 1910 the Constitution will be carried out, and the three-fourths Customs and Excise revenue returned to the States.",12
21,Mr TILLEY BROWN,EUROPEAN CABLE,It must be.,12
22,Mr MAHON,EUROPEAN CABLE,Queenslan d says that shehas not received her three-fourths.,12
23,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EUROPEAN CABLE,"The States in. the aggregate have received three-fourths of the total. Further down in the paragraph there is another statement which seems to be misleading."" It says The Commerce Act is administered by the States. The Act is not administered by the States. It is administered by the Department of Trade and Customs. Some States officers, The may act for us, but, as a matter of fact, the Act is administered by our own Department.",12
24,Mr CROUCH,EUROPEAN CABLE,"Las t Friday the Prime Minister made an interjection, during the speech of the honourable member for Mernda, in which he said that an opportunity would be given later on for considering fully the question of the taking, over of the States debts by the Commonwealth. I wish to ask the honourable gentleman whether that opportunity will beafforded this session, and also whether he purposes to proceed by Bill or by resolution ?",12
25,Mr DEAKIN,EUROPEAN CABLE,"If time had permitted"" this session, the whole scheme in relation to Federal finance and the financial relations between the Commonwealth and* States would have been submitted to Parliament. I am, however, unable to promise that the matter will be dealt with this session, if the session is to close by Christmas. But even before that time there will probably be another opportunity for an expression of opinion.",12
26,Mr CROUCH,EUROPEAN CABLE,Is it proposed to proceed by Bill or resolution?,13
27,Mr DEAKIN,EUROPEAN CABLE,B y resolution.,13
28,Mr JOHNSON,EUROPEAN CABLE,"I desire to ask the Treasurer, without notice, whether arrangements are in progress with the Treasurers of the States with a view to some understanding being arrived at as to what is to be done after the year 1910, with regard to the amount of revenue to be retained by the Commonwealth? Will any revenue be returned to the States after that date?",13
29,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EUROPEAN CABLE,"If I gather the purpose of the honourable member's question aright, he desires to know Whether negotiations are proceeding between the Federal and States Governments as to what is going to happen after 1910? I do not think so, except that I understand that the Premiers of States intend to meet shortly to attempt to deal with the financial question. I have no doubt that the Prime Minister and I will meet the Premiers in conference if circumstances seem to demand that we should.",13
30,Mr JOHNSON,EUROPEAN CABLE,Has the Treasurer anything in his mind ?,13
31,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EUROPEAN CABLE,I shall keep it there. DEFENCE DEPARTMENT. NA TUBES IN VICTORIA - MILITAR Y BOARD.,13
32,Mr CROUCH,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"the Minister of Defence, ufon notice I. How long have the new short rifles been distributed to Victorian corps? 2. How many Morris tube rifles have been distributed with them for training purposes? 3. How many corps have been neglected or overlooked in this distribution ?",13
33,Mr EWING,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow : 1. The first issue was made last August, and nearly all corps have been supplied. It is expected that the distribution will be completed in a few weeks. 2 and 3. No aiming tubes have yet been issued for the short rifle, as a sufficient number has not yet been received complete from England. Pending receipt of these, corps will retain in use the Morris Tubes on issue with the Long Rifle. Instructions have been given that action be expedited.",13
34,Mr ROBERTS,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"the Minister of Defence, upon noticer. When was the Military Board established? 2. Who held the position of secretary of the Board prior to the appointment of Lieut - Colonel Legge? 3. What was the salary paid to that secretary ?",13
35,Mr EWING,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"The answer to the honourable member is1. 12th January, 1905. 2 and 3. In July last two additional regular members were appointed to the Military Board, a civil member dealing with contracts and supplies and administration of civil business, and a military secretary, Lieut - Colon<;l Legge.

36,Mr MCDOUGALL,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"the Minister of External Affairs, u f o n notice I. Whether it is a fact that, in connection with the murder of the New Hebridean settler and his daughters, the cruiser Prometheus has been despatched under orders to "" punish"" the natives ? 2. Is it true, as stated in the press, that to ""punish"" the natives means to shoot down, without discrimination, the innocent as well as the guilty ? 3. Are the natives suspected of the crime, if captured, to receive any kind of trial? 4. When the Prometheus has completed its work, will he inform the House of the nature of the punishment inflicted on the natives, and state how many have been punished ?",14
37,Mr DEAKIN,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :These questions relate to crimes outside the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth, which may have to be dealt with as acts of war. Natives accused of crimes are tried in the Courts of Fiji. CANCELLED MAIL CONTRACT: GUARANTEE. . Mr DEAKIN - Before Government business is called on, it may be as well to inform the House that the protracted litigation-o r rather the preliminary proceedings to what promised to be protracted litigation-at the instance of the Commonwealth Government against the late tenderers for the European mail contract, have been brought to a conclusion. It will be remembered that the amount of the bond was .Â£25,000. That was the sum sued for. Under the circumstances the Government have accepted a sum of Â£1:7,500, and the payment of all our costs. In Committee of Sufpiy: Debate resumed from 30th October (vide page 1822) on motion by Sir WILLIAM LYNEThat the item, ""The President, ^1,100,"" be agreed to.",14
38,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"Hume-Trea surer) [3.19] - When progress was reported on Friday afternoon, I had commenced my reply to some of the statements which had been made during the debate in regard to the Budget and the policy of the Government. I had proceeded as far as to quote figures relating to Commonwealth investments in London, and in Australia, showing the satisfactory results. I had shown that we had lost no time, but had invested long before Parliament met a very large sum of money, which amounts now to between Â£ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 and Â£ 6 0 0 , 0 0 0 , at a fair rate of interest. So that .all the money that was available in trust funds has been invested, and has not been allowed to lie idle.",15
39,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,Does the Bank of England guarantee the investments?,15
40,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,I am now referring to money invested in Australia. I have already stated the arrangements made with the Bank of England.,15
41,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,Does the Bank of England guarantee the investments upon which it charges commission?,15
42,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"Yes . stated the position clearly in my Budget speech. With regard to the criticism of the Budget by the leader of the Opposition, one feature of his speech which struck me very forcibly whilst he was speaking was his statement that there was no surplus. The right honourable member was evidently calculating that the Commonwealth finances are kept according to the same method as is adopted in regard to the States finances. But he overlooked the fact that under our present conditions the Federal Treasurer can have no surplus under any circumstances. If there is more.money than is required for purposes for which appropriations have been made, that money, which would otherwise be a surplus, must go into the trust funds either for old-age pensions or for defence purposes.",15
43,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,I think. the Treasurer misunderstood the leader of the Opposition.,15
44,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"I took the rjght honourable member's statement down . - in writing, and my secretary also made a nor^e BUDGET. of it.. /",15
45,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,The..poin t of the leader of the Opposition was that if the Treasurer expended anything beyond his expectations he would have a deficiency.,15
46,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"He did not say that. What the honourable member states may have been in the mind of the leader of the Opposition, but that was not what he said. Any money that is available must go either to the trust funds for the two purposes to which I have referred, or it must be paid back to the States. What I have said in connection with the matter is . that under the Constitution the Federal Treasurer has to see that the States obtain their three-fourths until 1910, or until some other arrangement is made. I hold - and I am going to take this coursethat until 1910, considering the necessities of the Commonwealth, the States must not look forward to receiving anything more than their three-fourths. If that position had been taken up some time ago, it would have been very much better than, waiting until now to adopt such a policy, -.",15
47,Mr WILKS,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"That is the policy,, that should have been adopted vears- - ago...",15
48,Sir WTLLIAMLYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"I question very much whether we could have done it effectively years ago, except by actually spending the money on works, and. in a vari&ty of other ways. We could notjiave adopted f this line of policy until the, termination of I the five years period. 1",15
49,Mr WILKS,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,That period.was over two years ago.,15
50,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"It expired last year-som e time in October. A great deal of obloquy was hurled at me because I - teak the course I did last June. Unfortunately, I could not last June deal with any revenue received before that month, even, if we could have saved or used for the Commonwealth Â£ 3 3 3 , 0 0 0 more than we. obtained in June last. I was unable to take the action that I took before introducing the Surplus Revenue Bill . It is gratifying to me now to know that the action which we took has been ratified by the High Court unanimously, with costs in favour of the Commonwealth. That question may, therefore, be regarded as settled. I have been asked by some honourable members why I have not provided for all the money that will be required during the next two or three years, and how I am going to provide for it.",15
51,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,The question is how the Treasurer is going to provide for the demands that he knows will be made upon him.,16
52,Mr TILLEY BROWN,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"The Treasurer does not expect to be in office two or three rears hence, surely.",16
53,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"Certainly , I do.",16
54,Mr JOHNSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,The Treasurer is very sanguine.,16
55,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,It is better to be fairly sanguine. I do not like to be pessimistic. It seems to me to be unfair to expect the Treasurer to provide for a period unduly beyond the: year for he is financing.,16
56,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"Certainl y it is I am talking about. fair if the proposals are actually before Parliament, as they are in this case.",16
57,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,What for?,16
58,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,For various things. I gave a list in my speech. mentioned the defence scheme and other projects.,16
59,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"What money country will be required for the defence scheme beyond this year it is impossible for at the present stage to say. It would be of no use for me to give an approximation of the money required to be spent. I cannot make a calculation until I can take absolutely nnd definitely into consideraamount tion the requirements after the law on question has been passed. Only eight must months of the present financial year to run. What I believe the honourable member had in his mind, however, was the expenditure that may be involved in future on the transcontinental railway, spondence ? the Northern Territory, and other undertakings.",16
60,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"Expenditur e for those purposes will have to be ingive them all they require at once. curred further on. Sir WILLI AM LYNE - Still , I have been asked to say what I am going to with regard to them. I am not prepared fore. at this stage to say how money will be provided for undertakings lying so far ahead. I am prepared, however, to meet all the expenditure that is required year. I have gone further than that, although it was not necessary for me as Treasurer to go further at present. I have stated that I will provide the money for old-age pensions for 1910, andT that will be done.",16
61,Mr SAMPSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,What about increased postal services ? . .,16
62,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"I can only say with regard to that matter that the Posts and Telegraph Department is. obtaining, more money than it ever had before.",16
63,Mr SAMPSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,It wants more.,16
64,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,Does it? I am not sure that that Department doeswant more. I think it requires a great deal of economical management. It is not because there is a rush that every one is to have at once everything he asks for. The state of things at the present momentis that there has been an undue rush.,16
65,Mr SAMPSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"It is an evidence of which the prosperity of the country. Sir WILLI AM LYNE - I know what I have had a considerable amount of experience, not only as Treasurer of the largest State in Australia, but also as Minister of Works in that State. I know what claims are put in, and am fully aware of how necessary it I is for the Treasurer to know what the* money is wanted for. If a number of Departments, and if many people in thewere to get all that they wanted) at once, I do not know how much exme penditure would be involved each year.",16
66,Mr MCDOUGALL,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"There is no stinting, as far as the capitals are concerned?",16
67,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"I have had to be very cautious in seeing that an undueof money was not expended. As the to the capitals, the honourable member not forget that the largest proportion, have of our population is centred in them.",16
68,Mr MCDOUGALL,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,What would the Department do without the country corre,16
69,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"The country cannot expect everything. The country districts have a right to a great deal of consideration!, but it is not possible toI think that I have gone to extremes in giving, the Postal Department this year about do Â£300,000 more than it has ever had be",16
70,Mr SAMPSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"Does the honourable gentleman regard that as a very substantia] increase, where the total expenditurethis amounts to over Â£3,000,000?",16
71,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"I think it is. Honourable members should not forget that if interest on buildings is taken into account, the revenue of the Department is considerably less than the expenditure. It is unreasonable for honourable members to expect that we shall be able to meet all the demands made at once. The position is a difficult one.",16
72,Mr SAMPSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,The revenue of the Department is commensurate with the proposed expenditure ,17
73,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"No . I noticed a statement in .the press this morning to the effect that during the past few years, if interest on buildings be taken into account, the revenue of the Department has been from Â£ 4 0 0 , 0 0 0 to Â£ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 short of what wasrequired to meet expenditure.",17
74,Mr SAMPSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"The reason is that, especially in country districts, the telephone service has come greatly into favour during the last two or three years. Sir WILLIAMLY ' NE - It is true that the telephone service has come greatly into favour. The Department is rushed with demands for telephone facilities, and the charges are too low.",17
75,Mr TUDOR,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"Hear , hear ! Why do not the Government increase them ?",17
76,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"That is another matter, the decision of which does not rest with me. We must meet the demand for expansion in the Department, but it must be carefully done. It would not be wise to propose a largely increased expenditure upon a Department that is not paying expenses under existing circumstances, aud that makes low charges for services rendered. I. personally believe that the charges are extremely low, and that no harm would be done by increasing them to such an extent as to cover expenses.",17
77,Mr JOHNSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"Wit h the object of ducing business again? Sir WILLIAM LY'NE - No . There is no doubt that the demand for expenditure in this Department has been such as no Treasurer could meet in the circumstances, I am asked to find a lot of money, from the expenditure of which there would be no return.",17
78,Dr WILSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,Countr y telephone offices are paying the Department handsomely.,17
79,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"The Department is not paying at all in the true sense, if all its obligations were met.",17
80,Mr MAHON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"The Auditor-General has suggested that the expenditure has advanced by over Â£ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 during Federation. 9 Budget. 1829",17
81,Dr WILSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"A number of country telephone services are paying 50 per cent, on the actual cost. . Sir WILLIAM LYNE - Most of the new services asked for at the present time would not pay. I hope honourable members will permit me to continue what I wish to say.",17
82,Dr WILSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,We are trying to help the honourable gentleman.,17
83,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"The honourable member would help me into my political grave if he could. It is unreasonable to ask any Treasurer to finance for years ahead, especially in the case of a young Federation such as ours. It might be much more easily done in the case of a State whose business has been carried on for forty, fifty, or sixty years. Honourable members should not forget that during the existence of the Federation, the financial fluctuations have been very great, ancl no person could accurately foretell what might happen as regards trie finances within the next few years. In the circumstances, it would be very unwise for any Treasurer to estimate expenditure required some years hence, ancl I am not going to attempt to do it.",17
84,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"But Ministers have submitted political schemes which will require increased expenditure; we have no surplus, and, in the circumstances, it is the honourable gentleman's business to say where the money to give effect to those schemes is to come from.",17
85,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,The honourable gentleman knows that we have a surplus.,17
86,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,Not this vear.,17
87,Sir WTLLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,We are placing a lot of money in trust funds even this year.,17
88,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"That is not a resurplus. Sir WILLIAM . LYNE - If it were not for the fact that* we are placing a lot of monev in trust funds, we should this yea) have an immense surplus.",17
89,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,But that money must be spent.,17
90,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"There is nc question about that, and it has been appropriated also. The statement was made just now in connection .with the allegation of the leader of the Opposition that there was no provision for a surplus. This is what the right honourable gentleman said- There is no provision even on paper for a surplus of one penny to meet the possibilities of finance. That is what I have referred to, and under no conditions can there be a surplus in the sense referred to.",17
91,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"Oh , yes, there can.",18
92,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,Unde r no conditions can there be a surplus of one farthing. There never has been a surplus in Federal finance.,18
93,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,Then how is it the subject. that we have had anv surplus revenue?,18
94,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,What has been called surplus revenue has had to be returned to the States.,18
95,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,But the honpaid orable gentleman could have drawn upon it before it was handed back to the States.,18
96,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"We could have drawn on it for the purposes for which it honourable was appropriated, but for no other purpose. some time.",18
97,Dr WILSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,The honourable gentleman could have drawn on it before he set it aside to be returned to the States.,18
98,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"I am afraid on that honourable members do not know much about Federal finance. All their arguments and statements have been based upon the experience of State, and not of Federal finance. That was the case with the speech of the honourable member for North of Customs and Excise revenue. Sydney.",18
99,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,No ; the honamount orable gentleman misunderstood it.,18

101,Dr WILSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"That is the business of the Government, not of the honourable member for Flinders.",18
102,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,It was at the say that he is absolutely incorrect. suggestion of the honourable member for Flinders that the Treasurer introduced his Surplus Revenue Bill.,18
103,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"I beg the hononce orable gentleman's pardon. It was not at the suggestion of the honourable member Flinders at all. That measure originated long before the honourable member for Flinhe ders said a word on the subject. The Bill was prepared, and in type, before the honrowed money. orable member for Flinders dealt with the matter.",18
104,Mr WISE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,And the honourable member voted against the Bill.,18
105,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,The honourable member for North Sydney is mistaken in saying that the Surplus Revenue Bill was based on the suggestion of the honourable member for Flinders. It was nothing of the kind.,18
106,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,Nothin g was done in the matter until long after the honourable member for Flinders had spoken on,18
107,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,The honourable member for Flinders said the other nightThe compensation to the States for the value of property transferred should this year be out of the Commonwealth's one-fourth.,18
108,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,That was not the honourable member's statement. The member spoke on the subject for tation Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I have the quohere.,18
109,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,The honourable member for Flinders referred to the interest the transferred propertv.,18
110,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,Yes ; the suggestion was that the compensation due on transferred properties should be paid this year out of the Commonwealth's one-fourth How could it be paid until we know what the is? Is it not farcical for any honourable member in his senses to make such,18
111,Dr WILSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,Whose fault is it that we do not know the amount?,18
112,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,I suppose it is to the fact that it has not been possible The in the time available for mere human beings down to complete so immense a task.,18
113,Dr WILSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"The honourable gentleman has had control of the matter for seven years, and has done nothing.",18
114,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"The honourable member is as correct in that statement as in most others that he makes, and that is to I should like to know whether the honourable member for Flinders was in earnest in his suggestion that the Commonwealth should at hand over Â£8,000,000 or Â£9,000,000 to the States to expend. I should also like for to know whether the honourable member is aware that the transferred properties ""which suggests ought now to be paid for were largely constructed by the States out of bor",18
115,Mr BOWDEN,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,Why not take over the liabilities as well as the assets?,18
116,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"We shall do what we wish to do. Evidently the honourable member, from his statement and actions, wishes to impoverish the Commonwealth-that has been the game of the Opposition right through. There are several other matters in the speeches of honourable members to which I had intended to refer, but I do not think that it is necessary for me to do so. The deputy leader of the Opposition referred at length to the financial question; but, after having heard him, and having read the Hansard report, I cannot see that he touches in any way the proposals of the Government, which are simplicity itself. The honourable member for Parramatta tried to make us believe that the Government proposed to pay Â£4,101,000 as a sinking fund, in order to meet the whole of the indebtedness of the States-which , I think, amounts to Â£247,000,000-in thirty-five years.",18
117,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"The Treasurer is hopeless, because I said the very opposite-that the Commonwealth has no such intention.",19
118,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,The honourable member for North Sydney took me to task the other night because I said the Federal Government had no such intention.,19
119,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,No .,19
120,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"And a similar view was taken by the leader and deputy leader of the Opposition. The words I used wereTo place themselves in the position which the Commonwealth Treasurer offers to place them in-that is, of being relieved of their debts, now totalling ^'247,974,624, in thirty-five yearsan annual payment to Sinking Fund, accumulating at 3 per cent, interest, would be necessary of ^4,101,000.",19
121,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,They never proposed such a thing.,19
122,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"But the deputy leader, and the leader of the Opposition both say that is what I proposed.",19
123,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,No .,19
124,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,I went on to say that neither had there been any proposal by the Commonwealth to pay off all the debt.,19
125,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,No r by States.,19
126,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"We propose to take over the debts, and ask the States to pay Â£2,890,000 for the first five years, and afterwards a gradually reduced amount which disappears at the end of thirty-five years. The Commonwealth takes over the whole of the debts, and the responsibility for the interest; and it is for the Commonwealth to decide how, and under what conditions, and in what length of time, it will pay the Â£247,000,000. It has never been proposed that the Commonwealth should pay off the indebtedness at any particular time; but it will take sixty or seventy years, and require Â£1*074,556 to be paid each year, if paid off in seventy years.",19
127,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,That has not been provided for.,19
128,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,Quite so; I am merely pointing out what will be required each year; and I take it that probably something of the kind will be proposed.,19
129,Mr TILLEY BROWN,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,Surely the calculation is wrong?,19
130,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"It is a calculation by the Treasury. It must not be forgotten that a sinking fund at a small percentage will pay off a large indebtedness very easily over such a long period of time. I remember that in New South Wales I was instrumental in passing the Water Supply to Country Towns Act; and a sinking fund of one-half per cent, was sufficient to pay off the whole in 100 years.",19
131,Mr FISHER,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"I should think so; with fths per cent., it ought not to take more than seventy-five years at compound interest.",19
132,Dr WILSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"It is absolutely ridiculous to think of paying off Â£247,000,000 at the rate and in the time named.",19
133,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"The percentage necessary for a sinking fund is found to be amazingly small when extended ovei a long period; and the whole result is owing to the compound interest. As to old-age pensions, I was asked today whether I had given any information to the press, and I replied that I was as much astonished as any one to see what had appeared, and that where the news had been obtained I did not know. But I do say that, so far as my investigation goes, there seems to be an extraordinary state of affairs in New South Wales. I do not say that Victoria is paying as much as ought the to be paid in this connection; but the difference between the payments in the two States is, in many respects, so marked that I cannot help thinking that there is a great mistake somewhere.",19
134,Mr JH CATTS,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,There may be a difference in the Acts.,19
135,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"There is some difference, but not much. What I desire to find out is, if Parliament-whic h is the reflex of the people-is anxious to provide old-age pensions-wha t the pensions are to be; and I have in my mind, especially, invalid pensions. I am informed that in New South Wales the departmental arrangemaits are rather peculiar, in that the Central Board has no power over the District Board. There are one or two District Boards in every police district, and each Board has full power to decide who shall have pensions, and what the amount shall be up to the limit prescribed by the Act ; and the Central Board, or the Minister, has no power to alter any decision of a District Board. The usual course is for an applicant to obtain a doctor's certificate, which he sents to the District Board, that he has premonitory symptoms of some disease; and, although at the time he may not be incapacitated from working, he is granted a pension, and goes on with hiis occupation. It is anticipated that this year something like Â£690,000 will be expended upon old-age pensions in New South Wales, as against an expenditure of about Â£590,000 last year.",19
136,Mr JH CATTS,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"Does the honourable; member say that there are at the present time in New South Wales persons drawing invalid pensions, and yet working? Sir WILLIAM LVNE - I am told that there are. I am simply giving honourable members reports made to me by officers I have interviewed. I questioned one officer very closely as to why such a system was allowed, and was told that a person having, say, a tendency to consumption, could obtain a certificate to that effect, and on presenting it to a District Board might obtain a pension. The pension could not' be denied him if the District Board considered that he ought to receive it. I am informed that there are! many cases of the kind. I wish to disabuse the minds of honourable members of any idea that I should be disposed to deal illiberally with decrepit or aged persons who ought to receive pensions. I think I may take to myself some little credit for having initiated the old-age pensions system in New South Wales, and I hope that I am not so hard hearted as not to be prepared to deal more liberally with deserving persons than some would do. In the interests of the public, however, the system must be cautiously and carefully guarded, more especially when we find that 40 per cent, of the 46,000 people over sixty-five years of age in New South Wales are receiving old-age pensions, whereas only 16 per cent. of some 66,000 persons over sixty-five years of age in Victoria are drawing them.",20
137,Mr SAMPSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,The honourable member would not quote what is being done under the Victorian Act as an example that we should follow?,20
138,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"I am simply giving the figures. The Victorian Act may be too stringent. I cannot express a definite opinion on the point as I have yet to make further inquiries; but the difference between the number of persons over sixty-five years of age drawing old age pensions in Victoria and in New South Wales is certainly remarkable^ New South preWalesis, I think, just as healthy as is Victoria.",20
139,Dr WILSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,But Victoria is more prosperous.,20
140,Mr CHANTER,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"The difference is due to the fact that in Victoria the relatives of a pensioner have in many cases to contribute to his pension. . Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I am endeavouring to get at the root of the matter, but do not wish honourable members to imagine for one moment that I would refuse a pension to any one who was deserving of it. My desire is to protect the public against any abuse of the system. If the provisions of the New South Wales Act were applicable all over Australia every bread-winner in the Commonwealth would have to contribute .Â£2 10s. per annum towards the cost of the system. It seems to me impossible that the cost of the Commonwealth system could be so great if the Act were properly administered. I have given much thought to the subject, and having made maniy calculations of the probable cost, have come to the conclusion that, with proper management, the expenditure is not likely to exceed that for which I have made provision on the Estimates. According to some calculations that have been made, it will be considerably less. Assuming that the cost of the Victorian system is only one-half of what it should be, and that the cost of that in New South Wales is one-half in excess of what it ought to be, the expenditure on the Commonwealth system, taking it all through, will be less than that for which I have provided . I1 am giving the question my earnest attention, and can only say that if more money is required to finance the system more will be provided.",20
141,Mr FISHER,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,Wh v does the honourable member emphasize the point that every ^bread-winner would have to pay Â£ 2 ios. per annum towards the cost of the system if that in force in New South Wales were applied to the Commonwealth?,20
142,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,I am going - on the basis of a calculation that has been made.,21
143,Mr FISHER,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,Shoul d not the revenues from the land provide for the aged and infirm? Sir WILLIAM . LYNE - I know what - the honourable member has in mind'. have always been in favour of a progressive land tax.,21
144,Mr FISHER,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,Then why use the other argument ?,21
145,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"I am called upon to do so, because the money must <be paid wherever it is to come from. I do not say at present how it should be provided- The Prime Minister has said more than once that he cannot introduce progressive land tax legislation during the life of this Parliament. - cannot speak for the Ministry, I may say at once that if I were at liberty to propose such a tax at the present time. I should be justified in doing so, since I have said' before that I would if the opportunity offered. The fact remains that on a population basis, allowing four to a family, the head of every family would have to pay Â£""2 10s. per annum towards the cost of a Commonwealth old-age pensions system based on the lines of that in force in New South Wales.",21
146,Mr MAHON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"There r,684,000 bread-winners in Australia.",21
147,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"The Treasury - officials have made a calculation, showing that the cost of such a system would be .a little over Â£ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 , and that would mean that every bread-winner would have to pay the amount I have stated. cost must largely depend upon how the system is administered, and it is difficult to say what it will be. If we require more than I have estimated, however, the money will be found in some way or other. I am personally prepared to go to the extent of proposing that the necessary funds be provided by means of direct taxation, and if they cannot be obtained in any other way, I have no doubt that the Prime Minister will submit such ai proposal to the - electors at the next general election.",21
148,Mr CHANTER,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,What does the honourable member estimate would be the cost of providing old-age pensions for those who are not receiving them in any State?,21
149,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"It is estimated that the proportion is not more than 5 per cent, of the total population, though I cannot answer positively. I wish now to refer briefly to the question of silver coinage, concerning which much has been said during this debate. I have alreadystated that it is probable that an arrangement will be made with the Imperial Government to undertÂ£ke, for the present, the work for the Commonwealth. The arI rangement proposed is a very good one, and would result in our making a profit of something like Â£ 5 6 , 0 0 0 per annum.  the work ourselves?",21
150,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"I am not sure that we shall not do so, but at present we have not in Australia a Mint that could undertake the work.",21

152,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"But it would But whilst I be necessary, first of all, to instal new machinery.",21
153,Mr HEDGES,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,An offer has been made on behalf of the Perth Mint to provide the necessary machinery without cost to the Commonwealth.,21
154,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"No Mint in Australia could undertake the work without installing new machinery, costing from Â£""6,000 to Â£""io,ooo.",21
155,Mr HEDGES,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"The cost in the case of the Perth Mint would be Â£ 5 , 0 0 0 .",21
156,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"The Perth are about Mint has made an offer, but I think that if the work is to be done here it should be undertaken by the Commonwealth. It should not be undertaken by any State.",21
157,Mr HEDGES,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,Wh v not take over a Mint ?,21
158,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"I learned toThe day-and I have wired for information on the subject-that the Imperial Government contemplate erecting a new Mint in Sydney. I have wired to ascertain the position. I think that if that course is going to be taken the Mint should be built with a view to providing every facility for the coining of silver, and should belong to the Commonwealth. I am holding my hand until I am in a position to see whether it will be wise to take over all the Mints, including the Mint to be built in Sydney as a Mint for the coinage of our own silver.",21
159,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"All the Mints? Sir WILLIAM LYNE.:-Yes . If we can make an arrangement with the Imperial Government that all the minting shall be done under the Commonwealth, and not by themselves, we can take over all the Mints, and the new one could be built in such a way as to afford every facility for the coinage of silver.",21
160,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,I suppose that the honourable gentleman knows that the Commonwealth would lose money on the gold coinage?,22
161,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"Yes . I do not know what the percentage of loss is, but it is not very much. The report which I hold in my hand, and which was ordered to be printed on the 15th December, 1904, is altogether against the minting of silver here. It is only because it seems to me that it will be a good thing to do if we possibly can do it, that I am holding my hand for a few days, until I find out what can be done.",22
162,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,What I meant was that the Commonwealth will not derive the profit which the honourable gentleman pointed out if it does the gold coinage too.,22
163,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"That is quite true, and I have asked for information in order to judge whether the loss would be great. I have also been written to with regard to decimal coinage, and as to why the Commonwealth cannot follow the example of Canada. There are two reasons why it cannot be done here. It is essential to Canada to have the same sort of coinage as obtains in the United States, but in Australia that is not necessary. It seems to me that we had better pause until we can make some arrangement, or until the Imperial Government desire to do the same thing. The coinage which we use is Imperial coinage, and we do not know what trouble might be created if we were to proceed without knowing exactly what the result was likely to be, unless the Imperial Government did likewise, or led the way for us.",22
164,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,We have discussed that question here.,22
165,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,I know that it has been discussed many times. I am stating what appeals to me as a good reason for not rushing into the matter at once.,22
166,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"The British Government has prepared the way for us by adopting the florin. ' Sir WILLIAM LYNE - Yes . It one thing for an irresponsible person to venue ? talk; but it is another thing for a responsible person to accept a grave sibility. I do not know what may be done if I remain in the Treasury until next year. But at the present time. I think that it might be premature to take up the question in the sense in which some honurable members desire. In his speech, the honourable member for North Sydney discussed what would happen if the balance of the Customs and Excise revenue were distributed per capita. He quoted one table which it was rather troublesome to follow, but honourable members will find that the figures are set out on page 89 of the Budget Papers. Take, for instance, the actual distribution in 1907-8. New South Wales received Â£3,566,371, but if the balance had been distributed per capita, she would have received only .Â£3,311,903, making a difference of Â£254,468.",22
167,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"I said that it would make a difference of Â£300,000.",22
168,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"The honourable member said that he was prepared to advocate this policy on any platform in New' South Wales. I have no doubt that he would be courageous enough to take that step, but I do not think that at the present moment the Government of that State would agree to the proposal. I am not considering now whether it would be right or not. But I may tell the honoraSle member that when I raised this very question at the Convention in South' Australia. I was met with the objection that some States were on a different basis from others, and that some would lose while others would gain. I said then that if it resulted in a little difference, and it was desired to have a propeiFederation, that difference ought not to be thought of.",22
169,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,Some difference will always exist.,22
170,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,I believe that by-and-by it will get so small that there will not be very much trouble.,22
171,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,But it will always exist.,22
172,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"Las t year Victoria received from, the Commonwealth Â£2,449,243; but if the balance had been distributed per capita she would have received Â£2,634,623, or an addition of Â£>85,38o.",22

174,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,It would have responbeen the distribution per capita.,22
175,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,But that the expenditure shall also be charged j>er capita.,23
176,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"Yes ; but. that is quite a different proposal. - Queensland received from the Commonwealth Â£1,003,527, but if the balance had been distributed per capita, she would have received Â£1,143,623, or an addition of ^Â£140,096. South Australia received Â£792,686; but if the balance had been distributed per capita, she would have received Â£828,886, or an addition of Â£36,200. Western Australia received Â£""753,510, but if the balance had been distributed per capita she would have received Â£552,139, or suffered a loss of Â£201,371. It is very evident that if that method of distribution were adopted, some arrangement would have to be made as regards Western Australia, because, in my opinion, it would not be possible for her to carry out her obligations if she had to suffer a loss of Â£ 2 0 . 1 , 0 0 0 o d d .",23
177,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,I proposed that.,23
178,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"I admit that the honourable member did. Tasmania recreases ceived Â£294,259, but if the balance had public servants. been distributed per capita she would have received Â£388,422, or an increase of Â£94,163. I do not propose to read the next table on that page of the Budget grades. papers, because it is an estimate of the distribution during the current year. But the same thing will apply. It is very difficult to get the States to agree to a per capita method, of distribution. I am sure that Tasmania suffers a loss, though exact amount cannot be ascertained by the accountants. For that State imported goods are bought in Victoria and New South Wales, though chiefly in Victoria; but Tasmania is not credited with the imyear portations. On one occasion Tasmania estimated the loss to her revenue at Â£40,000 a year. But so far as estimate her loss is about Â£20,000 a year. I approached the Premiers of New South Wales ancl Victoria to see whether they would agree to that money being credited to Tasmania, but they would not listen my proposal. When they will not listen to a sum of Â£20,000 a year being credited to a smaller State, which requires revenue been considered very largely. perhaps more than do the larger States, it likely that they would agree, unless they were compelled, to the balance of our venue being distributed per capita and one or two of the States thereby losing money ? I propose Mr DUGALD THOMSON - The Treasurer knows that they will not listen to his proposals",23
179,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,It does not say Last year much for their so-called statesmanship if they are prepared to allow personal animosities to interfere unjustly and unduly with the making of an arrangement fair to the States.,23
180,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,That is part of the whole arrangement.,23
181,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"But I do not think that is the reason underlying their action. As far as Victoria is concerned, I know that its Premier entertains no animosity to the Commonwealth. I approachecl Sir Thomas Bent upon this matter, and he was more favourable to our proposal than was Mr Wade. But when they met in Conference, they would not agree"" to it. I have referred to this matter because I wished to explain to the honourable member for North Sydney, and to others who entertain similar ideas, that it-is a very difficult question to deal with. I now desire to say a word or two in answer to the criticism which has been levelled against the in which it is proposed to grant to It has been said that it is intended to grant increases to the higher-paid officers of the Service, whilst ignoring the claims of those in the lower",23
182,Mr MATHEWS,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,The Treasurer will hear more about that later on.,23
183,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"The honourable member forgets that upon this year's Estithe mates the sum of Â£26,963 is provided for increases to officers in the lower grades of the Service, besides a large sum of about Â£20,000 for what are known as statutory, increases. Surely that is a fair sum. Last these officers were granted increases to the extent of about Â£40,000. The Commonwealth Public Service is a better paid I can service than any other that I know of. Increases in respect of long service increments in the fifth class, amounting to about Â£11,000, are included in the before-mentioned amounts for this year. Though into dividual cases of hardship may exist, I maintain that the lower-paid officers of the service have not been forgotten, but have The anis nual rates of increments provided in the professional, clerical, and general divisions refor the calendar years 1906 and 1907 are to Â£37,711 and Â£34/,o62 respectively. In addition, an amount of ,Â£14,442 was granted as minimum wage for 1906, and Â£11,692 for 1907. Passing away from this matter, I desire to say that I have taken the trouble to procure a copy of a legal opinion which was given to the Premier of Tasmania some time ago concerning the validity of the Surplus Revenue Act, which was questioned by the States. I intend to lay that opinion upon the table of the House, and I wish to have it embodied in Hansard, because it shows the extremes to which some Governments will go in order to fight the Commonwealth. This opinion was prepared, I believe, at the instance of the Premier of Tasmania by the Crown Law officers on the 25th April last. shall not trouble honourable members by reading it, but I should like to have it embodied in Hansard, because it declares that the action taken by the Treasurer of the Commonwealth was absolutely constitutional, and because it advises the Government of Tasmania that it would not be wise to proceed to litigation in respect of the validity of the Surplus Revenue Act. It readsSection S9 of the Constitution only continued in force until the imposition of the uniform duties of Customs, but while it wns in force it was incumbent upon the Commonwealth to pay to each State, month by month, the balance of revenue in favour of the State. Section 93 is also of a temporary character. Under its provisions the Commonwealth was bound, during the first five years after the imposition of uniform duties of Customs, and thereafter until Parliament made other provision, to credit revenue, debit expenditure, and pay balances to the several States, in the same way as in the period previously referred to. Under section 94 the Parliament may provide, on such basis as it deems fair, for the monthly payments to the several States of all surplus revenue of the Commonwealth. This section did not come into operation until the period of five years from the imposition of uniform duties of Customs had elapsed; but this period has now lapsed, and section 94 has, therefore, become operative. The Surplus Revenue Bill is a proposed exercise of the power conferred upon Parliament by section 94. Shortly, the elfect of it is to do away with the necessity that now exists under section 93 of paying over month by month to the States the balances of revenue which have not been actually expended by the Commonwealth, and to enable the Commonwealth to withdraw from the consolidated revenue, and pay to trust account, moneys which have been appropriated by the Parliament to any special purpose. I think it is within the competency of Parliament to pass this Bill, and, in my opinion, the Bill' is not in conflict with any provision in the Constitution. The general power to appropriate moneys out of the consolidated revenue fund is contained in section 81, and it seems to me plain that moneys appropriated by law are no longer surplus revenue of the Commonwealth. Section S7, while it remains in Sir William Lyne. force, protects the States to this extent, thats the Commonwealth cannot appropriate more than one-fourth of its net revenue from Customs and Excise annually towards its expenditure. That opinion was given months before theaction in the High Court was commenced, by the States. Yet, in spite of that opinion, which was only laid before theTasmanian Parliament on Tuesday last, the Treasurer of that State entered intothe fight which was initiated by the Treasurer of New South Wales against the Commonwealth. That circumstance points to a. I vicious determination to create trouble and. to fight the Commonwealth at all hazards. The same sort of conduct has. recently been manifested in connection with the report of the Auditor-General of New South Wales. If the statements made by the press are trustworthy, that officer hasexperienced a rather bad time. I maintainthat it is about time that litigation instituted by the States against the Commonwealth was prompted by common sense and) not by viciousness. My desire is that this Parliament should act within the limits of the Constitution-that it should not knowingly exceed its functions. But nothing should prevent the Commonwealth frompursuing the even tenor of its way, and. faithfully discharging its duty by"" safeguarding its own interests, whilst at the same time conserving the interests of the States, as far as it possibly can. But it must be remembered that whilst Commonwealth finances are drooping we cannot give up everything to the States. I trust that we shall have no more legal actionsinstituted against the Commonwealth, seeing that the last two or three have ended* so disastrously to the States. It is not wise for the States to be constantly fighting the Commonwealth, especially when \verecollect that-irrespectiv e of whether th'eexpenditure incurred in litigation be takenfrom the pockets of State or Federal electors-it has to be contributed by die sametaxpayer. We should endeavour to work in harmony with the States as much as possible, and it will be the consistent objectof this Government to do so.",23
184,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"North Sydney) [4.15] - Some statements have been made by the Treasurer which, I think, call for a reply. They are so different from what I conceive to be the facts of thecase that I have determined to answer them briefly. For instance, the Treasurer stated' that the leader of the Opposition, when he accused him of not having any surplus to draw upon in case of financial necessity, seemed to be ignorant of the fact that under the Constitution the Treasurer can have no surplus. I need scarcely say that the right honourable member for East Sydney is perfectly aware of the provisions of the Constitution and that his speech does not indicate that ignorance which the Treasurer sought to make it imply. The leader of the Opposition saidThe Treasurer, with the assistance of his officers, says, "" We shall have Â£6,514,000 to spend this vear,"" and he proposes, on these Estimates, to spend every penny of it. There is no provision, even on paper, for a surplus of one penny to meet the vicissitudes of finance which are not unfamiliar to Australian Parliaments. That is a perfectly accurate criticism, and it is not usual for Treasurers-whe n they expect to have a certain amount of revenue - to provide for the spending of every pennv of it. The Treasurer, however, has provided for the spending of every penny and he has no surplus revenue out of which to meet any unexpected expenditure. He intends to return to the States only their actual three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue. He has no reserve fund to meet emergencies, and yet he proposes to spend every penny of his revenue. The leader of the Opposition was perfectly justified in pointing out that fact, and the Treasurer was absolutely wrong in declaring that the statement of the right honourable member for East Sydney exhibited ignorance of the fact that the Commonwealth could not retain a surplus. The Treasurer also affirmed that although he had looked through Hansard he was absolutely unable to understand what I was driving at. I will not enter into a discussion of whether that result was owing to a lack of clearness on my part or to a lack of clearness on the part of the Treasurer's understanding. I merely wish to point out that his declaration that the States by adopting his proposal to take over the whole of their existing debts would effect an annual saving of Â£4,000,000. in addition to the interest, shows that he does not at all appreciate the position. The Treasurer arrives at that sum of Â£4,000,000 by assuming that if the States paid 3 per cent, to a sinking fund so as to wipe off their debt in thirty years they would be better off to the extent of Â£4,000,000 by handing their debt over to the Commonwealth.and not having to provide that sinking fund. But does he assume that the Commonwealth pays 3 per cent, to a sinking fund ? No, the Commonwealth, according to him, is to pay nothing, specific. He might as well say that if the States established a sinking fund that would wipe out the debt in ten years they would save Â£20,000,000 or Â£25,000,000per annum by handing the debt over to the Commonwealth. The thing is absurd. Neither the Treasurer nor the States ever proposed to have a 3 per cent, sinking fund"" or to wipe out the debt in thirty years.",24
185,Mr TILLEY BROWN,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,It would be utterly impossible.,25
186,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"Of course,, and nobody proposes to do it. When the Commonwealth takes over the debt from the States the taxpayer does not escape it. It will still be on his shoulders. It will' be simply .transferred to the Commonwealth. Yet the Treasurer says that when the Commonwealth takes the debt over he will by his scheme save the States Â£4,000,000 a year-the sum. which would have obliterated the debt in thirty years.",25
187,Mr MATHEWS,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,I take it that the Treasurer addressed that argument only to those who try to differentiate between'State and Federal people.,25
188,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,Is it not absurd for the Treasurer to say that he saves the States what they never proposed to expend?,25
189,Mr MATHEWS,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"It is, looking at it in that wav.",25
190,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"If it is right for the Treasurer 'to calculate in that way, he might as well sav that he could save the States the annual payment that it would cost them to pay off the debt in ten years. The States have never proposed, nor could they accomplish, such arc obliteration of the debt. We have never proposed, nor can we accomplish it ; yet the Minister takes it into calculation and says that it is a saving to the States. In that instance, at any rate, however complex or not understandable my remarks may have been, I think the Treasurer has shownthat he does not understand the comparison which he himself made. He has not said a w^ord- I do not know whether it was an accidental or an intentional omission on his part-abou t the unequal relief of State debts. I spoke to him privately about the matter some weeks ago, and intimated that I intended to bring it up in the House, as I did not wish to take him by surprise. If he pools the debt as he proposes in his scheme, and distributes it over the population of the Commonwealth at Â£58 per head, he will relieve some States of the payment of Â£78 or Â£79 a head, and relieve Victoria of only Â£""43 a head. One of the peculiarities of that transaction is that some of the States have borrowed for municipal and water and sewerage purposes through their Governments, whereas the borrowings of Victoria, for instance, for those objects have been conducted through certain Boards or municipalities. The extraordinary result, under the Treasurer's scheme, is that Victoria will be relieved to the extent of only Â£43 per head, whilst still retaining her liability of Â£12 or Â£13 per head for debts incurred by municipalities, water trusts, harbour trusts, and age Boards, while other States will be relieved of Â£78 or Â£79 per head, including borrowings similar to those which Victoria has conducted through those local governing bodies. There is no particular need for me to protect the finances of Victoria. tainly New South Wales will lose a little, although not very much, because her debt is Â£55 per head, and the average, if all the State debts were pooled, would be ,Â£58 per head. Still, I always try to look at these things from the stand-point ot what is fair under a proper system of accounts. I do not consider such a proposal either fair or proper, and I cannot conceive that it will be accepted. giving the Treasurer that intimation some weeks ago, I raised the question when I spoke. If there was any. proposal on the part of the Government to meet the difficulty, I wanted to hear it, but the Treasurer has not alluded to it, and is silent either accidentally or intentionally. It is an important and serious matter, which the House will have to consider, and the Treasurer, in his reply, should have dealt with it. He referred to the inequality that would be caused by adopting the per capita system, but that would be very slight in comparison with the revenues dealt with. Yet the Treasurer says he fears that the States will not accept it, while, at the same time, he proposes a gigantic inequality to the extent of Â£35 or Â£36 per head of population. He jumps at that with the greatest readiness, and expects the States to accept it, but the comparatively trifling inequality of Â£200,000 or Â£300,000 per year on revenues of Â£3,000,000, is to his mind too alarming to touch, although one of the definite purposes of Federation was that the bookkeeping system, which was adopted only Mr Dugald Thomson. for an emergency, should not be continued, and that we should get into the per capita allotment, not merely of revenue, but also of expenditure, as soon as possible. I do not understand how any Minister can propose to face the financial situation so unequally as he does by the pooling of the debts, and yet fear to face that other comparatively minor inequality-fear , in fact, to reach the destiny which it was intended we should reach by Federation-fea r to adopt one of the leading principles of Federation, which was to get away from separate accounts, and the separate bearing of burdens, to unite our accounts, except as to debts, and to bear together sewer- certain national burdens better than we could do singly. That was one object of Federation, yet the Government's financial proposals disclose no real intention of dealing with that important aspect of the Federal finances. Cer- Any Treasurer is worthy of censure who would fear objection by some States which happen to gain a little by the present system. I am not speaking of Western Australia. We must treat her. specially, because she returns so much larger an amount of revenue per head than does any other State. We must give that State an allowance, which will decrease on a sliding scale until it ultimately disappears. But the difference After in the case of the other States is comparatively slight. This year one or two of them may benefit, but ten years hence others may be benefiting. The present abominable system of bookkeeping is worse than the old system of Customs entry, and, while we continue it, we disregard the intentions of the people who voted for the Union, and can come to no complete financial arrangement with the States. In regard to decimal coinage, the old answer is repeated: That we must wait until Great Britain adopts it. There might be reason for that answer were it proposed to alter our system of measures. Difficulties would be created if Australia adopted the metric system of measurements; but Great Britain is beginning to find that, if she is to hold her own in the markets of the world, she must be prepared to adopt the system of measures used by France and other countries, and some of her engineering manufacturers are now prepared to supply orders in accordance with either the metric or the British standard. There will be no difficulty, however, in adopting a decimal system of weights here. As to the inconvenience which the adoption of a decimal system of coinage would create, it will not decrease by delay, nor will it be made greater if Great Britain does not alter her standard. Although Committees and Commissions in the Old Country 'have reported almost unanimously in favour of a decimal system of coinage for Great Britain, and the florin was adopted as a step towards the decimalization of the British coinage, the reform has been delayed, partly because of the conservatism of thought there, partly from fear of prejudice, many of her people not being as well educated as ours, ancl partly because of the greatness of her trade. We have no such reason for hesitating. Those who were not members of the first Parliament may not be aware that a Select Committee of this House went very carefully into this matter, and approved of the decimal system of coinage. It was estimated by some that the adoption of such a system would save at least two years in the education of children, and I think that it is within the mark to say that it would save one year. Furthermore, it would make calculation very much easier, and simplify the keeping of accounts. The coinage proposed would have followed as closely as possible the present British currency, and, on a former occasion, I offered, while on my feet, to calculate without the aid of pencil and paper, the transposition to the proposed decimal coinage of any sum that might be named in the present currency. proposed currency, the sovereign, the halfsovereign, the florin, the shilling, and the sixpence would be retained.",25
191,Mr HEDGES,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,And the half-crown?,27
192,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"The halfcrown could be used as a matter of convenience, but would not be part of the system. The florin would be the unit, ten florins making J Â£ I , and five a half-sovereign, while the shilling would be the half florin, and the sixpence the quarter-florin. If threepenny pieces and pennies were retained, there would be an alteration in value, the number of pennies in Â£ 1 being increased from 240 to 250, which would give an advantage of 4 per cent, to those who buy penny articles. Those who sell such articles-the newspaper proprietors for example-coul d make up the loss by reducing the quantity sold for the price, or in some other way. Are we for ever to follow what we know to be the worse of two systems? It is our duty not to stand still in this matter. Ministers will go out of their way to push forward proposals in regard to which our constitutional right of legislation is doubtful, but pay not the least attention to the substantial advantages which may be gained in directions like these by the exercise of powers which undoubtedly have been conferred upon us. As it is now proposed to make arrangements for the coinage of silver by or on behalf of the Commonwealth, we have a favourable opportunity to change the system of coinage.",27
193,Mr BOWDEN,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,Would the honourable member propose changing the system of coinage without proposing the adoption of the metric system of measurement?,27
194,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"I think that we should coin our own silver, or have it coined for us by Great Britain. The Prime Minister is aware that, when that is done, a distinguishing mark must be placed on Commonwealth coins to enable our liability for the replacement of wear and tear to be ascertained. There is, therefore, an opportunity to adopt the decimal system, which has been recommended by Committees and Commissions in Great Britain, supported by some of the ablest men in the Empire. The Mother Country has hesitated to adopt the decimal system only because of the difficulty there would be in moving an older and larger population than this, the ramifications of her commerce, and the immense volume of In the her transactions. As we grow older the difficulties will increase.",27
195,Mr DEAKIN,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,They would be great now if we adopted a coinage different from that of the Mother Country.,27
196,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"There would be no difficulty. Transactions between the two countries are conducted on paper, and at 'the present time similar calculations have to be made in all dealings between the United States, Canada,, or the Continent of Europe.",27
197,Mr DEAKIN,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,Busines s men insist that there will be difficulties.,27
198,Mr BOWDEN,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,Not if the sovereign is retained.,27
199,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"In any case, the transposition could be done very rapidly, and would take but little time, even where the value of a whole shipment was concerned. It would not have to be made in regard to the coins which pass from hand to hand. Besides, nearly all the existing coins would be retained. The Sydney Chamber of Commerce has reported in favour of the proposed system.",27
200,Mr DEAKIN,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"So also has the Melour bourne Chamber of Commerce.

202,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"I do not .see how the Treasurer could be against the proposal. Now that we are about to deal with our coinage, I think there is every - reason for adopting the decimal system. Canada has adopted it. I know that there are special reasons in that case, due to the ,proximity of Canada to the United States. But still the Dominion is a dependency of the Empire, just as is the Commonwealth, and there is not the slightest difficulty in carrying on business between Canada and Great Britain. There are two reforms which we ought to adopt independently of - action on the part of Great Britain. One is the decimalization of the coinage, and ;the other the decimalization of weights.",28

The relation of the threepenny piece would be altered; but the penny would only be affected to the extent of 4 per cent.

I should be reflecting on the constitutional knowledge of the Government were I to say that they never had any anticipation of their being proved to be wrong; but, right or wrong, they have on several occasions proceeded with measures. My contention is that the States had reason to resist the legislation of the Commonwealth, and, in a majority of cases, the States have been successful in the Court.",29

224,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"I do not say that it absolutely is so, because that would necessitate looking up the matter. However, I agree with the Treasurer that there ought to be consideration on both sides, because it is absurd to have the Commonwealth and the States rushing at each other's throats on the slightest provocation. On the financial question, where agreement does not seem very near, the Treasurer ought to go further than he proposes-this would not injure the States, but assist them rather-and adopt the per ca-bita system in regard to both expenditure and revenue. He ought not to continue the bookkeeping system when we are supposed to be making a financial settlement, and such a suggestion as I have made bewould be in the interests, not only of the Commonwealth and State Legislatures, but of the people generally.",29

The honourable member for Mernda stated the other day that Western Australia, in her share of the three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue, was receiving more than enough to pay the interest on the State debt. That may be so, but we should remember that Western Australia is probably carrying out more public works, in the shape of railways, and so forth, than any other State of the Union. At the same time, this Parliament, in its wisdom, has heavily taxed steel rails, so that what we are supposed to be receiving from the revenue is really and truly only part of what the State has borrowed. There can be no doubt that, considering the hundreds of miles of railway now being laid down, Western Australia is contributing a large amount in duty on the rails; and, while the Commonwealth declares that it is wrong to borrow, it does not mind taking the money which has been borrowed by Western Australia.",29
226,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,No .,29
227,Mr HEDGES,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"What I am saying is absolutely true-the Commonwealth takes from the States money which they have borrowed, and returns it to them the shape of revenue; and a case in point is afforded in steel rails, on which there is a duty of io to 15 per cent. That may be goodfinancefrom the point of view of the Commonwealth, but is certainlv not goodfinancefrom the point of view of Western Australia. Such States as Queensland and Western Australia, in order to open up their large areas, must borrow money; and it is all very well for the Commonwealth",29

229,Mr HEDGES,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,I shall in due time show the treatment of Western Australia.

The averages in the Commonwealth Year Book are not calculated in the correct way.

If we look at page 643 of the Commonwealth Year-Book, we Ranges, I suppose. see that the revenue received from Western Australia under this head is Â£4. 12s. per head, whereas the average of the ComQueensland monwealth is given by Mr Knibbs at .Â£3 2s. per head. That latter average is correct, unless Western Australia is cluded. It would be right for Mr Knibbs to strike that average if he had not added a foot-note to the effect that Western tralia was paying nearly 50 per cent, more than the average for the Commonwealth. As a matter of fact, Western Australia is paying Â£ 1 12s. 8Jd. per head more than the other States; and this is a good deal higher than 50 per cent. There is no doubt that when the people of Western Australia voted for Federation, they did so on the ground that taxation throughout the Commonwealth would be equalized. The people of the western State expected to gain; but, instead, they find themselves to be the highest, taxed people in Australia.

241,Mr HEDGES,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,".That is so, but if one has a knowledge of the decimal system he can readily understand the metric system, and those who have been accustomed to the decimal and metric systems find it difficult to follow the British system. I believe we should do one of the best things ever done for Australia if we established the decimal system, and 1 should be prepared to support its establishment, no matter what the expense might be. In dealing with the same question the Treasurer mentioned that a new Mint was likely to be established at Sydney. If so, I think something must be wrong with the New South Wales Government. If we are to establish a new Mint for our coinage in Australia, it should be established as near as possible to the Federal Capital. This phase of the subject was suggested to me by the honourable member for Perth. In Western Australia we have the most up-todate Mint in the Commonwealth, and one of the best in .the world. The Premier of that State offered to put in the necessary machinery for the coinage of all the silver required for Australia. This, it is estimated, would cost about Â£5,000, and he offered to equip the Western Australian Mint with that machinery without any cost to the Commonwealth. As its Mint is not fully employed, it would have suited the State Government to do that. Let me say that the work done at the Perth Mint has been so good that, I understand, some inquiries were made from England, with a view to find out how it could I believe it is due to the fact thai it is equipped with the most modern machinery. When the Perth Mint can turn out such work, I should like to know why we should continue to have our silver coined in England. During the discussion of the Tariff, thi support of local industries and the employment of our own labour were strongly advocated, and surely it is not too much to ask that we should make use of mints already established in the Commonwealth that are not at present fully employed in preference to having our coinage done in England? I think that some Federal action should be taken to permit people engaged in different professions and trades to carry them on in any State. I do not know whether we have' the power to take such action, and I should like the advice of the Attorney-General on the subject.",31
242,Mr GROOM,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"It is a State power at present. The honourable member refers to the question of reciprocity in the case of doctors, mining engineers, and so on.",31
243,Mr HEDGES,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"I shall mention one case to indicate the difficulty to which I refer. I was informed this year that some locomotives were being sent from Western Australia to Queensland, and a correspondent wrote to me to ask whether men who had been employed in driving those locomotives in Western Australia could get employment in the same work on the Chiilagoe line in the Etheridge district in North Queensland, to which the locomotives were being sent. I found that a man might hold a Government certificate, and be the driver of a locomotive in Western Australia, and yet would not be allowed to drive that locomotive in Queensland. I think that is a disgraceful state of affairs.",31
244,Mr MAUGER,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,Unti l he passed the Queensland standard?,31
245,Mr HEDGES,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"I was informed that he would be expected to start cleaning and firing, and go through the whole business again in Queensland, although he might have been driving a locomotive in Western Australia for ten or twenty years.",31
246,Mr GROOM,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,The honourable member contends that there should be Inter-State reciprocity in such cases ?,31
247,Mr HEDGES,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"I believe that if a man has once learned to drive an engine, he should be able to drive it over the border between two States. There might be some - difficulty if the work on which the men were to be employed was Government work, but in the case to which I have referred, the locomotives were to be used in the construction of a private railway line, and I claim that qualified men holding Government certifi-cates as engine-drivers in Western Australia should have been entitled to drive engines in Queensland. The matter is one which requires some consideration. I propose now to submit some figures to show which of the States has gained by Federation, and to what extent. I find that in 1901 New South Wales had a deficit of -Â£12,749. That was the position when the State entered the Federation. Let us see what the position has become since then. In 1903, the deficjt hacl increased by Â£ 1 7 1 , 1 6 6 , to a total of Â£ 1 8 3 , 9 1 5 . In 1905, New South Wales hacl a surplus of Â£ 1 4 1 , 8 4 3 . T905-6 her revenue was Â£12,283,082, and her expenditure Â£11,386,864, a surplus of revenue over expenditure for that year of Â£ 8 9 6 , 2 1 8 , so that her position had improved from a deficit in 1901 of Â£ 1 2 , 7 4 9 , to a surplus in 1905-6 of nearly Â£T,000,000.",31
248,Mr BOWDEN,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,That shows that New 'South Wales has been too heavily taxed under Federation.,32
249,Mr HEDGES,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"In 1906-7, the revenue - of New South Wales was Â£13,392,435, and the expenditure Â£11,881,746, showing n. surplus of Â£1,510,689. This shows an improvement in the position of the State from a deficit in 1901 to a surplus of over Â£""1,500,000 in 1906-7.' In 1901-2, the revenue of New South Wales Â£11,007,356, and in 1906-7 the revenue bad increased to Â£ 1 3 , 3 9 2 , 4 3 5 .",32
250,Mr BOWDEN,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,That shows that the State was too heavily taxed if it shows anything at all.,32
251,Mr HEDGES,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"Thes e figures indicate an increase of revenue since the establishment of Federation between 1901 and 1907 of no less than Â£ 2 , 3 8 5 , 0 7 9 . Dealing with the expenditure in the same way, I find that in 1906-7 the expenditure of New South Wales was Â£11,881,746 , whilst the expenditure in 1901-2 was ,Â£11,020,105. So that honourable members will see that the expenditure increased only to the extent of Â£ 8 6 1 , 6 4 1 , whilst the revenue increased to th. - extent of Â£2,385,079.",32
252,Mr BOWDEN,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,Has the honourable member allowed for borrowed money in his estimates of expenditure?,32
253,Mr HEDGES,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"I am giving the position as published to the world by the State Government. I say that the figures disclose a wonderful gain for anv one State, and show that New South Wales has done well out of Federation.",32
254,Mr BOWDEN,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"In being taxed to the extent of Â£ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 more than is necessary?",32
255,Mr HEDGES,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"I now take the figures for Victoria, and possibly the honourable member for Nepean will remain quiet while I give those figures. In 1901-2 Victoria had a deficit of Â£ 4 0 1 , 0 4 0 , and in 1905-6 a surplus of Â£ 5 2 6 , 9 8 4 , so that her total gain in the five years was Â£ 9 2 8 , 0 2 4 .

In 1906-7 her revenue was In Â£8,345,535, and her expenditure Â£ 7 , 6 7 9 , 1 4 3, or Â£ 6 6 6 , 3 9 2 less. But while her revenue had increased from Â£ 8 , 3 4 5 . 5 3 4 over that of 1901-2, which was Â£ 6 , 9 9 7 , 7 9 2 , - an increase of Â£1,347,742, her expenditure in 1906-7 was Â£ 7 , 6 7 9 , 1 4 3 , while in 1901-2 it was only Â£7,398,832, or Â£ 2 8 1 , 3 1 1 less. Her revenue, therefore, increased much more than her expenditure. Queensland in 1901-2 had a deficit of Â£ 4 3 1 , 9 4 Â° , while in 1905-6 she had a surplus of Â£ 1 3 , 9 9 5 , a total gain of Â£445,935I "" i 9 Â° 5 - fi n e r revenue was Â£ 3 , 8 5 3 , 5 2 3 , and her expenditure Â£ 3 , 7 5 , 7 i 2 , or Â£ 1 2 7 , 8 1 1 less.

These figures are very creditable to those concerned in the administration of the affairs of that State. Tasmania in 1901-2 had a deficit of Â£ 4 4 , 3 Â° 7 , and in 1903-4 a deficit of Â£ 1 1 6 , 0 2 1 , but in 1905-6 she had a surplus of Â£ 1 2 , 4 9 6 , making a total gain of Â£ 1 2 8 , 5 1 7 .

The people entered the Union because they thought that taxation would be made, more even, ancl that persons would be treated alike Instead of that, however, we find that the taxation is creeplibeing up in a monstrous manner, and that in some States it is double what it is in of others. Why? Because the gains have not been evenly distributed. In 1906-7 South Wales had a surplus of Victoria a surplus of Queensland a surplus of expenditure was Â£ 3 9 6 , 1 1 5 , South Australia a deficit of Â£ 3 , 5 5 , 9 3 9 , Â£ 1 4 3 , 7 9 4 , 8 Tasmania a surplus of In 1906-7 Â£ 5 7 , 0 8 6 , and Western Australia a deficit Â£ 3 , 4 9 0 , 1 8 2 . of Â£ 8 8 , 8 2 8 , showing clearly that the showing question of adjusting the State finances or a will require very careful consideration.

In looking over the Estimates I find that very , while little provision is made for Westerm AusThere are several matters which more I brought before the Minister here; but f durpractically nothing has been done.",33
260,Mr MATHEWS,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,Wester n Australia gets her share of the vote for public works.,34
261,Mr HEDGES,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"It gets practically nothing. Just outside Perth there is a place which, no doubt, the honourable member has never heard of, as it is not so large as Port Melbourne, and which is called Victoria Park.",34
262,Mr MATHEWS,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,I have heard of that rising suburb.,34
263,Mr HEDGES,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"In 1901, the State Government handed over to the Commonwealth in that very progressive place a block of land for building a Post Office, but so far nothing has been done. Not only the postal business, but also the electoral business, is now being carried on in a little wooden room measuring 10 feet by 10 feet. Since Federation Victoria Park has gone so much ahead that now it is traversed by an electric tramway, and not only the town but the surrounding district which is served by the tramway is lighted by electricity. At the instance of the Mayor and Councillors and a committee which was formed there, I took the trouble to bring the matter before the Postmaster-General, and submitted to him photographs showing the main streets in the municipality, but nothing has been done, nor has anything been promised. When the Commonwealth is collecting 5s. per capita more in Western Australia than in the other States, surely it should give to the people of Victoria Park reasonable postal facilities ! At Cottesloe we find that just the same thing is taking place. The first complaints I heard there emanated from the Government employees, who are working in a little place which probablv would be condemned by any sanitary inspector. The Department promised that the matter would be attended to. I suppose that the population of the place has increased tenfold since the Post Office was erected.",34
264,Mr MATHEWS,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,The honourable member is treated no worse than I am. I cannot get a Post Office.,34
265,Mr HEDGES,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"It is all very well for honourable members in the other corner to say that the Commonwealth must not borrow. Adjoining Cottlesloe we have a place called Buckland Hill. I do not know whether the Department has lost the run of the place, but when I represented its requirements a little while ago the authorities said that something would be done, and I believe that it is going to be done. I found that the only facility given there was a public telephone in the shop of a chemist, who said that while it was in use his customers would not buy the articles which they required, lest their orders should be overheard. He wjshed that the telephone was removed, as it took away custom instead of bringing it. Buckland Hill has about 20 miles of made road, a revenue of Â£3,000 a year from rates, and a population of 3,000 persons. It was left without even a contract Post Office until a little while ago, when, the Department promised me that one would be established. I only want to bring out these matters to show that the Department is not going ahead with the times. If it is necessary, money must be obtained to provide for these services. This policy of trying to do without! money and without development is ridiculous. We must anticipate the amounts required by the telephone, telegraph and postal services.",34
266,Mr JH CATTS,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,Where shall we get the money ?,34
267,Mr HEDGES,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"If the country was populated by such persons as the honourable member we would not know where to get the money, but I believe that I could raise, in some way, enough money to provide such services as I have indicated. Although it has been laid down that the Commonweath must not borrow, still there should be no harm in anticipating our requirements. It might be much cheaper to spend Â£1,000,000 straight off, and anticipate our revenue for a year or two than to continue muddling on, doing a bit of repairing here, and a bit there, and really throwing away the money. It is virtually the same as a farmer starting to mend old fences instead of erecting new ones. If he mended the old ones he would not have any fence at the end of five years. But if he obtained money and erected new fences at once he would be) better off at the end of the time named. The Commonwealth must have money in order to go ahead. That is much the cheaper plan. No doubt we should now have been in a very poor position if the Customs duties had not been raised. I understand now why the Treasurer was anxious to see such high rates imposed. If the increased revenue had not been provided by the Tariff he would have been placed in a very awkward position. ' Even if the old Tariff had been continued there would not have been a very nice position for the Commonwealth to face. On the Estimates a certain sum is set down for naval defence. Our safety, I contend, lies in the fact that Australia is a British possession. morrow we possessed a navy, half as powerf ul as that of Great Britain, we should not be in any safer position than we are today, unless we had the Mother Country behind us. If we possessed a navy large as that of America we should be practically helpless if we were not sheltered under the wing of Great Britain.",34
268,Mr JH CATTS,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"Is America helpless, then?",35
269,Mr HEDGES,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"I have thought the matter out for myself, and I leave the honourable member to do the same. I ask not to forget that Australia is a British possession. It is idle for us to mount fence and cry, "" See how big I am."" must recollect that any little power couFd knock us off a fence. We must either be upon firm ground, or have our backs against something substantial, before can say, "" See how big I am."" When I hear honourable members talk about the Commonwealth building a navy of its own, I feel tired. They are merely inviting humiliation. I have very rarely heard a quiet, unassuming citizen being interfered with, but I have observed that directly man exclaims, "" Oh , I can fight,"" there ii dwavs another man prepared and able to give' him what he is looking for. I favour a continuance of our present naval forget. contribution to Great Britain. I think that that contribution is small enough. addition, I am in favour of doing evervtraining? thing that we can to strengthen our forts, and to assist in our naval defence. long as I am a member of this House, will not be a party to' giving any affront to Great Britain. It is an affront for to say to the Imperial authorities, "" W .are practically going to look after our own defence."" Surely the British Admiralty knows best what is most necessary for the defence of Australia ! I do not think it is right for us to say to the Admiralty authorities, "" We propose to do this, that, and the other."" It would be much better for us if we said to them, to do something to help you. What do you advise?"" As Australians, we have no knowledge of naval requirements. But recollect that we are dealing with a nation which has been accustomed to naval warthe fare from the time when wooden fighting ships were in vogue until the present, when it is turning out Dreadnoughts. Without any loss of dignity we might consult the British Admiralty in respect of our naval defence, and be advised by them. If to- Mr COON - What do they advise?",35
270,Mr HEDGES,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"That is what I wish o know. Personally, I think that we t should have training ships stationed at each p t . Then any of our boys who happened 0r as o become rowdy could be sent aboard, t d taught discipline in addition to somea n thing useful. In after years these lads would be very thankful that the opportunity was afforded them of becoming good citizens. The best men in the British Navy h a v e gravitated from training ships, and in Australia there is certainly a class of him boys running about our towns who would make better citizens if they were cleaned, a disciplined, and taught something useful, We If they are permitted to run wild they will find their way into our gaols. Regarding military defence, I think that the Government propose to start at the wrong we end. I believe that the key to the whole position is the compulsory training of our boys whilst they are at our schools and colleges. If we adopted the principle of compulsory training in their case, in a very of little time we should have an army which would be quite capable of defending Ausa tralia. Whilst they are at school they are at an impressionable age when it is most easy to inculcate lessons of disciplinelessons which once learned they will never",35

Scarcely a day passes that us we do not read of accidents caused by the e negligent handling of pea rifles, guns, &c. If our boys were taught to properly handle a rifle, we should not hear of so many of these unfortunate occurrences. Instructors should be deputed to attend our schools for the purpose of drilling the boys,",35
273,Mr JH CATTS,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,They do that now.,35
274,Mr HEDGES,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"They may do it in "" We should like some places.",35
275,Mr COON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"The honourable member ""would cease training the boys when they we must reached twelve years of age?",35
276,Mr HEDGES,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,I would do nothing of kind. Boys do not leave school at thaiage. It would not be any hardship if we compelled them to undergo a course of drill until they were eighteen years of age.,35
277,Mr COON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,Then the honourable member favours compulsory training up to eighteen years of age?,35
278,Mr HEDGES,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"Yes . Coming to'the new protection, I say that the matter is one which requires a lot of thinking about. As far as I can learn, the system of Wages Boards established in Victoria is the best that can be adopted to insure fair treatment being accorded to employees, because, under it each industrial dispute is dealt with by a body of experts. That system is preferable to the settlement of disputes by an Arbitration Court such as obtains in Western Australia, where it is composed of a representative of the employers, a representative of the employees, and a Supreme Court Judge who acts as referee.",36
279,Mr MATHEWS,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"As a rule, the Tudge represents the employers.",36
280,Mr HEDGES,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"He represents the Crown. The system adopted in Western Australia is unsatisfactory, because it is not possible for any two men representing the employers and employees to be familiar with all the ramifications of every trade and business.",36
281,Mr JH CATTS,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,But they decide upon the evidence submitted to them.,36
282,Mr HEDGES,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"I do not think representatives of employers and employees are competent to decide these questions on evidence. How can they be expected to deal with disputes relating to the clothing industry, the boot industry, the saddlery industry, and the mining industry ? It is impossible them to possess the requisite expert knowledge. The intricacies of some trade disputes are such that it is puzzling even to read the evidence. I consider that the determinations by Wages Boards partake more of the character of mutual agreements between persons who have expert knowledge of the particular industries in which the disputes arise. Most of the troubles which we have experienced in the Commonwealth have been due to decisions arrived at by persons who do not possess that knowledge. The working of our Arbitration Courts has not been satisfactory chiefly because we cannot find any means of compelling the employees to abide by their awards.",36
283,Mr JH CATTS,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,Would that trouble be cured if each dispute were dealt with by a Wages Board ?,36
284,Mr HEDGES,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"I have never heard of a decision by a Wages Board being repudiated. Indeed, such a state of affairs is practically impossible. But if the employees in any industry refused to abide by an award made by the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court, what would happen? We should either have to yield to them or.enforce the award, and the latter course would? be impossible. Mr J. H. CATTS - The honourable member believes in voluntary as opposed to compulsory arbitration ?",36
285,Mr HEDGES,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,I believe in industrial disputes being settled by Wages Boards.,36
286,Mr JH CATTS,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"How would the honourable member enforce the new protection, by means of voluntary agreements? "" Mr HEDGES - It is merely a matter of constituting certain boards to deal with certain industries. The determinations of these bodies would, I think, generally be in favour of the workmen. Of course, it isconceivable that a Judge of the Arbitration Court might suddenly be called upon toleave a temperate climate like that of Victoria to hear a dispute in the interior where similar climatic conditions obtain. But hemight happen to strike a very hot day, and 1 his decision might be influenced by theconsideration that such days were the rule, ancl not the exception in that particular locality. On the other hand, his visit to a. tropical region might be made on a cool day ancl he might be induced to think that men working there experienced no morediscomfort than is experienced elsewhere. With regard to the proposal that the Commonwealth should control tKe scale of for wages by means of a Judge, we could only deal with industries which were protected by Customs duties. That would often put us in a peculiar position. Take, for instance, a firm like Foy and Gibson's, whosell all kinds of things, and also manufacture. Some of their employees would be under the States Wages Boards, and someunder the Federal Arbitration Court; yet those people would be working side by side.",36
287,Mr MAUGER,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"In the case of a protected industry, the Federal authority, and' not the State Board, would be dominant.",36
288,Mr HEDGES,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"Unde r the proposed system, unless there was a Customs duty on the articles that those employees were engaged in manufacturing, the Federalauthority could not touch them.",36
289,Mr MAUGER,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,Does the honourable member know of any manufactured article that has not some protection?,36
290,Mr HEDGES,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"I am certain that there are large numbers of them, if one had timeto look them up. The honourable member cannot expect me to name them on the spur of the moment. I am sure that the complication which I have pointed out would! arise. The Wages Boards, as constituted in Victoria, should be allowed to deal with the whole question of wages and conditions of labour. 1 desire to say a few words on the question of land settlement. If the Federal Government did the very opposite to what they are doing, some good would result for Australia. Federal legislation has the tendency to draw the people to the towns, whereas the State Legislatures are trying to scatter them over the Commonwealth by building railways and opening up the country so that they may go out back and build up new towns. The tendency of Federal legislation is to centralize the people. If we intend to try to make Australia a manufacturing country, the effect must be to bring the people into the cities.",36
291,Mr JH CATTS,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"Does the honourable member object, to protection?",37
292,Mr HEDGES,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"I do not, but I believe that we cannot overproduce such commodities as wool, wheat, copper, gold, and silver, which Australia can produce and sell in the markets of the world; but that we can overproduce for our own requirements. If we lay down a scale of wages such as we know that Australians get-and no other part of the world pays such high wages-w e shall not be able to sell our manufactures in the markets of the world if we produce more than we can consume ourselves. What are we to do then? We shall have a lot of men here whom it will be cruelty to have to ask afterwards to go on the land. If , instead of that policy, we induce people to go on to the land, we shall have men that can defend Australia, used to handling the rifle, the hoe, and the plough-me n of physique that .can face any enemy. If , however, we bring them up to factory work and other town occupations, while they will have all the pluck of the Britisher, they will not have tine strength and the stamina to go out and rough it . The Prime Minister said at Castlemaine a few weeks ago that the policy of the Federal Government was to help the producer, and to induce the people to settle on the land.",37
293,Mr DEAKIN,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,That is a free translation of a summary of a fairlv lengthy speech.,37
294,Mr HEDGES,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,I ani afraid the Prime Minister was not sincere when he made that speech.,37
295,Mr DEAKIN,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,Absolutely .,37
296,Mr HEDGES,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"The 'actions of the Federal Government have been in exactly the opposite direction. They proposed [69] duties on steel rails and wire netting, and did their best to carry them. I fought against them, but the duty on steel rails, at any rate, was carried. If I wished to put an effectual stop to the settlement of the people on the land, and"" the opening up of new country, I should 'prohibit the importation of a single steel rail into Australia, and if the country were infested with rabbits I should prohibit the use of wire netting. Yet that is the tendency of Federal legislation. We have 15,000 miles of rails laid in the Commonwealth, but if we had them in proportion to the length laid in A^ictoria, we should have 100,000 miles throughout Australia. We can do nothing to develop the riches of the continent without railways. We can bring nothing to the coast without them. If a man in the interior found enough gold to live on for the rest of his life, he could not carry it any distance without a railway. Nothing but railways will open up or benefit Australia, and to tax steel rails is a cruel thing to the country. It will hamper the development of the States, and prevent men who have, perhaps, little money, but the right sort of pluck, from succeeding. If we wish to open up Australia, and make it prosperous, we must afford every facility for the building of railways, and for preventing vermin from over-running the land. There is on the business-paper the Manufactures Encouragement Bill , generally known as the Iron Bonus Bill , the consideration of which in this House came to a dead stop on the item for the payment of a bonus on the manufacture of wire netting. After we had prevented the Government from imposing a duty on wire netting, they sought to insert a provision for paying a. bonus equal to Â£ 2 8s. per ton on netting made from imported wire, and twisted in an imported machine. We had evidence that it cost only about 12s. for the man who watched the machine do the work. Yet the Government propose a large bonus in a Bill which they pretend is introduced for the encouragement of Australian industry. I told the Attorney-General that if the Government wished to get that Bill through the House they had better wipe out that proposal. If the Prime Minister was sincere in his statement at Castlemaine that he wished to help the producers, the Government are going a very curious w i y about it , because the taxation of steel rails', and other such articles, will never help them. If by our new protection proposals we increase the cost of the production of anything that we have to sell in the markets of the world, we shall only harass our own producers. That cannot be in the interests of Australia, but must in the end tell against us. It might do all right for town people to win an election on, but it will never do for country members to tell their constituents that they intend to tax steel rails or wire netting. We want 100,000 miles of railways in Australia within the next twenty years.",37
297,Mr MATHEWS,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,And we want the Goshow that. vernment to make the rails.,38
298,Mr HEDGES,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"I should like to see steel rails made here, but until that done we dare not stop the opening up of num. the country.",38
299,Mr MATHEWS,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,The Government could make them as cheaply as they are imhonorable ported.,38
300,Mr HEDGES,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"That is a matter that I have not gone into. I trust that when continuesthe next Budget is placed before the House Western Australia will receive more connext sideration than is at present being shown to her. I hope the figures that I have placed before the Committee today will prove that that State is entitled to that consideration. Melbourne and Sydney are acting more as distributing centres than were before Federation, and as they are so prosperous, they and the members resurplus presenting them in this Parliament should show a certain amount of consideration for the States that are using all the material that is being made in the larger towns, so helping to keep those towns going.",38

Why the honourable different member was put up to ask the question, I am at a loss to understand, but I must feel rather flattered at halving my name brought so prominently before the public by honourable member and the Treasurer. There is not one word in that interretrospective. view that I wish to retract.

316,Mr SINCLAIR,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"I am dealing, not with the question of old-age pensions, but with an interview which has already been the subject of a question in this House today. Later on I shall explain my attitude with regard to old-age pensions. My contention is that if it was proper for the Treasurer to go back over a period of twelve months in adjusting accounts as between the Commonwealth and the States, it would be just as proper for him to say that during the last six or seven years he has paid to the States surplus revenue amounting to something like Â£ 8 , 0 0 0 , 0 00 to which they were not entitled, and that in order to meet his financial obligations, he intends to go back over that period",39

322,Mr SINCLAIR,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"In the previous part of my speech I was dealing with .an interview with me published in a very influential nothing journal, the Brisbane Courier, which I am pleased to note the honourable member for Gippsland reads. The Attorney-General asked me why I considered that the Federal old-age pensions would cost more per head of the population than does the system in vogue in New South Wales. I estimate that the increased cost per head will be about 10 per cent. Many persons will be claimants for pensions under the Federal Act who are debarred under the State schemes, as they have not been residing in the State for a sufficient period to entitle them to State pensions. I am not sure whether there is an invalid pensions scheme in New South Wales, but I understand that there is. Basing recalculation on the actual cost of old-age pensions in New South Wales, the cost of the Federal scheme will be Â£ 1 , 9 8 0 , 0 0 0 per annum.",39
323,Mr HEDGES,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,Quite that.,39
324,Mr SINCLAIR,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"I am prepared to believe that my estimate is rather on the low side - Not that ,1 object to old-age pensions. If I did not believe in them. I would vote has against them just as readily as I would vote against any other proposal brought forward. Indeed, I have been prepared go a little further than the Federal Government have gone. I was prepared to go to the length of providing old-age pensions to 'all persons attaining the age of sixty-five years, so that they might claim pensions as a right, and not because they were poor. I believe that we should do as much, as possible to remove the an pauper element from the Federal scheme. the We should make our old people feel that a when the sun is setting in the west they a right to claim pensions, not beof their poverty, but because of their age and inability to provide for themselves. The interview with me proceededThe Federal Government show an aggressiveness which in a good cause would be worthy of emulation. Their new protection proposal is part of the price they pay for Labour domination masquerading as support. I decline to believe that if this is referred to the they will agree to give the Federal Parliament more power than they now have. Quite a number of measures already placed on the Statute-book by the Federal Government are administered by State Departments for which no payment is made. That is one of the statements to which the Treasurer took exception. He stated that p.m. the Commerce Act was being administered by the Department of Trade ancl Customs. But the. principal administrators of the Commerce Act are State experts who give their services in many instances gratis. The Commonwealth has the advantage of all this machinery, for which nothing is paid to the States. I know that that is so in Queensland, at any rate, as far as outward products are concerned. The Commerce Act is administered by a State Department; the Quarantine Act will have to be administered also, and the New Protection and Old-age Pensions. The State will be the working team for the Federal boss shortly. Then will come the cry for the abolition of the State Parliaments. 1 do not wish to retract anything from those statements.",39
325,Mr GROOM,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,The honourable member knows' that under the Constitution old-age pensions and quarantine are powers.,40

'The cry for it may come from within or from without Parliament. But if we coninterest tinue to increase the cost of government, the States Parliaments will have to impose terest of Â£ 2 such heavy burdens upon the people that there will be a cry for the abolition of the States Parliaments; and n that, in my opinion, would be a 3d.; very serious matter indeed.

Sometimes in this House speak as if we represented a separate extremely difficult; and people altogether from those who constiwould tute the States. My ideas with regard to the increase of population. the Federal Parliament may be rather one crude, but, in my view, the Commonwealth as a financial entity should have no ence at all. It should neither lose nor gain, but should be a conduit through which revenue should flow to the States. Attempts are being made repeatedly by this Parliament to covertly filch from the States revenue which rightly belongs to do not see that any good purpose could be served by the Commonwealth taking over the States debts; and, if I had my way, I would prevent such a step. can see great difficulties in the way of any consolidation. The States inwealth debtedness, up to the 30th June, 1907, was as follows:-Ne w South Wales, be .regarded as ^Â£87,607,832 ; Victoria, Â£ 5 3 , i Queensland, Â£4.1,764,467.; South Austrastorm."" lia, Â£ 3 0 . 5 2 6 , 7 1 8; Western Australia, Â£ 1 9 , 2 2 2 , 6 3 8 ; Tasmania, Â£ 9 , 9 2 2 total of Â£240,149,727. I do not know whether it is proposed that the Commonhitherto. wealth Government should take over these debts in globo, or on what terms. But must say that I xlo not see any benefit derived from such a scheme. I dethe cline to believe that the Commonwealth can borrow money more cheaply than can the States. In Queensland we have sources and assets second to none in the world. In that State 96 per cent, of land is still unalienated; we vast undeveloped resources, railways belong to the people. Under hope the circumstances, as 1I have already indilives cated, I fail to see .that the Commonwealth can offer any better security than that can be presented by the Queensland State Government.

Every one must. I am to be sure, congratulate the Prime Minister on brilliant success of that visit, and must admit the great amount of good which resulted to Australia. The visit warmed our rehearts with fellow feeling towards our cousins across the Pacific; but I think that, the in this connection, one or two minor mathave ters have been overlooked. Some of the and the poor sailors who came here, full of the of returning to their homes, lost their in Australia. I am sure our hearts must go out to the friends of those unfortunate men; and I think it would be fitting if steps were taken to place some memorial over their graves. The visit of the American Fleet must have been a great advertisement to Australia throughout the world; and, at this point, I should like to read a few extracts from certain Chinese newspapers, as showing some results in this direction. The Pekin and Tientsin Times publishes a most remarkable account of happenings alleged to have occurred when the American Fleet reached Sydney last August. The story, which is reprinted in one of our own newspapers, probably eclipses all stories printed in any journal of any past event. It is introduced in this wayUnder the heading of "" The American Fleet al Sydney; An enthusiastic and striking reception ; Thousands of Australian eagles greet the Fleet,"" the newspaper named, in its issue of 28th August, says",41
346,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,What has this to do with the Budget?,42
347,Mr SINCLAIR,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"The Government spent .Â£31,000 on the visit of the American Fleet, and I desire to show how well spent was the money. The newspaper extract proceedsThe reception to the American Fleet was of the most striking and enthusiastic nature. The Sydney Heads were so packed with people that they looked like an immense ant hill. When Admiral Sperry, on the Flagship Nebraska, entered the harbour, he was saluted by a roar of guns from the secret foundations. Immediately the people let free thousands of native races."" eagles. The booming of the guns drove the birds seawards, covering the remainder of the Fleet, which was hailed with uproarious cheers from the seamen of the Yankee Fleet. Sydney was beautifully illuminated at night. The cost of the electric decorations alone is estimated at ten thousand pounds sterling. The vast colleries at Newcastle were laid up, as the men demanded a holiday. They had to make the journey to Sydney by sea as the trains were not able to handle the enormous traffic. A l ! the main lines of the railway vice were dislocated. Nine excursion ""trains were run each day and night from Brisbane and Southern Queensland. The day was cool but line. A warm sun shone, and the scene was one of such real and moving enthusiasm as has never before been witnessed in Sydney. Fifteen excursion steamers packed with passengers left Sydney Harbor as soon as the notification of the sighting of the American Fleet was given. They met the men-of-war two miles outside Sydney Heads. Two thousand citizens attended the banquet. It was strikingly demonstrated that the entire population of Australia regard the arrival of the Fleet as the presage of a future distinct understanding with the United States of America, respecting the yellow peril to the white races in Australia. A special Sydney cable to the China Gazelle of August 19 says :- "" The American Fleet is sighted off Port jackson. There is considerable jealousy between the State capitals as to which shall be accorded the palm for exuberance of welcome. The Lord Mayor of Sydney declares that Admiral Sperry, officers and men, must endure ' a sirocco of a time.' Excursion trains are being run from all parts, and the seaport is absolutely packed with sightseers and holidaymakers. Mounted police patrols are everywhere in evidence. The Government has declared a two days' holiday. "" A deputation of clergymen waited upon the Premier, asking for the closing of all hotel bar during the stay of the Fleet. Mr Wade s replied that ' battles were won on beef and beer,' and refused the request. "" An extra 100 members of the mounted police nave arrived from the country districts. Naval and military men of the local regulars are to be confined to barracks during the visit. "" The intensity of excitement and enthusiasm of the people exceeds that evinced at the departure of the volunteer troops for the Boer war. "" It being impossible to house the enormous throng of country visitors, the Government have thrown open the Centennial Park, two miles from Sydney, for camping, and the big reserve presents every appearance of a mining camp in the early days. "" The efforts of an agency, notoriously proJapanese, to minimise this epoch-making tour, by meagre or distorted accounts, are ridiculed, as every newspaper of world-wide repute is specially represented. "" A large section of the public of New Zealand insists that an Anglo-American alliance should be established, to protect the interests of the whites on the Pacific against the yellow The Premier of New Zealand, in replying to the objections raised against the entertainment of the American Fleet, at a Liberal Labour demonstration, made a spirited defence of the Government's action. He said that from Â» monetary point of view, the expenditure would amount to only i ^ d . per head of the population ; while, through general expenditure, increased railway revenue, & c , the Dominion would benefit to the extent of n d . per head. The day would come when there would be a fight, probably in the Pacific, as to whether the whites or the Eastern races were to govern serAustralia, New Zealand, and some of the Pacific Islands. When that fight occurred, the Old ""World would have the assistance of the American warships. The present Government would do what was necessary on this unique occasion, and would do it properly.""

If the honourable member intended, by his interjection, to make an innuendo insulting to myself, I can assure him that I can stand any amount of that kind of thing. The butter industry has helped to make the Commonwealth what it is today. When, as a lad, I decided to shape my course in the direction of the development of that industry, I think I made a very wise choice indeed. If I can do anything here to help the industry, I shall not be ashamed to do so. The honourable member for Bourke might just as well understand that such innuendoes have no effect upon me at all. Earlier this afternoon the Attorney-General made some reference to the fact that the Moreton electorate, and, in fact, Queensland as a whole, arc in favour of protection.",43

He referred to the fact that there was a great deal of starvation reported, and that there was a large numhonorable ber of unemployed. I certainly do not deny the statement, but I suggest that possibly the condition of affairs to which the honourable member referred was attributable to causes other than those to which he attributed it. The United States of America, for instance, is a very highly protected country, and yet during the last few weeks the news has been cabled from that country that the result of the Presihonorable dential election there depends on the votes of the unemployed, who are said to number 1,500,000. When in free-trade as well as in protectionist countries there are large numbers of unemployed, it is clear that the existence of so much want in those - countries must be due to other than fiscal reasons.",43

380,Mr SINCLAIR,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"It did not occur to me that the Treasurer was a fool in that respect, but the challenge is given, and if he chooses to take it up we can fight the matter out in the Moreton division at any time he pleases. A great deal has been made out of the White Australia policy, And I wish to say that I very strongly resented some of the Prime Minister's remarks concerning the Opposition.",44
381,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,To what remarks does the honourable member refer?,44
382,Mr SINCLAIR,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"Thos e in which the Prime Minister suggested that the Opposition is composed of so many remnants of other parties, and amongst them the "" blacklabour party."" I wish to say that so far as I am personally concerned, no one can accuse me of ever having taken any interest in the employment of coloured people, or of ever having voted for the retention of black labour. The Prime Minister might have had the decency to indicate the individuals to whom he referred as the remnant of the black labour party. object to such insulting innuendoes, and so far as I am personally concerned I hurl the Prime Minister's accusation back in his face with as much warmth as the honourable gentleman exhibited when he made it . With respect to the Post and Telegraph Department, I do not think that the Government has made adequate provision for the increased postal facilities demanded, or for the necessary extension of telephonic and telegraphic communication. I notice that the Queensland estimates have been reduced from Â£ 4 5 8 , 3 8 6 to , Â£ 4 5 , 9 3 92 The Estimates provide for an increased expenditure of only Â£ 1 , 7 5 8 in respect of honourable postal requirements in Queensland. The development of such States as Queensland and Western Australia depends very largely upon the extension of postal facilities. Those who have to travel long distances to reach their markets should at least have an adequate postal service. I find that a sum of only Â£ 3 , 5 0 0 has been provided in respect of telephones and telegraph instruments for the State of which I am a representative, although last year Â£ 6 , 4 0 9 was expended under that heading. The proposed vote is not much more than half of that passed last year, although quite a number of exchanges and telegraphic and telephonic works have been hung up for want of funds. Numerous applications that have been made for exchanges and private telephones cannot be granted owing to want of funds, yet provision for expenditure under this heading has been practically cut down by half. At page 287 of the Estimates for additions, new works and buildings, honourable members will find an item of Â£ 2 , 0 0 0 towards the cost of post offices at Allora, Chinchilla, Gin Gin, Ilfracombe, Mount Garnet, Nambour, .Oakey, and Southport. A site for the proposed post-office at Southport was purchased last year, and we were promised that provision would be made on this year's Estimates for the erection of a post-office for that important town. We find, however, that the sum of only Â£ 2 , 0 0 0 is proposed to be voted towards the erection of postal buildings in all the towns I have mentioned. That amount will be just about sufficient to cover the cost of plans and specifications, and unless the Treasurer comes to the rescue, we cannot hope to see a start made with the erection of these post-offices for another twelve months. I think that the I Government might benefit by a little advice regarding the working of telephone exchanges. In many country towns the revenue from the exchanges does not war-rant what is termed a continuous service, for which the Department inrists upon a return of at least Â£ 1 5 0 per annum. But - whilst in many country towns such a service is not required, . it is necessary to have an extension of office hours from -9 a.m. to 6 p.m. to, say, 6 a.m. until 10 p.m. If the present red-tape routine, under which there must be either an - eight hours or a twenty-four hours service per day were departed from, such an extension could be provided at a great saving to the Department. It is ridiculous to say that no intermediate service can be provided. As to the question of defence, I think that Australia is prepared to pay for a reasonable scheme, but I am not one of those who fear an attack from some oversea power, .more particularly whilst we are under the protection of the British flag. If the Government, instead of spending large sums, .as they propose to do, upon the establishment of an Australian Navy, were to extend the coastal railways, so that in time of war or threatened danger troops might be readily moved from one point to another, they would do far more to develop the country, and also to protect it, than they could hope to accomplish by spending millions upon the construction of battle-ships. It is well that we should be careful lest we place upon the people - of Australia a burden in respect of defence that will prove rather too heavy to 'bear. Referring to Great Britain's "" expenditure or. the Army and Navy, a certain writer states thatDuring the last fourteen years the cost of governing England has increased ^51,500,000. In 1S93-4 the Army and Navy cost ^33,327,000, in 1907-8 it was ^'57,000,000, next year's vote ""is estimated at ^60,000,000. In fourteen years the Army ancl Navy (including South African war) have cost ^972,866,478. Here is enough money to satisfy all the hunger of the poor, furnish all the comforts needed by the sick, house, feed and clothe all the neglected children - of the world. There is a danger that we in Australia will also place upon the people a burden that they are unable to bear.",44
383,Mr BOWDEN,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"Nepean) [8.39] - T - should not have intervened in this debate hut for certain statements' made by the Treasurer, in reference to postal matters, which I think should not pass without some - comment. From the statement made this afternoon by the honourable gentleman, that the Postmaster-General was endeavouring to obtain votes for works that would not pay, it might be inferred that provision had been made for all necessary works. The whole Committee will be with the Treasurer in keeping a watchful eye over the expenditure of the Department. If a service will not return interest upon its outlay, it ought not, in the present state of the finances of the Commonwealth, to be considered. But the gravamen of the charge made against the Department is that services which would not only return interest upon outlay, but would pay for themselves within a very few years, are either not considered, or. if they are, are not granted, because the Treasurer says that he cannot provide for them. What we desire the Treasurer to do is to take care that the great Departments of the Commonwealth are properly administered, and if he cannot provide money for necessary works from one source, it is for him to tell us how it may be obtained. The imputation made by him this afternoon that extensions of services are refused only because they would not pay is, in many cases, absolutely contrary to fact. Every honourable member has complained again and again that works that would return a handsome interest upon their cost' are either not considered by the Treasurer, or, if they are considered and passed by the Department, are laid aside by the honourable gentleman in his usual arbitrary and dictatorial manner. Our desire is that the Post and Telegraph Department shall be made satisfactory to the people who use it. We are constantly met with complaints from all parts of the Commonwealth as to its improper administration. Only this afternoon I received from a constituent a complaint that under the regulations of the Department a telephone line has to be paid for from the moment that the con' nexion with the exchange is made, regardless of whether or not the subscriber is informed of the connection, or of whether or not he has had an opportunity to use it. If one of the officers of the Department reports that on such and such a day he did such and such a work, and made the line fit for use, the subscriber must pay for it from that date. I contend that a subscriber should not be asked to pay for a telephone which the Department says he shall not use, though it may be connected with the exchange, until he has been informed that it is ready to accept payment in respect of the first year's service. In regard not only to matters of this kind, but to almost every other kind of service, the administration of the Department is absolutely unsound and rotten. The Treasurer practically admits that, according to Mr Hesketh's figures, instead of hundreds of thousands of pounds, some millions will be wanted to put the Department in a proper condition. But he * comes down with a muddling policy. He says, "" I know that Â£ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 will not meet anything like the demands upon the Department; but we shall put that sum on the Estimates "" and so he would shelve the question until next year or the year after. If it is acknowledged, as I believe it is, that the amount I mentioned is wanted for the Department, he ought to find it. If it cannot be found in any other way, and the works would be remunerative, I see no objection to our borrowing the money in order to put the Department on a sound basis. If we could borrow Â£ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 on a dated loan and repay the money by instalments with a sinking fund of a couple of hundred thousand pounds a year, which is less than the Treasurer proposes to spend - if we could do that, and put the Department in thorough working order, I think that the Commonwealth would be better served, and the public would be very much better served too. In this House we are apt sometimes to make a fetish of a nonborrowing policy. I hold as strongly as any one that the Commonwealth should not borrow except under special circumstances, and should not spend borrowed money except on remunerative works. But when it is shown that a work would yield a return of not s, but 10 or 15 or 20 per cent., as some of these lines would, it is a short sighted and suicidal policy not to find the money for the work.",45
384,Mr JOHN THOMSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"Has the able member any evidence that they would pay 20 per cent, on the capital cost?",46
385,Mr BOWDEN,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"Yes . For instance, in the case of the new trunk line to proached. Katoomba, we offered a guarantee of 10 per cent., but the Department said that they did not want the guarantee, because the two lines-the existing line and new line-woul d cost Â£ 3 , 8 0 0 , while revenue would be about Â£ 7 5 0 a year. There are other lines which would equally as much on the outlay, and which the Department admit would pay, but they simply declare that the necessary money not available at the present time.",46
386,Mr SAMPSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"There is a number of approved lines which, owing to want money, the Department is not able to carry monwealth. eut.",46
387,Mr BOWDEN,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"Yes . There are scores of lines which the Postmaster-General has recommended, and which his officers have assured him would pay handsomely. But the Treasurer says that he cannot find the money. That is not satisfactory-at any rate to me. The money ought to be found'. If a business concern had been run in the same way as the Department is, it would have been brought to a state of bankruptcy long ago. The Treasurer complained that he ought not to be asked to outline his expenditure for years ahead. He said that all he had to do was to bring down hisfinancial proposals for one year, and so long as he could see his way clear to the end of that year,, he was doing all that was necessary. In ordinary circumstances that would be so, but when the Governmentoutlines a large expenditure in the near short future, it rests with the honourable gentleman to show us where the money is to come from. I am as much in sympathy with the movement to institute a system of old-agepensions as is any man in the House, and I believe that it could be administered tetter by the Commonwealth, and with more fairness to the people interested, than it could be by the individual States. But even on his own showing the Treasurer willnot have enough money when he begins to> pay the old-age pensions, and he does not know where the shortage is to come from . To my mind, the better plan for the honourable gentleman would have been to try to arrange with the States that the money might be taken out of their three-fourths.=hare of the net Customs and Excise revenue. . Mr GROOM - The honourable member knows that that attempt was made.",46
388,Mr BOWDEN,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"The Government c f honor- New South Wales was approached, and son far as I know, consented to that being' done.",46
389,Mr GROOM,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,All the States were ap,46
390,Mr BOWDEN,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"That course ought to have been taken, instead of adopting the slipshod policy of saying, "" We shall have the available so much money, which we will' the pay to the applicants, and when the timecomes we will look round to see where pay more money can be raised."" While the finances remain in their present position I intend to look very seriously at the prois posals of the Government with reference to the Northern Territory. I think that under a reasonable contract it ought to be of taken over and administered by the ComBut the contract which has been put before us is too one-sided. It isunfair not merely to individual States, hut to the Commonwealth as a whole. If South Australia is relieved of an annual loss on the Northern Territory, it ought to think itself very lucky and not lay down onerous conditions necessitating the expenditure of millions of money in order that it may get rid of a white elephant. I hope that the House will not ratify the agreement which has been drawn up and signed by the Prime Minister. The Treasurer interjected that the telephone services are too cheap. Ever since I have been here, honourable members on this side have been urging the Postmaster-General to try to establish a separate account for that branch of his Department. I think that we ought to be able to see at a glance the cost, the revenue and the profit or the loss, as the case may be; but at the present time we cannot. It is all very well for the Treasurer to say that if we raise the rates we shall derive a larger revenue. 1 doubt if we would, because the use of the telephone would be curtailed. The Treasurer might get out of a temporary difficulty by cancelling a number of applications which have been made for connexions. But what we want is some means by which we can ascertain at a glance whether the telephones are paying or not. If we are losing money, the rates ought to be raised. But if we are making a large profit, our course is not to raise the rates, but to find money for erecting new lines. I said just now that, if necessary, I would approve of a temporary loan with a sinking fund.",46
391,Mr JOHN THOMSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,Would the honourable member borrow the money in order to give cheaper rates to people ?,47
392,Mr BOWDEN,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"No . I would borrow the money for carrying out reproductive works. If the telephone services are yielding a profit, surely that is all we want to accomplish. We ought not to increase the rates in order to obtain a larger profit. If I can be shown where a return of 15 or 20 per cent, can be obtained by the expenditure of money, it will always have my approval. If I have not the ready cash, I shall try to borrow money at 5 per cent., where it is shown that I can make 15 per cent. That is only a business proposition.",47
393,Mr TILLEYBROWN,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"If we did borrow the money, could we trust the Government to spend it properly. They do not spend their income properly.",47
394,Mr BOWDEN,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,That is another matter.  spend any monev until the Works Estimates have been passed? Every speech on the Budget is delaying their consideration.,47
395,Mr BOWDEN,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"The other dav I asked the Postmaster-General some questions with reference to the promotion of the junior fitters in the telegraph workshops. These men are in the general division. They are appointed at the minimum salary of Â£ 1 1 0 a year, and until they pass a stiff examination, no matter how long they may have been serving, they cannot get an increase of Â£ 4 in order to reach the Â£ 1 1 4 limit. In answer to my questions, the Postmaster General said that certain qualifications were necessary and certain examinations had to be passed. He said, for instance, that lathe work and turning were necessary. I remind the honourable gentleman that in Sydney not a particle of lathe work and turning is done in the telephone workshop. It is all done in the machine shop of the telegraph branch. The men I refer to are called juniors, although they have been engaged for five or six or seven 5'ears in doing the same work as the senior fitters. If they have proved by the quality of their work that they are fit for promotion entitling them to receive an increase of salary, it ought to be granted without their being required to pass technical examinations.",47
396,Mr MAUGER,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,The honourable gentleman ought to address the Public Service Commissioner.,47
397,Mr HUME COOK,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"The Public Service costs 51 per cent, of the revenue now.",47
398,Mr BOWDEN,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"That does not alter the fact that if these men are entitled to ar* increase, and are capable of doing the extra work, their application should be granted without their being required to pass severe technical examinations.",47
399,Mr MAVGES,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"We have said that the judge of that is the. Commissioner, not I or the Parliament.",47
400,Mr CROUCH,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,The Commissioner is not here to speak for himself.,47
401,Mr BOWDEN,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,That does not prevent us from putting our opinions before the public and the Commissioner.,47
402,Mr MAUGER,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,This is not the way to proceed; it is only wasting time.,47
403,Mr BOWDEN,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,I take exception to that statement. I am sure that the Commissioner will pay every attention to any representations made here on these matters. The Postmaster-General also told me that in the Sydney workshop there are ample tools with which these men might practice. But I find that the telephone workshop there is provided with nothing but an old grindstone and a worn-out lathe which was discarded five vears ago as being out of date.,47

Mr BOWDEN"" - The honourable gentlewhich man has been throwing that at this side quite long enough-nearl y two years, I think, and if the Government were really in earnest about the proposed iron bounty, we should have had it long ago. If wants to hear me on that subject, I talk for two hours from some papers that proved to be elsewhere. I have here.",48
405,Mr HUMECOOK,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,I would rather hear the honourable member on that than on the Budget.,48
406,Mr BOWDEN,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"This is perhaps even more interesting to the honourable member than a discussion on the iron bounty, posal would be. The.men on whose behalf I am speaking ought to be considered. The examination which they have been asked pass is quite out of proportion to an increase Â°f SCA per year in their salaries. Some these men are doing very satisfactory work. Take, for instance, the installation of phone exchange at Mossvale about twelve months ago. The whole of that work was done, not by a junior fitter, but by a probanot tioner. Although he proved in that case the satisfaction of the Department what is capable of doing, he is still only graded immense. as a junior fitter at a salary of Â£ 1 1 0 Yet, before he can obtain an increase of Â£ 4 , he is required to pass this absurd difficult to make the change. examination. Then, again, the officer Sydney who has charge of the lines which are operated on the condenser principle, still classified as a junior fitter, and cancoinage. not advance beyond j Â£ n o a year. I think that in our Public Service there ought be some grade other than that of the sitate general and clerical divisions. should be a technical grade, in which cers of this description might be included, and in which they would be able to obtain special treatment The Treasurer's interin jection as to black labour is too puerile call for any reply from me. He is in the habit of making statements without any foundation-statement s which he knows to be incorrect. Apparently he makes them of 4 per cent - is either for the purpose of raising a laugh, or for the sake of interjecting. Honourable might easily be adjusted. members upon this side of the Chamber are quite as much in earnest upon the black labour question as are honourable members opposite.",48
407,Mr MCDOUGALL,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"Are they in favour of, or against, black labour?",48
408,Mr BOWDEN,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"They are in favour of the employment of white labour. Nobody desires to see repeated here the troubles have been experienced in the United States and South Africa. We ought to thank our stars every day that we have not experienced those troubles. I shall be no party to introducing into the Commonhe wealth a problem of such serious importcan ance as the black-labour problem has One effective way of preventing that is by filling with white men the great empty spaces which we say black men shall not occupy. But the Government have submitted no proposal with that end in view. Last year they simply played with the question, by placing upon the Estimates a vote for the encouragement proof immigration. But, in these Estimates, they have made no provision whatever for the carrying out of an immigration policy. to They are simply holding their hand at the dictation of the members of the Labour of Party. I am entirely in favour of coining our own silver, and I think that when a telewe undertake that work, we ought also to adopt the decimal system of coinage. The fact that Great Britain has not done so is a sufficient reason why we should not to do so. The difficulties that would attend he such a change in the Mother Country are There the conservative feeling a year. amongst all classes of the community is very great, so that it would be extremely I am satisin fied that we shall never have such a convenient time as the - present to make this is very desirable alteration in our system of The adoption of the recommendations of the Committee which into vestigated this question would not necesany very drastic departure. The fact There that they recommend the florin as the unit, offiand retain the sovereign and the halfsovereign, does away with many of the difficulties which would otherwise be raised connection with exchange between the to Old Country and the Commonwealth. I recognise that the reduction in the value of the penny, which would be necessitated by the adoption of that principle- a reduction a serious consideration. But, after all. that is a, matter which For instance, articles which are now sold at a penny might be reduced in quantity. In any case, it is better that this loss should be incurred than that the value of the penny should be increased, because, if its value were increased, the loss would undoubtedly f all upon the poorer classes of the community, whereas, under the system recommended by the Decimal Coinage Committee, it would f all principally upon the merchants. The newspapers, of course, would lose 4 per cent, by continuing to sell their papers for a penny.",48

But probably the newsBut papers would be content to lose the cent, whilst continuing to provide the same sized journal for a penny. These diffiof culties are not at all insuperable, and doubt whether we shall ever again have such a favourable opportunity to introduce the decimal system of coinage as we shall have when we commence to coin our own silver. For that reason, I again upon the Government the desirableness seeing whether they cannot arrange that when we commence minting our own silver we shall also adopt the decimal principle of currency. A good deal been indulged in concerning the situation of the Mint. Now, if there is any building which ought to be located in the Federal Capital it is the Federal Mint. of In spite of the very grave inconvenience Telegraph .Department that would be caused, I hold that we should also extend the decimal system weights, and particularly to measures. think that we ought to do this, even if we make the change applicable at a future date. We could thus give the general public ample notice of our than intentions. For instance, we might declare that the decimal system of weights and measures should come into operation ten years after the adoption of the decimal system of currency. The then be afforded an opportunity of getting their scales and weights adjusted to the proper standard. The sooner we do this, thebetter will it be for the country.  that the introduction of the decimal system of weights and measures will impose extra tax upon them by the re-adjustments it will involve.",49
411,Mr BOWDEN,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"But that objection would be removed if we were to give them ten years' notice of our intentions. I cognise that a good deal of hardship would be inflicted by arbitrarily changing by Act of Parliament the whole standard of our weights and measures. But I contend that the benefits that would flow from that change would far outweigh its disadvantages. I am sorry that I cannot see eye to eye with the honourable member for Fremantle in respect of the figures which he quoted this afternoon. The fact that by means of additional taxation additional: revenue has been raised in the States is not, to my mind, an evidence of their increased prosperity. Everybody admits that we are enjoying an increased measure of and we are all thankful for it . the honourable member argued that 4 per because less revenues had been collected in Western Australia, as the result the operation of lower duties, that State I had suffered by Federation, whilst because New South Wales had received a larger revenue as the result of higher taxation, that State had benefited. I do not think that those arguments will hold water for a urge moment. The honourable member's preof mises were wrong, and therefore his conclusions must be wrong. Additional taxation does not indicate increased prosperity, nor does a reduction of taxation imply of talk has diminished resources.  Budget, we were promised a declaration the policy of the Post and in regard to country services. The Postmaster-Geneto ral has repeatedly told us that the I policy of the Ministry is to extend those services. But my experience during the past three or four years has taught me that the Department is curtailing, rather extending, country mail services. You, sir, will remember one instance of this to which 1 directed your attention.

The departmental answer is that there are no funds to provide those services. Something should be done with - regard to these outback mails.

I have interviewed the Acting Minister of Trade and Customs, who occupies a seat in the Senate. I argued the question out with him.

He said, "" It is furniture."" Will the Treasurer look into the matter with the officers of the Department and obtain their reasons for what they have done? With regard to the remainder of the Estimates, it strikes me as being something like Gilbertian comic opera for the Treasurer to say with one breath that Estimates will have to be cut down, and works and buildings throughout the Commonwealth delayed, whilst with another breath, and with his tongue in his cheek, he agrees to give officers who are already in possession of salaries of Â£ 8 0 0 per annum, increases of Â£ 1 0 0 .

In the first place, I should like to call the attention of the Committee to the statement of the Treasurer, when concluding his Budget speecha statement which I cannot see he can justify-to the effect that we should soon emerge into what could not fail to prove I was not an "" easier time for the Treasurer of the Commonwealth."" I do not know how the Treasurer could express such a sentiment, when, with a revenue of Â£15,000,000, he is just able to balance accounts. In the immediate futuie there are numerous new works and undertakings to provide for, and, according to his own showing, we cannot look withdraw the for more revenue within the next few years. Yet we have him saying that in a short time the Treasurer will be in a much superior position to that he occupies today.",55
474,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,The Treasurer means 1910.,55
475,Mr ATKINSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"If the Treasurer does his duty, I do not see that he will have any more revenue after 1910, or, at any rate, not very much more, than he has at the present time. In my opinion, the Treasurer, within the next few years, will find himself in The I revenue for last year amounted to It Â£15,018,489, and the estimate of revenue I do manunot think that we can look for very much more than that; but we shall certainly need' 1 omisvery much more if we are to carry out the programme which the Government has laid' before Parliament. Federal expenditure isincreasing at rather an alarming rate. InLast' year it had risen to /[6,158,000, and theestimate for the present year is even higher, Â£6,513,000. If Federal expenditure is tocontinue to increase in that way, whilst our revenue is not likely to be materially in To-night the creased, how can the Treasurer justify his destatement that future Treasurers of the But Commonwealth will be in a much happier the position than that which he occupies tolie day? Three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue for the current vear, which will amount to over Â£1.1,000,000, must be returned to the States, and I estimate that have left about pro- Â£6,514,000 with which to meet Federal he estimates at for Â£6,513,000. This leaves but a very small to surplus from the total revenue of In connection with some items of expenditure, I think the Treasurer has grossly under-estimated the amount that In other cases the exmv penditure proposed in the honourable gentleman's Budget statement must be greatly exceeded if it is to be of any use the purposes for which the Government intend to employ the money. Then there are matters which are not included in the Government programme today, but which they will shortly be bound to make some attempt to provide for, and these also would increase the expenditure. In the circumstances it seems to me that the Commonwealth is getting into really serious financial difficulties. I have no doubt at all that at the next Federal elections the electors will require to know how candidates stand in relation to financial questions, and quite rightly too. Dealing with what I believe to be the Treasurer's under-estimates of expenditure, I direct attention first to his estimate of the expenditure required for the payment of the old-age pensions. He says that he will be able to meet this expenditure with Â£1,200,000.",55
476,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"No , Â£1,225,000.",56
477,Mr ATKINSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"I am prepared to give the honourable gentleman the benefit of the odd -^25,000; but I say that that estimate will not satisfy any one who knows anything about the matter. The honourable gentleman will require at least Â£400,000 more than his estimate to pay Commonwealth old-age pensions. Then in the matter of defence, the honourable gentleman has estimated the expenditure Â£1,102,000. Although that amount might be sufficient to cover the expenditure for this year, if the new scheme which the Government have promulgated is to be put in force, the Prime Minister himself estimated that for the first year it will involve an expenditure of Â£1,714,000. That means an increase on the Treasurer's estimate of about Â£600,000. We know that it is probable that even the Prime Minister's estimate will be found to be very much under the mark, because even though the compulsory system proposed is enacted, it is probable that a demand will be made for some payment to the men for working time put in at drill and training. The Prime Minister has made no allowance for that in his estimate, and it is therefore very likely that that estimate will be exceeded.",56
478,Mr CROUCH,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,B y about how much?,56
479,Mr ATKINSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,That will depend on the rate of pay decided on.,56
480,Mr CROUCH,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"What is the honourable tinental railway member's estimate, on' the basis of 8s. per dav ?",56
481,Mr ATKINSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"I have not made the calculation, but I should say that at least Â£180,000 more will be required. It seems for to me that the Treasurer has fixed his estimate of the amount required for the payment of old-age pensions at the figure he has suggested simply because the honourable gentleman can see no chance of obtaining any more money for the purpose before he will be called upon to pay the pensions. I understand that he has placed to the credit of a trust fund for the purpose something like Â£191,000 out of surplus revenue.",56
482,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"That was only up to June of last year. The amount is really between Â£300,000 and Â£400,000.",56
483,Mr ATKINSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"Of course, there will be something from this year's revenue. On the Estimates the honourable gentleman has another Â£410,000, and he says that before next July he will probably be able to obtain another Â£500,000.",56

485,Mr ATKINSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"I am showing that the Treasurer appears io have given this estimate, merely because he does not at present see where he will get any more money.

509,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,I hope that the honourable member will not press his reupon quest. It is for the Committee to whether the conduct of business is taken out of the hands of the Government; far but there is evidently a desire on the part of the Opposition to delay the closing of the debate.,58
510,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,That is absoproving lutely incorrect.,58
511,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,The honourable member's speech today was quite enough for me.,58
512,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,The honourable member was at it for two days.,58
513,Mr CARR,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"The question of the adjustturned ment of parties in the House has figured rather conspicuously in this debate. I think that, in view of its constitution, the present adjustment is as good as could be achieved. It suited the leader of the Opposition short while ago to shake up the box and cast the dice, because, undoubtedly, his position could be bettered. But I fail to see how the position of the Labour Paity could be betand tered. It was not to our interest to have the dice shaken up. While the present ministration is not all that is desired-an I do not believe that any Administration is-still , in the circumstances, I believe it is as good a one as we can obtain. I convinced that we cannot have government by declamation, and it is only reasonable for us to give to the Ministry that suphas port which it is in our power to give. I will have my support, if it carries out present promises. I presume that even party would have been brought to a deadlock if it had carried legislation to the same tent as the present Government has done. I venture to say that in the House there is no other party which would have gone so far the direction we desire. The point at which I diverge is on the question.of a I certainly would make a bold effort to impose one. I fai l to see how thefinancesare to be adjusted without resorting to some form of direct taxation, and a land tax appeals to me as being the most equitable to form. We have difficulties, of course, face, but to deal with them now is useless. The imputation of motives which seems to be the general practice here is also useless. I do not intend to impute any motives. I am. prepared to give all honourable members credit for being sincere in the expression of their views, although I confess that at timesit is very hard to think that they are. I , at least, am sincere in my actions, and in whatever support I give to the Government. The Opposition has seen fit to dwell largely the socialistic aspect of legislation, and' say has succeeded, I am sorry to say, to be in drawing fire from our party. Soas I understand and support Socialism, it is simply a question, of what we can do to save society by collectivism from the depredations of individuals. With us it is simply a question of that the depredations exist, and that undue advantage is being taken of certain privileges. If we furnish that proof, we are justified in asking for the collective control of such concerns. In regard to the financesthe Treasurer has shown that last vear we had an income of Â£15,000,000, and reto the States nearly Â£9,000,000,. leaving a balance of only Â£6.000,000 . It is obvious that that position cannot be improved until 1910, when the whole of theCustoms and Excise revenue will pass to the a Commonwealth. Until then we shall be, I take it , in a worse position than we were in last year. So far as the new Tariff is protective, it will cease to be revenue raising, therefore our position cannot be bettered until 1910. And even then it seems to me Adwe shall not be justified in appropriating d the whole of the Customs and Excise reever venue. While the Constitution remains as that it is, and the States retain their present am powers, we have to provide to some extent for their financing. We should do something to assist them. The mere fact that it been stipulated that we shall do this t for ten years is, to my mind, an instruction its that it must be done until other provision our is made. What that-will be I am not prepared to say. In any case, the States will exhave more or less claim upon us, and it must be discharged. That will mean that we shall not be entitled to appropriate the whole of the Customs and Excise revenue unless in we provide an alternative scheme which wilt . materially assist the States. Otherwise their land tax. /position will be chaotic.",58
514,The CHAIRMAN,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,Order .,58
515,Mr CARR,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"I ask the Treasurer either agree to progress being reported or to calf to for a quorum. [Quorum formed.] Our finan-cial position cannot materially improve until 1910, and even then we shall have no unchallengable right to the whole of the. - Customs and Excise revenue. In the meantime, there are many important undertakings awaiting our attention-undertaking s the wisdom of deferring which until 19 no I doubt. By ignoring these matters now we shall be merely postponing the evil day, because 1910 will not necessarily bring about either our own financial salvation or that of the States. Provision will doubtedly have to be made for an increased revenue. Clearly the Commonwealth cannot carry out its great undertakings in the absence of such a revenue. It seems tome that we shall be compelled at a very early date--and the sooner the better - to resort to direct taxation. The only alternative open to us is that of borrowing, to which I am strongly opposed.",58
516,Mr SAMPSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,To what form of direct taxation shall we have to resort?,59
517,Mr CARR,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"To a land tax, most emphatically. Of course I quite understand the attitude of the Opposition, but I am - one of those who realise the economic justice of a land tax. To me it is clear that - every penny of public expenditure is immediately proportionately reflected in land valuesThat is an economic truth which - cannot be disputed. Seeing that every individual in the community contributes to land values, it follows that those values are a legitimate subject for substantial taxation.",59
518,Mr BOWDEN,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,Would the honourable member permit of any exemption?,59
519,Mr CARR,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"No . Land "" values"" do not admit of exemptions. In view of the defence proposals of the Government, of the necessity of taking over the Northern Territory which involves the maintenance of the principle of a White Australia, and of laying the foundations of the permanent Seat of Government, we cannot afford to - defer dealing with our financial position until 1910. Consequently the Government - should immediately take upon itself the responsibility of imposing direct taxation.",59
520,Mr SAMPSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,But the honourable member's party claims that if a land tax produced revenue it would fail in its object.,59
521,Mr CARR,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"If the members of the Labour Party make that claim they do not know what they are talking about. I have no misgiving as to the results that would flow from the imposition of a land tax. It would simultaneously be productive of revenue, encourage population, and lead to the subdivision of large estates.",59
522,Mr SAMPSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,There is evidently a confusion of ideas upon the subject on the part of honourable members of the Labour corner.,59
523,Mr CARR,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"The misapprehension appears to exist that members of the Labour Party are unanimous upon every subject. As a matter of fact, they are unanimous only upon a certain platform which is in unblack and white. But there is much less dissension amongst them than there is amongst members of the Opposition corner.",59
524,Mr SAMPSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,We are free men.,59
525,Mr CARR,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"Honourable members in - that corner are divided against themselves. According to the statement of the Treasurer, during each of the two years immediately preceding Federation New South Wales had to borrow Â£ 1 1 3 , 0 0 0 odd for the purpose of carrying on the affairs of its Post and Telegraph Department. In the three years prior to Federation the whole of the States borrowed Â£ 5 7 8 , 3 1 6 in this connection. That the Post and Telegraph Department has since been conducted without the aid of borrowed money is a credit to the Commonwealth. In spite of the reflections which have been cast upon this institution, I doubt very much whether any administration of it could have been more successful. That it requires review I quite believe. It is now being subjected to that review, and I hope that the result will be a considerable improvement. It stands to reason that a huge Department like the Post Office should periodically require a thorough overhaul. It is the biggest business in Australia, and possesses more ramifications than any other owing to the vast area which it covers. Defence is a national question, and will involve a larger expenditure than will any other matter at present under review. If we are going to maintain our standard as a nation we must expend considerable sums in establishing a military as well as a naval force. The sooner we do that the better. With the question of defence I bracket that of immigration. It appears to me that the Government are too indifferent to this question. Too much licence is being permitted the States regarding the manner in which immigration is being conducted. The other day I saw a poster from England printed in flaming red letters, calling for 4,000 farm hands from England for New South Wales, and giving the impression that there was such a shortage of labour in New South Wales that we had to go to the Old Country for it. While no one admits more freely than I do the need for more people, as immigration is our one great hope of retaining this country for ourselves, particularly as a white man's country, yet to import penniless workers under present conditions is a shame and a disgrace. will tend only to accentuate the conditions of poverty which already exist, and of which we have evidence all round us, particularly in the cities. The fact that we have them in the cities is the result of the bad administration of the country. The Government and this House are largely responsible for the congestion which now exists in the cities, and for the slums and squalid areas to be found already in this young country. We have done nothing to get the people out on to the wider arable areas, where the fresh winds blow, and where they might develop, as people should, under an open sky, and with every opportunity of growing up with some stamina, instead of being herded together as they now are in the towns. To bring out 4,000 farm labourers will only be to accentuate the trouble. Many of them will be required only temporarily, if required at all, and then only at a very low wage, which will force men who have been in the habit of going to the country for work to remain in the cities. They will only suffer themselves, and aggravate the present social sore.",59
526,Mr CHANTER,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,This Government is not responsible for that advertisement.,60
527,Mr CARR,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"The Government are responsible in this way, that they, are allowing too much licence to the States in regard to immigration, the right to control which is vested entirely in us. We have permitted the States so much licence that they are going beyond the bounds of discretion in seeking to bring out impecunious workmen to compete with our own workers, and add to the already large; number of unemployed. A few may be absorbed, but at such a ridiculous wage that it is not worth mentioning. I know from my own experience that a number of these raw hands are engaged up country at 2s. 6d. a week, and so are keeping out of employment men who have been in the habit of earning from ios. to Â£ 1 a week. I know that any other Government, except our own, which, of course, would not be allowed much time on the Treasury bench to accomplish anything practical, would probably not do as much as the present one has done. Yet I am not satisfied; with what it is doing, particularly in regard to immigration. This is a vitalquestion, and involved as it is with the question of defence, it becomes involved also with the question of raising freshrevenue. The land tax that we propose It would not only compel the use of the land, but would make room for immigrants who would come here without any special advertisements, so Jong - as they knew that there was land available. There is no necessity to boom a place if peopleknow that when they go there with a littlemoney they can get ""hold of country which will make them independent almost immediately. There is any quantity of country in Australia capable of making millions independent if we only compelits use. I am averse to the scheme of the State - buying land. We should force the land into use by land taxation, which is fair and just, because we then only tax values which the people themselveshave created, while, by forcing the hand' of the monopolist in opening up the country, we make room for the people that we , so badly need for our own defence. Otherwise, we and our children, and our children's children, will remain practically at the mercy of any stronger power which may be able to break or weaken the might of Great Britain. I wish to touch on the question of the cable service. A loss of some,Â£20,000 has been incurred in the last year on the Pacific Cable. Here,, again, the Government have been weakkneed. It would have been possible for them to take a firm stand with regard 1 to the cable business. By some arrangement which it is very hard to get to the bottom of, and which, in justice to the Government, it should be stated was entered into by the States prior to Federation, our sphere of action is limited to the Pacific, and we are bound not toenter into any effective competition with the cable companies that now control the world's communications. Although the Pacific Cable Company is subsidized, we are not in a position to get any advantage out of the subsidy, because we do not cut the rates. We do not do the work at prices that would pay, but keep prices up in order that it may not hurt the large combines which control the Atlantic cables, and the world's communicationsgenerally. There are thirteen cables across the Atlantic, eleven of which are lying idle, in order that the business of those controlling the cables may be conserved. They do not want cut rates to increase the business, because they make handsome dividends out of the present rates. ""Unless some co-operative movement is established with regard to the cable service, which will cover the Atlantic as well as the Pacific connexions, we cannot hope for a cheapened cable service, which would be a boon to the Empire. Means of communication and transit, particularly within the Empire, should be made as cheap as possible. When one considers that it is quite possible fo send a whole book-full of news across the Atlantic or the Pacific for about a shilling's worth of chemicals, one wonders why we are taxed to the present extent for our over-sea communications. Nothing could facilitate Empire unity or settlement in this country, provided that we had a land tax that would compel the opening up of the country for settlers, quicker than would cheapened cable communication. penny a word cable system is well within the range of possibility, and would have a material effect in cementing the Empire and developing Australia, because it would promote the transmission of that reliable information from Australia to the old world which would result in a considerable influx of desirable immigrants, as well as foster trade. The cable company is composed of excellent men in many cases, just as the shareholders in the Suez Canal are honourable men, whose right to levy toll on the Empire's commerce is legalized, ancl, therefore, beyond reproach on that ground, although the moral effect on the Empire is absolutely disastrous. The relationship of the cable companies to the Empire is on the same footing as the relationship of the Suez Canal Company to the Empire. The cable charges are an embargo on the communications of the Empire, just as the Suez Canal dues are an embargo on the trade of the Empire. These honourable and excellent men, who are allowed to sit upon the Empire's chest, should be given notice to quit. It only requires a Government strong enough, with sufficient moral courage and statesmanlike foresight to see the importance of these movements, to undertake the task and carry it out. I believe the public of Australia would rally round them to a man in cheapening the cable service with a view to fostering the [7i] spread of Empire intelligence and facilitating the Empire's business, and particularly in promoting immigration to Australia. They would rally round any Government that imposed a land tax which would pave the way for the reception of immigrants, and would provide the sinews of war for the heavy tasks we have before us, such as the establishment of a Commonwealth old age pensions fund, the taking over of the Northern Territory, defence, and the creation of the nucleus of a navy. The people would also heartily support the Government in any action taken with a view to lifting the embargo on traffic passing through the Suez Canal. - Mr CROUCH (Corio) [10.51] - I wish to know from the Minister if he will consent to the reporting of progress, seeing that the hour is late.",60

530,Mr CROUCH,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"Corio) [10.58] - I decline to make a speech at this late hour, although I wish to point out that I am the first Government supporter who has risen to speak on the Budget, and that the Treasurer has shown so little consideration for the time of the Committee that he has made no fewer than four speeches. It is unfortunate that I am not to be allowed to criticise the Budget. I think that if the House had had a chance to divide upon the Budget, and the financial proposals of the Government, without the added responsibility of supporting the motion of the right honourable member for East Sydney as one of want of confidence, there would have been a majority on the other side. I do not consider that the financial proposals are at all satisfactory. I think that they are very unsatisfactory, and I repeat that had not the motion of the right honourable member for East Sydney carried with it the responsibility of expressing a want of confidence, I should have been satisfied to support it. I object to this Budget altogether. I think that it is an extravagant and an outrageous Budget. There are three points of objection to it. It was bad, first, because it was reaid; secondly, because it was read badly; and, thirdly, because it was not worth reading. It is just as well to examine the Budget, and see what it means.",61
531,Mr TUDOR,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,This is from a loyal supporter !,62
532,Mr CROUCH,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"I am net going to be a "" loyal supporter"" of extravagance, and, it seems to me, of threatened deficits; because either it means that, or it means increased taxation at the end of twelve months, or a loan, unless the Government are prepared to abandon a large part of their financial proposals. I put the responsibility upon the Treasurer.",62
533,Mr FULLER,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,Why did the member vote against the motion of censure if he holds these views?,62
534,Mr CROUCH,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"Because it would have involved a change of Government. Except for that, I believe that the whole House would have denounced these financial proposals.",62
535,Mr FRAZER,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,Does the honourable member for Illawarra object to the honourable member for Corio criticising the Government ?,62
536,Mr FULLER,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,I do at this stage.,62
537,Mr CROUCH,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"I had no desire to vote for a general motion of censure. 1 did not want the Prime Minister, and some of his colleagues, to be removed from office. 1 think that the Prime Minister is the only leader whom this House would accept, and that it would be impossible to form a Government that would be at all stable from any other party or combination of parties in the House. Consequently, I think that the Government should continue in office. I wish to deal with one or two items in the Budget. Is there any doubt in the mind of any honourable member that it is an extravagant Budget, and that the expenditure has risen enormously ? When the items are dealt with in detail, I shall vote for large decreases where I think that extravagant advances have been made by the Treasurer. It is just as well that we should recognise at once the alternatives that we have to face. It appears to me that the Treasurer is deliberately working either for a land tax or for a loan. I do not desire to see either alternative realized. 1 will vote for decreases in every direction, if I can get other honourable members to vote with me. I will vote to restore many items on these Estimates to the same figure as that at which they stood last year.",62
538,Mr FULLER,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,If I were Treasurer I would tell the honourable member what I thought of him.,62
539,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,I can control myself a little better than that.,62
540,Mr CROUCH,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,The honourable member for Illawarra had better not loose the Treasurer's tongue.,62
541,Mr ARCHER,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,He might say things that he would afterwards be sorry for.,62
542,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"No , I should not be sorry for whatever I said.",62
543,Mr FULLER,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"No Minister with a proper sense of his position would submit to this sort of business. honourable Mr CROUCH - In the first place, I find that the Treasurer starts with making increases of Â£ i o o each to ""the heads of Departments. If honourable members will look at the Estimates for 1902, as submitted to this House, they will find that we started very moderately, and that permanent heads were paid salaries of Â£ 6 0 0 . Shortly afterwards the amount rose to Â£ 6 5 0 . Now, nearly every one of the permanent heads receives Â£ 8 0 0 , and it is proposed to increase the amount to Â£ 0 0 0 . These increases have gone up by Â£ 5 0 and Â£ 1 0 0 ; and, of course, if the permanent head of a Department secures an increase in his salary we cannot expect that subordinates will be satisfied unless they receive increases also.",62
544,Mr TUDOR,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,We wonder what increases will be proposed next year.,62
545,Mr CROUCH,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"Because there are three transferred Departments, the permanent heads of which received large salaries, the permanent heads of the other Departments desire to be paid equally large amounts. The three transferred Departments are those of Trade and Customs, Post and Telegraph, and Defence. The other Departments, the permanent heads of which are now to have their salaries increased, are those of the Attorney-General, Home Affairs, External Affairs, and the Treasury. They will all creep up if they can to some maximum; I do not know what it will be. I do not intend to refer to the permanent heads individually; they are all men of great ability. There is an important principle at stake, especially in view of the fact that we are trying to save money for the purposes of old-age pensions and that public works are being delayed throughout the country for lack of funds. There is another point to which I draw attention in connection with the financial proposals of the Treasurer. It seems to me to be a most serious one. The Treasurer, in order to laud his own administration, stated that although the ex-Treasurer, the right honourable member for Swan, had cut down estimates, he, the present Treasurer, took it as a matter for which he was entitled to honour, appreciation, and credit, that he had increased expenditure by hundreds of thousands of pounds for the Post and Telegraph Department alone. Every one of us knows, however, what a strong Treasurer is wanted for. He is expected to cut down estimates and to see that economy is exercised. It is his business to see that departmental demands instead of being supported, are decreased. He is there to sit on the Treasury chest and to defend the interests of the taxpayers as far as he can. But what do we find with this Treasurer? We actually find him taking credit to himself in this Budget speech for having increased expenditure. I regret that I have not all my papers available. I thought that I should have had fair play after listening to four speeches from the Treasurer, and should, at least have had a reasonable opportunity of expressing my own views. But I have to proceed without the notes which I have made. The Treasurer, as I have said, takes credit to himself for having increased estimates by hundreds of thousands of pounds, and attacks his old colleague, the ex-Treasurer, because he cut down estimates. I think, however, that the attitude [ 7 1 ] -* taken up by the right honourable member for Swan was the proper one for a Treasurer to assume. I regretted to hear the Committee generally cheering the Treasurer's statement. It seemed to me to be a very unsatisfactory state of things indeed.",63
546,Mr ARCHER,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,I think that the cheers came from the honourable member's side of the chamber.,63
547,Mr CROUCH,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"If the honourable member who interjects absolves himself from approval of the Treasurer's attitude, and says that he shares my view, I am glad to have him with me; though it seemed to me that the cheers came from all round the chamber. It is true that there have been demands for increased expenditure from the Post and Telegraph Department. But. we want a strong Treasurer who will resist such demands, and will take the proper responsibility for doing so. It is only by having such a Treasurer in charge of the finances that economical government can be satisfactorily carried on. I have marked down a few of the items on account of which expenditure will have to be met within the near future. There are defence, old-age pensions, bounties, lighthouses, immigration-involvin g Â£ 2 0 , 0 0 0 per annum - a new naval scheme, iron bounties, transcontinental railways, the Northern Territory, the Federal Capital, and the Agricultural Bureau. It is estimated that the Northern Territory will involve an expenditure of Â£3,000.000 , although we may not have to pay it all at once, and the Agricultural Bureau cannot be established without large expenditure. I saw the present situation coming. I saw that the Commonwealth was undoubtedly drifting towards a tight financial position, to meet which we should have to increase taxation or borrow.",63
548,Mr TILLEY BROWN,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,We told the country that a year ago.,63
549,Mr CROUCH,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,Indee d ! Did the honourable member say so ?,63
550,Mr TILLEY BROWN,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,Absolutel y we in this corner said so a year ago.,63
551,Mr CROUCH,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"If the honourable member for Indi had been a member of this Parliament three years ago he would have known that I said it then. He entered this House six years after Federation, and evidently does not know what he is talking about regarding the history of this Parliament. On the 27th Mav of this year a motion was carried, at my instance, directing the Treasurer to lay on the table 3 paper or return showing the expenditure for the coming year under the new proposals of the Government, but that paper is not yet forthcoming. I was stopped in the street by one of the clerks of the Treasury Department, and asked to inform him what the motion exactly covered, and then somebody came down from the Treasury to my office and asked for further particulars. I replied as far as my memory served me; but up to the present, as I have said, no return has come to hand. The facts show either that this Budget was prepared in ignorance or neglect of our actual requirements, or that the Treasurer has decided to suppress certain financial information which this Parliament ought to have.",63
552,Mr FISHER,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"That is a very serious charge, which, if proved, shows that the Government ought not to sit there.",64
553,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,The honourable member ought to consider who makes the charge.,64
554,Mr FISHER,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,The honourable member for Corio is a supporter of the Governhave ment.,64
555,Mr TUDOR,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,The honourable member for Corio is speaking of a motion which was carried by the House.,64
556,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,I am surprised at the honourable member for Wide Bay taking any notice of the charge !,64
557,Mr CROUCH,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"The motion is recorded in Hansard, and the charge is important to be left.",64
558,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"If made by any one else, yes.",64
559,Mr CROUCH,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"That does not matter; at any rate, the facts are as I have stated. .So far as I can gather, immigration, which means advertising the Commonwealth, is - estimated to cost Â£ 2 0 , 0 0 0 ; defence to cost an extra Â£ 6 3 5 , 0 0 0 ; old-age sions Â£1,100,000, or, according the Treasurer's amended .Â£1,225,000, and if , on the New South Wales basis, about .Â£2,100,000; lighthouses will cost about Â£ 4 0 , 0 0 0 ; bounties about Â£ 1 1 0 , 0 0 0 ; the Australian Â£ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 , and a similar sum next year; the iron bonus, Â£ 1 1 0 , 0 0 0 , or, according the reduced estimate, Â£ 3 0 , 0 0 0 thern Territory, Â£ 3 , 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 ; and a transcontinental railway, anything Â£7,000,0 0 0 to Â£10,000,000. have the Federal Capital, to cost we know not what; ancl an Agricultural Bureau at not less than Â£ 2 0 , 0 0 0 a year. The I moved on the 27th May was as f o l lows :That a return be laid on the table of the House showing[a) The expenditure by the Commonwealth on services and departments previously paid for by the States, showing the main details. (4) The estimated expenditure on Federal Old-age Pensions. (c) The estimated expenditure on services already approved by the Commonwealth Parliament or Government, including new Defence Scheme, payments under Bounties Bill , Immigration, and Northern Territory.",64
560,Mr ROBERTS,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,Was the motion carried?,64
561,Mr CROUCH,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"Yes , on 27th May, 1908, which, as honourable members will see, was only in the last session of Parliament. If at that time the Treasury Department did not know what these items were they certainly should have known what they would be when they made up the Budget speech with which we are now dealing. It is absurd for the Treasurer to submit a financial statement, which is the balance sheet of the Commonwealth on which we to work, without knowing what the expenditure .Is going to be.",64
562,Mr FULLER,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,Then does the honourable member believe that the financial proposals of the Government are satisfactory?,64
563,Mr CROUCH,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,I have already told the honourable member that I do not think they are.,64
564,Mr TILLEY BROWN,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,Is the honourable too member going to move in that direction?,64
565,Mr CROUCH,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"I wish to say that honourable members might bring about a better condition of things without the aid either of a loan or a land tax. Let me say here that I object strongly to the Treasurer continually advocating the imposition of a land tax. I was returned to this House as a follower of the Prime Minister, who at is .the last Federal elections stated distinctly penthat he did not favour a Federal land tax. to I was asked at many election meetings if estimate, I believed in such a tax. I told the electors that I did not, and I do not see any present necessity for it .",64
566,Mr FULLER,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"What is the Prime MinNavy, ister's opinion on the subject now?",64
567,Mr CROUCH,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,Onl y the other night to the Prime Minister stated that he did not ; the Norapprove of a Federal land tax.,64
568,Mr ARCHER,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"To be imposed during from this Parliament. Then we Mr CROUCH - The honourable gentleman did not bind himself as to the future. I say that twice since December, 1906, the motion date of the last Federal elections, the Treasurer has publicly advocated the imposition of a Federal .land tax. That is either very unfair to me and to the other supporters of the Government, or it is disloyal to the honourable gentleman's colleagues and to the Prime Minister.",64
569,Mr FULLER,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,Why not ' censure the Treasurer for it.,65
570,Mr CROUCH,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"I do not object to censuring the Treasurer, but I am not going to censure the Government. Mr TILLEY BROWN.^-The honourable member fires only blank cartridge. will not fight.",65
571,Mr CROUCH,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,I will not fight the present Government. I believe that the present Prime Minister is the only man who can lead this House.,65
572,Mr FULLER,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,He is the only man who will submit to be driven.,65
573,Mr CROUCH,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,I must answer the interjection of the honourable member for Indi. I believe that no one realizes the extent of the Prime Minister's self abnegation and self sacrifice in continuing in this Parliament at all. I have not the slightest doubt that the honourable gentleman continues to hold the position of leader of the Government simply because he recognises that the King's Government must be carried on in the Commonwealth. I believe that no other combination of parties in this House which honourable members could suggest could expect to constitute a stable Government.,65
574,Mr ARCHER,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,What stability have we now ?,65
575,Mr CROUCH,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"We have the fact that the present Administration cannot be removed, and that the Government of the Commonwealth is being'carried on, and has been carried on, since December, 1906. So long as the Prime Minister continues to lead the present Government and is able to secure a majority of twenty-two on a motion of no confidence the Government will continue to be carried on, and I shall continue to support the Prime Minister, as the only possible Prime Minister in the circumstances, and because I agree with his political platform. When the honourable gentleman makes a statement of policy at an election he adheres to that policy until when before the people again he considers it desirable to announce a departure from it.",65
576,Mr FULLER,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,And yet he submits to such a castigation as his Government is receiving from the honourable member and other honourable members to-night.,65
577,Mr CROUCH,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"After this little interlude, in which the voice of the chorus is by no means as charming as that of the soloist, and on which account I ask the chorus to cease for a minute or two, I may go back to the matter with which ^ I started. I think it was a very great mistake that the Treasurer should so frequently speak, and that the Prime Minister should permit the honourable gentleman to so frequently speak in favour of a Federal land tax. ' If I were the leader He of a Government I would lead it.",65
578,Mr FULLER,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"Hear , hear. That is what we have not seen in this Parliament for a long time. "" Mr CROUCH - If my Treasurer or other colleagues went around the country advocating a course inconsistent with my policy",65
579,Mr ROBERTS,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,Of f should go their heads.,65
580,Mr CROUCH,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"No , but they should be removed from their Departments, or comply with the policy I had announced to the people.",65
581,Mr FULLER,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,But what about the Labour Party. Have they not a say in the matter?,65
582,Mr ARCHER,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,The biggest quarrel we have with the Prime Minister is that he does not adopt the course suggested by the honourable member.,65
583,Mr CROUCH,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"I do not now propose to enter into a discussion of the merits or demerits of a land tax, whether imposed by the Commonwealth or by a State Government, but I wish to raise the question of the necessity for a Federal land tax. I wish honourable members to understand that our present financial difficulties can be only temporary. In 1910 we shall have control, not only of one-fourth, but of the whole of the revenue from Customs and Excise.",65
584,Mr TILLEY BROWN,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,The Government dare not take advantage of that.,65
585,Mr CROUCH,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"Thos e who desire the imposition of a land tax will then have to show that the Commonwealth Parliament will not be in a position to give effect to what it desires without becoming a taxing body, and so making itself distasteful to the whole of the people in order merely to supplement the revenues of the States. That is a position which we should not be asked to face. I dc not know whether the Treasurer is saying to himself, "" I am here now; God help the man who comes after me.""",65
586,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,No orable gentleman thinks that Providence will help him.,66
587,Mr CROUCH,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"I do not know whether the' Treasurer is taking up that attitude. If so, it is certainly very unfortunate. The honourable gentleman may be saying that he is able to bring about such a position of affairs as will render the imposition of a land tax a necessity in 1909. so, that is unfair to me and to other supporters of the Prime Minister. I am reminded by the situation of a story told me by the honourable member for Bourke, who will excuse my mention of his name, in view of the aptness of the story. The honourable gentleman told me of a friend of his who was a member of a lodge. This man's father had been sick for a very long time, and was drawing sick pay from the lodge funds. There were some signs that he was getting well again, and he overheard the wife say to the son, "" We shall have a real good holiday at Mount Macedon if father is only lucky enough to be sick for a little longer."" plication of the story is this, that it would appear that the Treasurer is thinking that if the Commonwealth will only be sick for a little longer lie will have a glorious opportunity for the imposition of a land tax. Such a consequence may follow from the course he is pursuing. I should not object to a land tax if it were absolutely necessary to enable us to pay our debts. I should, of course, favour any taxation rather than that the Commonwealth should not meet its obligations. Our public debts must be paid, and we would be face to face with the necessity of imposing a land tax or of floating a loan. I wish to avoid resort being had to either of those expedients by so reducing the Estimates that we may have something like reasonable economy. I certainly wish to put a stop to the extravagant increases in salaries for which the Treasurer has provided.",66
588,Mr ROBERTS,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"If the Ministry said that they would resign if an item were reduced, what attitude would the honourable member take up?",66
589,Mr CROUCH,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,"If the Government threatened to resign, I should vote for the Estimates being passed as they stood, considering that that would be the less of two evils.",66
590,Mr FULLER,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,I call attention to the state of the Committee.,66
591,Mr HUME COOK,DISTRIBUTION OF RIFLES AND MORRIS,After the honourable . the honmember has emptied the House.,66
