1,Mr THOMAS,BROKEN HILL MINING,Is the AttorneyAustralian workmen. General yet in a position to make a statement concerning the raid upon the offices of the Broken Hill Proprietary Com^ pany ?,5
2,Mr HUGHES,BROKEN HILL MINING,"B y leave of the the House, I desire to make the following statement:The investigation into the position the Broken Hill Company and other companies engaged in the metal industry has not disclosed any offence against law, but it IB, on the other hand, quite clear that a position of affairs exists quite incompatible with our attitude towards the vital interests at stake during the present war, the commercial and indusdestruction trial supremacy of the Empire, and the development of the resources of the Comsubmission. monwealth. Shortly stated, the facte show beyond all question that German capital and German influence exercise a monopoly of the base metal industry of the civilized world; that this monopoly - is for all tical purposes so complete as to exclude effective competition; that it covers the whole sphere of the industry, limiting output, controlling markets, determining the channels of distribution, and fixing prices; that the war, by closing most of the channels through which the metallic products were distributed and the markets in which they were disposed of has very seriously affected the industry, throwing large numbers of working men out of employment, causing great loss of wealth production, retarding the developof our great resources, and seriously menacing the welfare of the whole community; that peace holds out no prospects satisfactory or even tolerable to British and Australian interests, since it would but revive that complete domination of the industry by German influence, which insures the building up of German instead of British and Australian inNo patriotic citizen can contemplate such a prospect without the most serious misgivings. This war will have been in vain; the blood of our best and bravest citizens shed without purpose; the Empire will have endured the dreadful horrors of modern warfare to no purpose, if, at its conclusion, when victory tardily and at a dreadful cost bas been won, we are again compelled to pour into the lap of Germany the lion's share of the wealth created by Australian enterprise and Before the war, German capital and influence had created a splendidly organized system by which it was enabled to levy toll upon the world. The cream of profits arising out of the metal industry of the world-profit s upon a turnover which, at a rough estimate, cannot of fall short of £200,000,000-foun d its way through various channels to the pockets of the great German financiers, thus the strengthening Germany's position commercially, industrially, and nationally, enlarging the scope of her'operations-in other directions, and maintaining and perfecting that terrific instrument of by which she now seeks to batter all who dare withstand her, into It is a humiliating but irrefutable fact that Australian capital, enterprise, and labour have materially aided the enemy in this dreadful conflict. A few figures will clearly establish this position. The value of the metals, lead, praczinc, copper, and tin produced annually in Australia, estimated upon an average price for the year 1912, amounts to nearly £13,000,000, or, including silver and gold recovered in the extraction of these commoner metals, £15,000,000. Even upon a fair average price for the past ten years the gross value is not less than £13,000,000. All this wealth was produced in Australia, but-wit h the exception of gold and silver-the industry was and is controlled by German influence, so that output, destination, and price were matters in which Australia had no say whatever. The methods by which the industry was controlled are characteristic of the modern German spirit and enterprise. Everywhere agencies were established which assumed the cloak of the nationality in which they found themselves. America, for example, it was known as the American Metal Company; in Africa, the African Metal Company. A convention controlled by German influence fixed and fixes the price of lead. Lead can be sold only through a Genu ancontrolled agency. The British Government is compelled to buy through this agency, which dictates the price. Lead can only be bought through this agency, or with its approval, and at the price fixed by the convention, which is under the same control«as the agency. For all practical purposes, the agent is the convention. Zinc is controlled as to price, output, destination, and manufacture into spelter, the zinc of commerce, by a German combine of three firms-Beer Sondheimer, Metallgesellschaft, and Aaron Hirsch and Sohn. British firms cannot obtain supplies of concentrates for purposes of making spelter, because the Germans have control of the supplies, and have contracts with the mines in this country until 1920. Copper is controlled in much the same way, if not to the same extent. The same may be said of tin. Germany thus levies toll upon the whole industry; it holds its destinies in its hands. We produce the ores, but we do so to the extent the Germans determine, and must he content with the price they fix. They determine-in effect-the output of our mines and the manufacturing processes of the products of those mines in which we may engage. This is surely an intolerable position. Common sense, self-interest, and patriotism alike impel us to put an end to it. The inducements to do so are very considerable. No obstacles that cannot be removed stand in the way. The metallurgical treatment of lead, copper, and tin can be successfully accomplished within the Commonwealth with an expenditure of an amount of capital easily obtainable. The treatment of zinc involves a very large expenditure. It is hoped that British enterprise may be induced to take this latter in hand without delay. The basis of any successful undertakings of this nature here or in Great Britain mtist rest upon a market free from In the control of that German influence by which it is now dominated. British capital can hardly be expected to invest in an enterprise so gigantic without an assurance of an adequate supply of concentrates, and these cannot be obtained while the existing contracts still hold good. We are communicating with the British Government, setting forth the position, and strongly requesting their co-operation in these matters in which the interests of the Commonwealth are so vitally concerned. The present position in which the Australian and certain British companies are tied up by contracts with agencies dominated by German capital and influence may call for legislative action in Great Britain arid here. The success of any proposal to divert the control of the industry from German to British hands depends largely upon the co-operation of the Australian companies. If they prefer to be tied up by contracts which provide for resumption of business after the war, and if they prefer that the control of the industry shall rest with the alien enemy, the task before us will be rendered very difficult. We hope, however, for their cordial cooperation-w e have every reason to believe they are very ready to co-operateand we believe that, with the aid of the British Government and British enterprise, much wider avenues may be opened for British and Australian interests, and for the employment of British and Australian workmen. We ought no longer to play the part of building up the power and influence of a nation whose avowed intention is to humiliate and crush us.",5
3,Mr BRUCESMITH,BROKEN HILL MINING,"W it h regard to the very important statement read to the House by the Attorney-General, will the Prime Minister take into consideration the advisability of conferring with the British Government to ascertain whether the Commonwealth is not entitled to take possession of the whole of the German in terests in the mines, and establish an Australian trust to conduct the business in future ?",7
4,Mr FISHER,BROKEN HILL MINING,"The Government have already taken steps to communicate with His Majesty's Imperial Government on this important question, with a view to joint action by them and ourselves to safeguard our common interests and those of the Empire as a whole; but I would suggest that, in the meantime, notwithstanding our general policy, we should not plunge on this question until there has been a full and ample discussion between the Mother Country and ourselves. shall, however, be glad to communicate overseas the general desire of all parties in the House to co-operate in this matter. AUSTRALIAN NOTES.",7
5,Mr FLEMING,BROKEN HILL MINING,"Sectio n 10 of the Australian Notes Act provides that the Treasurer shall not pledge Australian notes or deposit them with any bank or person as security for money. Does not the Prime Minister think that the recent transaction whereby the Government obtained £10,000,000 in gold from the p r i vate banks in exchange for £10,000,000 worth of Commonwealth Bank notes, which are not to be presented for payment for twelve months, is a direct contravention of the section?",7

12,Mr JENSEN,BROKEN HILL MINING,"I shall obtain the necessary information from the Minister, and acquaint the honourable member. NORTHERN TERRITORY.",7
13,Mr SAMPSON,BROKEN HILL MINING,"The Administrator of the Northern Territory, in his last I official report, states that two prime essentials for the development of that part of Australia are means of communication by roads and railways, and water conservation, subterranean and surface. Will the Assistant Minister of External Affairs, or the Cabinet, take into consideration the advisability of sending an eminent engineer to report full y on the possibilities of water conservation and irrigation, covering the whole of the river system of the Territory, so that honourable members may have the facts before them, in view of a discussion of a general policy?",7
14,Mr MAHON,BROKEN HILL MINING,"The Government recognise the importance of the matter referred to. We are now considering the report of the Administrator, and due attention will be given to his recommendations. ' UNIFORMRAILWAY GAUGE.",7
15,Mr MATHEWS,BROKEN HILL MINING,"I understand that the the New South Wales Government, in connection with the uniform gauge question, are making experiments with a third rail. If the Commonwealth Government are connected with these experiments in any way, will they also take into consideration the advisability of a third wheel?",7
16,Mr FISHER,BROKEN HILL MINING,"At the last conference between the representatives of the Comrnonwealth and of the States regarding strategic and other defence railways, the matter referred to was discussed. The Commonwealth was invite'd by the representatives of New South Wales to witness experiments with a thir d rail, and I thank the honourable member for now affording me the opportunity to inform the House that the question of at h i r d wheel is also being considered.

18,Mr JENSEN,PARLIAMENTARY VISIT,"Yes ; I have made in - lation ? quiries from the Minister, who informs me that the article, as it appeared i newspaper, is, as regards himself, totally untrue. The Minister did not give any orders whatever; all he did was to ring up the Commandant, and state that three senators proposed to visit the camp. instructions were given that a march-past should take place in the presence of senators.",8

CUSTOMS REGULATION , NEWCASTLE.",8

24,Mr TUDOR,PARLIAMENTARY VISIT,"I am aware that a regulation, which is inoperative at other times, TO has been brought into force, pending any alteration of the Tariff, or in view of the that the Tariff is before Parliament. This regulation is necessary for the proregarding tection of the revenue.",8
25,Mr WATKINS,PARLIAMENTARY VISIT,I am referring to a transhipment regulation which has been of put into force previously in times of,8
26,Mr TUDOR,PARLIAMENTARY VISIT,All I know is that the regulation is one for the protection of the revenue under the circumstances I have,8
27,Sir JOHN FOKKEST,PARLIAMENTARY VISIT,What is the regu,8
28,Mr TUDOR,PARLIAMENTARY VISIT,It is the usual regulan the tion that has been put into force previously; the revenue must be safeguarded.,8
29,Mr WATKINS,PARLIAMENTARY VISIT,My question has no reference whatever to the protection of No the revenue. The revenue could be protected just as well under the old system the as under the present. Is it not a fact that the present regulation is so hampering business people that they are unable to carry on their affairs in the ordinary,8
30,Mr TUDOR,PARLIAMENTARY VISIT,"I have not the regulation with me here, but if the honourable member will put his question on the notice-paper I will let him have a reply stating exactly what the regulation is.

32,Mr FISHER,PARLIAMENTARY VISIT,"I shall have the schedule placed before honourable members pose. as soon as possible. NA CONCENTRATES. MY . FENTON - Has the Minister of Trade and Customs noticed a telegram the newspapers during the last day or two in reference to negotiations between what, I think, is called the Australian Zinc Corporation and others interested in similar industries in the United States, indicating that there is a likelihood Australian and other metals being there treated ? Has the Department of Trade and Customs any power to prevent a country like America carrying on operaTrade tions which may have the effect of preVictoria venting the establishment of industries in Australia?",9
33,Mr TUDOR,EXPORTATION OF ZINC,"I saw the cablegram, but I confess that I had not time to read it. The only power we have is the power ter? to rjrohibit the export of material; and we should be very reluctant to exercise it. If the industry referred to is a fitable one, I have no doubt that capital will be found to carry it on in Australia; and I am sure we should all be glad see such industries established here. A l could do, as I say, would be to either imto pose an export duty or prohibit export altogether. Such a step as the latter might be taken in time of war, would certainly be rather a strong step to take at any other time. NA CUSTOMS DEPARTMENT .",9
34,Mr JOSEPH COOK,INFORMATION FROM THE,"I desire to ask a question of the Minister of Trade and Customs, and it w i ll be necessary to preface that question by a few explanatory remarks. Last Friday I sent my secretary to the Customs Department to ask for certain information concerning the probable exports for the year. I was given to understand that the information would be obtained. When my secretary called for the information yesterday the head of the Department quite properly said that he would let me have the information when it had been seen by the Minister. To-day, when my secretary again called, he was informed that the Minister regretted that he could not supply the information. I should like the Minister to explain why I cannot have the information. I want it for no party pur",9

41,Mr TUDOR,DUTY ON CORNSACKS AND ALES AND,"I cannot answer the question from memory, but I will look the matter up. If any application was made, I will certainly lay it on the table. I do not think that any duty on cornsacks is proposed, but we do provide for a preference on cornsacks made in the Mother Country.",9
42,Mr RICHARDPOSTER,DUTY ON CORNSACKS AND ALES AND,"Seeing that the proposed duty on cornsacks is estimated to yield more than £100,000, will the Minister in for m the House if Calcutta will come within the preference given to the United Kingdom?",9
43,Mr TUDOR,DUTY ON CORNSACKS AND ALES AND,"Calcutt a will not come within the definition of the United K in gdom, but Dundee, where I understand jute is manufactured, is in the United Kingdom.",10
44,Mr MASSYGREENE,DUTY ON CORNSACKS AND ALES AND,"Is it a fact that the Attorney-General asked Mr John Talbot to inform the Government what duty could be safely charged on beer and spirits? If so, why was it necessary to go outside the officers of the Department? Does the Attorney-General think that this course is the best method to adopt in order to protect the revenue?",10
45,Mr HUGHES,DUTY ON CORNSACKS AND ALES AND,"I have certainly written to Mr Talbot, in reply to letters he sent to me, and it may be that I have sent a letter that could be construed into a request for information, but I am not prepared to say that any letter of mine could be so considered. I can give the assurance that the information supplied by Mr Talbot was volunteered and very voluminous, and, in the usual way, I sent it along to the Prime Minister and the Minister of Trade and Customs. I know nothing of the matter beyond that.",10
46,Mr GROOM,DUTY ON CORNSACKS AND ALES AND,"When the Minister of Trade and Customs was previously in office it was his rule, in connection with all applications for Tariff relief, not to give any relief until he had in his possession signed declarations giving information as to the number of hands employed, the value of the machinery industry, machinery profits, and so forth .

49,Mr TUDOR,DUTY ON CORNSACKS AND ALES AND,I have noticed the action proposed to be taken in New South Wales. I have not noticed that a similar action is proposed in Victoria ; I hope that it will be taken.,10
50,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,DUTY ON CORNSACKS AND ALES AND,"Has the Minister of Trade and Customs received any recommendations from the Inter-State Commission as a result of the Tariff inquiry, and, if not, when does he expect to receive a report?",10
51,Mr TUDOR,DUTY ON CORNSACKS AND ALES AND,"I have not received any report from the Inter-State Commission. In common with other honourable members, I suppose, all I know has been gleaned from the daily newspapers, which inform us that the Inter-State Commission has finished taking evidence nn Tariff matters. I presume that that evidence will soon be made available; but I have no knowledge of any recommendations. DARWINBOARD OF HEALTH .",10

53,Mr MAHON,DUTY ON CORNSACKS AND ALES AND,"The Board of Health at Port Darwin has been abolished mainly because it would not perform the duties for which it existed.

In view of that statement, and in view also of the facts that I brought under the Minister's notice on Friday in regard to> the instructions to the Victorian Commissioners of Railways to prevent wheat going from Victoria into South Australia, will be Minister ascertion tain the powers of the Commonwealth with regard to these common carriers?

(b) The estimated revenue to be derived therefrom?",16
134,Mr MAHON,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO," The answer to the honourable member's quest i o n is as f o l l o w s: It is only in the case of certain classes of estimates, whore it is considered sufficient information for the preliminary quotation is already in possession of the Department, that the inspection of proposed routes is dispensed with. The basis of the estimate in these cases is the accumulated data as to the costs of construction of different classes of line, and the probable revenue to be derived, which is held by the Department's officers. This new procedure has the twofold advantage of enabling preliminary quotations to be given to applicants with a minimum of delay, and of effecting economies in administration in the case of a large number of cases for which working estimates have in the past been prepared, but where the proposal has not been further proceeded with.

It was Sir Edmund Barton who drew attention to the matter in Committee of Ways and Means; and there was a ruling, or rather a direction, given by consent by the Chairman the debate could be taken in of Ways and Means, and that every matter in the Budget, and every separate fiscal proposal of the Government, ferred to.

156,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Parramatta) [3.40] - We begin the discussion of the Budget this year under circumstances that that. are quite abnormal, including the time of year at which it is introduced. I , for one, have no intention to open up a wide field of debate. I should imagine that, surplus, thanks to the money we left him having regard to the fact that our proThe ceedings are to be wound up on Tuesday or Wednesday next, the discussion on the Budget will be of limited duration. However, something needs to be said, and ife is my duty to refer to some of the aspects, of the Budget brought prominently before-, us and the country by the Prime Minister. One expects the Prime Minister in these years to begin all his discussions of finance with a reference to that blessed word "" surplus,"" and on the present ocBudget has casion we are not disappointed. In his very first sentence he solemnly calls the world to witness that on such-and-such a date in the year 1912-13 there was an audited cash surplus available for expendiis only a ture. That forms the subject of a distinct paragraph in his speech. What follows does not necessarily relate to the surplus, and we can only, imagine that the Prime Minister, true to the instincts of himself and the party behind him, seeks at to impress the country once more with his wonderful financing which gave him the Australia surplus of £2,643,000. There is no mention made by the Prime Minister of the wonderful inheritance which he received from those who went before him. He says nothing when speakthat ing of the riches with which his "" rich Committee Liberal uncle "" filled his coffers to overflowing.  could be rethe deficit?",18
157,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"The deficit of £450,000 had been increased to £1,100,000 in the same year, and ill of it liquidated of out of the rolling millions the Liberals left him for that purpose. One is apt to imagine, when rolling in wealth inherited somebody else, that it is the result of one's own merit, and, accordingly, the Prime Minister and his party plume themselves on their wonderful financial management. They never once refer to the we fact that the whole financial dispositions the rewere due to the arrangements made by previous Liberal Governments, who gave the Government the inheritance that they have tried their best to dissipate at the very earliest moment. In three years the Government increased the expenditure of the country by over 100 per cent.; but the Prime Minister tells us nothing about",18

159,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Stil l he has a. v blessed word "" Mesopotamia "" is not. in it with the word "" s u r p l u s , "" no. other word is in it except, perhaps, the word ""referendum."" The Government remind us of that large number of people who have come down in the world; and, perhaps, the Prime Minister's intention, after all, is to show how, from the affluence of a year or two ago, he has reached the condition of being financially out at elbow. It may be his way of pointing out that the Government have now reached an unenviable position, i u which every stratagem must be resorted to to make the Budget balance and to present the accounts in a way that they may be readable at all. This position is not wholly the Prime Minister's fault, and I am not blaming him ; I merely wish to say that it is time the word "" surplus"" was less on his tongue. I hope we shall hear less of the word from his party, for whatever advantage they may have gained by its use-and they have gained much in former times-the y are now down in the financial world, and "" m a k in g heavy weather."" Notwithstanding the surplus and the Ministry. wonderful financial ability which we are told is possessed by honourable members opposite, the present case is a desperate one, indeed. I am not now speaking of calamitous consequences of the war. what I have to say I shall confine myself to a review of events as they relate to the ordinary current expenditure of the Commonwealth. Prom that point view, I say, the case is most desperate, and needs attention at the earliest possible unoment. What are the facts ? Notwithobligations standing the surplus, and all the extra taxation which has been mounting up, - the Treasurer today has to drag in the - savings of former years, to resort to ther all-round taxation, and to begin to borrow, in order to square his ledger, far as the ordinary business of the year concerned.  be avoided ?",18
160,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"I candidly think it could-in a large measure, at the tax. on beer? any rate. I cannot help feeling that this is a most unfortunate time to he imposing all this heavy taxation. Consider first the land tax, notice can of which has just been given by the right honourable gentleman. Jt is a fact, made due note of by the right honourable ber for Swan, that the people who are being h it hardest at this time are the large shoals. people who are faring worse, the people who are suffering most from drought and other adverse natural conditions. That is a fact we may note, apart altogether from party views and feelings. Then there is the new probate duty, and the way in which that imposition appeals to me is this: we have men trooping away to the war to fight for us, and while they are absent from the country, notwithstanding all the risk they are taking, we are making it a little b it harder for their wives and families in the event of anything happening to the bread-winners. It is most unfortunate and inopportune that these taxes ""should be imposed in the particular way in which they are being imposed. I shall say nothing today in regard to the general taxation per medium of the Tariff and Excise. That will come in for discussion later on, and, I have no doubt, will receive adequate treatment at the hands of honourable members on this side who have been studying these schedules, and all the wonderful doings of this most wonderful I will only say, in passing, after a cursory perusal of these schedules, that it seems to me that the righ t honourable gentleman would have done better the to have waited until he had received the In report of the Inter-State Commission rather than present this thing of shreds and patches - this complete botch of a Tariff, as even his best friends outside, of who clamoured loudest for Tariff revision, are beginning to see already. But the Government had to fulfil their to certain interests and individuals from whom they gained large support in the recent election. I do not blame them for carrying out their election furpledges, but I do think they should have gone about the matter in a sensible, reaso sonable, and business-like way.

163,Mr HIGGS,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,It seems to connote brains.,20
164,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"It connotes something else than brains. I am drawing attention to the way i u which taxation in Australia is towering up, particularly in those spheres where Labour men do congregate. I have in my hands a statement of what has been done in some of the other States under the segis of Labour government. In Tasmania, for instance, the Government are withholding all increments from officers in the Government service who are receiving over £200 per year. In the Federal sphere we are increasing them. Then they are graduating the tax upon the unearned increment of land, and increasing the amount obtainable from that source. They are putting the screw on the income tax a little more, and by that means hope to get £14,000 extra. In regard to the taxation of deceased persons' estates, there is a duplication of what the Federal Government are doing. They are taxing all tickets for public amusements and entertainments, and so getting a little more fro m that source. They are increasing the stamp duties, and the taxes on motor vehicles and such-like things. It seems to me that in Tasmania there has been an all-round endeavour to get a little more revenue somewhere or other. We are following after them with the same kind of imposition, and just where this double taxation is going to cease I do not know. It is becoming a very serious problem in Australia as to how far this doublebanking is to proceed.",20
165,Mr BURNS,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,You want Unification.,20
166,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Lo t the honourable member tell the people that he is a Unificationist, and be plain about it . The leader of the honourable member's party is constantly condemning Unification and saying that he is not a Unificationist.",20
167,Mr BURNS,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,I say that the honourable member wants Unification.,20
168,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"I do not, but I want a little common sense and business management, and I may add that I should not go to the honourable member's quarter for those qualities. t [57]_2 In my own State of New South Wales the Liberal Government are resolving their difficulties by imposing a supertax on the income tax, which they increased only a few months ago. There is also an additional tax on motor cars. We are told that all this taxation in New South Wales is temporary, although how the war has h it the Government in that State I do not pretend to know. I rather see the way in which they are throwing money about tth order to popularize themselves in thevarious electorates, and so make their owncalling and election sure- a praiseworthyobjective, no doubt, within certain limits, but when you have to tax people in a* period of stress and strain like the present, it is time to draw the line. I shall not go into the details of what the Government in. Western Australia are doing, but there they are putting on the same kind of taxation as the Government arc proposing here in such large and generous measure. I desire to refer to the Budget statement of the Prime Minister for a few minutes, in order to make apparent exactly what we are doing in the Commonwealth. The right honourable gentleman dealt with a period of three years-hi s last year in office, the year in which the Liberal Government were in power, and the present year-and he began at the point where his precious surplus was in the Labour party's safe and secure possession. I call attention first to the curious way in which the right honourable gentleman set out his figures when stating the anticipated revenue for this yearJ estimate that the total revenue for the current financial year 1014-15, inclusive of the surplus balance of £1,222,401, will amount to £24,495,401. "" I estimate this to be the revenue for the year."" Not one word is mentioned of the extra taxation involved in the make-up of this revenue. He told us of the extra taxation in another part of his speech some time later, and the impression will be created outside, particularly amongst the honourable gentleman's own followers, that these taxes do not go to make up this revenue, which is therefore deficient by the amount of such taxes. The honourable member adds the taxes first, and then says, "" I estimate that the revenue will be so much,"" without saying a word about the taxes which are included in the estimate. I submit that that is a very tricky way of stating the figures; and, whether there be a political purpose or not in that method, the fact remains that it is not a fair way of setting out the revenue. What would have been a fair way would' be to say: "" I estimate the revenue for the year at £21,695,401, and I propose to augment that amount by £1,000,000 from land taxation, £1,000,000 from probate duties, and £800,000 from further fiscal taxation, and by issuing Treasury-bills for £1,346,000."" Instead of doing that, the right honourable gentleman said, "" I estimate that the revenue will be £24,000,000, the estimated expenditure is £25,841,000, and, therefore, the estimated deficit will amount to £1,346,000."" As a matter of fact, there is a deficiency on this year's income and ordinary expenditure of £4,000,000 odd. That is a fact I desire to get before the country; a fact that the right honourable gentleman seems to be studiously covering up-the difference between the income of the year on the old basis and the expenditure for the year is over £4,000,000 sterling.",20
169,Mr AKCHIBALD,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"There is no covering up, when the Prime Minister refers to the taxation to meet the deficiency.",21
170,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Bu the did not refer to the taxation u n t i l a long time later on in the speech. That is the complaint I am making. When he referred to the revenue was the time, surely, to have mentioned the taxation proposals. But not a word of them was mentioned at that stage. The right honourable gentleman assumed the taxes at this point, and gave the House the total figures-"" I estimate the income for the year at so much, the outgoing at so much, and the deficiency at £1,346,000."" People outside, when reading that statement, would naturally come to the conclusion that that is the whole of the deficit on the year's operations.  thing like that surplus which your Treasurer claimed.",21
171,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Neve r mind what we did. I am discussing now the Budget of the right honourable the Prime Minister. Whatever the right honourable member for Swan did was candid and straightforward, and he would never have dreamed of stating the revenue of the year at what was to be the revenue after the imposition of taxation not yet authorized or collected. There is no statutory authority for such taxation so far , and I complain of this tricky way of presenting 0 the Estimates of revenue for the year. Here are the facts: Last year the revenue was £21,740,000. This year's expenditure is estimated to be £25,841,000, a difference between last year's revenue and this year's estimated expenditure of £4,101,000. The right honourable gentleman has been very fortunate this year in regard to a number of items which we had to pay last year, but from which he is absolved this year. For instance, last year we had to pay £149,244 for sugar bounties, and £41,310 for other bounties. The Science Congress cost about £15,000 extra. Advertising in connection with the London Office amounted to £36,979; but that expenditure has been completely wiped out this year. The righ t honourable gentleman gets credit for these amounts, which total £241,000, and if , in order to make a fair comparison between last year and this year, we add that £241,000 to the £4,101,000, the right honourable gentleman is short of his expenditure by £4,342,000.",21
172,Mr MAHON,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Are you not twisting figures?,21
173,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"I am not twisting figures. I am making a plain statement, though a very different one, I admit, to that made by the Treasurer. My point is that, taking as a basis of comparison the revenue of last year and the estimated revenue of this year, the Treasurer is not financing the year's ordinary expenditure by a sum considerably over £4,000,000. Else, why does he bring in these new taxes-the land tax, probate duties, and additional fiscal taxation amounting to £2,800,000-and then, on top of that, need Treasury-bills for £1,346,000, giving a total of £4,146,000 extra to be got somewhere in order to finance the ordinary expenditure of the year ? The war has little to do with this kind of thing. The Minister of Trade and Customs says that the total effect of the war upon the Treasurer's estimated income is £1,500,000.  terfere with the returns through the Customs House?",21
174,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"That is precisely what I am saying. In order to liquidate through the Customs the deficit, which the Minister informs us is £1,500,000, extra impositions to the extent of £4,000,000 are to he placed upon the people. Clearly, therefore, had there been no war and no drought, the Treasurer would still have had to resort to this further heavy taxation in order to square his ledger for the year. This new taxation is not war taxation. My friends on the other side will tell the people that it is all due to the war; but, happily, the war expenditure is all earmarked and set down in the Budget, and the way in which it has affected our revenue has been definitely expressed in figures by the Minister of Trade and Customs. Clearly, therefore, the ordinary income and expenditure of the year, quite apart from the influence of the war and the drought, necessitate all this heavy taxation announced by the Treasurer.",22
175,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Tw o months after we came into office, I suppose, things commenced to go wrong.",22
176,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Her e is a different tune. We came into office right at the end of a financial year, a little over a year ago, but, nevertheless, the right honourable gentleman took good care to saddle us with the whole of the responsibility for the year; yet now, after being in office all these months, he is trying to get r i d of the responsibility for the financial position this year. He changes his tune as he steps from one side of the chamber to the other. Although we came in at the end of a financial year, the right honourable gentleman and his colleague, the Attorney-General, went all over the country denouncing our finances to some purpose; they piled up the millions and set them rolling in fine style, and got all they could out of them. I do not blame them ; but what are the facts? Last year the Liberal Government spont £1,636,000 more than in the previous financial year, but this year, for the ordinary purposes of government, not for the purposes of the war, and not to meet any falling off in Customs revenue, the present Treasurer proposes to spend £2,680,000 more than was spent last year. If the Liberal Government were extravagantly financing last year, the present Treasurer must be having a high old carnival this year, so far as the ordinary expenditure of the year is concerned. Making a comparison between the two years, putting them both on the same basis, and bringing in the £241,000 which the Liberal Government had to pay last year, and which the present Treasurer is exempted from paying this year, and adding the £2,680,000, there is a difference of nearly £3,000,000 between the financing of the two years in regard to ordinary expenditure.",22
177,Mr WEST,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,It is a good thing that we have the money to spend.,22
178,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"The trouble is that you have not got it ; you are going to your money lender for it ; you are going to raise Treasury-bills to the extent of £1,346,000 in order to liquidate your deficit this year. Taking the total figures of the Budget, the Treasurer needs to borrow £10,500,000 during this year for the purpose of war expenditure, and he proposes to aid his revenue by a sum of considerably over £4,000,000. In other words, if we take the full extent of his proposals, he is to borrow £18,000,000 and to tax the people to the extent of £5,000,000 in a full year.",22
179,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"The righ t honourable gentleman should not l i m it the year's war expenditure to £10,500,000.",22
180,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"I am not doing so. It is £11,700,000, but I am giving the Treasurer credit for the extent to which he is aiding his war expenditure from the Treasury-bills:",22
181,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"The deficit is £1,346,000.",22
182,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"But the Treasurer is aiding his revenue by extra taxation. He proposes to bring as an aid to his revenue-lan d tax £1,000,000, probate duties £1,000,000, and fresh Fiscal taxation £800,000, which gives a total of £2,800,000; and then he has a deficit of £1,346,000 which he proposes to liquidate by means of Treasury-bills. The Treasury-bills amount to £2,588,000, but I am only taking £1,346,000, the actual amount of the deficit, to aid the revenue. The total amount of the war obligation is £18,000,000, and the extra taxation is £5,500,000.",22
183,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Par t of the Treasury bills will go towards making up the difference between £10,500,000 and the actual amount of the war expenditure. Mr JOSE PH COOK - I am giving you credit for that.",22
184,Mr WATT,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"How do you arrive at the figures of £5,500,000 as extra taxation?",22
185,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"There is to be - £1,000,000 from the land tax, and - we are to have £1,000,000 from probate duties for the half year and double for a full year.",23
186,Mr FISHEK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,I am afraid that we cannot get that amount for the whole of this year.,23
187,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"If the Treasurer anticipates £1,000,000 from probate duties for the half-year, what amount will he expect in a normal year?",23
188,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"We hoped to get eight months, in estimating the revenue at £1,000,000 .",23
189,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Mr MCKay, the Commissioner of Taxation, in a statement he made public the other day, said that from the increment of the laud tax alone he expected to get £700,000 or £800,000 for the balance of the year, irrespective of leasehold taxation. I cannot be told that ho is to get only £200,000 a year from the taxation of holders of leases. I should estimate that from this source he would get at least the balance of £2,000,000. Therefore, I think that my estimate of about £5,500,000 extra taxation per annum will be near the mark. This is to be imposed in a full year. Taxation is towering up in Australia. The increase proposed by the Treasurer means about £ 1 2s. 6d. per head of the population on the basis I have named, and in New South Wales Mr Holman has imposed another 12s. 6d. per head for the year. As New South Wales contains 38 per cent, of the population of Australia, I can take it as an example of the effect of this new kind of financing we are getting. W it h 12s. 6d. per head imposed by the State, and 22s. 6d. per head imposed by the Federal Treasurer in one f e l l swoop, this additional taxation will come out at about £8 15s. per family in New South Wales, and I venture to say that the figure will come out about the same in the other two Labour States. If Mr Scaddan had had his way in Western Australia, the additional i m post would be much more, and, in relation to her population, Tasmania would not be very far behind. All this taxation will be passed on. There can be no mistake about that. All experience proves the absolute impossibility of making watertight compartments in regard to . taxation. Taxes filter through and down to the man who works for his daily living, and who has to bear the brunt of it .",23
190,Mr ARCHIBALD,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Will probate duties filter down?,23
191,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Eve n the effect of probate can be filtered down to a certain extent. Are these taxes to be temporary or permanent?,23
192,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Parliamen t alone can determine that.,23
193,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,But the Treasurer is the responsible financier. What does he propose to Parliament?,23
194,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"So far as I am concerned, these taxes have no limitation, because I cannot see the end of the expenditure.",23
195,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Then are they to he made permanent on the statute book?,23
196,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,I cannot see the end of the expenditure that these taxes are to meet.,23
197,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Will the right honourable gentleman answer a plain question? Will he say what is in his mind regarding this extra land taxation and these probate duties? Has he any intention of taking them off under any circumstances?,23
198,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,I am not in a position to bind Parliament in any way.,23
199,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,The right honourable gentleman is in a position to bind the action of his Government.,23
200,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Thes e are taxes to provide for the proper carrying on of the King's government.,23
201,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"That is a perfectly obvious statement. I ask the right honourable gentleman whether he proposes that this extra taxation shall remain permanently on the statute-book, or does he propose to remove it when the war, with its resulting trouble, is over ? There is no answer to that inquiry. We have, therefore, the clear, inescapable position",23
202,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,The clear answer is that while I hold office as Treasurer I shall try to provide the revenue to properly carry on the government of the country.,23
203,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,The honourable member could not remain in office if he did not.,23
204,Mr GROOM,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,There is no virtue in that.,23
205,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Non e at all. Such a statement is a mere commonplace. When Lloyd Gteorge came down with his increased taxation he told the people that it would be taken off when the war was over. Could not the right honourable gentleman make a similar statement here? Could he not tell us what is his attitude regarding this taxation and the war ? There are certain well-known war appropriations which have to be resorted to in every civilized country. Great Britain, for instance, always resorts to an increased income tax, and other taxation of the kind, but there is always given to Parliament a distinct intimation that such taxation is for war purposes only, and the anticipation of relief is' always well founded. The relief, indeed, invariably takes place. I ask the right honourable gentleman if that is to be so in connection with these taxes?",23
206,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Thes e taxes do not provide for the liquidation of the war debt.,24
207,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"That is a sufficient answer. The right gentleman tells us that these taxes have nothing to do with the liquidation of war liabilities. We are, therefore, to assume that they are for the purpose of liquidating his ordinary liabilities-liabilitie s curred in carrying on the ordinary services of the Government for the year.",24
208,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,They carry that on their face.,24
209,Mr WATT,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,That is a declaration of their permanency.,24
210,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"The statement is clear enough. We are imposing additional taxation on the people to the tune of nearly £3,000,000 in respect of the rest of the financial year, and probably to the extent of £5,500,000 for the whole of next year for the purpose of carrying on the ordinary government of the country.",24
211,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Is that more than the right honourable gentleman anticipated ?,24
212,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,A great deal more.,24
213,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Does the right honourable member say he really believed that it would not be required ?,24
214,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"I hot only lieved it , but I told the people that we saw our way to getting through with little or no more taxation. We have only to study the Estimates to see that a great deal could be done to avoid the additional taxation now being imposed on the people. Is it not time to ask, in this National Parliament, where economical management comes in ? Is it an affront to my honourable friends opposite to ask if they propose to begin to exercise a little economy in , for instance, the Postal Department? The Treasurer tells us that these are the Estimates as presented to him-that he did not interfere with them in any way.",24
215,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,I did not say that.,24
216,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,The right honourable gentleman practically told us so.,24
217,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,I did not.,24
218,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Then we are to take it that the right honourable gentleman cut down the Estimates. Let us see how he has cut down the Estimates of the two great spending Departments of Australia. I shall deal first of all with the ordinary expenditure of the Defence Department-expenditur e in no wise connected with the war. Let it be distinctly honourable understood that I am speaking all through of the ordinary expenditure of the Department, the war expenditure being specially provided for by an additional sum chargeable to Loan Account. in - I find that the ordinary expenditure of the Defence Department this year is to be increased to the extent of £1,802,000.  right honourable member blamed us for not spending sufficient on the Department.",24
219,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,I am not aware of having made any such statement. Twelve months ago I told my honourable friends I thought they were not getting value for the money expended in the Defence Department. I still hold that view.,24
220,Mr MAHOTT,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Why did not the r i g ht honourable member's Government cut down?,24
221,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,The honourable gentleman knows that we did all that we could; that we went as far as we could go. We provided the present Government with the machinery to ascertain what be- goes on iiT the Department.,24
222,Mr MAHOIT,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,The right honourable gentleman's Government cut dowm the equipment.,24
223,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"We know all about that allegation. I think, by the way, that the honourable gentleman supported the motion submitted last year by the honourable member for Capricornia, in which he demanded that we should reduce by £500,000 the expenditure on the Defence Department. He was here, but no vote was taken.",24
224,Mr MAHON,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,The right honourable member is romancing as usual.,25
225,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"The honourable gentleman sat here supporting the honourable member for Capricornia. Not one word fell from his lips as to anything being wrong with the Defence Department, except that too much - had been spent upon it . He now says that we ought not to have cut down this expenditure.",25
226,Mr MAHON,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Not h in g of the kind.,25
227,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"What we did do, did not interfere in the least with the effectiveness of the Department, and we certainly saved a considerable sum.",25
228,Mr MAHON,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,As k some of the men who are at the front what they think of the equipment provided by the late Government ?,25
229,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,I readily admit that it is the general opinion of the permanent officers that they never had so much money to fly round with as when Senator Pearce was at the head of the Department. It is by no means a popular move to try to circumscribe the range and scope of the Department's expenditure.,25
230,Mr FENTON,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,It will have to be done.,25
231,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,The honourable member told us plainly from the Opposi. tion back benches last year that we must cut down our Defence expenditure.,25
232,Mr FENTON,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,And the late Government did so.,25
233,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Her e is the present Government putting it up again. They are actually increasing the ordinary expenditure of the Department this year by no less than £1,802,000. Is the honourable member going to help to reduce that expenditure, or is he going to remain dumb on this occasion)",25
234,Mr FENTON,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,I shall not be dumb.,25
235,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"We hear nothing from the honourable member this year as to the necessity for cutting down the ordinary expenditure of the Defence Department. He and all his colleagues will remain silent-lik e Jeremiah dumb dogs. I call attention to the fact that the ordinary Defence expenditure this year is 38 per cent, more than last year. In other words, there is an expenditure of £1 6s. 3d. per head in respect of ordinary services, having nothing whatever to do with the war. Last year we spent 19s. 6d. per head all told; this year there is to be an increase of 6s. 9d. per head, or a total Defence expenditure of £ 1 6s. 3d. per head on ordinary services. I hope that the Public Accounts Committee will get to work speedily and see if this expenditure is really necessary. If they find it to be absolutely necessary in order to maintain an effective organization, then no one on this side of the House will c r it i cise it . But we ought to know the facts. We ought to know whether we are getting 20s. in value for every sovereign that we spend in the Department. We ought to know that the monev is being well spent. We do not begrudge a liberal Defence expenditure, as long as we know that there is corresponding efficiency. What are we obtaining just now for our expenditure? The Minister told us the other day that altogether we were sending 42,000 men to the war-that 20,000 had already gone, that 13,000 were to go this month, and that during the next six months 9,000 were to be sent, but only as reinforcements. The effectives that we propose to maintain on the battlefield, therefore, number only 33,000. If these represent the total proposals of the present Government, I do not think them adequate. I hope the Government will reconsider this matter. The war is for us a l if e and death struggle, and having regard to the purpose that we should have in view-the extinction of the enemy at the earliest possible moment-to say that we are going to maintain only 33,000 soldiers on the battlefield is to make an entirely inadequate proposal. We are under an obligation to do more, and I shall be much surprised if Australia does not expect us to do more. I hope that this statement by the Minister does not represent the final judgment of the Government on what is undoubtedly the greatest war in the history of the world. We must have more than 33,000 men on the battlefield. . It is idle to talk about giving our last man and our last shilling if this is all that is to be done. Our last man and our last shilling, if left in Australia, will bring the battle over yonder no nearer a conclusion. We must, if necessary, send our last man and our last shilling over there, where the fighting has to be done. If the proposal represents what the Prime Minister meant when he spoke of our last man and our last shilling being at the disposal of the I m perial Government, I venture to submit, with great respect, that it is time he revised his opinions of this war and of its range and scale. I come now to the Postal Department, another huge spending service, and I do not hesitate to say that it must soon be tackled seriously. It is a perfect sink of money, and something must be done to place it upon a business footing. It is not so at present. The estimated increase in the revenue of the Postal Department for the year is a trifle over £60,000, whereas the estimated expenditure is £546,000 more than was expended last year. These figures are exclusive of loan expenditure. I find that the ordinary expenditure of the Department this year is to be £6,845,000, while its income is put down at £4,604,000, or a deficiency of £2,241,000. If we add to that the loan expenditure of £459,000 we have a total expenditure of £2,700,000 more than we shall get out of the Department this year. In other words, leaving loan expenditure out of consideration, the ordinary expenditure for the year is to be £2,241,000 more than is earned by the Department. ""We are to receive practically no more revenue, whereas the expenditure is being increased by 8£ per cent. If this kind of thing is to go on, the Department will be waterlogged and bankrupt financially. It really is so at the present moment, and I suggest to the Treasurer that he directs his attention to it .",25
236,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,I have.,26
237,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"I say delibermuddle. ately, after consideration of the whole of the circumstances, that there to be saved in connection with the Department. The question must be grapthe pled with. We must not be content talk ; something must be done, and done at once in this Department, which using up money which ought to go to the ordinary purposes of governworse ment. There is another fact in connot nexion with the Postal Department which I should like to call attention. According to the Budget papers expenditure of the Department has in creased in inverse ratio to its income. 1910 we paid an average salary of £124 per official, and earned an averagerevenue of £265 per official. This year we are paying an average salary of £ 1 4 0 and earning an average of £ 2 1 3 per official. Whereas in 1910 an income of £140 was earned in excess of each salary paid, this year the excess will be only £73.",26
238,Mr WATT,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,It has fallen one-half.,26
239,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Yes . Each official represents a departmental earning power only half as great as that of four years ago. The position may be stated in another way. Whereas in 1902-3 it required a salary expenditure of £ 5 1 to earn £100 of revenue, in 1909-10 that amount of revenue was earned with a salary expenditure of £ 4 7 , and in 1914-15 there must be a salary expenditure of £ 6 5 to earn it .",26
240,Mr WEST,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,In those days the postal officials were very badly paid.,26
241,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"I do not desire that our officials should be paid badly. I wish them to have the utmost farthing that we can afford to give them; but the position disclosed by the Budget papers shows an utter and absolute want of effective management in the Postal Department. I urge the Treasurer to take the matter in hand and to grapple with the difficulty confronting us. In my judgment he will not achieve anything so long as the present system of control is continued. I u this matter he should listen to the voice of the honourable member for Gwydir. We require business men to control the Department independently of Parliament, so that the administration may be in accordance with business methods. Every year the situation becomes worse, and our efforts to remedy it only increase the",26
242,Mr SHARPE,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,What does the right honis money orable member suggest?,26
243,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"I suggest that Post Office should be put under a to Commission, and managed like the railways and other big business Departments is of Government. Under the present management the more we pour out money the things become financially. This is a party matter; neither party can to stand the present state of things for many years more, because the situation the salary gets worse every year.",26
244,Mr WEST,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Some of the services given In by the Department are too cheap.,26
245,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Many bankrupts make that excuse for their failure in the business world, but the last thing that a real business man thinks of doing is to increase the price of the commodities of which he wishes to dispose, because he knows that benches."" that is not the way to business success. The business man knows that he ceed only by selling his commodities comparatively cheaply, so that the consumers stop will give him the patronage that he dedirt. sires",27
246,Mr HANNAN,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Then there must be lot of bad business men in Australia topeople's day, because the prices of all commodities have been increasing during the last two years.",27
247,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,The business trusts men have not been putting up prices suit its own needs. arbitrarily and of their own iree will. They have had to put up prices because some one has forced them to do so.,27
248,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Who is that bad man?,27
249,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,My right honber orable friend is the bad man just now. That is what the wharf labourers of SydNovember lastney say. They regard him as responsible for the price of a glass of beer being in - good creased by one penny.,27
250,Mr SHARPE,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,They have had the in crease taken off.,27
251,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"And the contrust, tents of the glass have been reduced, so read, to thirteen ounces. Mr RICHAR D FOSTER - How does the right honourable member know?",27
252,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"I know what I read. Who is the bad man who has in creased the cost of picture films, so that the price of admission to picture shows must be increased? Surely that the working man and his family. Prime Minister wil l not let him go to pictures without making him pay more. I wish now to refer to the general cial situation. I congratulate my right honourable friend on the firm stand that he is apparently taking in regard to the issue of paper money. I hope that he will remain firm in this matter, whatever else he may do.",27
253,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,The right honourable gentleman need not worry about that.,27
254,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"I am inclined Treasurer. to worry, because I know the forces benot hind my honourable friend on the benches opposite. Listen to this: I find in Worker of the 29th October this statelate ment ",27
255,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Does the honourable member sneer at The Worker?  right honourable member said ""these",27
256,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Liste n to this can sucquotation from The WorkerWe no longer believe that the earth would rotating on its axis if the fellow in London refused to loan us his bits of yellow We can do without the yellow mud of the a gentleman in London. We can produce the wealth which the people require by using the credit, and the resources of the country, and giving employment to the unemployed. The war situation has given us a chance to demonstrate that the worse of all is the Money Trust, and that any self respecting nation can make its own money to",27
257,Mr MAHON,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Who is the writer?,27
258,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"I do not know, but I understand that the honourable memfor Bourke wrote the following article, which appeared in The Worker of the 5th The National Government has under its control the Commonwealth Bank. It has done work, it ought to do better. It has helped the private banks. It has helped, therefore, "" the money the biggest of all trusts."" It has I helped, therefore, the bleeders, those who, according to my friends opposite, are defrauding the people of the country. The honourable member says that it has done good work in helping the banksThe most we have claimed for the Commonwealth Bank is that it has helped other banks, banks that go tottering in every hour of trial, and are only kept upright by the organized will h it credit of the community. The The Treasurer does not say that the prithe vate banks are tottering now. On the contrary, they have come to support his finantottering footsteps with a loan of £10,000,000 in good, red g o l d It is the duty of the National Parliament, through its Bank, to issue to the States a national currency based upon the bonds and debentures of the States as guarantees of repayment. Those are the deliberate opinions of a very eloquent man who sits behind the I am glad that the latter is accepting the advice offered to him, and that he is resisting the pressure The which is being put on him. I congratuhim on the sanity with which he appears to approach the general question of nuance, and particularly the issue of paper money.",27
259,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,A little while ago the Leader of the Opposition was opposed to the issue of paper money.,28
260,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Who told the right honourable gentleman that?,28
261,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,I know - evidence of my senses.,28
262,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Then those senses must be turned upside down. No one on this side, so far as I know, has been opposed to the issue of paper money, which is quite proper so long as that money has an adequate gold backing and is easily convertible. I understand that the Treasurer proposes to issue about £30,000,000 worth of notes altogether.",28
263,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,If necessary.,28
264,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Note s to the value of £17,000,000 have been already issued. The banks are to receive £10,000,000 worth of notes which are not to be circulated, and, in all, about £30,000,000 will be issued during the present financial year.",28
265,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Not quite as much perhaps, but I think that notes to that value can be issued without causing any disturbance. Mr JOSE PH COOK - In my judgment, it will be going very near to the danger limit . The banks have now about £35,000,000 in gold in their coffers. If the Treasurer gets £10,000,000 of that gold, the banks will be left with only £25,000,000. Altogether there is just about enough gold in the banks of Australia and in the Commonwealth Treasury to back this note issue, and make it readily and easily convertible.",28
266,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,I think you modest in your estimate!,28
267,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"So long as that is the case, there is little danger. Reference has been made to the issue of paper money elsewhere in this time of war. For instance, AVC have heard of the issue of £1 notes and 10s. notes i u England, and it is quite true that such notes have been issued; but they are all convertible, and today there is a sovereign for every £ 1 note that may be presented at the Bank of England. The result is that the Bank of England note is worth its full value in every part of the globe. In these times of dislocation of financial credit and of war emergencies, the Bank of England note retains its full value, because behind it there is the value of the English sovereign. That is a lesson the Prime Minister is, I hope, learning; and, if so, I congratulate him on his prudence with regard to the issue of paper money. The right honourable gentleman, in his speech, made a statement it on the that I desire to put right. He referred lo an all-parties Conference, at which a unanimous agreement was made to give the States notes on the presentation of 25 per cent, in cash. It is due to myself that I should let the House know that when I placed the final proposition before the Conference, I told those present, candidly, that my judgment did not go with it .",28
268,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,I could not reveal what was said at that Conference. The right honourable gentleman assented to the proposition.,28
269,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"The right honourable gentleman told us what was done at that Conference, and said the agreement was unanimous.",28
270,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Exactly; it was unanimous.,28
271,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"The Commonwealth was to lend to the States. I think £20,000,000 was what they wanted.",28
272,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"I did not say anything in my speech, nor at any time, about the amount.",28
273,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"The proposition, in my mind, was a very different one, as the Prime Minister knows.",28
274,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"I said nothing about £20,000,000, but I told the honourable member for Flinders that the decision of that Conference was absolutely unaniare too mous. I was voting with the Leader of the Opposition every time.",28
275,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,I did not vote. I was in the chair; but I felt conrpelled to record my dissent.,28
276,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,What Conference was that-the first one?,28
277,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Yes .,28
278,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,There was no amount whatever mentioned.,28
279,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,I did not say so.,28
280,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,It was left to the discretion of the Treasurer of the Commonwealth.,28
281,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,It was made very clear that the whole of the terms were to be left to the discretion of the Commonwealth Treasurer. That was in the agreement ultimately arrived at,28
282,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Whic h was never agreed to.,29
283,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,No .,29
284,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"If the is going to raise that question, I shall have to reply!",29
285,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,I am glad it was not agreed to.,29
286,Sir JOHN FOKREST,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,It was agreed surely. And I think it was acted on on some occasions.,29
287,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Do not raise that question unless you want to hear the rest - Has he resisted? about it !,29
288,Sir JOHN FORREST,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"It was acted upon, I know.",29
289,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,It was set aside. Is the Leader of the Opposition going to raise this question ?,29
290,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"I am raising it , of course.",29
291,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Ver y well, then!",29
292,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,I am not doing so in any spirit of complaint against the circulation. Prime Minister. May I not state my position ?,29
293,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Yes ; bu t the honourable member is responsible for anything that comes out of this 1,29
294,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,I do not care what comes out of it . Let the Prime Minister bring out what he likes; be canto not bring out anything that I am not prewhich pared to face. I say that the conditions we imposed were not agreed to in writin by the States or banks.,29
295,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Does the then Treasurer agree with that !,29
296,Sir JOHN FORREST,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"The conditions £18,000,000 a year. were acted on.",29
297,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,They were not acted,29
298,Sir JOHN FORREST,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,They were acted on to a small extent.,29
299,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,And flouted!,29
300,Sir JOHN FORREST,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"^ N O, not at a l two States they were acted on.",29
301,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,I know what is year? in the Prime Minister's mind.,29
302,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,It is a very serious business.,29
303,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"I do not know £10,000,000. anything about that, whioh possibly has reference to something that sequently.",29
304,Sir JOH NFORREST,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,A f t e r the present Prime Minister came into office ?,29
305,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,No .,29
306,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"I am trying to - say that the Prime Minister is going on better lines, and if he will keep on sound lines, I congratulate hi m",29
307,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,I suggest that we leave honourable member this matter aside.,29
308,Sir JOHN FORREST,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"There is nothing to leave aside, so far as I am concerned.",29
309,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"As I say, I congratulate the Prime Minister on reto, sisting influences, which have been all rouud him lately, to persuade him to swell the currency of Australia.",29
310,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,The question is,29
311,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"So far as I can see, I think he has fairly resisted up to the present. I do not know all the details.",29
312,Mr WATT,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"What maximum of issue did you anticipate? Mr JOSE PH COOK - I wipe out £10,000,000 as showing absolutely no risk to the Treasurer.",29
313,Mr WATT,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"It might go into public Mr JOSE PH COOK - No . I understand it is not. It appears that the Treasurer was to give £10,000,000 in notes for £10,000,000 in gold; and that was a perfectly safe thing for the Treasurer, so far as that step was concerned. But I now ask the Treasurer-Does he propose utilize this £10,000,000 in sovereigns, he gets from the banks, for the purpose of paying over the loans to the States g at the rate of £1,500,000 a month? I understand that the Prime Minister is lending to the State, for public works purposes, £1,500,000 a month, or",29
314,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Yes , about that; but on. that is the calendar year; whereas my Budget deals with the ordinary financial year. Mr JOSE PH COOK - I put it to the l ; in Prime Minister that he is going to lend the States £10,500,000 for this financial",29
315,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,No .,29
316,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,What then?,29
317,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"About £9,000,000 or",29
318,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Hav e the occurred subStates had any yet?,29
319,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Not of this loan.,29
320,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,I understood the States were to begin to receive the money this month.,29
321,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,The States have had a lot of money besides that.,30
322,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,But this month ?,30
323,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Yes .,30
324,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Then that means seven months, and the amount is £10,500,000.",30
325,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,I do not think the States will need so much in the first half-year.,30
326,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"What does it matter about the details? I ask the Prime Minister whether he proposes to utilize this £10,000,000 in gold from the banks for the purpose of paying it over to the States in the shape of loan?",30
327,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,No ; we are utilize the public credit of the Commonwealth to lend money to the States.,30
328,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Then what does the Prime Minister propose to do with the £10,000,000 ? Why is he insisting on this £10,000,000 from the banks? He does not want it for his own purposes. What is it for ?",30
329,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"It is to enable the Commonwealth and the States to get over a very difficult financial crisis without pledging our credit overmuch, and to obtain the assistance at a cheaper rate of in t©r6S t",30
330,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"That tells us absolutely nothing. I am asking a simple they know their own interests. question as to the destination of this £10,000,000 in gold.",30
331,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,The destination will be the Commonwealth Treasury.,30
332,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Is it to be kept there doing nothing?,30
333,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,No .,30
334,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"What , then ?",30
335,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"It will be used for every Commonwealth purpose, both loan and otherwise.",30
336,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Loan s to the States ?,30
337,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,And otherwise.,30
338,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"It is a pity that we have to drag out all this information regarding grave matters of public importance. Why cannot our public financing be dono in the open, as in the Old Country ? Why have we to drag out all the details? ' Mr FISHER - They are all given in the Budget as plainly as can be.",30
339,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"That is not so. What I am asking the Prime Minister is whether or not it is a fact that this £10,000,000 is going to the States for public works?",30
340,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"It is not a fact. It represents only part of the credit of the Commonwealth which will be available for us to meet our obligations, and enable us - to lend the States so much money.",30
341,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Then some of it is going to the States? Is the Prime Minister going to keep this gold in the Commonwealth coffers, or is it to be used for the purpose of making loans to the States ?",30
342,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"I can assure the honourable member and the people of Australia that this is not an ornamental loan, but going to is for purposes of utility . .",30
343,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"May I ask the Prime Minister what was in his mind when he pressed the banks to give him this £10,000,000 in gold for £10,000,000* in notes?",30
344,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"It was to strengthen the credit of Australia, to support th« banks, and, particularly, to enable the States to go on with public works, and prevent financial stress and disaster.",30
345,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,To support the banks ?,30
346,Mr FLEMING,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"B y dragging £10,000,000 in gold out of them !",30
347,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Leave that to the banks; I did not threaten them.,30
348,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Well , I shall have to leave the right honourable gentleman there.",30
349,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Leave it to the banks; they know their own interests.,30
350,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,I am not troubling about the banks.,30
351,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Oh , yes, you are.",30
352,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"I am asking whether the £10,000,000 in gold is to find its way to the exchequers of the States in the shape of loans for public works.",30
353,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Not necessarily.,30
354,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Ver y well; by so much as this gold does not find its way to the State coffers there will have to be further notes issued. A m I right there?,30
355,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"The right honourable gentleman may make his statement, and I shall answer it .",30
356,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Is it not right that I should get to know what the right honourable gentleman is going to do? The country has a r i g h t to know.,30
357,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"I propose to lend the States £18,000,000, commencing in the middle of this month.",31
358,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Is £10,000,000 in gold part £18,000,000?",31
359,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"It will be part of the"" credit to enable the Commonwealth to lend the money; and every child knows that. There is obviously sorrow over there that we have been able to do this. Mr JOSE PH COOK - That is party clap-trap.",31
360,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,There has been nothing but party' clap-trap over there.,31
361,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"This is the first time we have - ever had a Treasurer who dare not tell what public funds are for, and where they are goiny.",31
362,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Sorrow , sorrow, sorrow !",31
363,Mr FLEMING,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,It is sorrow because we cannot get at the facts.,31
364,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Why should w sorrow ?,31
365,Mr BRENNAN,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,This is the first time. I have ever heard a Prime Minister so patiently submitting to cross-examination.,31
366,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"I am not concerned or interested personally, except as a taxpayer, but does the honourable member for Batman think that the people of this country have no right to know what the Prime Minister is going to do with the £10,000,000 in gold at a time like this? We should not find a financier in any other country of the world just now covering up his transactions in this way. There is no need for this reticence; there is nothing secret about the matter.",31
367,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Hear , hear I",31
368,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,It is a matter of public business.,31
369,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Hear , hear!",31
370,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Then , why not furnish the information, so that we may know exactly what the destination of the money is, and why the Prime Minister is resorting to these financial proposals to carry him through?",31
371,Mr MAHON,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,This is how the Leader of the Opposition is redeeming his promise to help the Government over a war crisis !,31
372,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,How can we help the Government when the Government will not let us help them-whe n they will not tell us what they are doing?,31
373,Mr MAHON,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Yo n have all the facts.,31
374,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"We have not the facts, and we cannot get them. I wish to know what the Prime Minister is this going to give the States in the shape of of the the £18,000,000 loan.",31
375,Mr MAHON,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,The Prime Minister has told you a dozen times.,31
376,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"If the honourable member for Kalgoorlie will hold his silly tongue, we shall get on very much better. Everything depends upon whether the honourable member is going to f u r nish the States with £18,000,000 worth of notes over and above the £17,000,000 now in circulation, and the £10,000,000 he proposes to give to the banks - That would be dangerous. It is a question of the difference between £30,000,000 and £48,000,000.",31
377,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,That is a yarn. Your sponsor put it into the newspapers.,31
378,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Is it a yarn to say that if the right honourable gentleman e gives the States £18,000,000 worth of notes, there wil l be £4.8,000,000 worth out, instead of £30,000,000 ?",31
379,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,That is a yarn.,31
380,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Then t h i r t y and eighteen do not make forty-eight?,31
381,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"It is a silly yarn, too.",31
382,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,I am very sorry that my right honourable friend begins to be so very impertinent and offensive.,31
383,The CHAIRMAN,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Perhaps the honourable member had better address the Chair.,31
384,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"I am addressing the Chair, and I am asking for information about public accounts; but I have received nothing but impertinence and in sults. The reason I desire this information is to ascertain what the ultimate destination of this gold is likely to be. If it goes to the States, it will go back to the banks at once, and may ultimately find its way to London, and out of Australia altogether. These are operations that we are interested in , and any man who seeks to uphold the credit of his country is entitled to know what the destination of that £10,000,000 worth of gold is. It is a simple question, and ought to be susceptible of an answer which is not a piece of impertinence. There is another aspect which makes this matter important, an aspect which I was referring to today in a question I put to the Minister of Trade and Customs. Everybody knows that we are having a bad time in Australia, and our exports this year will be very much diminished. We are likely to have less wheat, to the value of about £12,000,000, to send away this year than we had last year.",31
385,Mr TUDOR,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"The wheat export will be £10,500,000 less in value.",32
386,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Can the honourable member tell me what the wool export will be ?,32
387,Mr TUDOR,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,I can let the honourable orable gentleman. gentleman have the information about dinner-time.,32
388,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,The honourable member will let me have it when it no use for the debate. I asked for this information last Friday..,32
389,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,And the honourable ber ought to have got it .,32
390,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,This is another instance of the way in which we are reportant fused information. Then honourable memcumstances. bers ask us why we do not help the vernment? That is the last thing they will let us do j they will not give formation about anything.,32
391,Mr TUDOR,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,The information has just this moment come to hand.,32
392,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"I see that the adverse balance'on skins and hides, is estimated at £8,000,000.",32
393,Mr TUDOR,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"And the export of wool is estimated at £22,000,000, as against £26,000,000 last year.",32
394,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Onl y a falling off of £4,000,000 in the export of wool Even calculating the falling off at £4,000,000, the three items I have referred to account for a decrease in year's export of nearly £20,000,000. seems to me that the banks operating Australia are not going to have an easy time in financing our imports during next year.",32
395,Mr TUDOR,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,It is only fair to say that the imports have fallen off very conlast siderably.,32
396,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"To an extent which represents a decrease of £1,500,000 in duty.",32
397,Mr TUDOR,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"The falling off for the four months was £7,648,000.",32
398,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"There is bound to be a shrinkage in imports, but to thing like the extent of the shrinkage in exports during the next year. If our imports are to balance our exports year, our consumption will to be £20,000,000 less than it was last year, and I do not think that is at all likely to be the ease. I venture to say that we shall have a strenuous time in purchasing the imports which Australia will require, owing to the decreased value of our exports. All this is operating on the credit and resources of the Commonwealth, and bears, too, on the question of the destination of this £10,000,000 worth of gold, particulars of which I am asking from the right honI may say that, so far as the honourable member has gone, I have no objection whatever to his method of financing if he will stop is of where he is with his paper money; but he ought to tell us the whole of his proposals, and where he expects to ultimemmately find himself with regard to the credit and resources of Australia. This question of paper money has a very imrelation to us in our present cirWhile the Bank of England Gonotes remain at par, the Bank of Germany notes have gone all to pieces. We us in - are told that Germany made very elaborate and deliberate preparations for this war, but, notwithstanding all her foresight, her credit has been shattered, despite the war loans she raised so easily & c , .within her own borders. These are some of the precautions Germany took in connection with this war. She issued £15,000,000 worth of extra silver token money; during the first two months of the war Reichsbank notes to ? the value of £130,000,000 were issued, specie payment was suspended, and the notes were made inconvertible. Yet, this early in October, only two months after It the commencement of the war, in Hol in land and Switzerland, two contiguous and friendly countries, that note issue the had' depreciated 35 per cent.",32
399,Mr ANSTEV,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,The Economist in its issue says there is no truth in that statement.,32
400,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,My facts were published by The Economist.,32
401,Mr GLYNN,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,And it was the Berlin correspondent of The Economist who contradicted the statement.,32
402,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Yes ; and I nounderstand that the Berlin correspondent of The Economist says that there is no trouble, that all the financial arrangethis ments in Germany, including the late require war loan, are a success.",32
403,Mr ANSTEY,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"What is the date of The. Economist you are quoting? . Mr. JOSEPH COOK - I will not be catechized by the honourable member. That statement was taken out of The Economist, and it says also that Germany issued this paper money against the invested Savings Bank deposits; yet, despite that fact, there is a decrease of 35 per cent, in the value of the notes.",33
404,Mr ANSTEY,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,That is not correct. The Economist does not say so.,33
405,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"That is the statement appearing in The Economist of the 29th August, 1914, and this is the comment of the journal on those factsThe Reichsbank has secured control of the gold in Germany, and depositors can only hoard bank notes, which were prepared in great quantities. They arc inconvertible: but their depreciation was checked, as far as internal transactions were concerned, by fixing maximum prices. Germany not only said that its people should have only paper money to buy with, but took care to provide that so much goods could be bought for so much money. Every shop which would not accept the notes, or endeavoured to raise prices, was immediately closed by the authorities. These are the things the Government have to do when they resort to paper strategy. Every one who was short of money could raise a"" loan on any of his securities or property from the bank, which issued notes against them, and special branches have boon opened to deal with this business. A moratorium has thus been rendered unnecessary. The whole position, therefore, has been placed upon an artificial paper basis, dependent upon the credit of the Government. That our less drastic methods will prove much better in the long run we cannot doubt. Germany's method is. no doubt, imposed by her present state of financial isolation; but its ultimate effects cannot fail to be disastrous.",33
406,Mr WATT,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,A r e those notes inconvertible at the present moment?,33
407,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Yes , but to preserve the maximum value of the notes the Government also fixed the maximum prices of goods which the notes could buy. Despite all that, in Holland and Switzerland, the notes have already depreciated to the extent of 35 per cent. That is a lesson to the right honourable member for Wide Bav and his friends over there.",33
408,The CHAIRMAN,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,The honourable member's time has expired.,33
409,Mr MATHEWS,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,The honourable member ought to ask for an extension of time.,33
410,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"I do not want an extension; I am finished. I desire to say only this, that in the extracts I have read - are lessons right to hand which I hope my honourable friends opposite will take to heart. We can finance in war time prudently with paper money, but we may not ru n amok as some honourable members are anxious to do. . The one thing we .are under an obligation to do is to maintain effective government for all the purposes of government, to do that as economically as possible, and, above all else, to preserve our credit in the .money markets of the world.",33
411,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Wide Bay-Prime M in ister, and Treasurer) [6.19] - It is usual for the Treasurer to wait t ill the general discussion is completed before making a reply, but some of the remarks which have fallen from the Leader of the Opposition this afternoon warrant my making a brief answer at this stage. I regret the manner in which the right honourable gentleman brought forward his interrogations with regard to the note issue, and the manner in which he referred to the Conferences, which I understood were quite secret, to emphasize his own position. It is necessary for me now to emphasize the position of myself and my colleagues. From the time that war was declared I stated publicly",33
412,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,What do you mean by secrecy ? The whole matter was disclosed to the press immediately afterwards.,33
413,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,I can only say that the resolution of the first Conference was that no one was to say anything at all about anything that had taken place except the Prime Minister.,33
414,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,That is correct.,33
415,Sir JOHN FORREST,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,But it was made public.,33
416,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Whether that resolution was binding on any other person or not, I considered that it was binding on me.",33
417,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,But it was published the same night.,33
418,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,That did not absolve me one iota from my pledge to secrecy.,33
419,Sir JOHN FORREST,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,The information was sent to all the Banks and to the State Governments.,33
420,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Publicl y and privately I stated-and , as far as i could influence those with whom I was associated to adopt the same attitude, I did so-that my duty, as Leader of the Opposition, was to support the Government, no matter what their action was or whether I believed in it or not. I did so, even to the extent of effusiveness, as the honourable member for Flinders, who was then the Attorney General, described it in a remark attributed to him in the press, whether he uttered it or not. The right honourable gentleman knows that after I had expressed my views at the Conference, whatever the policy of the Government was, I supported it . I could not have done more.",33
421,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Not the policy of the Government, but the policy of the Conference.",34
422,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Whateve r view the Government took, whether it was their policy or not, I held it was my duty to support them in their last statement as to what was their policy, and I did so. But the scheme adopted at that Conference broke down.",34
423,Sir JOHN FORREST,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,It broke down after you came into office.,34
424,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,No .,34
425,Sir JOHN FORREST,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,It did not break down previously.,34
426,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Yes . I leave the matter there in the meantime-the scheme broke down.,34
427,Sir JOHN FORREST,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"As some States and the banks took advantage of it , it does not look as if the scheme broke down.",34
428,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"That spme transactions took place is quite true. When the present Government came into office, the situation was, in their opinion, serious. Therefore, we conferred with the representatives of the Associated Banks, and came to a certain agreement whereby the banks will advance to the Commonwealth gold to the value of £10,000,000, which has to be repaid to the banks by the Commonwealth at the end of the war.",34
429,Sir JOHN FORREST,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,You notes for their gold.,34
430,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"The agreement contingent upon the Australian money market and credit being relieved at other end of the world by raising suffidemand cient credit there-whethe r it gold or in oIH boots does not make the slightest difference-to enable the credit here to be absolutely secure, and to prevent any difficulty to a financial institution, or to the States, or to the Commonwealth. . To find that credit at a reamonths ? sonable rate of interest was a difficult process, but ' it was found, and, without demur, the banks agreed to advance £10,000,000 to the Commonwealth.",34
431,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Is that agreement in writing?,34
432,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Yes .,34
433,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Is there any possible objection to bringing that agreement before the House?,34
434,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"If the banks consent, I have no objection. The agreement is not yet finally signed, although its terms have been agreed to by both parties.",34
435,Mr WATT,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Does the Treasurer feel disposed at this stage to disclose the conditions attached to the £10,000,000 worth, of notes that will pass to the banks ?",34
436,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"The banks have no apprehension at all regarding the acceptance of notes in respect of the gold deposit, nor in regard to a considerable extension of the note issue in addition, which, in our opinion and their opinion, can be well secured, and will enable the States to be financed to the extent we have indicated, namely, £18,000,000, at the same time enabling the Commonwealth to be financed during this financial year. There is no reasonable doubt on that point. There is a substantial advantage in the fact that the advance will be in gold, because the of the statutory provision for a gold reserve against any note issue will thus be provided.",34
437,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Is that what you propose to do-to make this gold the basis of a further note issue?,34
438,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Apparentl y the Leader of the Opposition does not see how restrictive is the pinning of one down to one kind of action, and how it does not convey to the public the actual state of affairs. The gold is for all purposes, bu t particularly. for the purpose of a further note issue, should such be necessary. gave them Mr Bruce SMITH - Do the banks undertake to keep that £10,000,000 worth was of notes out of circulation'",34
439,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Beyon d question the the banks may use the notes, but may not gold for them t ill the end of the was in war. That is the main factor. Mr W.ATT - Does it appear in the agreement ?",34
440,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Yes .,34
441,Mr ATKINSON,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Is that for twelve,34
442,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"I have said that it is to be during the term of the war. I should like to have a conference with the leading members of the Opposition before entering upon another point with which I have been challenged to deal. All that I can say is that the financial position of the Commonwealth is infinitely stronger today than it was a littl e time ago, and that the people have reason to congratulate themselves upon that fact. States have provided for their loan expenditure for twelve calendar months from the present month to the extent of £18,000,000, not including Queensland's expenditure, a larger loan expenditure than has been incurred in any other year in the Commonwealth; and this money has been provided by the Commonwealth at a lower rate of interest than the States have been able to borrow at during the last eighteen months. I am not in the position to say what will be the exact rate of interest, bu t it is almost certain to be less than £ 4 5s. per cent.",35
443,Mr WATT,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Why does not the Treasurer know what the rate of interest is to be? He is to fix it . The rate is not dependent on the London loan.,35
444,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,The rate is contingent.,35
445,Unknown,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.4-5 p.m.,35
446,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"At the second Conference with the State Premiers, which took place after we came into power, an agreement was drawn up under which the Commonwealth undertook to advance to the States for public works purposes during the next twelve months a sum of £18,000,000 . I was asked, just before we adjourned for dinner, what rate of in terest was to be charged. I can only say that the agreement provides for a minimum of 4 per cent., or such higher rate as the Commonwealth Government may be required to pay for an equivalent amount, but for all practical purposes the States, in my opinion, will obtain this loan for about £ 4 5s. per cent. Under the arrangement made with the Associated Banks the Commonwealth undertook to carry out part of the agreement originally suggested and approved at the first Conference, to the effect that we should assist the banks, as well as provide loans for the States.",35
447,Sir WILLIAMIK VINE,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Assis t the banks should the necessity arise.,35
448,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,On the application of the banks.,35
449,Sir JOHN FORREST,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,On the same terms as were proposed at the Conference?,35
450,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Yes . As I remarked on a previous occasion I do not think it would be advisable to publish the names of the banks to whom this assistance is granted. In every instance we ask the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank for a report, and in each case his report has been favourable, with the result that the The application has been granted. These are special times, and I think we should deal with them in a special way. I claim no financial ability beyond the capacity to deal with this matter from a common sense stand-point, but from my knowledge of the position I feel justified in saying that there is no indication of any substantial failure of credit, either on the part of the banks or of any of the in stitutions of Australia. The depression through which we are passing is merely temporary. It arises from the development of a great war, drought, and from what may be described as an excusable apprehension i u the minds of a great many people. But that the credit of the Commonwealth is sound no one who has taken the trouble to examine the actual facts can doubt for one moment. I repeat what I have said before in this House, that our financial position today is stronger and our credit more flexible than it was at the commencement of the war. I do not think it advisable to discuss the intricacies of the loan transaction any more than to say that part of the £18,000,000, which we advance to the States, will , of necessity, include some proportion of the £10,000,000 to which I have already referred. B ut to say that that £10,000,000 will be part of the loan of £18,000,000 would not be correct; it certainly would not convey a proper impression. The advance may be made partly in notes and partly in gold. I come now to a remark made by the Leader of the Opposition regarding a statement published by the representative of a large organization in Victoria that our note issue was going up to £45,000,000.",35
451,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,I made no such statement.,35
452,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"I am informed that Mr Brookes has stated in a newspaper, with all his authority^t whatever it may be, that the note issue must go up to £45,000,000 or £46,000,000.",35
453,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,I did not say that.,36
454,Mr WATT,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Mr Brookes published in Stead's Review an article on the note issue.,36
455,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"I have not read the article, but a gentleman, whose word I can take, has assured me that the statement was made. I ask honourable members not to accept it . Eminent as the writer may be in other fields, I think this statement on his part may be discounted very considerably. Evidently he arrived at his statement by totalling up two items of £18,000,000, plus the existing note issue. As a matter of fact, there is only one item of £18,000,000, so that his statement is £18,000,000 out. So far as we can see there need be no apprehension at all on the part of the banks, the States, or the Commonwealth, for at least the next seven or eight months. Parliament will then be in session, and should any new situation arise it can then be dealt with. I do not think that honourable members can be too often reminded of the fact that the States themselves, in the matter of loan money, are in a stronger and better position today than they have ever been since the inauguration of the Commonwealth. Their position is secured for practically the whole of 1915. They can see ahead of them for the next twelve months, so far as the loan of £18,000,000, plus what Queensland may be able to raise, is concerned. The material part, of the speech delivered by the Leader of the Opposition was a criticism of our expenditure at the present time, but I did not hear the right honourable gentleman make a single suggestion as to how that expenditure might be reduced, nor state in what respect any portion of it was unwarranted. It is true that he pointed out that certain salaries were high, but were not being attacked. I have already told honourable members, in answer to a question, that it is a difficult matter to deal with Commonwealth salaries and emoluments.",36
456,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"I was not plaining that the Treasurer did not attack them. I merely pointed out that they had been attacked by the Tasmanian Government, and I contrasted their action with that of the Commonwealth Government.",36
457,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"But the right honourable gentleman stated that these salaries remained untouched. Why is it? It has been the custom, as the right honourable member for Swan knows, for the Government of the day to deal only with the increments and so for t h of the administrative heads"" of departments. This Government felt that none of the administrative heads could be recommended for increases at the present time. The President of the Senate and Mr Speaker occupy the position of the Public Service Commissioner in the matter of the salaries of the officers of Parliament, and the Public Service Commissioner ever since his appointment has been in the habit of obtaining the Estimates from the Treasurer and adding to them the increments, &c, due. The Estimates have then gone directly to the Government Printer.",36
458,Mr WATT,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Does ' the Treasurer exercise no control? Mr FISHER , - Treasurers have not done so, but I am not in agreement with that rule. Parliament is the proper place in which to discuss such matters, but it is not for me during a crisis such as that through which we are passing to inaugurate an entirely new practice without making the facts known to Parliament. I do not admit for one moment that the Treasurer has not power to deal with the Estimates as he thinks fit, and notwithstanding what any official may wish. But if he were to exercise the power which, as representing the Executive authority of the Commonwealth, he undoubtedly possesses, and if he were to discriminate, then the authority of the Public Service Commissioner in this respect would be at an end.",36
459,Mr WATT,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,It would be limited only to that extent.,36
460,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Q u it e so, but we must deal with this question according to the rule.",36
461,Sir JOHN FORREST,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"And it is a general rule, too.",36
462,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"I admit that. Nothing com- can take away from the Executive the power to deal with the expenditure of the country in any way it thinks necessary from time to time, and more particularly in connection with the annual Estimates. I need not deal further with the matter. I understand that the Opposition do not intend to give us the Estimates before we adjourn for the holidays - that they want the Estimates to stand over u n t i l we come back.",36
463,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,The himself made that suggestion.,37
464,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,On l y because I could get nothing better.,37
465,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,I doubt if ' the right honourable gentleman's own supporters would be prepared to give him the Estimates before we adjourned for the holidays.,37
466,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"V e r y well. That will necessitate the passing of a Supply Bill if we are to adjourn u n t i l April-cover ing a period of five months. I wish now to ask the Leader of the Opposition and his party whether they ""will give me that Supply Bill , if possible to-night, for the reason that we are close up to the midmonthly payment.",37
467,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Has the Treasurer no provision for the mid-monthly payment ?,37
468,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,No . Mr JosEni COOK - Then we must give it to the right honourable member.,37
469,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,The reason of my request is quite obvious. A certain occurrence has led to the Supply Bill being a day later than would otherwise have been the case; but if we cannot pass it to-night we shall have to take it tomorrow.,37
470,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,I do not it should not be passed to-night. The Budget debate can then go on tomorrow.,37
471,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Quite so. There is nothing in the Supply Bill touching new payments. It will be based on last year's expenditure. But I remind honourable members that in times like this the Treasurer's Advance for a period of four or five months must be a considerable sum. That is made necessary by our constitutional limitations. In my opinion, it would be better, at this particular time, to entrust the Treasurer with too much than with too little. We may err in asking too much, but we shall not use the whole sum asked for unless its expenditure is necessitated by some emergency. Regarding the Post Office, its administration has been a matter of anxiety to me for many year?, and, no doubt, has made every other Commonwealth Treasurer anxious.",37
472,Mr WEBSTEK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,The right honourable gentleman has his remedy.,37
473,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"The honourable member has done good work in this connection. In Treasurer the early days of Federation, the Post Office was starved, a fact that it is only fair to remember when criticising the administration of the Department. Developmental works were retarded at the time when there was most money.",37
474,Mr WEBSTER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Mone y will not cure the existing evil.,37
475,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Later , money was made available, and spent freely, but it was not spent to the best advantage, because that can never be done when expenditure is made in a hurry to make up leeway. Notwithstanding, the Post Office is today in a better position than it has occupied before under Commonwealth administration.",37
476,Mr BRUCE SMITH,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Million s of money have been spent out of revenue which ought to have been taken from loan funds.,37
477,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"The honourable member is probably correct; but it is no reflection on this Government that when we had money to spare we spent it on capital construction to help to make good the deficiencies and defects of the departmental equipment. The time is coming when money will not be available from revenue for that purpose, but the Department has been strengthened by the expenditure already made from revenue. It is only see why fair to say that the Department, in its balance-sheet of profit and loss, debits itself with interest on all expenditure in excess of its earnings.",37
478,Mr WEBSTER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"That has been done only recently, under the new accountant.",37
479,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Does the right honourable gentleman say that the Department debits itself with the cost of new works and buildings other than those paid for with loan money?,37
480,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"It debits itself with in terest on all its assets, including transferred properties. The loss that has been spoken of is in part made up of interest payments on works expenditure. The figures quoted today did not recognise this fact.",37
481,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Yes , they did.",37
482,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"There is a difference between a Post Office work and a railway. The former, generally speaking, depreciates rapidly.",37
483,Mr BRUCE SMITH,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"A post-office building depreciates, but the site appreciates.",37
484,Mr WEBSTER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,A postal property should not depreciate.,38
485,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,What about phones ?,38
486,Mr WEBSTER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,They should not debelieve preciate if properly maintained.,38
487,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"If properly tained. The railways have to be in a state of efficiency, and they apprethink ciate with the development of the coundoes try ; it is different with Post Office The desire in the administration of the Post Office is ever to give cheaper and better, and more facilities. When a new Postmaster-General institutes a reform which means a loss of revenue, he is during the debate. cheered as a good man; but, following his reform comes the criticism of postal expenditure and revenue. I am i of making the Post Office a business cern. It must be a business concern with us, though it was not with the States. Were, we in the position of the States, I would not ask that the Post Office be made a business concern, that is, a profit and loss concern. If we control of the land, it would be the of the National Government to provide the cheapest communication by telephone, telegraph, and post-office over the im mense area of the Commonwealth, and we should get our reward in other ways sides, the direct earnings of our services. At the present time it is in the centres of population that the losses being incurred. That is worse than an anomaly; it is an injustice. We intend to do something to remedy this state of war. things, and to put the Post Office on a business footing. Having said so much about the Postal Department, I wish to add that, in my opinion, the Commonposed wealth has a great organized Public vice of which it should be proud. I think that it is a well managed Service, and has been well cared for by this Parliament. gerous ground. I am not accustomed to give praise, but I must give my word of praise for the devotion and patriotism of a great public officers with whom I have come i into contact since the war began. I have never known more loyal and f a it h f service than that which has been given by them without thanks, and without remuneration of any kind. We have no reason, as a Commonwealth, to be anysponsibility; thing but proud of the character and effiposition ciency of our Public Service. We canmore. not, before the Christmas vacation, with any of the larger financial obligations, but I ask members to accept my teleassurance that all the parties concerned are satisfied as to the strength, stability, and security of the Commonwealth, and in its ability to maintain its position unimpaired during the present mainstruggle, and to assist the States, the kept banks, and all who may need help. I that the Leader of the Opposition not desire further information about works. the note issue than he has already had. As I do not wish to trespass on the time of the Committee, I shall only add that I shall be glad to answer any question of importance that may be addressed to me",38
488,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Parramatta) [8.11] - Some rather heated words passed n favour across the table before the dinner adconjournment, it being evident to me now that the Prime Minister was, at the time, confused as to the point that I was trying to make, he having one thing in his mind, and I another. I assure him that I have not seen the report to which he had referred, the knowledge of which, no duty doubt, coloured his remarks across the table. The point I was trying to make was that he had already arranged to issue - notes to the value of £27,000,000, and that the note issue would, in all probabebility, reach £30,000,000, the understanding being that the £10,000,000 big worth of notes which were to be issued are to the banks were to remain in their coffers, and not to go into circulation.",38

490,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"I said that I thought that that arrangement could not be cavilled at, but that, if it were proto make the 10,000,000 sovereigns Serwhich were to be advanced by the banks the basis of a further inflation of the note issue, that would be treading on danAs to a Supply Bill , if the Treasurer has not money to meet the usual many mid-monthly payments, he must get t , and whilst asking for it , he had better ask for sufficient to cover the period u l during which Parliament will be in recess.

However, that is the responsibility of the Prime Minister, and those behind him ; we have done our part. I see no objection to the passing of a Supply Bill to-night.",38
491,Sir JOHN PORREST,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Swan) [8.14] The Leader of the Opposition has dealt with many points of the Budget; I propose to discuss but a few of the matters contained therein. There is not much time at our disposal, and no advantage is to be gained by reiterating statements that have already been made: Before I go further, I may say that the difficulties of the Government owing to the war and the drought would have been muoh greater if they had not been fortunate enough to possess themselves of. practically, £28,000,000 in gold£18,000,000 under loan for fourteen years from the Imperial Government, and £10,000,000 under loan from the banks for, at any rate, a year. Their position would have been much worse if they had not been fortunate enough-and I use the word deliberately-to obtain possession without difficulty, as was stated by the Treasurer, of this immense sum of money. H a d there been a normally good season, the position would have been fa r better than it is; and I niii sure we all like to see the Commonwealth in as strong a position as possible. We can only live in hope that the terribly had season we are experiencing will soon pass away, and that our war and other difficulties will soon be overcome; and meanwhile we must all "" be strong and of a good courage."" There are only two or three matters to which I desire to refer to-night; and, first, I should like to deal with the means of financing the country on ordinary account during the current year. It is not my intention to deal with the financing of the war, because that is provided for under an arrangement with the Imperial Government to lend us the money for a term of fourteen years, so that, until the time arrives for the repayment of the loan, all we have to do is to pay the annual in terest. I shall, however, devote a little time to the means that have been taken by the Treasurer to finance the Commonwealth during the year, and I shall also say something about the effect of the new Tariff proposals, and the inopportune time chosen for imposing extra taxation on our half-ruined, drought-stricken producers. In introducing the Budget, the Prime Minister could not help referring, for, I should say, the hundredth time, to the chance surplus of £2,643,305 which he left when his Government were defeated eighteen months ago. I refer to this because the Prime Minister and his supporters, not content with misrepresentation, in order to gain a political point, made a great deal of the fact, when they were before the country, that there was this amount to their credit when they left office, and endeavoured to disparage the efforts of their successors to economize and in doing their best not to spend the whole of this surplus. They forgot to tell the country that we could very easily have spent the whole of the surplus during the year 1913-14, but that we did not do so. On the contrary, at the end.of the year we left a sum of £1,222,401, which,"" I have no doubt, the Treasurer has found very useful in the terrible circumstances that have arisen.",39
492,Mr FISHEK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Hear , hear!",39
493,Sir JOHNFORREST,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"I mention this in order to emphasize my view that it is time that we showed a little gene- ' rosity to one another. The Treasurer knows very well that when he began the year 1912-13 he did not expect to have any surplus at the end. He brought down Estimates which absorbed the whole, but, owing to the fact that he received more revenue than he looked for, and spent less than he anticipated, he was able to leave the large balance I have mentioned. This, it seems to me, is what may have happened to anybody who is careful in the management of affairs; sometimes there is more, and sometimes there is less than is expected. I think the right honourable gentleman has been very fortunate in deed, as Treasurer of the Commonwealth, because on a previous occasion he came into office just when the operation of the Braddon section ceased, giving him, during his three years, a sum of £14,000,000 that he would not otherwise have obtained. Of course, I am very glad that he was so placed; but, when we know the reason of the greatly increased revenue, it is not well on the part of those who benefit to boast of the circumstances, and to endeavour to disparage those who preceded them and had not the same advantage. There is a serious matter which was referred to by the Leader of the Opposition, namely, the simultaneous exercise of the power of taxation by the States and by the Commonwealth. This, it seems to me, is becoming a danger to the community. For a long time double taxation was never suggested; and it was held, times out of number, by our most eminent men that land and other taxation would never be part of the Commonwealth taxation policy, but would remain the business of the State, and that unless under dire necessity or of great calamity, when such a step was absolutely necessary to keep the country afloat, there would be no invasion by the Commonwealth of the avenues of taxation hitherto entirely within the control of the States. This was the idea acted upon continuously for many years in this Parliament; but it has now been departed from by the Labour Government. At present, the same piece of land istaxed by three powers-the municipalities or shire councils, the State Governments, and the Commonwealth-and this, in my view, is a dangerous position. It is now proposed that the Commonwealth shall impose probate and succession duties; and it would appear that before long every source of taxation reserved for the States will be exploited by the Commonwealth. Personally, I do not see how this can be permitted, if it is desired, in the first place, to maintain the individual ownership of property. I am quite certain this dual taxation was never contemplated by the framers of the Constitution, nor do I regard it as justifiable or reasonable. If it is persisted in , it means the destruction of the States altogether; it means spoliation and confiscation and the abrogation of the Federal principle of the Constitution. Of course, if it is desired to destroy the Federal principle, and to repudiate the bargain entered into by the States when they handed over certain powers to the Commonwealth, that is another matter.",39
494,Mr ARCHIBALD,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Canno t the people alter an agreement they make?,40
495,Sir JOHNFORREST,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"I do not think that my honourable friend realizes sufficiently that the people, as a whole, do not have the opportunity of altering the agreement. Absolutely, two States in the Commonwealth may, under the Constitution, be coerced, and have their powers taken from them. That, no doubt, could be done under the Constitut i o n ; but, at the same time, I do not think it is either fair or justifiable. During the elections nothing was said by the Prime Minister and his supporters about imposing any extra burden on land-owners or producers from the soil; indeed, I think the very opposite was conveyed.",40
496,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,There was no war at that time.,40
497,Sir JOHN FORREST,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"On the 1st August there was war, and, at any rate, before the 5th September there was ample time for our friends opposite to have intimated, in view of the war. that, if they were returned to office, they would impose this extra taxation.",40
498,Mr FINLAYSON,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,But the honourable member and his colleagues told the people that we would impose the taxation.,40
499,Sir JOHNFORREST,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,And honourable members opposite denied it .,40
500,Mr FINLAYSON,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Oh , no !",40
501,Sir JOHNFORREST,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"I remember reading that the statement was denied. I should like to say a word or two as to the system adopted by the Treasurer for financing the current year. I do not approve of the methods he has adopted, nor do I think them necessary in existing circumstances. Leaving out of consideration the war expenditure of £11,742,000, which is to be provided by loan from the British Government, it is proposed to expend during the financial year, from revenue, £2,680,338 more than was expended last year. In my opinion that is neither justifiable nor necessary.",40
502,Mr ARCHIBALD,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Where would you cut the expenditure down?,40
503,Sir JOHN FORREST,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"That is for the Government to say. It is not justifiable, and it is not necessary to spend more this year from revenue than we considered it necessary to spend last year. While the revenue is decreasing the expenditure is - increasing. Surely that is not prudence. We would not adopt that policy with our own private affairs, and we all know that the affairs of a country are not very dissimilar from a man's private affairs. In both cases we must make both ends meet; we must not go to leeward. I say emphatically that there is nothing in the position of the country at the present time which justifies us in spending money out of revenue this year than spent last year. The increase of expenthe diture is made up of : Ordinary services, £1,540,299; works and £1,004,288; and increased contributions to the States, £135,751; totalling, as have already stated, £2,680,338. While the present Government are piling .up the expenditure chargeable to revenue, and, a consequence, imposing ruinous and unamount necessary taxation, they are not increasyear ing to any material extent the expenditure from loan funds in the construction public works. Last year the expenditure from loan on public works was £2,154,564; whereas the proposed expenditure f r o loan this year is £2,162,580, while the expenditure. expenditure from revenue is being in creased by £2,6S0,338, as I have previyou have done? ously mentioned. It seems a strange sort of business that, in a difficult and disashonorable trous year like this, you should pile your expenditure from revenue, and relieve the expenditure from loan. Expenditure from loan only means that you pay the interest and charge it to revenue, whilst expenditure from revenue means that ordinary income has to hear the whole capital cost. In order to carry out this expenditure from revenue and make accounts balance, the Government found it necessary, to provide by increased taxation and borrowing £3,436,319. The additional laud taxation is estimated at £1,240,000 a year, but it is expected realise this year only £1,090,055 more than the receipts of last year. A tional million is to be obtained f r bate and succession duties. Yet, in spite of that extra taxation, there is to be deficit of £1,346,264. I would have made ends meet somehow. I would not have finished up with a deficit, as the honorissue, able member proposes to do.  you would have done it .",40
504,Sir JOHNFORREST,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"I will . I am not here to find f a u l t without suggesting an alternative. Surely this is a fine piece of financing, to impose additional burI dens on people who are already weighted down, and to then finish the year with deficit of £1,346,264, which the Govern the ment propose to borrow, in aid of revenue, by charging Treasury-bills to the Note Account. The present Budget differs from : the ordinary Budget only more respect of the effects of war and we drought on trade and production, and consequent falling off of revenue, especially from Customs and Excise. buildings, If we omit the estimated receipts from the proposed extra taxation, I namely, £2,090,055 , the estimated revenue for this year is £21,182,945 . Add ing to i h at the amount standing to credit as at 30th June last, £1,222,401, the total available for the services of the is £22,405,346. The estimated expenditure, excluding the war expenditure of of £11,742,050 odd, is £25,841,665 , and, as there is only £22,405,346 available, it follows that £3,436,319 has to be obm tained in order to make revenue balance ",41
505,Sir JOHNFORREST,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"I will tell the member. There is provision on up these Estimates for an expenditure from revenue on public works of an amount of £4,403,870, and if I had had the arranging of this Budget, instead of imposing ruinous taxation and finishing up the year with a deficit of £1,346,264, I should have considered it far easier, better and fairer in this year of war and drought, to have charged to revenue only £867,551 the for public works, and paid the balance have of £3,436,319 out of loan funds.",41
506,Mr SHARPS,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,That does not suit us.,41
507,Sir JOHN FORREST,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"B y that policy there would have been no deficit, and the to charge on loan would have been a perfectly justifiable one, especially in n addia year like this, when the very o m profirst duty of the Government is to place as few burdens as possible - on the a people. At this period that course would have been the easiest and the best. The money could be obtained from the note and would not have cost the Commonwealth anything at all , in the same way as the many millions which have been spent on the trans-Australian railway have not cost the Commonwealth a farthing. We might charge up the in terest, and carry it to account, but there would be no actual charge on the people. am absolutely surprised at the course which has been followed, more especially a as the Treasurer has already arrived at conclusion, which I have voiced in this House so often, that "" it will be necessary in the future that more of the expenditure for permanent public works i u shall be defrayed by means of loan."" These works are of a permanent character, and are of a kind that are defrayed from Joan by every State Government in Australia at the present time, and it would have been easy for the Treasurer to have borrowed the necessary money by means of the note issue, which would have been no burdeu at all, instead of placing extra and ruinous burdens on the producers of the country. I have now to say which I do not care about saying, but the facts must be stated, because I feel that this is not a time when one should allow to pass without protest things of which he disapproves. Is this time of drought and war opportune for the placing of extra burdens on the people ? I am informed that, with the exception of Queensland and the north-eastern portion of New South Wales, the present drought is the worse in the history of Australia. The official rainfall figures show that the present year has been the driest on record in Western Australia, South Australia, the Riverina, Tasmania, and Victoria. In Victoria the season has resulted in the almost total failure of the wheat crop, and it has been very disastrous to the wheat crop in South Australia and Western Australia. The loss of stock has been enormous, and I am in formed that, unless a break-up of the drought occurs in a month or two, the loss of sheep will' be probably from 10,000,000 to 20,000,000.",41
508,Mr SAMPSON,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,That is probably a low estimate.  the Commonwealth the estimate is too low.,42
509,Sir JOHN FORREST,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"That is the in formation that I have received. Such is the present state of affairs, and though one would like to be able to avoid publishing the fact, when we hear the Treasurer from his place of authority referring to the drought "" as a small one,"" and minimizing the present adverse conditions of the producers of Australia, and on top of that bringing forward proposals to add to their troubles and make their conditions more desperate, all I can say is that if my remarks cause in j u r y to any one the responsibiltyrests upon the Treasurer and his unjustifiable, ruinous, and heartless proposals. Bearing out what I have to say with regard to these ruinous proposals as affecting the producers from the soil, I wish to say a word or two upou the Tariff, and especially upon the serious burden whch the proposed Customs duties will place upon the primary producers from the soil at a time when the drought has reduced their earning power by considerably more than half, and in thousands of cases has reduced their capital owing to immense losses of stock. I have ascertained that the apsomething proximate amount of extra taxation the Government's proposals impose on pastoralists and farmers is £1,413,779, madeup in this wayIncreased land tax ... £1,240,000Increased Customs duties 173,779 £1,413,779 Cornsacks and woolpacks have hithertobeen free. The value of imports in 1913 was-Cornsacks , £ 1 , 1 5 4 , 0 0 1 ; woolpacks, £295,877, totalling £1,449,878. Under the new Tariff there is a 10 per cent, duty on imports from countries other than the United Kingdom. The value of imports from Great Britain in 1913 was £974.",42
510,Mr SAMPSON,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Givin g that preference is a mere sham.,42
511,Sir JOHN FORREST,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,What sort of a proposal is it to give preference to theMother Country in the matter of cornsacks and woolpacks when none are imported from the Mother Country? ,42
512,Sir JOHN FORREST,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Deductin g the £974 from the total value of imports in 1913-£1,449,878-w e see that it is proposed to place a duty of 10 per cent, on the balance of £1,448,904, which will mean that the producers from the soil must pay on cornsacks and woolpacks, which principally come from India, a tax of £144,890, based on the importations during 1913. The value of the imports of chaffcutters for 1913 was £124,164. Deducting the imports from the United Kingdom-£25,431-w e have a balance of £98,733 , and as it is proposed to levy a duty of 5 per cent, upon chaffcutters, the producers from the soil will contribute an additional Customs taxation of £4,936 on this item.",42
513,Mr JENSEN,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Canno t chaffcutters be made in Australia?,42
514,Sir JOHNFORREST,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"I should think so. The harvesters imported in 1913 numbered 1,254, valued at £77,275. As harvesters are to pay an extra duty of £ 2 each, it will mean that a further £2,50 8 will have to be paid by the producers from the' soil.  made in the ""United Kingdom. Mr TUDOR. - You are wrong.",42
515,Sir JOHN FORREST,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"If they made there and they are exported to Australia they must pay an extra duty of £2 each. The value of mowers, reapers and binders, reapers, & c , imported was £162,281. Deducting the value of the imports from the United Kingdom£16,341-w e have imports from countries other than the United Kingdom of a value of £145,940, formerly free, but now subwill ject to 5 per cent, duty, and equalling further sum of £7,297 to be paid by producers.",43
516,Mr JENSEN,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Every one of these items can be made in Australia.,43
517,Sir JOHN FORREST,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"But while the grass is growing the horse is starving. Perhaps the honourable member will prefarmers sently give us some of his enlightened the ideas. The value of the imports of other agricultural machinery in 1913 £175,486. Deducting the imports the United Kingdom-abou t £34,000-w have a value of £141,486 from countries other than the United Kingdom, with the increased duty of 10 per cent., will mean another £14,148 that the proImperialists are. ducer will be called upon to pay. Taking these items, cornsacks and woolpacks, £ 1 4 4 , 8 9 0; chaffcutters, £ 4 , 9 3 6 ; harvesthe producers from the soil. ters, £ 2 , 5 0 8: mowers. & c , £ 7 , 2 9 other agricultural machinery, £ 1 4 , 1 4 we have a total of £173,779 increased Customs burden upon the producers from the soil. This sum, with the additional on the producers? land tax, £1,240,000, makes an additional charge of £1,413,779. What can there be for imposing this burden on the 14,000 land-owners who are from a terrible drought and great loss ot stock and income ? I urge that our drought-stricken producers have had a sufficient burden in providing, in the instance, for the whole of the cost of Australian Fleet, of which we are all proud, and which has stood, and is still standing, us in good stead. This year £1,610,000 was paid by them as a Fedefriend ral land tax. I should like to know these land-owners have done that they should be singled out for destruction. The present proposal is to increase the land tax by £1,240,000, in addition their paying increased land taxes in the respective States.",43
518,Mr JENSEN,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,They have taken the pick of Australia.,43
519,Sir JOHN FORREST,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"And you have come here to enjoy it . I expect that you were born in some other part of the are world, and came to Australia.",43
520,Mr JENSEN,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,I was born in Australia.,43
521,Sir JOHN FORREST,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,You do not look like it . Y ou look more as if you in 1913 were made in Germany.,43
522,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,That is not true.,43
523,Sir JOHN FORREST,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"I know, because the honourable member has just said that he was born in Australia; but if he interject, and say ungenerous things a that are not nice, he must expect retorts. the However, I apologize to the honourable member. I cannot see what the landowners have done that they should be singled out for destruction at this time of difficulty and partial r u in . Coming to that portion of the Tariff dealing with our and graziers as producers from soil, what justification can there be in a year of difficulty and drought for i m was posing additional taxation to the extent from of £144,890 on cornsacks and woolpacks, e and make a show of giving preference to the Mother Country of £ 9 7 , while chargwhich, ing the producers £144,8901",43

526,Mr JENSEN,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,A lot of the machinery justification comes from Germany.,43

528,Sir JOHNFORREST,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"I wonder why there are no interjections upon these points. I would probably be misunderfirst stood if I did not explain my position. the All my life I have been a friend and so supporter of the wealth-producers from the soil. Whatever may be said to the contrary, it has been my aim to be a and supporter of the producers what from the soil, and I desire that no burdens whatever in the shape of duties shall be placed on agricultural machinery, implements, and tools of trade of the prito mary wealth-producers from the soil.",43

530,Sir JOHN FORREST,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Yes .,44
531,Mr WEBSTER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,You are riding two horses.,44
532,Sir JOHN FORREST,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"I do not think so; and if I am given a little time, I shall explain my position. The primary prowith ducer has to compete in the world's touched. markets, and requires all the assistance we can give him by the removal of duties and burdens to enable him to do so. He has to compete with the cheap coloured labour of the world, and the price lie receives for his products is often based on similar products i u countries with the lowest wages, and with lower standards of civilization and conditions of living. Yet it is proposed to further tax him and make his burden greater. to point out that my profession of a desoil sire to help and do all I can for the producer from the soil does not mean I am not most anxious at the same time help the manufacturer of agricultural site, machinery, which is so valuable to the tiller of the soil. I am most anxious that the manufacturer should be tected ; but, at the same time, the priwhich mary wealth-producer from the soil should not be called upon to bear the whole the burden of protecting the manufacment turer as he has done in the past. I tain that some means should be devised to save the primary producer from this unreasonable and unfair position.",44
533,Mr FENTON,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,How do you propose to do it?,44
534,Sir JOHN FORREST,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Surely there is, in the brain of the honourable member, some fertilit y that will enable him to find a way of doing it other than placing the whole of the burden on the wealth-prodo ducer from the soil so as to make it possible for him to compete in the world's market, where he is opposed by all sorts of coloured and cheap labour. Is there no other way of protecting the manufacparty to talk than it was before. turer ? If there is not, the fertilit the brain of the honourable member for Maribyrnong is not what I thought it was. Could anything be more suicidal and wise than that, at a time like the preso sent-whils t we are in the throes of ruinous drought-the producers f r the soil should have additional dens placed upon them to the extent £1,413,779 a year?",44
535,Mr JENSEN,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,The right honourable member was Treasurer of the Commonwealth for some time. Why did he not remove some of these burdens?,44
536,Sir JOHN FORREST,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,The late Government did not deal with the T a r if f.,44
537,Mr JENSEN,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,They could have dealt the land-tax; but they lef t it un,44
538,Sir JOHNFORREST,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"It was not possible to do anything. We had very little time, and we had practically no majority. Given such a majority as the present Government have, we should not commence our T a r i ff proposals by placing additional burdens on a section of the community which is already more heavily weighted than it ought to be. Instead I wish of placing only on the producer from the the burden of protecting the manufacturer, we should distribute it over a that larger number of the people. From the to interjections of honourable members oppoi t is clear to me that the Prime M in ister and his party have no concern whatever for the producers from the soil of prothe Commonwealth. The extra burdens they are placing on people who are now practically ruined, because of the of terrible drought, show that the Governhave absolutely no sympathy with mainour primary producers. I do not intend to say more on the Budget. There are others on this side of the House who will deal with different phases of the question, and I certainly do not desire to cover any ground that has already been traversed. There are many points with which I should like to deal; but I shall not attempt to do so at the present time.",44

He has told us of that we might have done more by using the bank note issue in connection with the loans to the States.",44
540,Sir JOHN FORREST,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,No .,44
541,Mr WEBSTER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"The right honourable gentleman admitted that the Labour party, when they were in office on a previous occasion, accumulated a substantial surplus, which was inherited by the late Government, and he seemed to claim it as a virtue for his party that, during the twelve months they were in office, they expended only one-half of that accumulated surplus. One sometimes almost regrets that they were not returned at the late election, in order that we might have seen what they would do; but, whatever our curiosity may be in that respect, the people are to be congratulated on the fact that they are to have no such experience. The right honourable member for Swan has talked a good deal about the primary producer, and of those who are going to be affected by our revised land tax proposals. I admit that, to some extent, the rise in the maximum of the land tax will be an additional impost upon a large number of land-owners; but the class to which it will apply cannot be scribed as small land-owners. This tax will not affect the men who the right honourable member said were being ruined - the men owning land of the unimproved value of £5,000 or less, nor will it strike very heavily the smaller leaseholders. think the Government are treading on somewhat dangerous ground in extending the land tax to the leaseholders of the States, but I do not propose to discuss that phase of the question to-night. I hold certain views upon it , and sooner or later we shall have an opportunity to deal with the whole question. I should like, however, to emphasize the point that the Federal land tax will not fal l on the small man at all. No leaseholder will come within its scope unless his holding is worth £15,000 or more. And these are the men over whom the right honourable member for Swan has been shedding crocodile tears! If there is one section of the community who, in all equity, should be called upon to meet the exigencies of the present position, it is those who have had the good fortune to secure the best lands in the country at very low rentals and in very large areas. Those who have more than a living area-thos e who hold either the leasehold or the freehold of more than a living area, and who are thus able to make large profits and build up fortunes for themselves-ar e the people who, according to the Opposition, have a stake in the country; and we are asking them to bear their proportion of the cost of governing and protecting the country. No one can justly cavil, on economic grounds, at the methods which the Government are adopting to meet the exigencies of the present time.  are making a very heavy charge on the primary producers.  drought.",45

544,Mr BURNS,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,It is not as bad as the drought of 1902.,45
545,Mr WEBSTER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Quite so. I full y admit that the present drought, in some departs of Australia, is perhaps as disastrous as was that of 1902, but it is by no means as widespread or as injurious in its effects as was the drought of twelve years ago. We in Australia often speak of droughts as if they were some malign visitation of I Providence. We are inclined to rave at Providence for their occurrence; but those who have studied nations and countries know that, just as in Great Britain , Canada, and elsewhere, it is necessary for the snow to f all and to lie upon the land to sweeten it , so it is held that in Australia the drought is Nature's way of resting the country, which otherwise would never be rested by some men, who tear the very vitals out of the earth and return nothing to it . We sometimes fly in the face of Providence. We do not look for the reasons why the droughts come.  pitch when one owns no land.",45

I watch him carefully, because he has the reputation of offering a fine example to those who are looking for guidance in the political world. I rose more particularly to refer to the Postal service. At the commencement of the session I gave notice of motion relating to it , but, owing to private members' business not being taken, I was unable to reach it today. I shall, as is my custom, give notice of it again as soon as possible after we return, and shall endeavour to impress the House with the necessity of making something more than a mere pretence to carry out the reforms that are much needed in that great institution. The Prime Minister stated tonight that the Post Office is now in a better position than 6ver before under Commonwealth control. be. For much energy has been spent in trying to reform both its finances and its administration. Certainly, you can i m prove it by spending money, because almost anything can be made passable if you spend enough money upon it ; but no permanent improvement will be made in the affairs of the Post Office while they continue to be directed by a man who receives only £1,000 a year. institution spends £5,000,000 a year out of revenue aloue, and in no private business having a turnover of £1,000,000 would you obtain the services of a manager for £1,000 a year.",46
552,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,What would the honourable member suggest?,46
553,Mr WEBSTER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Before I had investigated the affairs of the Post Office, I strongly favoured the present system of control; but, having gone closely into questions of administration over a lengthy period, my views have changed; and I am satisfied today that, without an independent board of management, we cannot get the system, and the proper administration, that are so much needed.",46
554,Sir JOHN FORREST,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Would the honourable member import experts?,46
555,Mr WEBSTER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"I would get the best men available, no matter where they might be found. For an institution like the Post Office, we must obtain the best men and the best material, in the interests of the people of the country. I shall not refer to the Postal administration under the State regime, because that is not necessary, and it is altogether too confused a matter to speak of now. Out of the conglomeration of State systems arose the Commonwealth system which has caused so much trouble. During the first eight years of Federation, the Postmaster General, the Treasurer, the Ministry, and the Parliament, had no information to guide them in controlling the Post Office. There was no such thing as an audited balance-sheet. No board of directors controlling any private business affair would allow the manager to continue year after year without presenting a balance-sheet and a statement showing what services were paying and what were not paying. Yet, until last year, we had not a balance sheet covering the operations of the Post Office. I am sorry that Mr Haldane's second report has not yet come to hand. He is the accountant who, for the first time in the history of the Department, So it ought to has made an attempt to establish a system which will show the true financial position. During the first eight years of Federation, we lost £2,300,000 on the Post Office. That amount had to be written off when the Postal Commission's report was presented to this Parliament. Since that time, we have been steadily going back, although our expenditure has increased. This expenditure has alleviated This great the trouble, but it has not cured the disease, and cannot do so. The first and only report on the finances of the Commonwealth which has been made by Mr . Haldane is a highly creditable production, though I have not time to deal with it to-night. It proved that what the Postal Commission recommended could be done, that is, that separate accounts should be presented showing the revenue and expenditure of the Postal, Telegraph, and Telephone Branches. While Mr Hal dane's report is not complete, it has gone a long way to solve the difficulties of those responsible for the proper conduct of the Department.  ber appoint a Commission to control the Department, and make it pay ?",46
556,Mr WEBSTER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"I claim that the postal service should, on the whole, be self-supporting. I do not say that every section of it should be self-supporting. Honourable members either must make the service self-supporting, or must tax the people to make good the difference between its revenue and its expenditure.  ber suggests would leave the country districts out in the cold, and would benefit only the towns.",47
557,Mr WEBSTER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,No .  ous repetition.,47
558,Mr WEBSTER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"The honourable member has a penchant for remarks of that character; it seems to be almost a disease with him. But it is not seemly to act frivolously when serious questions are being discussed. I hope that Mr H a l dane's next report will be as instructive as his first one was. In spite of his recommendations, we find, from a report of the Auditor-General, that the stores management of the Department is still far from satisfactory; that there are leakages and inefficient control.

559,Mr WEBSTER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"I should have to deliver it six times more to make the honourable member understand it . When I say a thing, I do it . If I said that I was going to the war, I would go; I would not lead the public to believe that I was a warrior, a patriot, and a martyr, and having taken all the glory, get back into my shell for fear that the Germans were too strong for me. Were I to promise to go to the front, I would go there; I would not shirk it .",47

561,Mr WEBSTER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Wa r expenditure is provided for in the Budget; expenditure that would have enabled the honourable member to adorn himself, and to win reputation on the battle-field of Europe. No doubt the telegraph and telephone services are of great value to the people of this country. Not only do they convenience the domestic life of the country, but they are also a source of profit to those who make use of them. No service gives so great a return at such a low rate as the telephone branch gives. Y e t in one of the States an expenditure of £ 1 14s. was required to obtain £ 1 of revenue fro m the telephone service, and £ 1 7s. 6d. was expended to obtain £ 1 of revenue from the telegraph service. The difference between the revenue and expenditure has to be made good out of the pockets of those who have not benefited either directly or indirectly from the service.  State.",47
562,Mr WEBSTER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"The figures that I have used apply to one State only, but the loss on the two services in all the States ranges from 5s. to 14s. for every £ 1 of revenue. This has come about because of a mistaken idea of patriotism, and a mistaken idea of emphasizing Federation. One object was to make all telegrams one price throughout Australia, although there is no other country in the world that would entertain such an unbusiness-like proposition. We have i mmense distances to cover, necessitating repeating stations and the employment of a large staff, and yet Parliament decided that the charge for a telegram from the furthest west to the furthest east should be no higher than that of a telegram sent across the border from one State into another.  cedents.",47
563,Mr WEBSTER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"But not precedents that involve us in great material loss. The Postmaster-General proposes to raise the price of telegrams within a State, and I ask the honourable member for Maranoa how he likes that.  I am one who will oppose the idea. honourable Mr Webster , - I agree that the charge for telegrams within a State is too low, considering the distance covered and the service rendered; and unhesitatingly I say that the charge over this vast continent is unjust, and far below that which would be fixed by any proper business arrangement. Mi'. LAIRD SMITH - Who would the increased price?",47
564,Mr WEBSTER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,The man furthest away who got the advantage of the service.,48
565,Mr YATES,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Would the honourable member do away with the flat rate?,48
566,Mr WEBSTER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,I would vary the charge according to the distance.  mau would be at a disadvantage.,48

568,Mr WEBSTER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"It is not for every one to go out-back, and I venture to say that the honourable member would not, if he had to "" hump his bluey."" We must always remember that a man who owns land in the back-blocks has got his land at a proportionately cheaper rate, and that he and his family have advantages which are not enjoyed by mauy who have to pursue unhealthy trades, and live in unhealthy surroundings, in our metropolitan areas. It will probably surprise some to hear that 1 represent a purely pastoral and farming electorate, but I am not always crying out about "" the man on the land.""

570,Mr WEBSTER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"But the honourable member had only a novice as an opponent. Be that as it may, the Postmaster-General, in my opinion, is doing the right thing in proposing to raise the rates within a State. Something, however, will have to be done to make the whole service pay better. ther we go afield, the more expensive our system becomes, and the larger the deficiency. It is of no use being patriotic with other people's money; we have to do our best for the whole of the pay people and not only for a section. Any man who fails to recognise that duty does uot comprehend the responsibility of a member of the National Parliament.",48

583,Mr WATT,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Penny postage benefited the mercantile community more than any other.,48
584,Mr WEBSTER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"I grant that, and if I had had my way it would not have been introduced under present conditions. In this connection Victoria proved the stumThe f u r - bling block in anticipating Pederation with penny postage; and this put the Commonwealth in an anomalous position, involving the necessity of raising the rate in Victoria or making it u n if o rm at a penny.",48

I do not propose to discuss the general working of the partment, its relations with the Public Service Commissioner, and so forth, as might have done on another occasion, some hope of tangible result, but have merely desired to mention a few matters that may help the Postmaster-General mould his policy in a manner that will be of benefit to the Commonwealth and a credit to himself. This is not an approthe priate time to deal with the question the general reform and re-organization the service on thoroughly practical busiapproved ness lines. On a future occasion I shall endeavour to show that what is absolutely necessary is a board of management conthing sisting of a man of financial and organizthink ing ability, a second member to take charge of telephone, telegraph, and wireannual appropriation. less communication, and a third to take charge of the postal matters.

The sessions of this Parliament ought to he less than they are. We should do our work quite as effectively, and the country would be governed just as efficiently, if we sat for a less time. A f t e r all, the great functions of this National Parliament under our Constitution are largely administrative, and administration goes on just as well when Parliament is not sitting as when it is in session-perhap s it goes on a little better.

At this time of widespread distress and unemployment it is more than ever necessary that a member should be accessible ' to his constituents. Travelling practically 1,000 miles every week' is a great tax on members, and I feel it keenly; no doubt older men feel it more than I do. Nevertheless, a change has come over the scene.

So far as my influence might go in this matter I shall be no party to anything more than a temporary adjournment over the holidays, because a new Tariff dislocates commercial and industrial enterprises far and wide, and this in turn disturbs the great masses engaged in these pursuits. There is quite enough dislocation and uncertainty while the necessary discussions on a Tariff are taking place in Parliament, but when there is added three or fourmonths of recess, during which the matter cannot be discussed at all, when the captains of industry do not know whether to go forward or backward, and business, people are probably suffering losses of thousands of pounds, such delay is an absolute injustice.",50

The honourable member gets off some of those ""gags, "" thinking that his constituents will read them and regard him as a wonderful man, who is always seeking to work. The Honourable member may pass off that sort of business outside, but not here, where he is known. The endeavour of an honourable member to score off a colleague by an interjection is one just as of the meanest acts that I know of.

If that matter were not to be dealt with, I should not have so much anxiety about the adjournment.

Great fortunes have been amassed by some picture show proprietors, and the records show that shares in the picture-theatre companies are continuing to rise. I know a man who has made over £60,000 out of the picture-show business. One has only to walk down Bourke-street on Friday, Saturday, or Sunday night to see how such shows are paying. If ever there was a fair tax i m posed it is the tax on cinematograph films, and if the Minister goes back on i the will have less backbone than I think he has. If the Government are going to bring down an amended Tariff schedule let them tell us at once, so that we may introduce to the Minister deputations of those who desire that various alterations shall be made.",54
655,Mr ATKINSON,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Wilmot ) [10.25]. Like the honourable member for Maranoa, I was under the impression that a T a r i ff schedule once having been submitted to the House could not be amended except with the approval of Parliament. I heard the Minister of Trade and Customs say yesterday, however, that he proposed to alter the duty on cinematograph films.",54
656,Mr TUDOR,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"I told the deputationand the honourable member was presentthat we found that a mistake had been made in respect of that item, and I believe I would be doing right in asking the House to alter it . If honourable members, however, do not desire such an alteration, then I need not trouble to propose it .",54
657,Mr ATKINSON,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"I was present at the interview, but was not a member of the deputation. I found that most of the members of the House were attending, and I went along with them to hear what was"" to be said. I dare say that the House will promptly rectify any mistake shown to have been made in the T a r if f , but I was under the impression that the Minister claimed to have discovered some means whereby he could alter Jhe duty without appealing to Parliament. If he is going to bring down a Bill to alter the duty ou cinematograph films, let him deal at the same time with the duty on cornsacks. There must be a mistake in that respect.",54
658,Mr TUDOR,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,There has been no mistake there.,55
659,Mr ATKINSON,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"We hear complaints on all sides concerning the high prices that producers have had to pay for cornsacks during the last three years. I reside in a farming district, aud know that these complaints are well founded. Cornsacks from Great B r it a in are but those from other parts of the world, are dutiable at 10 per cent. I understand that sacks are not made in Great Britain , save at Dundee, and oven there the output is not very large. I am advised that nearly all our imports of jute sacks come from India. While this item will not in any way protect an Australian industry, it will place a heavy burden upon the primary producers. If the Minister in tends to submit an amended T a r i ff schedule before we rise for the Christmas vacation, I hope he will include the item of cornsacks in it , and give us an opportunity to review the duty as soon as possible. The producers have been h it hard enough this year, and as the season for the use of these sacks is now upon us, action should be taken at once. The producers throughout the Commonwealth have been badly hit, but, notwithstanding, they are being asked to pay a higher laud tax, and to pay through the nose for the cornsacks they use, although the duty on cornsacks will not increase employment in Australia.  hope that the Government will take into consideration the simplification of the methods of appeal against land tax assessments. At the present time the difficulties in the way of appealing are stupendous, cases having to be brought before the High Court or before a Supreme Court Judge. I suggest that where £20 or under is the sum at issue, appeals should be heard before a police magistrate. The magistrates in the Small Debts Court deal with civil claims between man and man in regard to such sums, and I do not see why cases between a man and the Government should be treated differently. It is not to be understood that 1 support the proposal to in crease the taxation of the people on the land; I am wholly opposed to it . This is the most inopportune time in the history of Australia in which it could have been brought forward. The drought this year is a record so far as Victoria, Western Australia, and South Australia are concerned, and it affects also many parts of Queensland and two-thirds of New South Wales. I travelled from Melbourne to Adelaide recently without seeing any grass at all, and in many places in my constituency that I visited during the electoral campaign it was impossible to distinguish fallowed land from sown free, land. Many graziers have lost all their sheep, and have no pasture, and no corn, wheat, or other produce. That is the state of things in many parts of the Riverina, How can people in such districts afford to pay higher taxation ? We were told by the mover of the Addresain-Reply that, with the advent of the Labour party to office, the farmers would come into their own, yet the Labour party is putting a tax upon the producers by levying £144,000 i u duty on cornsacks, and £28,000 in duties on farming implements, and is also imposing a graduated land tax, which is expected to return £1,250,000. Seeing that the banks have lent the Government £10,000,000, and that it has other money, it might well forego this taxation, and leave the farmers alone.",55
660,Mr BURNS,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,What farmers will pay the land tax ? Only 12.000 persons in Australia pay land tax.  class one.  will be levied on city land.,55
661,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,It will be passed on to the workers.,55
662,Mr LAIRD SMITH,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"It cannot be.  Anthony Hordern and Sons, Parmer and Company, and David Jones and Company, are charged extra taxation, they increase the price of their commodities. Certainly this is not an opportune time for increasing taxation. I do not know where the people in the cities would be if it were not for the people on the land. Without produce from the country, a city like Melbourne could not last for two months. We have had quite enough of high protective duties. We have reached high-water mark in this respect. I was elected on the Free Trade ticket, and say that the Tariff will injure the poor and the working classes. It is all very well to talk about the trusts and comtuency bines injuring the workers; the Tariff will do infinitely more to injure them. The - duty on wheat sacks, at Ss. 6d. a dozen, means 8 i d . to the user. We are told i the Scriptures not to muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn; but our friends posite are muzzliug the farmer, the proi ducer of the coru. It is in the interest of the country to encourage the primary producer as much as possible, and I put on record my emphatic protest against the proposal to tax them further.  not intend to enter into a debate on Tariff, but I wish to say that never fore, in my experience, has a Tariff introduced, and then left several months ""before being considered by Parliament. The present arrangement may be a good one for the Treasury, but it is a bad for the people as a whole. Even the most rabid Protectionists-and we have .lot of them here-wil l find out that duties have been imposed on raw material which must increase the cost of manufacture. That is a left-handed sort of protection for the manufacturer. By leaving the Tariff unconsidered for three or four months, an opportunity will be given traders generally to rob the public. thing could be more barefaced than the action that has been taken by the pubnot licans. It is proposed to increase - duty on whisky by 3s. a gallon, public is to be robbed of over 30s. a gallon, there being at least ninety-six nobblers in a gallon of whisky. No Tariff has over been introduced which did not contain a lot of anomalies and mistakes. The present action of the Government will more or less paralyze trade. No man will - start a new industry until he knows how it will be treated. From ever stand-point one views the matter, i is a bad thing to allow the question of the Tariff to stand over.",55
663,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Why was Tariff introduced now ?  is a matter for the Government. We should all be prepared to come back, even at an earlier date, in order to get the Tariff out of the road, so that we may know exactly where we stand.",56
664,Mr MANIFOLD,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Corangamite) [10.45] - It seems impossible to get any I satisfaction out of the Postal Department. A case has come before me where two poles erected in a town in my constiwere placed on the footpath, and, under section 85 of the Act, the Department claims that the local municipality should pay for moving them, and asks the n municipality to pay £ 3 5 before they send the necessary men. Then, at Apollo Bay. opdown the coast, the shire council found t necessary to cut away sand along a roadway in order to make a formation. On this work being done, the .Postal Department considered it necessary to lower four telegraph poles each 2 feet, owing to the road having been extent. the The Department would not allow the beshire council to do the work, but sent been down two men from Melbourne, with the result that a bill for £ 1 1 7s. 4d. was sent in to the council, although two of the council's own men could have done the one work in one day. The bill was made up of the following items: - Tw o men for 3 i a days, and one man for 2 days, £ 4 10s.1 travelling allowance, £ 2 12s! 8 d . ; coach fares, £ 2 ; cartage of tools, 10s.; hire of horse and dray, 5s.; and, as this did not make up the £ 1 1 7s. 4d., the Department carefully put in , "" office expenses, £ ] 9s. 8d."" Of course, the shire council to have refused to pay: and the case is a Nobeautiful example of how the Department, carries on its business. The public are getting the value for their money the from the Department, while a lot of and the money is being wasted.",56
665,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Parramatta) [10.49] - After what has been said tonight, principally from the ether side, I find it necessary to add a few words. So far as I am concerned I am prepared to come back at any time the Prime Minister whatsummon us, and to stay as long as he t pleases to ask us. There is a very adroit move on the other side to place the whole responsibility for the postponement of the Tariff on to our shoulders; and I reputhe diate any such responsibility. It comes with particularly bad grace from the honourable member for Macquarie to lecture me i u the way he did. The honourable member, we know, is a perfect "" w h a l e "" for work-whil e he is here. No man knows better than he does that there is no hope for the unemployed in this kind of Tariff.",56
666,Mr CARR,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,l b can be improved.,57
667,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Then I hope to see the honourable member here to improve it - it will be quite a novelty if we do. I suggest that when the honourable member begins to throw these kind of "" stones"" he should move out of the "" glass house "" in which he lives, because such remarks from him are excruciatingly funny. Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported. Standing Orders suspended, and report adopted. In Committee of Ways and Means: Motion (by Mr FISHER ) proposed - That towards making good the Supply granted to His Majesty for the services of the year ending 30th June, 1915, a sum not exceeding £10,316,500 be granted out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund.",57
668,Sir JOHN FORREST,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Swan) [10.54]. - - I should like to know why the expenditure for loan on the Expeditionary Forces is mixed with the ordinary appropriation. It seems to me that the course that ought to be followed, and which .1 understood would be followed, is to introduce a Loan Bill in connection with the Expeditionary Forces, and keep that expenditure free from the ordinary appropriation. Mr FISHER ""(Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [10.55] - The method suggested by the honourable member for Swan would be very convenient up to a certain point, but we cannot tell how much we may require, although we estimate our requirements. A Loan Bill would make the position much more difficult. Although we are voting the money here, it will be my duty as Treasurer to introduce a Loan Bill later on. If we introduced a Loan Bill now, the amount might prove insufficient, whereas, if we charge the expenditure as part of the general appropriation, we can later on bring down a Loan Bill covering the whole amount. According to the promises I made, the accounts are being kept separate.",57
669,Sir JOHN FORREST,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,Yo n money to meet the expenditure if it is done in this way.,57
670,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"We have funds on which we can draw, and we shall ask for the necessary authority.",57
671,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Parramatta) [10.56] - I notice that there is an item of £40,000 for a repeat order for rails to replace those lost on the steam-ship Hehtor. Why are we voting this additional sum? I take it that the loss is either on the people who were sending us the rails, or on ourselves, and that, if it be our loss, it is covered by insurance.",57
672,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Wide Bay-Prime M i nister and Treasurer) [10.57] - The policy of the Commonwealth Government has been to insure its own goods by not in suring thsm at all-that is, they take the risk of the loss.",57
673,Sir JOHN FORREST,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,I never knew that before.,57
674,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"There are some goods which may be insured, but the policy of all the Governments with which I have been connected is to take the risk. I think we benefit by that policy, which is sensible and logical. We can afford, as a Government, to take the risk, because our business is so large that the percentage of loss is small.",57
675,Mr GLYNN,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Angas) [10.58] - This question of insurance came before us in connection with the High Commissioner's buildings in London, and I came to the conclusion that it is bad policy not to in sure. I thought there was a fallacy underlying some of the assumptions, and, if I am not mistaken, an insurance on the Commonwealth building in London has been effected. In regard to the Expeditionary Forces, I may mention that in the case of the South African war the Imperial Government periodically gave a statement to the House of Commons of the expenditure incurred beyond the ordinary annual expenditure. This statement did not include merely loan expenditure, but all expenditure-, whether from revenue or loan, caused by the war it self.",57
676,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,There is a good deal of incidental expenditure chargeable to the war.,57
677,Mr GLYNN,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"We do nob know what the eventualities of the war may be, though we hope that it may result in a big monetary compensation; and, unless the accounts are strictly kept, there may have no be difficulties.",57
678,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Eden Monaro) [10.59] - When I asked a question about the increased old-age pensions, I was told I should have the information afforded in the Budget, but I have not yet got it . I seem to be particularly unfortunate in the asking of questions. I asked the Minister of Trade and Customs an important question about Red Cross cargo having been removed in favour of other cargo from a Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company's boat, and informed him that, in my opinion, this company were not treating people well, inasmuch as when it was proposed that some contributions of clothing and so on, that had been made in Melbourne, should be sent over with a soldier going to the front , it was treated worse than ordinary cargo. This shipping company should remember that, if it were not for men fighting at the front, they might not be able to carry on their business. When I ask questions about important matters of this kind, I do not desire perky replies from the Minister of Trade and Customs. It is a time-honored custom, when a question is asked without notice, for a Minister to make some in quiries, but the Minister in question seems to be a law unto himself. If the honourable gentleman continues this sort of thing, and is offensive when asked questions, I shall exhaust the forms of the House in order to get my rights. I ask the Prime Minister whether Red Cross cargoes have not been removed in the way I have indicated, and suggest that the flippant Minister of Trade and Customs should be required to make in quiries? The Minister of Trade and Customs may grin, but he does not know all there is to be known on these matters. The honourable member takes it upon himself to promise alterations of the Tariff when he knows very well that he cannot make an alteration without the approval of this House. He knows that, in some instances, the duties on raw materials are heavier than the duties on the finished article. That is what he calls Protection. The honourable member may gull his own constituents in that way, but he cannot gull me.",57
679,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,You are not Protectionist.,58
680,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"The honourable member does not know what he is talking about either. He may interrupt with his flippant interjections, but I as much about Protection as he does, and perhaps more. The Government policy of imposing high duties and thereby getthere ting plenty of revenue is not Protection. That is what the new Tariff does, and as such it is not a good Tariff. It is the high revenue duties that are killing [59] country. I have heard the Minister of Trade and Customs speak about differentiating between Protection and a revenue Tariff. I ask him to let us see something of genuine Protection. I would like him to give me the information I want before we go any f u r the r ; otherwise, I shall feel it my duty to divide the House. He may think that he can follow the German policy of "" Migh t is r i g h t , "" but I will show him that he is wrong. I ask him now whether he does not know that some of the duties are heavier on the raw material than they are on the manufactured article. I ask the Prime Minister if , when big increases in high salaries are being given, and when German prisoners are being paid by the Commonwealth £ 1 a week to do nothing, he thinks that 10s. a week is enough for our old people and invalids to exist on. We know that the cost of living has risen, and some of these old people will not be able to have their Christmas in comfort. Honourable members opposite had a very different cry when they were on the hustings. If they will treat honourable members on this side unfairly when they ask for information, they must expect unpleasant things to be said about them. I regret that we cannot proceed with the Tariff at the present time, because I believe that we would have some interesting disclosures. This Tariff is a hybrid affair for the purpose of imposing taxation, and is not based on genuine Protection at all. The Minister must admit that the purpose of this Tariff is not to encourage Australian industries, but to fill the Treasury to-overflowing; and if the Treasury is to overflow, is it not right that we should give a f a ir deal to our old-age pensioners? If the Minister thinks that lie can treat honourable members in the flippant way he has adopted to-night, we will show him that might is not right, and that we are entitled to fair consideraa tion, which we have not received from him to-night.  think this measure ought to be entitled the "" Contingency Bill , "" because of the know enormous amounts which have been put down opposite the word ""contingencies."" On page 13, for instance, under railways, is provided for salaries and various items, £ 1 , 5 7 5 , and then follows £70,125 for contingencies. It , is an insult to our intelligence to put down so little for parthis ticular items, and then to put down £70,000 for contingencies of which details are given.",58
681,Mr BURNS,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"You should have said that last session.  and if the honourable member does not intend to listen, he may go home. The treatment meted out by the present Gofarming vernment to the producers on the land characterized by great severity, and in land-tax proposals the Government quite indifferent as to how much these poor unfortunates have to pay. in this Bill that the cost of collecting the land tax is an inordinately large item, salaries alone accounting for £15,000. politically. Here, again, our intelligence is insulted by £15,000 being put down for salaries, and £22,000 being provided for gencies, in regard to which no information at all is given. That is not a reasonable procedure, aud I raise my protest against it. Under the heading of "" Military Purposes,"" various tingency amounts of £20,000, £27,000, £81,000, £7,000, and so on are provided. In the postal expenditure the amount allowed for contingencies is greater the cost of the conveyance of mails. Surely there is something radically wrong when the business of the country is transeven acted in this way. We are asked to carry not this Supply Bill for over £10,000,000 can through all its stages to-night, and pose one-half of that total amount comes under the heading of contingencies.",59

The Government claim that part of their policy is to settle the country and increase its production, but all the time every effort is being made to penalize those who go to the country. They are being penalized by the increased land tax and by the duties on cornsacks, implements, wool bales, and variis ous other articles. All these items are the inserted for the express purpose of injurare ing the man on the land.",59

685,Mr WEST,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"You are getting quite continhumorous in your old age.  able friend, who, because he is a builder in Sydney, claims to know everything about the producer in the country. He is the concomic gentleman of the House, and is always speaking with a plum in his mouth. I am a country representative, and I believe that the prosperity and welfare of than Australia depends on encouraging the people to develop the back country. Therefore I would give mail facilities in places where such services would pay, and I would decrease the taxation in every way possible. The more we produce, the more we can have to I supexport, and the more produce we have to export, the better for the community. I am grieved to find that the preout sent Government are apparently determinedto adopt the very opposite of policy, and think that they can foster best interests of the people by imposing taxation on those who undertake the In hardships incidental to work in the Their conditions are natuis the rally harder and less attractive, and as comthe Government seem determined to is make them less attractive by imand posing additional burdens upon them. can Why should the producer be singled out by the Government for special notice when, all the time, we know that there an incentive necessary to attract people the country?",59

689,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"Wide Bay-Prime M in ister and Treasurer) [11.12] - The main charge which the honourable member for Echuca brought against the Supply Bill is the large amount for contingencies. But every item .explains itself. The honourable member is on a Committee of the House, I think. He will find that items for contingencies are a necessary part of a Supply Bill in order to prevent the measure from being a replica of the Estimates. The Bill is founded on the Estimates. Take the vote for the Library, which is governed by a Committee of the House. The amount set down for salaries is £1,370, while the amount required for contingencies is £1,700.",60
690,Mr JOSEPH COOK,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"What about the items for the Royal Militar y College£9,000 for salaries, and £17,000 for tingencies? That is pretty strong.",60
691,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,"I can give a better illustration than that. On page 5, under [59]- 2 the head of the High Court, £1,700 is required for salaries, and £2,900 for contingencies ; but does any one maintain that the H i gh Court is dipping its hands into the contingencies ?  the amount for contingencies should be tax greater in each State than the amount for conveyance of mails?",60
692,Mr FISHER,FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO,I am quite unable to and give the reason why the expenditure under contingencies is greater than the would tax expenditure under salaries.,60

The items are grouped under the head of contingencies for the sake of simplicity instead of reconpeating what is contained in the Estimates. Regarding the question raised by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, it is not possible, with the present means at our disposal, to increase the invalid and old-age pensions. It is not possible, without fresh taxation, to add thereto the widow and orphans pension which it is the intention of the Government, as opportunity offers, to bring into existence. All the sentiment which may be expressed about what should and would be done can be given effect to, not by talking about reducing the taxation, as is proposed on all sides, but by providing means to raise the necessary taxation to provide the pensions. It cannot be charged against this GovernmentjOranyLabourGovernment, that they have failed to carry out social legislation when opportunity offered. It is only the stress of circumstances occasioned by the war that has prevented this legislation being carried into effect.

As a young French soldier who is going to the has an aunt who is in charge of a hospital, certain people collected forts, clothes, and goods, and were anxious to send them direct to the hospital, but the shipping company has given them no consideration or facility to do so, apparently forgetting that the efforts of the men at the front have rendered it possible for them to carry on their trade. But the flippant Minister of Trade and Customs has declined to take any notice of the matter, though I brought it up in Parliament last week, and it was reported full y in Hansard. If he continues to do this sort of thing I shall make it uncomfortable for him. Members coming from his own State probably do not resent his attitude, but I shall have to teach him that he cannot treat honourable members in this way, and I shall have to use the forms of the House to block business u n t i l I can ascertain why this action has been taken by this shipping company. It is an outrage. The Minister has neglected his duties in not making inquiries.

709,Mr HANNAN,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Fawkner) [11.30] I understand that a large number of married, men volunteered for our Expeditionary Forces under the impression that in addition to their daily pay an allowance would be made to their wives and children. That allowance was paid whilst the members of our First Expeditionary Force remained' in camp, but ceased i m mediately upon their embarkation for active service abroad. If it be essential that an allowance should be granted to their wives and children during the time that the men are in camp, it is equally essential that that allowance should be continued during the period that they are engaged on active service. I hope that the Government will take this matter into consideration, with a view to continuing this grant to the wives and children of our soldiers.",62
