It was agreed during last Parliament that questions on notice and the replies to them should be handed to the Clerk, without being read, and I suggest that the time of the House is now being wasted by the Minister replying at length to a question ostensibly asked without notice though in reality notice was given to the Minister informally. Moreover, questions without notice, should, I suggest, relate to matters of real urgency. The Minister is now making a statement which could only properly be made by leave of the House.",13

32,Mr LYONS,CONSIDERATION BY PREMIERS CONFERENCE,"If the Commonwealth Government takes such action, it will be for the first time in the history of this country, and entirely out of keeping with the methods that were adopted by the Scullin Government.

It especially will do all in its power to relieve their distress during the winter months.",16

Further, can the Assistant Minister for Defence inform the House whether the supply of military clothing is so dangerously depleted that mobilization would be retarded if Australia were involved in hostilities?",16
34,Mr FRANCIS,CONSIDERATION BY PREMIERS CONFERENCE,"The Commonwealth Government has distributed as much as possible of the military clothing that is available, and an investigation is now being made to guide its future action in that direction. I am unable to confirm the fears that he expresses in the coneluding sentence of his question.",16
35,Mr BEASLEY,CONSIDERATION BY PREMIERS CONFERENCE,"As the last war was a war to end war, and as the Commonwealth Government has set aside a considerable sum of money to send a delegate to the Disarmament Conference, surely the matter of the mobilization of troops should not arise; so that any available military clothing should be distributed to the unemployed who are in need of covering. Mr SPEAKER,-Order ! The honourable member has made a statement, instead of asking a question. That he is not entitled to do.",16
36,Mr R GREEN,CONSIDERATION BY PREMIERS CONFERENCE,"Is the Assistant Minister for Defence aware that his predecessor in the Scullin Government declared in this House that the Lang Government of New South ""Wales refused to pay freight on any military clothing that was made available for distribution among the unemployed; further, that it would not transport such clothing free over its system of railways? Do those conditions still obtain?",16
37,Mr FRANCIS,CONSIDERATION BY PREMIERS CONFERENCE,"Yes . The New South Wales Government will not hold itself responsible foithe distribution of any clothing that is made available to the unemployed by the Commonwealth Government, nor will it pay the cost of dyeing such garments, an obligation that is cheerfully undertaken by the other States. As a result the Commonwealth Military Commandant, at the Victoria Barracks, Sydney, has to distribute the clothing, while different charitable institutions in New South Wales bear the cost of dyeing.",16

42,Mr HOLLOWAY,CONSIDERATION BY PREMIERS CONFERENCE,"Will the Prime Minister consider the advisability of giving honourable members as much time to debate the unemployment problem as was given to the House yesterday to discuss the duties on tobacco ? I ask the question in an endeavour to help, not' to hinder, and in the hope that our joint counsel may be of some assistance in overcoming the difficulty.",16
43,Mr LYONS,CONSIDERATION BY PREMIERS CONFERENCE,"If we made as little progress in such a debate as we made yesterday when we discussed the tobacco industry, the proposal of the honourable member would be of no practical help to the Government or to the country.",16
44,Mr RELET,CONSIDERATION BY PREMIERS CONFERENCE,"Will the Prime Minister inform the House who are the members of the special Cabinet sub-committee that is inquiring about the relief of unemployment? If the Minister for Customs is not a member of that body, will the Prime Minister take steps to ensure that that gentleman is kept closely in touch with the committee's desires, so that men may be retained in work rather than thrown out of industry?",17
45,Mr LYONS,CONSIDERATION BY PREMIERS CONFERENCE,"The members of the special sub-committee are the AssistantTreasurer (Mr Bruce), the Vice-President of the Executive Council (Senator MCLachlan), Senator Massy Greene, and myself. The committee is in a position to obtain any information it desires from the customs or any other department.",17
46,Mr ROSEVEAR,CONSIDERATION BY PREMIERS CONFERENCE,"In view of the fact that the Assistant Treasurer is a member of the sub-committee of Cabinet which is inquiring into unemployment, and that he has expressed the opinion that the solution of unemployment depends upon the cultivation and encouragement of .private enterprise, will he analyse his theory by applying it to the experience of the United States of America, the home of private enterprise, where there is an army of 10,000,000 unemployed people?",17
47,Mr BRUCE,CONSIDERATION BY PREMIERS CONFERENCE,It is a little difficult to discover the exact meaning of the honourable member's question; but if he has the slightest knowledge of world affairs he will appreciate the fact that the troubles of the United States of America are part of a world-wide financial and industrial disturbance. In some other countries-of which the State which the honourable member represents is an outstanding example-simila r troubles have been accentuated by the actions of their governments. COTTON INDUSTRY .,17
48,Mr BERNARD CORSER,CONSIDERATION BY PREMIERS CONFERENCE,"In view of the fact that the alterations which the Government has made in the cotton, duties has led to the cancellation by the spinners of the agreement which they had made for the purchase of this season's lint from the Queensland Cotton Board, and that the board is not prepared to accept the alternative proposal made by the spinners, will the Minister for Trade and Customs inform me what action the Government proposes to take to overcome the deadlock which has occurred, and to ensure that a market will be found for this season's lint?",17
49,Mr GULLETT,CONSIDERATION BY PREMIERS CONFERENCE,This subject will be discussed when the tariff schedule is brought before honourable members at an early date. NA INQUIRY. METHO D OF PRESENTATION OF BUDGET.,17
50,Mr R GREEN,PUBLIC ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE,"Prio r to the dissolution of the last Parliament, the Public Accounts Committee had almost completed an important inquiry, in camera, on the method of the presentation of public accounts to Parliament. In view of the fact that that report might be of great value to both the Commonwealth and State Governments, and that it could be presented without incurring auy expense other than that of printing, will the Prime Minister see whether arrangements can be made for it to be presented to Parliament?",17

Motion (by Mr Fenton) agreed toThat he have leave to bring in a bill for an act relating to broadcasting. Bill brought up, and read a first time. SECOND READINO.",20
83,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Maribyrnong-Post master-General) [3.23] - by leave- I move That the bill be now read a second time. Broadcasting has, within recent years, assumed large proportions, and has become a matter of the greatest importance. It was said at one time that broadcasting was a toy, a mere plaything, but it has since developed far beyond that stage, and has become of national, and even international, importance. It has been encouraged in every possible way by practically all civilized countries. Australia was quick to take advantage of this new science. Broadcasting is still in its infancy, being only about ten or twelve years old. It is true that experiments were carried out before then, but it was not until 1922 that any systematic effort was made in the United States of America and Great Britain. In 1924 programmes were first broadcast to listeners-in in Australia. Since the first broadcasting stacions were established great progress has been made both in Australia and abroad. Mistakes occurred, as was only natural, but, on the whole, listeners-in have been well served, while even greater benefits are in store for them. The system of control proposed in this bill is, as near as practicable, that which is in operation in Great Britain, where the controlling body is known as the British Broadcasting Corporation. Australia cannot, of course, be expected to follow Great Britain slavishly; but there are many good points in the British system which we can with advantage adopt here. It is intended to introduce the mission system of broadcasting control in Australia. In Great Britain and in most other countries broadcasting was first undertaken by private enterprise, but very soon governments found that the business was assuming such enormous proportions, and was becoming so popular, that some system of national control was desirable, aud it was brought into association with the post office. Up to the .present, licence holders in Australia have paid in fees no less than £2,500,000, and the present annual revenue amounts to £403,000. The Amalgamated Wireless Company, in recognition of the patent rights which it holds, receives 3s. out of the 24s. licence-fee paid by each listener-in.",20
84,Mr GIBSON,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,Are those rights still recognized ?,21

86,Mr WHITE,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"The company paid only £40,000 for the patent right in the first place.",21
87,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Thes e royalties are being investigated now, and we are hopeful that, as a result, the amount paid to the company will be considerably reduced.",21
88,Mr BEASLEY,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,Canno t the Government find out the true position from its repre- service. sentative on the board of the Amalgamated Wireless Company?,21
89,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"It is largely matter. It has been before the Australian and New Zealand courts, the New Zealand Government having taken up the cudgels on behalf of its licence holders. Owing to some mistake, the case on behalf of the licence holders in Australia was withdrawn, and a verdict was given on the ex parte evidence tendered by the company. The Amalgamated Wireless Company receives each year £50,000 out of the licence-fees.",21
90,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,Does not the Commonwealth get half of that?,21
91,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"The Commonwealth is a shareholder in the company, but I do not know exactly what it receives.",21
92,Mr GIBSON,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Las t year the Commonwealth received only £21,000.",21
93,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"It is right that the com- licence holders should know how the money they pay is being divided. As I have said, the Amalgamated Wireless Company received £50,000. The Australian Broadcasting Company, which provides programmes for the A class stations, received £202,000, and the Government, which gets 9s. out of each fee of 24s., drew £151,000. A portion of the money received by the Government is spent on providing and maintaining equipment and expert technical service; but after that has been done, there is still, I am glad to say, a considerable amount which finds its way into the Treasury. The revenue of the British Broadcasting Corporation is now over £2,037,200 per annum, and it is distributed in these proportions-Pos t Office, £203,720; British Broadcasting Corporation, £1,370,090; and the Treasury, £463,390. The two government departments, Treasury and Post Office, take over £066,000 of the total revenue.",21
94,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,Upon a per capita basis the return to the Commonwealth is equally high.,21
95,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"The figures I have mentioned dispose of the belief held in many quarters that since broadcasting was handed over to a corporation in Great Britain, the Government has not participated in the revenue from the",21
96,Mr WHITE,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,The fee to the public in Great Britain is only about one-third of a legal that charged in Australia.,21
97,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"It is not so high; in many other countries it is about the same as that charged in Australia, and in some countries it is - higher. The broadcasting system in Great Britain is controlled by five governors, who are operating under a charter, and are assisted by a director and an organizer. The British Broadcasting Corporation was singularly fortunate in obtaining the services of Sir John Reith, under whose capable direction it has developed into one of the finest institutions in the United Kingdom. The fact that a first class broadcast is listened to by over 15,000,000 people' indicates what a wonderful part this service plays in the lives of the people. The Government has decided to adopt the British system of control, and the bill learned now before the House follows very closely that prepared under the direction of my predecessor, the honourable member for trol Kalgoorlie (Mr A. Green). Government decided unanimously on commission control, to follow the British system as closely as Australian conditions will permit. I remind the House, however, of the extent to which our conditions differ from those in Great Britain. The British Broadcasting Corporation operates in England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, an area of 95,000 square miles; it serves 46,000,000 people, and has an annual revtenue of over £2,000,000. Australia's area is nearly 3,000,000 square miles; its population is only 6,500,000, and the broadcasting revenue £400,000. A considerable proportion of tlic income of British Broadcasting Corporation is derived from the sale of periodicals, magazines, and newspapers. It is a very thorough organization, and I do not know of any other institution of modern times that has done so much for the entertainment, education, and intellectual uplift of the British people. I had the pleasure of meeting Sir John Reith when I was in England. At that time the principal broadcasting station was on Savoy Hill, but' since then the corporation has established a new station, which is undoubtedly the most complete and up to date in the world. To illustrate the lengths to which a government will go to obtain reliable data for its guidance in the establishment of a broadcasting system, I may mention that the Canadian Government'appointed a commission, over Mr Fenton. which Sir John Aird, president of the Canadian Bank of Commerce, presided. The commission visited the United States of America, United Kingdom, Erance, Germany, Italy and other European countries. I quote two brief extracts from its report. Everywhere in Europe we found inquiries being conducted under government auspices for the purpose of organizing broadcasting on a nationwide basis in the public interests. . . . We have examined and considered the facts and circumstances as they have come before us. As our foremost duty, we have concentrated our attention on the broader consideration of the interests of the listening public and of the nation. Prom what we have in our investigations and studies, we are impelled to the conclusion that these interests oan be adequately served only by some form of public ownership, operation, and conbehind which is the national power and prestige of the whole public of the Dominion The of Canada. I agree with those sentiments. Broadcasting is not an ordinary activity. Not only does it carry entertainment and education into the homes of the people, but it gives helpful information to even the remotest settlements. Broadcasting would be a simple operation if it were merely to serve city interests, but, particularly in countries of wide expanses, the cities must contribute more or less to the privileges enjoyed by the rural folk.",21
98,Mr WHITE,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,That is always so.,22
99,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"It is, and country folk will readily admit that, but for the immense revenues collected in the great cities, many of the privileges enjoyed by the rural population could not be provided. That principle is recognized as essential to any broadcasting system. It is undesirable to raise the cry of country versus city. I do not intend to do so, as each is helpful to the other. Iu November last, the New Zealand Parliament legislated for the establishment of a board to control broadcasting. The measure was passed unanimously by both Houses after a brief discussion, and I hope that this bill will have the same happy fate. I understand that the board in New Zealand is already doing remarkably well. Early in the history of Australian broadcasting four large A class stations were established, the two principal ones being 3LO Melbourne, and 2FC Sydney. Some of the later stations are built on Commonwealth property and some are leased. The Government proposes to take over from the broadcasting companies the services they operate, and to place them under the control of a commission. The programmes will be provided by that body, and for the present, at any rate, the technical part of the operations will be controlled by the Postal Department, which already has the requisite staff and plant. The capital value of the technical assets owned by that department and used permanently for broadcasting is £210,000.",22
100,Mr WHITE,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,Will the commission have power to set up later its own technical staff?,23
101,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,That is a matter to be determined later. The Government will expect from the commission advice on all matters relating to the future of broadcasting.,23
102,Mr GIBSON,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,The use of the technical staff of the telephone branch will be obligatory.,23
103,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"That is so. Let no honourable member imagine that in any country broadcasting can be divorced from the postal, telegraphic, and telephonic systems.",23
104,Mr WHITE,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,'The British Broadcasting Corporation has its own technical staff.,23
105,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"It has a very large revenue, and serves only a small area, and the underground channels formerly used for telephones are now available for broadcasting.",23
106,Mr GIBSON,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,It has not to give telephone service over thousands of miles.,23
107,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,That is so.,23
108,Mr RIORDAN,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,Why establish a commission? Cannot the Postal Department control broadcasting?,23
109,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"The Government has decided that control by a commission would be more satisfactory. Broadcasting is a comparatively new science, and every step forward must be taken on sure ground. Therefore, we cannot do better than follow the example of Great Britain in this matter.",23
110,Mr WHITE,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,But this bill provides for a considerable divergence from the British scheme.,23
111,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Yes . If we had a special staff whose sole duty was to attend to the broadcasting operations, heavy, and, I think, unnecessary expenditure, to which the listeners-in . would object, would be involved. The postal, telephone, and telegraphic facilities provided in Australia are available even to the humblest homes in practically every part of Australia, and it will be easy for the officials who have been well trained in supplying those services to look after ihe technical side of broadcasting. Over £200,000 has already been speut on this work, and the Postal Department is splendidly equipped today to continue. The Post Office has on its permanent staff 207 highly trained engineers having a specialized knowledge of all phases of communication services, and 2,700 mechanics who are also specially trained for the same purpose. In its research section, fifteen research engineers are engaged, and these are supported by twelve specially selected mechanics. Apparatus of a precision, character, and of the finest quality obtainable, to the approximate value of £28,000, forms the equipment of the research section. The capital value of the technical assets belonging to the department and used permanently for broadcasting purposes is £210,000. This figure excludes the large number of circuits used permanently for inter-connecting studios with pick-up points, and also excludes the value of telephone circuits used for periodically connecting stations when a chain broadcast is being made. At the present time, the national service is furnished by twelve stations. This bill will not apply to B class stations, nor will it deal with the vexed problem of performing rights, and the charges levied by certain record manufacturers with respect to broadcasting; those subjects must be dealt with by other departments, and by other measures. The problem of copyrights is a legal one for the Attorney-General's Department.",23
112,Mr GIBSON,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,It is an international matter.,23
113,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,Yes .,23
114,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,Performing right charges appear to be based mainly upon an agreement that has been arrived at.,23
115,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"Agreement s have been made,' but' they' have been broken:' I understand that various'*'charges have been made by the Performing Right Association to the owners of the B class stations. Of course, complaints in that regard have been made by those stations; but the matter must be dealt with at another time and under other legislation.",23
116,Mr HUGHES,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"It is entirely pertinent to this debate, I think, to say that the people who pay for the broadcasting service should know how much of their money goes in performing right fees. Wc pay five times as much in that direction as is charged in Great Britain, Canada, and South Africa together.",24
117,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"All I can say at this stage is that the Government has this subject under serious review, and it is being inquired into by the Attorney(Jeiieral's Department. I believe that we shall be able to introduce a system whereby we shall know the reason for all claims for copyright fees, and we shall know by whom they are made. Speaking off hand, if we were to insist on the registration of copyrights, and even charge a certain fee. it would be beneficial to the national exchequer, as well as helpful to the Performing Right Association and its clients. There are now 12 A class stations in Australia; one is to be opened next week at Crystalbrook, South Australia. In order to have a proper national system, it is essential to build another eight stations, and when we have about twenty of them properly distributed throughout the Commonwealth, the people will be remarkably well served. There are pockets in Australia, as in all parts of the world, where broadcasting is difficult. For instance, it is not so easy to carry on broadcasting operations in Tasmania as in other parts of the Commonwealth.",24
118,Mr GUY,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,And Tasmania receives least consideration.,24
119,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"When the necessary funds are available, Tasmania will be supplied with broadcasting facilities. Even the British Broadcasting Corporation, with its remarkable financial resources, finds difficulty in supplying a completely satisfactory service. I recently read in the Britisli press of serious complaints regarding the broadcasting service supplied to Wales. The Government desires to go on with, the work of erecting additional A class stations, and these will be placed principally in country areas, so that the people in out-back districts may be catered for.",24
120,Mr A GREEN,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,Wester n Australia has not yet an up-to-date .national station.,24
121,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"The difficulties in Western Australia are not similar, I think, to those experienced in Tasmania. Mr A. GEEEN - When will the Western Australian station be erected?",24
122,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"So soon as the Government can obtain the requisite funds. I am quite prepared to admit that it is not fair for the Treasurer to apply to general revenue the foes received from list&ners-in. The Postal Department 1 as received a considerable amount of adverse criticism with respect to broadcasting, ancl this is due, to some extent, to the fa<:t that part of the fees of listeners have been permitted to flow into the genf:. -. revenue. The revenue received in Germany amounts to £4,000,000 per annum, ancl in that country the .postal officials are practically in sole control of broadcasting. A great deal of research is proceeding, and we have officers being trained under the auspices of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. Although the British Broadcasting Corporation has control over the programmes that are broadcast, it is dependent on :he British post office, in the main, for it.* valuable services. The broadcasting work of that post office is almost identical with that of the Australian post office.",24
123,Mr GIBSON,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,Does the British Corporation pay anything to the Marconi Company for patent rights?,24
124,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"I do not know. I understand that quite a number of the charges made in Australia are not justified, and cannot be legally established. I now propose to refer to Empire broadcasting, with which excellent progress is being made. At the last Imperial Conference a special committee was ap pointed to deal with this matter, and certain recommendations were made. A great station is being erected at Daventry, England, and it is being specially constructed for the purpose of transmitting programmes throughout the Empire. The sum voted for this work, £40.000, has been provided out of the publication fund, and the maintenance aud upkeep of the station will involve an expenditure of £42,000 per annum. The difficulty Ln broadcasting programmes throughout the whole Empire is that in some parts it is night time, while in other parts it is day time. But wonderful improvements in broadcasting are anticipated in the near future. It is anticipated that under the Empire broadcasting system, it will be possible for naked blacks to listen-in in the jungle to the world's best operas. We may also reach the period when brownskinned Indians will be able to dance to one of England's best orchestras, and when fur-clad Canadians in distant snowbound outposts may listen to a description of the running of the English Derby. In order to make available to the people of Australia at an appropriate hour programmes which are broadcast in England at night time, extensive use will be made of the Blattnerphone recording apparatus. With this equipment whole programmes may be ""bottled"" and put on the air at whatever hour is most suitable for any particular part of the Empire. This apparatus is capable of recording outstanding musical concerts, radio plays, talks, and in fact everything that is put on the air. I believe that by means of wireless we shall be able to bring the different parts of the British Empire into very close touch with each other. I shall not describe in detail what the British Broadcasting Corporation is able to do, Hut I am not exaggerating when I say that it has organized one of the best orchestras in the world. It will be a great thing Australians if arrangements can be made for them to listen to relays of concerts this orchestra. It should also help to deepen our Empire spirit considerably if we, through the wireless, can listen to greatest British artists, speakers and turers, who participate in broadcast programmes. Television also offers wonderful possibilities. I was an unbeliever vision, and I well remember the feeling I had when, some years ago, I was called upon to participate in the opening of station 3AR in Melbourne and had some notes put in my hand in which it was intimated that the day was not far tant when a farmer sitting in his own home 170 miles from Melbourne would be able to watch the running of the Melbourne Cup, and would know the winner of it as soon as some people on the course at Flemington. Television has undoubtedly bounded ahead. Until comparatively recently, experiments in television were made difficult owing to the lack of finance; but lately millions of pounds have been made available in order to develop this great agency for human instruction and entertainment. I understand that the Baird experts of Great Britain are now collaborating with the German experts with the object of putting into practical operation such principles of television as have been established. While I was in England I had the wonderful experience, at No. 10 Downing Street, of seeing a lady and hearing her speak, although she was twelve miles away from the room in which I was sitting. No doubt the Leader of the Opposition had a similar experience.",24
125,Mr GIBSON,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,Is provision made in this bill for developing television?,25
126,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"The bill, of course, deals mainly with wireless broadcasting; but it is unlikely that the proposed broadcasting commission would overlook any great developments in television. We at present possess in Australia suitable equipment for broadcasting relays of British programmes throughout the Commonwealth. The bill provides for the appointment of a commission of five members for a chairman, a vice-chairman, and three others. The salaries to be by paid to these commissioners are on a modest scale. The chairman is to receive £500 per annum; the vicethe chairman, £400; and the other commislecsioners, £300 each. These are small salaries, but I believe that they will be sufficient to enable us to secure the services of thoroughly capable men.",25
127,Mr MAXWELL,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,I presume they will in telebe part time positions.,25
128,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,"If we were to set out to obtain the whole time services of first class business men, we should have to pay large salaries. The Government feels that disit should embark upon this new era of broadcasting carefully. We'are not in a position to spend large sums of money on salaries. I know that in other parts of the world the directors of broadcasting stations. receive large salaries; but we have already had an indication that it will not be difficult to secure the services of thoroughly capable persons for the reallotted muneration which we are offering.",25
129,Mr BEASLEY,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,What duties are to discharged by the proposed commission,26

The care of the technical side of broadbodies casting will, as I have said, remain the responsibility of the Postmasterferent General's Department. Clause 15 of the bill provides that the commission shall appoint a general manager and such other officers and servants as it thinks necesconditions. sary; but it is also provided that the salaries of the general, manager and the next six most highly-paid executive officers shall be subject to the approval of the Minister. We know very well in some business enterprises it - is the custom to appoint a managing director, while in others control is vested in hoard of directors, which appoints a general manager. The broadcasting mission will be conducted on the latter "" jammed "". lines.",26

I assure honourable members glad that the technical officers of the Government are doing everything possible to conduct our wireless operations in the best possible way.,26

It was recommended that they should be men of independent mind, good judgment, and outstanding ability. I may tell honourable members that it is expected by the Government that at least one lady will be appointed to the Australian commission.",27
143,Mr WHITE,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,Will the commission be authorized to appoint sub-committees as the British Broadcasting Corporation can do?,27
144,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING,Yes ; though these will be only advisory bodies.,27

We hope, of course, that with the developments which will follow, some re-arrangement will be possible in the present allocation; but the commission will certainly have 12s. of each licence fee, as under present conditions. Of tlte remaining 12s., 3s. will be set aside for patent rights, and 9s. will be taken by the Government. I hope that the measure will be kindly treated by honourable members, and receive a speedy passage. Debate (on motion by Mr A. GREEN) adjourned. NA (COMMONWEALTH LIABILITY ) BILL. Bill returned from the Senate, with an amendment. INSURANCE BILL . Debate resumed from the 4th March of (vide page 671), on motion by Mr. BEUOE)That the bill be now read a second time.",27
147,Mr BLAKELEY,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"Darling) [4.17] This bill will be welcomed by the people of Australia, and the members of my party will not oppose it. I regret that the Government has incorporated in the measure only a small portion of the two other comprehensive insurance bills that were introduced in the Senate, the provisions of which protected policy-holders in mutual and other insurance companies. Ever since federation the Commonwealth Government has enjoyed the power to introduce legislation of this nature, although it has no power to interfere with State insurance. Yet, we have reached the year 1932 before the Commonwealth Government really has begun to legislate in this field, and then only in regard to one of the lesser important phases of insurance. With the exception of New South Wales, the whole of the Australian States already have legislation providing that insurance companies shall lodge deposits with their governments for the protection of policyholders. As investors and policy-holders in that State know to their regret, New shall South Wales has lagged behind in this respect. There have been tragic failures of insurance companies in New South Wales in recent years, including the liquidation of the Property Insurance Company, the Australian Federal Life and General Insurance Company, in which was incorported the People's Prudential, Commonwealth Traders, and other associated companies, the Community General Insurance Company, and others of a mushroom nature. Notwithstanding the fact that it possessed the necessary power to do so, the Commonwealth Government took no action to protect the people of New South Wales, nor did the State legislature come to their rescue. That territory has therefore'been a happy hunting ground'<for go-getters and the spieler-type of company promotors. On the other hand, Tasmania introduced protective insurance legislation in 1874, while South Australia folState. New South Wales Victoria Queensland 5,000 South Australia 2,500 Western Australia 5,000 Tasmania 5,000 Under this legislation the Commonwealth Government proposes that the deposit shall be £40,000 for general insurance, aud £50,000 for life insurance, while the amount to be lodged by companies which have their head-quarters outside the British Empire is £60,000. Notwithstanding the comparatively small deposits required by some of the States, the aggregation of the deposits represents a respectable sum. The following are the particulars:Victoria - 449,477 Queensland 1,479,715 South Australia .. 490,947 Western Australia .. 559,119 Tasmania 280,194 I am unable to obtain information as to whether the States will have to hand back to the insurance company the margin of difference between the deposits specified by their legislation and those stated by this measure. I have endeavoured, too, to ascertain from the States the amounts that they hold in cash and securities, but only three have had the courtesy to reply. In fairness to those that have failed to do so, I acknowledge that there may be some difficulty in obtaining the information readily, and that it may be forwarded to me later. I am not a States rightcr. Rather am I a federalist. For that reason I welcome federal action in this matter, but I am reluctant to give approval to any legislaJ/r.

I have learned unofficially that the provisions of this measure will not operate harshly in that regard, and I hope that my information is correct. In committee I shall ask the Assistant Treasurer to give honourable members an assurance in that regard. The great trouble about insurance is that it has encouraged a number of £ people to fleece the public, and men who have been engaged as canvassers on commission, have decided to form insurance companies of their own. The whole thing was so easy. A flashily-furnished suite 3,259,452 of rooms and the assistance of glib tongues was ail that was necessary. Capital was not an essential. Those gogetters scoured the country looking for business, glibly assuring potential clients of the stability of their company. They even entered the realm of third party motor insurance. The result was a tragedy to the policy-holders. I remember that, only a few years ago, a number 7 of members in this chamber were left lamenting when a mushroom concern collapsed. Throughout Australia, and }3articularly in New South Wales, investors have been robbed of considerable sums of money. That, would not be so bad, because, after all, those who have money to invest in insurance companies are in a different position from persons who are endeavouring, by paying small regular instalments, to provide for their families. It is with this class of persons that I am mainly concerned in connection with this legislation. The great pity is. that this Government has seen fit to present now only a small portion of the legislation that was twice passed by the Senate. I mention, incidentally, that on each occasion the Government that permitted the introduction of that legislation fell almost immediately. I hope that the hoodoo will continue. The legislation which the last two Governments proposed to introduce in this chamber dealt with all phases of insurance. It embodied-registration ; winding up of companies; transfers and amalgamations; provision for security of insured persons in connection with deposits by companies, statutory funds, statements, returns, investigations, policies and protection of policies; payment of policy money; registrations, assignments and mortgages of policies, audit and children's insurance. Perhaps the most important clause in the bill of 1929, which I hope the Government will lose no time in introducing, was that which provided that before any canvasser or gogetter could even advertise, make application for subscriptions, or issue prospectuses, permission must be obtained from the Commonwealth Treasurer. In 1908, a Commonwealth royal commission was appointed to inquire into insurance, and after considerable investigation reported as follows:Owing to the nature of the legislative ments of the several States of the Commonwealth relative to the conduct of life insurance business, and the fact that these have all had a common basis, viz., the English acts of .1870 to 1872, there does not exist in Australia the same degree or convenience and want of equity from variations in State legislation that are to be found in America; but even here the diversity is of such an extent that the enactment of a uniform federal law superseding the existing State legislation would represent a distinct gain to the companies transacting life insurance business in Australia, and, indirectly, to their policy-holders since under it the present necessity for lodging separate deposits and returns of revenue, expenditure, assets, liabilities, &e., with the separate State governments would be obviated, the deposits and returns lodged with the Commonwealth Government, applying to the whole of Australia. Ah opinion which held good in 1908 holds good today. One wonders at the lack [30] interest shown by various Commonwealth Governments since that time in dealing with this important social service. Although it may be said that the last Government showed no great haste to deal with insurance, we must concede that it was continually dealing with matters of urgent public importance, in an endeavour to prevent a financial crash in this country. Nevertheless, we did facilitate the introduction of insurance legislation in the Senate, and made provision for its introduction in this chamber. Most of the sreneral and life insurance business in Australia is in the hands of the mutual companies, and there are interesting particulars available showing the great necessity for the governments of this country to protect the large number of policy-holders, most of whom are of the working class. I have a return showing that in the ordinary departments of mutual societies there are 676,310 policies, the sum assured being £234,429. In other societies and companies there are 225,304 policies, the sum assured being £59,855. In the industrial department of mutual societies there are 1,127,472 policies, the sum assured being £53,559, and in other societies and companies, there are 471,159 policies, the sum assured being £16,371. Any legislation that we pass must provide adequate protection for approximately 2,400,000 policy-holders. Even in those States where deposits are lodged the protection is not adequate'. In New South Wales there is absolutely no protection. I , therefore, enactwelcome the bill, but urge the Government to take the earliest opportunity to bring down to this chamber the remainder of the original bill. I am sure that the Government would be afforded every facility by honourable members to pass a comprehensive insurance measure which would enable the Commonwealth Parliament to exercise a power given to it under the Constitution, and thus bring about the federalization of insurance.",27
148,Dr EARLE PAGE,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"Cowper) [4.37] I cordially support this bill. My only complaint against it is that it does not go far enough. It deals simply with deposits, when it should deal with every phase of insurance. The Commonwealth has power under section 51 paragraph of xiv. of the Constitution, to deal with insurance, ancl the exercise of that power is long overdue. In fact, during the regime of the Bruce-Page Government, a bill dealing with life insurance was actually brought down. It passed the Senate, and had been introduced in this chamber. When the election took place, it unfortunately lapsed. During the next parliament Senator MCLachlan intropublic duced the. measure as a private bill. was passed by the Senate with the conThe currence of the government of the day, I and brought down under my name to this chamber. Despite the enthusiasm of the honourable member for Darling (Mr. Blakeley),' who was Minister for Home Affairs in the Scullin Government, day was set down for its discussion, and it suffered the fate of all unfinished jects at a general election. I urge this Government not to leave any stone Unturned to put this legislation on the statute-book, not merely this partial measure, but a complete measure dealing with, not only life insurance, but also marine, accident, and other forms insurance. There is no more important subject on which the Commonwealth Parconcerned liament may legislate than insurance, particularly from a social point of view. Insurance, in effect, is simply a system of pooling losses, and is of special ance to the small man in the community, much more so than to the rich man. Insurance is practically the substitution of a social co-operative provision for individual provision by a distribution of panies throughout Australia. losses and elimination of risk. What does in effect is to ensure that the whose house remains undestroyed by helps the man whose house has been destroyed by fire. [Quorum formed.] The man who has the good fortune to to a ripe age contributes to the support of the dependants of those who have unfortunate experience of dying early. The man whose motor car has not been stolen helps to replace the motor car has been stolen from another man. essence of insurance transactions is the payments by the insurance panies are made at a time when the recipient is in financial distress. Therefore, no parliament can take too much care in safeguarding the funds insurance societies, and in making certain and that the manner of their investment is Dr Earle Page. absolutely satisfactory and safe, that the funds at the disposal of the insurance companies, held practically for trust purposes, will be available when required, and that the overhead expenses of the companies are not such as to prevent full payments from being made at the proper time. There is a vital necessity in the interest for the passing of legislaIt tion on a most comprehensive scale. business is of a fiduciary character. t is in the nature of a trust for people who in many cases are not able to look after themselves. That applies particularly to life insurance, to almost every transaction in respect of which the date of the no maturity of contract is remote. If a man insures his life and dies before his propolicy matures, his widow needs to be certain that the money for which her husband scraped and pinched during his life time, will be paid to her. The object of insurance is to benefit a policy-holder in time of dire necessity, or to enable his fire, dependants to carry on after his death. of The complexity of insurance business, particularly marine insurance, which is with happenings in all parts of the world, makes necessary a great deal of supervision. Furthermore, cases arise of the mal-administration of insurance"" importfunds which have a serious effect upon - the community. These factors make it imperative that there should be a general Commonwealth law coveran ing the operations of insurance comWe it especially need a Commonwealth law to man guard the investing and insuring public fire, against possible injury from mushroom companies. In Australia there are several highly successful comlive panies, such as the Australian Mutual Provident Company, the Mutual Life and the Citizens Company, and the National Mutual Insurance Company, which have handled their business so satisfactorily that that unscrupulous company promoters The have been able to point to them that as a reason why it would be profitcomable for the public to invest in other companies. Erequently, through lack of experience or insufficient capital, such new companies have failed, and loss of has been sustained by the shareholders policy-holders. Commonwealth rather than State supervision of insurance operations, is necessary, so that conditions may be uniform in all States, and because social life in this country is becoming increasingly Australian rather than merely State-wide in its outlook. Greater stability is required in insurthey ance business, and one method of obtainprehension. ing this is by direct supervision also of insurance funds under legislation policies, passed by Parliament, while another by providing that due publicity is given to the balance-sheet and transactions of insurance companies. Various methods have been suggested for ensuring security to shareholders and policy-holders. One of the least valuable, in my opinion, is monwealth. that provided in this bill, namely, the lodging of deposits by companies. That may have the effect of preventing the growth of mushroom companies, but the amount of the deposit in the case of large companies is so insignificant compared with their liabilities that the security vided is negligible. Something more is necessary, and I hope that before the debate on this bill is concluded the Minisinsurance ter in charge will signify the intention of the Government to bring down another measure at a later stage dealing with aspects of insurance. One method of obI taining greater security is to require companies shall effect a proper separation of the various funds under their control. It should be possible for any one looking at the balance-sheet of a company to certain exactly what is its financial tion, and where its funds are invested. recognize that, in connection with the measure now before us, there is need for haste. Were it not so I would suggest pany promoters. that this bill be enlarged to incorporate the provisions I suggested. My experience has taught me that if one does not take the opportunity of introducing amend will ments to a measure when it is before the House, one may have to wait a long time before a new and more comprehensive measure is introduced. I hope that sition the Government will, in future legisbrought lation, stipulate that proper financial meet with a good reception here. statements shall be prepared by insurState ance companies, and also make provision for the investigation of accounts if necessary. It should also be provided that the policies issued are just from point of view of the policy-holders. the past, insurance canvassers have freI quently induced people to take out policies which have not provided the holders with the cover they thought they were receiving. Policy-holders sometimes do not read their policies until the time comes to make a claim, and then they find that have all along been under a misapDefinite provision should be made in regard to the surrender of and for a general audit of insuris ance accounts. Such matters as the assignment and mortgaging of policies should also be covered by Commonwealth legislation, so that all policy-holders will know exactly where they stand, and uniform practice obtain all over the ComThis bill deals only with the matter of deposits. To that extent I am in favour of it, although I am disappointed that it does not go further. It aims to protect the funds of insurance companies from prothe rapacity of a particular State. That is necessary at the present time, because we must recognize that injury to any company, large or small, must be felt also by large numbers among the general public. It is the first duty of all this Parliament to obviate such danger. t is important also to protect the interests that of shareholders and policy-holders from the directors of the companies themselves. Those who take out policies and pay premiums furnish most of the funds in the aspossession of insurance companies, and posithey should be protected by law against I the machinations of fraudulent or foolish company directors. The public should also be protected from unscrupulous comI trust that, at a later date, the Government will bring down a bill which meet with general approval. I understand that the bill dealing with life insurance passed last session by the Senate met with hardly any oppothere, and I am sure that, were it before this chamber, it would The of New South Wales is at present hopelessly behind the rest of the Commonwealth with regard to insurance legislation. For many years it has been the the happy hunting ground of unscrupulous In company promoters, and for that reason am glad that, this measure, if passed, will, to some extent, bring it into line. ""When the insurance hill was submitted to the Senate last year, it contained some provisions which seemed to conflict with the direct interests of the States. The Senate is the chamber which is charged more particularly with the protection of State interests, and it amended the bill in such a way that it met with the approval of the State Governments. I intend to vote for the second reading of this bill, and to assist its speedy passage through this chamber.",29
149,Mr NAIRN,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"Perth) [4.55] - It is desirable that the law as to insurance generally should be codified as early as possible. This bill is a useful contribution covering one aspect of the insurance problem. The oniy aspect with which I am much concerned is the position of self-insurers-as to whether they will be liable under this bill in some cumstances to lodge deposits. There are persons and companies which do their own insurance, sometimes entirely for themselves, sometimes in concert with others for their mutual insurance. know that it is not intended that selfinsurers should be required to lodge deposits, and I believe that the greater number of them will be outside the scope of this measure. Where a company merely establishes a reserve fund to be drawn upon to meet losses of its own property, it is clear that this bill would not affect it. It would not come within the definition of insurance business as set out in the bill.",32
150,Mr SCULLIN,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,Such a fund would really be an addition to reserves.,32
151,Mr NAIRN,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"Yes , an addition for the specific purpose of insurance. insurance business contemplated by the bill does not connote insuring one's self, but the giving of an undertaking to indemnify some other party. There are some private insurance schemes in which the insurers do give an undertaking to parties other than themselves. I refer more particularly to certain workers' compensation schemes, in which an undertaking is given to indemnify the worker in the event of injury. Some of those schemes are approved by the Treasury of a State. Deposits have to be lodged with the State Treasurer, and those deposits are available to satisfy the claims of injured workers. I shall cite a typical example. Section 10 of the Workers Compensation Act of Western Australia makes it obligatory on employers to insure, but it contains this exceptionProvided tiiat if an employer proves to the satisfaction of the Minister that such employer has established a fund for insurance against such liability, and has deposited at the Treasury securities charged with all payments to become due under such liability, the Governor may, by order in council, exempt such employer from the operation of this section. Under that scheme the employer undertakes liability to a person other than himself, namely, his employee. Insurance business is thus defined"" Insurance business"" moans the undertaking of liability to make any payment, or to make good any loss or damage, contingent upon the happening of a specified, event, and cir- any business in relation thereto . . . That means, I believe, an undertaking of liability in respect of any person other than the insurer; thus distinguishing beI tween insurance husiness and self insurance. I am certain that the Government does not desire that those firms which have already established schemes of the nature I have indicated, and made deposits with the State Governments, should be required to deposit' £50,000 with the Commonwealth Government. I ask the Minister in charge of the bill to refer this point to his officers, and at a later stage to give the House an assurance that the bill will not affect self insurers.",32
152,Mr BEASLEY,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"West Sydney) [5.1] Had the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Bruce), when moving the second reading of this The bill, explained the real motive for its introduction, honourable members would have been treated as intelligent adult's rather than as children. The right honourable gentleman, in emphasizing the need for protecting policy-holders, dealt at length with the failure of insurance companies in the United Kingdom. What he said may be quite true, but the purpose of those statements was only to mislead honourable members and the public regarding the real reasons for this legislation. Those of us, however, who have watched closely recent events, understand very clearly why the bill has been introduced. We have been told that there is need for a uniform insurance law throughout the Commonwealth. If that be so, the uniformity should be in regard to insurance generally, and not merely in regard to that one phase of insurance with which the bill deals. If deposits are to be made by insurance companies with the Commonwealth Government, that obligation should apply to all States. The mere declaration of the amount of deposit to be made by each company engaged in insurance business is not uniformity. Reference has been made to the fact that on two previous occasions a comprehensive insurance bill was placed before this Parliament, and not proceeded with only because elections intervened. So much lime having been given to proposed legis-. lation of this character, the Government must have had at its disposal all the data necessary for the introduction of such a bill as the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) has declared to be necessary. Why then has the Government not introduced such a bill? If a uniform and comprehensive insurance law for the whole of the Commonwealth, was necessary when the earlier bills were introduced, it is equally necessary today, and if the Government were sincerely desirous of dealing with this matter, it had the draft legislation at hand, and the requisite majority in both chambers to enact it. If the public is so much in need of protection against the occurrences in the United Kingdom and Australia, which were referred to by the Assistant Treasurer, why did not the Government legislate on those lines? The answer is obvious. The Leader of the Country party said that it is necessary to give this measure a speedy passage, but he did not explain why, because he wished to hide the reason for haste. We are entitled to expect reasonable frankness from honourable members. What have they to hide? Why do they not state candidly the undeniable reason for this bill? As soon as it was mooted, mild, consternation was caused amongst State Governments already holding cash deposited by insurance companies. They complained of the serious embarrassment which would be caused to them if this Parliament enacted those provisions of the bill which would necessitate the transfer to the Commonwealth of the deposits held by them. The Premier of Queensland and others expressed great concern, and apparently as a result of representations to members of the Senate the bill was amended to relieve State Governments of the obligation to hand over to the Commonwealth deposits they have already received. The explanation is that they could not hand over those moneys because they have applied them to other purposes. I quote the comment of Mr Barnes, the Treasurer of Queensland; dealing with repudiation, and the nnancial position of this State, he is reported in the Brisbane Courier of the 26th February, as having saidCertainly if the Federal Government were to insist on proceeding with those provisions in its insurance bill which would require Queensland to pay over certain moneys held as deposits from companies, the finances of the State would be weakened very materially. Queensland is one of the States which, according to Commonwealth Ministers, are honouring their obligations, and faithfully adhering to the Premiers plan; because of such conduct they must be given every help to tide over their difficulties. They would not be so dishonest as to use for other purposes moneys deposited with them to guarantee the rights of insurance policy-holders! They may boast of their cash balances, and claim that they have balanced their budgets; they may siug their own praises at meetings of the Loan Council; but the Treasurer of Queensland has admitted candidly that his Government has used for other purposes money received to safeguard the interests of insured persons. Probably a similar situation exists in other States, and I do not wonder at their refusal to let the honourable member for .Darling (Mr Blakeley) know the exact amount of cash deposits actually in their - possession. It would be unwise on their part to make such information public, because it might be utilized in connection with further representations that must be made at future meetings of the Loan Council and Premiers conferences. We have been told that New South Wales was particularly backward in legislating to protect the public against "" go-getters"" and tinpot insurance organizations formed for purposes of exploitation. Previous State Governments may deserve condemnation for not having provided ,this pror tection which is declared by the right honourable member for Cowper to be necessary; I do not condone their laxity, but I remind the House that not until the present Government in New South ""Wales introduced a measure to correct that omission were steps taken to induce the Commonwealth Parliament to legislate in this field. The organizations with which the right honourable member for Cowper is associated took action to cause the Legislative Council to prevent the necessary protection being afforded to policy-holders. While anti-Labour sections complain that New South Wales is still the happy hunting ground for insurance exploiters, they use their political organithe zations to prevent the enactment of corrective measures. Many of the anti-Labour members of the nominee Legislative Council are deeply interested in insurance companies, and they have their own interests to serve. Self interest has been the guiding principle of their parliamentary careers. Having appointed for life they have not to go before the people periodically to give an account of their stewardship, and they take particular care to protect the interests of themselves and the associations with which they are connected. Therefore their opposition to the insurance bill introduced by the Lang Government was to be expected. When the interests which were disturbed by Mr. Lang's bill got into touch with their representatives in this Parliament all that had been said in years gone by of the need for a comprehensive insurance measure went by the board, and the Government decided that this Parliament must legislate quickly to prevent the New South Wales Parliament from demanding deposits from the insurance companies as other States have done. Of course the Commonwealth Government has declared very definitely its attitude towards New South Wales, and the Government of that State; it is prepared to adopt any means to prevent the New South Wales Parliament from functioning as it thinks fit. But obstacles will have to be overcome before even this bill, which discriminates between States, can operate. The New South Wales Government will not stand idly hy while this Parliament exercises its legislative powers, not to protect insurance policy-holders, but to prevent the State Parliament from doing what it is Mr Ttsnslcy. justly entitled to do. That is proved by the fact that great care has been taken to provide that the bill shall operate from a certain date. Retrospective legislation is to be passed providing that the Commonwealth law shall override that of a State. Sub-clause 2 of clause 6 gives power to the Treasurer to call upon a State government, at any time, to hand over to the Commonwealth any deposits by insur-. ance companies that it may have in its possession. If , at the next general election in Queensland, a change of government took place, as appears likely, and the new Government refused to follow bankers' policy of so-called financial rehabilitation, the Treasurer of the Commonwealth could, for political reasons, demand that the Queensland Government should hand over £1,400,000 now deposited with it by insurance companies. If a new government were called upon to been pass over such a large sum to the Commonwealth Treasury, it would probably be seriously embarrassed in giving effect to its policy. If my opinion on this matter is correct, I have drawn attention to a serious aspect of the bill. I am satisfied that the financial policy that the State Governments generally have followed up to the present time has failed, and a drastic change must necessarily be made. I object to the power given under this clause to do something that would embarrass a State government that had the temerity to launch out upon a financial policy opposed to that of the Commonwealth Government. It is not necessary to consider in detail the provisions for the protection of depositors. Those who put their savings into institutions of the kind referred to in this bill should receive all possible protection; but insurance should be provided on national lines. That is th'j policy of the Labour party. New South Wales has a government insurance scheme in operation, and it is working very satisfactorily. It has resulted in a considerable reduction of premiums, and has been of benefit to the whole community. Since the object of this bill is to embarrass the Government of the State from which I come, I shall oppose it.",32
153,Mr HTJTCHIN,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"Denison) [5.20] In supporting the request of the honourable member for Perth (Mr Nairn) for the exemption of self-insurers, I ask the Minister to take a note of the points to which I shall direct his attention, so that the interests of self-insurers will he safeguarded, which is, I am sure, the intention of the Government. In certain industrial concerns in, at least two of the States, sickness and accident insurance funds have been built up, on a co-operative basis, by means of subscriptions from employers and employees, and are administered by trustees representing both employers and employees. Very useful work is being accomplished on a non-profit basis by means of these funds, and in --rldition to affording monetary relief in the event of sickness or accident, the movement is valuable in promoting good industrial relations between employers ancl employees. The States to which I refer are Victoria and Tasmania! In the latter State, another insurance organization has been established to meet the needs of workers who suffer from occupational diseases. Under an act of the Tasmanian Parliament known as the Workers Occupational Diseases Relief Fund Act, contributions are received from the employers ancl from the employees, ancl a further payment is made by the State Government. The result is that a fund has been established from which employees suffering bona fide from occupational diseases are compensated upon a scale that is laid down. It is provided, that, where, in the opinion of the board thai administers the scheme, an individual company is sufficiently stable to look after the matter of insurance on its own account, it shallbe exempted from the general operation of the act. Two large companies in Tasmania operate under that exemption today, with the result that neither the Government nor the employees are called upon to make contributions; the companies themselves carry the whole of the risk. This is an eminently liberal arrangement from the employees' point of view, and it is valuable in promoting good industrial relations. I have no doubt that the Government has no desire that the present bill should prejudicially effect the interests to which I have referred; but I am not satisfied that the definition of "" insurance business "" makes the position sufficiently clear 'to 'relieve employers and employees from anxiety concerning the effect of the measure ou the two types of insurance that I have mentioned. I hope that at a later stage the Minister will make such alterations as may be required to leave no doubt on this point.",34
154,Mr A GREEN,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"Kalgoorlie) [5.23] It is clear that the bill was brought down in haste, for there was no preliminary intimation that such a measure would be introduced. The right honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) had an insurance measure on the stocks for a year or two, and he outlined several directions in which the interests of the public might be safeguarded. This bill provides for a maximum deposit of £50,000 by life insurance companies, and of £40,000 by fire insurance companies. It seems to me that the Government will need power to examine the balance-sheets and books of the companies, and, therefore, I consider that the present bill does not deal thoroughly with the subject. The Vice-President of the Executive Council (Senator MCLachlan), when introducing the measure in another place, said that it was designed to protect the people of Australia from improper use of the deposits lodged by insurance companies, and to bring about a uniform practice. That is what I desire to see accomplished under the bill. Such a measure is long overdue, but I am afraid that the interests of depositors are not properly safeguarded under this proposal. Six or seven years ago, before Mr Lang came into power, New South Wales was the happy hunting ground of personsinterested in making money quickly by means of life and fire insurance business. If the Commonwealth Government of the day had done its duty it would have prevented a great deal of the loss caused by the depreciations of persons whose main desire was to accumulate wealth in the shortest possible time. I regret that the bill gives no power to examine the accounts of insurance companies. The Bruce-Page Government appointed a commission representative of the Labour and anti-Labour sides in politics to investigate, the subject of national insurance. That, commission travelled throughout Australia, and presented its report exactly five years ago this mouth. National insurance was an important part of the policy of the present Assistant Treasurer (Mr Bruce) when he was Prime Minister; but the scheme propounded by the commission was promply shelved. Although opposing political parties were represented on that body, the members endeavoured to arrive at a compromise. Senator J. D. Millen, who was chairman, did excellent work in that capacity, and it must have been heart breaking to him and to the other members , of the commission to find that their labours had been of no avail. If the Government considers £50,000 to be a sufficient deposit to accept from insurance , companies, I should like to know why the following sums are required from the companies by State Governments:-Victoria, £449,000; Queensland, £1,500,000; South Australia, £490,000; ""Western Australia, £559,000; and Tasmania, £280,000?  many insurance companies in those States.",35
155,Mr A GREEN,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"That is probably the explanation. Life and fire insurance companies have run wild in Australia. Any effort to prevent the immense waste caused by having 37 life insurance companies, and 42 fire insurance companies operating here should be supported by honourable members opposite who are interested in commercial economy. Of the 37 life companies operating in Australia only six are purely mutual, and only one is a government institution. The number of life policies in operation is 908,807, and the value of them is £290,313,414. The surrenders reach the surprising figure of 12 per cent, annually. The expenses of management amount to 9 per cent, of the income, and commission and other expenses to 8 per cent., making 17 per cent, in all as the cost of running the business. This rate is far higher that it -.hould be. If we had one Common.vealth life insurance ofiice it would be beneficial to the people. The establishment of such an office would not necessarily mean that the other companies would be swept out of existence; it would mean that a spirit of healthy competition would be evoked. New Zealand has had a government life insurance office in successful operation for 20 or 30 years, which has been able to police the life insurance business of the sister dominion just as effectively as the Queensland Government insurance office has been able to do valuable work of a similar nature in the northern State. There are 42 fire insurance companies operating in Australia, New Zealand and F i j i . This is a matter of particular interest to primary producers, who are called upon to pay extortionate premiums to secure cover against the risk of fire. The premiums paid to these 42 companies in 1929-30 totalled £8,304,000, while the losses accounted for £4,829,000. On a percentage basis, losses accounted for 58.15 per cent, of the income, and other expenditure for 33.66 per cent.; while the trade surplus totalled 8.19 per cent. The result of the operation of the Queensland insurance office has been that premiums have steadily fallen. I have not the exactfigures,but when I last made an inquiry into this subject, I ascertained that the insurance rates of Queensland were today very much lower than when the State office began operations. 1 Honourable members opposite must surely recognize that considerable economies could be effected by standardizing the insurance business. A multiplicity of companies cannot possibly lead to efficient activities. I regret, therefore, that the Government has not seen fit to introduce a comprehensive insurance bill. This measure has been brought forward with some desire other than the real improvement of the insurance business; but whether it is designed to bring the Premier of New South Wales to heel or not, I am certain that nothing but good could follow the introduction of a bill designed to stabilize the whole of our insurance operations. I hope that before very long a measure of that kind will be brought down for the consideration of the House. Mr E. J. HARRISON (Wentworth) [5.35] - The introduction of a measure of this kind has been too long delayed. Such legislation is essential to the welfare of the people of this country. It is highly desirable, in my opinion, that the insurance business of all the States should be placed upon an equitable footing. With the honourable member for Perth (Mr Nairn), and the honourable member for Denison (Mr. Hutchin), I think that something more should be done to protect the insurance schemes established by employers and employees. I do not believe that the object of this bill is to destroy the cooperative insurance movements which have been set on foot by various private enterprises in Australia in order that the welfare of employees may be safeguarded in the case of misfortune overtaking them; I believe that it is to protect the interests of thrifty Australian citizens who should not be left open to the exploitation of bogus insurance companies which, in the past, have been able to do a good deal to injure the best interests of the workers of this country. In these circumstances I am surprised that honourable members opposite should have shown any opposition to the bill. They must have read into the measure some ulterior motive. Surely honourable members who represent New South Wales constituencies must realise that the policyholders in insurance companies would be protected by the lodging of deposits by the companies. Only recently, investigations have been made in New South Wales which have demonstrated beyond question that bogus companies have been operating there for some time. Some of these companies have actually robbed people who have been so ill-advised as to take out policies with them. This has meant a degree of distress too terrible to contemplate. Although this bill is not all-embracing, it certainly does do something - to meet an unsatisfactory position in New South Wales. It has been said that the measure is aimed definitely at the New South Wales Government. Even if that be so, we must remember that "" hard cases make hard laws"". It is absolutely imperative that the welfare of the people of New South Wales should be protected. The stability and credit of the State, and the value of its stocks and securities, will be improved if insurance companies are required to make deposits in accordance with the terms of this measure. I remind honourable members that the bill has already been passed by members of another place, who have been elected for the purpose of watching the interests of the States. We may take it, therefore, that State interests have been conserved in this measure. It is certainly undesirable that any government should be able to confiscate the funds of insurance companies in order to carry out pet schemes of its own. I support the bill, because I think such legislation is necessary in the interests of the nation.",36
156,Mr FORDE,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"Capricornia) [5.4.0] The honourable member for Darling (Mr. Blakeley) made an informative and interesting speech on the subject of this bill early this afternoon, and I do not think it necessary to cover the same ground. I wish, however, to urge the Government to bring down a comprehensive insurance bill. It is regrettable that the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Bruce), who was Prime Minister of this country for about seven years, should have shelved a bill which he had had drafted on this subject during his period of office. It is evident that the real reason for the introduction of this small measure has not been stated in the speeches made by government supporters in this chamber, or in another place; there is undoubtedly more behind the bill than meets the eye. Royal commissions have been inquiring into the subject of national insurance in Australia for twenty years, and on various occasions have recommended that a uniform Commonwealth insurance law should be passed. In these circumstances, it is regrettable that the Government has not seen fit to do more than' it is proposing to do in this bill. We know very well that mushroom insurance companies have, in the past, robbed the thrifty people of Australia of thousands of pounds. Similar companies have done the same kind of thing in other parts of the world. It was for this reason that the British Life Insurance Act was passed in 1870, and that the Queensland Labour Government introduced the Queensland Insurance Act in 1916. I am sorry that this Government has not given more attention to the experience of the Queensland insurance office in the last fifteen years. The Queensland Government, under the act of 1916, was empowered to transact all classes of insurance, and it is actually carrying on fire, life, accident, and marine insurance on competitive lines with considerable success, as shown by the progress and growth of the business year by year. This bill was not satisfactory to the. States in the form in which it was originally introduced; but I understand that it became acceptable because amendments were made to it in another place, which provided that security lodged with a State government prior to the 1st FebTuary, 1932, may remain so deposited, and that - the provisions of the bill will not apply in such cases so long as such deposits are so held. The time is ripe for the introduction of comprehensive legislation to provide for national insurance throughout Australia. It has been shown in Queensland that the establishment, of a State office is beneficial to both the State and the insurers. The position in Queensland at present is that the State Government is able to take credit to itself for having].. Substantially reduced the rates charged by the insurance companies for insurance under the old Queensland act of 1905; incidentally, the rates charged for farming are as follow :Farm, agricultural labour (no busbfalling or clearing or blasting) .. Farm, bush-fellers and clearers (no blasting) Farm, bush-fclleis and clearers (with blasting) 2. More than doubled the benefits to injured workers; the maximum weekly allowance to disabled wage-earners has been raised from £1 per week (under the previous act) to £2 15s. per week, with a special provision that married workers shall receive up to £3 14s. per week according to the number of children under 1.4 years of age. Increased from £400 to £750 the maximum amount payable in respect of total incapacity: 3. Settled approximately 182,122 claims (excluding minors' phthisis, &c, section 14B) and paid over £3,825,000 to injured workers in cash, only 02 cases having been taken before police magistrates. 4. Given general satisfaction, not only to workers and their organizations, but also to employers who are relieved of a vast amount of the work of claim settlements which devolved ,/poii them under the old system of private insurances. 5. Made profits of approximately £435,000, after subsidizing compensation grant to the extent of £26,500 and section 14B £192,199. ft. Brought sufferers from miners' aud other specified industrial diseases, including pulmonary tuberculosis, where traceable to - work in mines, 4c, within the scope of the Mr Forde. act; in November, 1925, increasing the amount payable from £400 to £450 in case of disablement or death. 7. Enacted that compensation shall be paid direct to the injured worker, or to his agent, acting for and on his authority, or in the event of u fatal case, that the compensation be paid to the dependant or to an agent acting for or on his or her authority-in other words, payments of compensation are made direct to the worker or his dependants. 8. The operation of the 1905 act was restricted to manual workers only, but under the present act no such limitation exists. All workers in receipt of earnings not exceeding £520 per year come within the scope of the present act. Originally casual workers and domestic servants were excluded; this too, has been altered. 9. Under the 1910 act the employee is given power to apply for his compensation in a lump sum if he so desires; this privilege, under the 1905 act, lay with the employer only. The fire insurance section of the Queensland State Insurance Company has effected reductions of up to 33£ per cent, in premium rates, and as a result of these reductions and the annual bonus distribution to fire policy-holders on prescribed risks, the amount saved to the insuring public of Queensland during the past five years amounts to over £3,000,000. If £ s. d. this Government were to introduce insurance legislation providing for the establishment of a Commonwealth national inHi 0 surance department operating on similar .. 3 3 0 lines there would be a tremendous saving to the Australian policy-holders gener5 0 0 ally.",37
157,Mr BJMJCE,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,I remind the honourable gentleman that his party was in power for over two years.,38
158,Mr FORDE,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"During which time we had not a majority in the Senate. Because of that, and because a number of honourable senators are interested in proprietary insurance companies, it was impossible for the Scullin Government to secure the passage through Parliament of a national insurance scheme. The success enjoyed by the life insurance section of the Queensland State Insurance Department has been phenomenal. Within three years, at the first valuation, it was paying bonuses, and now, after having been fourteen years in existence, the company is paying a bonus which begins at £3 and runs as high as £3 14s. per £100 on whole phthisis life policies, while the minimum and maximum amounts declared on endowment assurance policies are £2 and £2 10s. respectively. The amounts insured to date with the Queensland State Insurance Company exceed £S,830,000. Only one other Australian insurance office has declared a bonus so early in its career, and few, if any, have declared bonuses in such a short period, which in any way approach in liberality those declared by the Queensland State office. I mention those facts to remind the Government of the wonderful success that has attended the national insurance scheme that was sponsored by a Labour Government in Queensland, in conformity with Labour's policy to nationalize insurance. The sooner such a scheme is adopted for the whole of Australia the better it will be for the tens of thousands who are at present charged excessive premiums by profiteering private companies. Queensland State Insurance Department has proved that a well-managed State concern can be of greater benefit to the public than any proprietary company, whose chief purpose is to make profits out of its policy-holders. I admit that there are mutual provident insurance companies in Australia which are doing excellent work, but not one can show as good results in such a short time as those disclosed by the operations of the Queensland State Insurance Department. The present Assistant Treasurer is likely to be a member of a Commonwealth Government for another three years, and I hope that he will exhibit a greater interest in this matter that he did on a previous occasion, when he carried a measure only to the introductory stage. I trust that he will introduce a more comprehensive bill, dealing in a national way with this important subject, which is now merely being tinkered with in order to enable the Commonwealth Government to deal with a certain delinquent State administration. As the measure proposes to protect policyholders, I shall support it . My only regret is that it does not go far enough.",38
159,Mr HOLMAN,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"Martin) [5.50] - I propose to support the measure; but I rise merely to direct the attention of the right honourable gentleman in charge of the bill to clauses in connection with which it might be w-ise to say something further when we reach the committee stage; I refer to those which relate to the investment of funds that are to be lodged with the Treasurer. The depositor may choose from certain prescribed forms of investment; if he fails to do so, the. choice will be made for him by the Treasurer. In the definitions clause, among: other forms of approved security which appear perfectly unobjectionable, there is specified in paragraph fUnencumbered titles to freehold lauds in the Commonwealth and first mortgages of freehold Iambi in which the sum secured does not exceed two-thirds, or such otlier proportion as the Treasurer determines, of the improved value of the lands; My attention has been called to that paragraph, which has caused some concern among managers of exceedingly stable insurance companies, particularly one that has its head-quarters in Great Britain, The and is operating on a large scale in the Commonwealth. It is conceivable that, in ' certain circumstances, companies might find themselves with their securities invested in first mortgages on properties the actual value of which was rapidly depreciating, and that this might be a cause of great embarrassment to them, because clause 20 provides that 1. If the Treasurer is satisfied that by reason of depreciation in the value of securities or other cause the value of money ancl approved securities deposited by any person with the Treasurer falls short of the value required by this act, he may, by notice in writing, require the person to deposit with the Treasurer money or approved securities or both to a value deemed by the Treasurer to be sufficient to bring the amount of the deposit to the value required by this act. The fear is expressed that a company might make the necessary deposit, which might be invested in an approved security of a depreciating character, and at a later date might be called upon to make a further deposit to bring its deposit up to the original value, although the direction of the investment had been determined by the Treasurer himself. Naturally, while the present Treasurer and Assistant Treasurer are in office that fear has very little substance, and the companies to which I refer have every confidence in the present Administration. However, as this legislation is to be permanent, I suggest that paragraph / of clause 3 might be further considered. Clause 6 provides that, within three months after notice is given by th? Treasurer, insurance companies shall make a return embodying certain information-. It has been represented to me that in the case of concerns which have their head-quarters abroad, there may be mechanical difficulties in the constitution of the company itself, preventing it from supplying such a return within three months, and that a somewhat longer period, say, six months, would be a safer provision. That alteration would the a convenience to companies I have in mind, supposing there is to be no objection to it from the point of view of the Treasurer. If my present understanding of the measure is correct, those two small weaknesses might repay further consideration, and I beg to recommend their revision to the right honourable gentleman in charge of the measure.",39
160,Mr ROSEVEAR,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"Dalley) [5.58] - In my opinion, next to banking, insurance is, perhaps, the most vital activity that affects the people of Australia. Because of that reason, if a national government intends to deal with the problem of insurance it should do so in an effective manner. In the past, policy-holders have been exploited unmercifully by bogus companies promoted by swindlers, and it is essential that any scheme sponsored by this Government should adequately protect the interests of the public. This is not a national insurance scheme. It merely tinkers with State activities with the definite object of harassing the Government of New South ""Wales. I am indebted to the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr E. J. Harrison) for stating so frankly that he would support this bill, if only because it provided the Commonwealth Government with effective means to deal with the Government of New South Wales. He rather intimated that there is a fear that, with the permission of the Nationalist majority in the New South . Wales Legislative Council, Mr Lang may pass certain insurance legislation which will frustrate the efforts of this Government. The honourable member appears to be afraid that Mr Lang will misuse the deposits lodged by insurance companies under the proposed State enactment. I may as well be equally frank and tell him that some of the Nationalist State Governments of Australia have already used deposits lodged by insurance companies in order to pay the salaries of their public servants. This bill provides a special getaway for such administrations, by enabling them to retain existing deposits and employ them as they see fit. We are assured that the Commonwealth Parliament has had power since federation to deal with insurance legislation. Royal commissions have exhaustively reviewed this problem, and have recommended that uniform insurance lawsshould be introduced. This is not uniform insurance legislation. It seeks to bring about uniformity only with regard to deposits. It does not deal with national insurance generally. Why, then, has this Government failed in its duty? Why, too, doesit insist that one State should hand over the deposits which it has received from insurance companies, and exclude other States from similar action, merely because they happen to have passed prior legislation dealing with the subject? If uniformity is to be effective at all, it should have general application. The deposits should be lodged at one centre. No preference should be shown to any State, and no discrimination exercised. The Senate has at different times passed two measures dealing with insurance. They were sponsored by senators, not of the Labour party, but of the party which the Government and its supporters represent in this House. Why did it not previously occur to them that there was dire necessity for demanding deposits from insurance companies to ensure their good faith ? Is the lodging of deposits with the Commonwealth Treasury likely to prevent wealthy insurance companies from defaulting? The other night the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Bruce), referring to a company called, I think, the Albert Company, said that it was so large that it had absorbed 25 other companies, and that the fact that it was immense and wealthy did not prevent it from defaulting. If a similar company were to spring up in Australia, would the fact that it had lodged deposits with the Commonwealth Treasurer prevent it from defaulting? I think not. On the other hand, the lodging of deposits with the Commonwealth Treasurer would be an effective bar against any new competition entering the insurance market to the detriment of the wealthy companies controlling iusurance operations in Australia. It would hobble and prevent private enterprise from entering this sphere of business, but*would not in any way prevent a wealthy company from defaulting. If a national scheme of insurance were adopted, the Government would be able, not only to give substantial guarantees to the people who insure under the scheme, but also to assist those who, through circumstances over which they had no control, could not continue 'their payments. In this respect it is interesting to study the statistics published in the Year-Book for 1929, under the heading, ""Ordinary life assurance"". The policies discontinued in Australia in 1929 were-by death and maturity, 17,280, covering an amount of £3,933,620; policies surrendered, 15,823, covering an amount of £4,409,649. understand that in some cases of surrender the companies did give nnancial consideration to the people concerned. In 1929 there were 42,538 policies forfeited, representing the sum of £11,461,656. Under a scheme of national insurance, policy-holders who were financially embarrassed for the time being, would be able to suspend their payments until they were in a position to meet them. The Year-Booh for 1931 contains a fairly complete table setting out ordinary and industrial life insurances and Australian liabilities for the year 1929. The paid-up capital of shareholders amounted to £1,729,408. The companies possessing that capital are, I presume, the companies referred to in the Year-Book. Their liabilities are shown £106,641,600, and their assets as £134,598.978. They, therefore, have surplus assets of £27,957,000 on a paid-up capital of £1,729,408, arid an annual dividend and cash bonus to shareholders of £750,837. It is no wonder that these wealthy insurance companies are so anxious to keep competition out of this field. As a means of keeping out genuine competition nothing Could be more acceptable to these companies than the demand under this legislation to lodge cash deposits with the Commonwealth Treasury. They realise that the lodging of deposits, in itself, would not be an effective safeguard against default on their part. Insurance, next to banking, is perhaps the most vital problem confronting the people of Australia. Mr E. J. HARBISON - Did the honourable member - support the Lang scheme in New South Wales?",40
161,Mr ROSEVEAR,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"The sooner a scheme of national insurance is brought down to this House the better I shall be pleased. But I am positively certain that national insurance, with all the safeguards and the assets of the Commonwealth of Australia behind it, would not suit the interests represented by the honourable member for Wentworth. The insurance companies have at times sought to control governments in respect of legislation. I remember the outcry that was raised in New South Wales about the Workmen's Compensation Act. The private insurance I companies-privat e enterprise-declare d that they could not afford to insure under that act, and that if they did, the exorbitant premiums would be beyond the means of the average person. The State insurance office, which was inaugurated by Mr. Lang, entered the insurance field, and within three months reduced the cost of premiums by 33J per cent. When the private insurance companies realized that their game of bluff was ended, they were eager to effect insurances under the Workmen's Compensation Act, and when the State insurance office subsequently effected a further reduction of 20 per cent, the insurance companies followed in its steps. To-day private enterprise in New South Wales is effecting insurances under that act at about one-third of the as original estimated cost. As has been indicated by the honourable member for Wentworth, this legislation has been introduced for the purpose of denying the Government of New South Wales the right to legislate aloug similar lines. I am in agreement with the honourable member if he says that the lodging' of the deposit demanded under this legislation will not be an effective bar against default on the part of insurance companies. They will default in spite of the deposit. If honourable members opposite are serious when they say that there should be uniformity in respect of the laws governing insurance throughout Australia, they should be prepared to allow the deposits to be controlled by one central authority-the Eederal Treasurer. It is because some of the governments of the other States would be embarrassed if the Commonwealth were to demand the handing over of deposits lodged with them by insurance companies that clause 8 has been inserted in the bill. It is designed to have a sort of double-barrelled effect, but it will have no effect if its purpose is to prevent the wealthy insurance companies from defaulting. If this legislation is designed to embarrass the Government of New South Wales, the Premier will resort to other means to obtain revenue. I say that, even if it is considered to be an admission that that Government would use insurance deposits in the same manner as Nationalist Governments in the other States have used them. I am indebted to the honourable member for Wentworth for having spilled the beans by admitting that all this talk about the necessity for insurance companies to lodge deposits with the Commonwealth Treasury so that the interests of the policy-holders may be safeguarded, is camouflage. Despite the efforts of this Government to overthrow the Premier of New South Wales, the Lang Government will exist in that State long after the members of this Government are forgotten.",41
162,Unknown,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,Sitting suspended from 6.12 to 8 p.m.,42
163,Mr BRUCE,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"Flinders-Assistant Treasurer) [8.0] - The reception accorded to this measure has been generally cordial, the chief complaint of its critics being that we have not gone quite far enough. honourable member for Darling (Mr. Blakeley) said that he was quite in accord with the principles of the measure, but deplored the fact that the Government had not on this occasion brought down a full and complete measure to take over the control and regulation of insurance throughout Australia. What he said was largely echoed by the Leader of the Country party (Dr Earle Page), and several other speakers. The Government considers that insurance is a matter that should be dealt with by the Commonwealth, and that Parliament should exercise the power given to it by the Constitution, and I hope that, at a later date, a complete measure dealing with the whole subject may be submitted to honourable members for their approval. As I pointed ou£ when introducing this bill, a comprehensive measure has on two occasions been passed by the Senate, but owing to the intervention of a general election on each occasion, that legislation was never completed. Except for the criticism that this measure did not go far enough, the honourable member for Darling approved of the bill, but said that he did not want to see any sudden, drastic, or immediate action taken by the Commonwealth which would embarrass the States which, at the present time, have control of insurance, and have accepted deposits paid by insurance companies in accordance with State laws. I assure the honourable gentleman that there is no intention to embarrass the States in any way. Under this measure power is taken to allow the deposits to remain with the States, and pro tanto, to be regarded as deposits required under federal law. The honourable member also was not sure whether the States would be required to hand back to the companies deposits in their possession of a value above that required by the federal law. There is no intention to require anything of the kind to be done at the present time. Things will be allowed to remain as they are, pending the introduction of a wider and more general measure for the regulation of insurance on a federal basis. With one exception, the other points raised were more or less committee matters. The honourable member for Perth (Mr Nairn), the honourable memThe ber for Denison (Mr Hutchin), and, I think, the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr E. J. Harrison), discussed the matter of self-insurance, or internal insurance schemes established by various business concerns. I am prepared to deal with those points in committee, though I think that they are, to a large extent, met by the bill as it stands. I intend to propose an amendment to the definition of insurance business, which will clear up most of the difficulties raised by honourable members. That amendment is to strike out after the word ""means"" the words ""the undertaking of liability to make any payment"" and to substitute "" life insurance business, and includes business of undertaking liability. The position is further safeguarded by clause 15, which provides that the Treasurer is to have discretion to exempt certain kinds of insurance businesses. The honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) suggested that though this bill had been introduced with an air of great simplicity, as one purporting to safeguard the interests of policy-holders in insurance companies, and to protect the public against mushroom and fraudulent companies, this is really camouflage to disguise certain insidious and dreadful designs of the Government. I assure the honourable member that the whole object of this measure is to protect the rights of holders, and to make sure that security will be available in the event of any company meeting with disaster. The honourable member, has, however, forced me to make a few remarks regarding the present Government of New South Wales. The honourable member for West Sydney is very difficult to please; apparently nothing will satisfy him. I have been accused of being at times a trifle outspoken regarding New South Wales, and a little too free in my comments on the Premier of that State, and the actions of his Government. But when introducing the present bill I did not say anything on the subject. The honourable member for West Sydney has now forced me to abandon my reticence. The purpose of this measure, as I have said, is to protect policy-holders, and to safeguard their security. A bill is now before the Parliament of New South Wales providing that insurance companies must deposit security with the Treasurer of that State, and one might imagine that that action was heing taken on behalf of the policyholders. But a significant feature of the measure relates to the security which has to be deposited. The word "" security "" is used, but the word "" securities"" is not used at all. From beginning to end the bill stipulates that money shall be lodged. In every other measure designed to protect the interests of insurance policy-holders it is always provided that money or securities may be lodged; but in the New South Wales bill there is no reference to securities at all. In the New South Wales the Parliament numerous amendments were made to the insurance bill, and they were all alike. They were to the effect that after the word ""' money"" the words "" or securities"" be inserted, the purpose being that securities in addition to money, might be lodged as a deposit. The New South Wales bill is not a comprehensive measure to deal with insurance with a view to protecting the interests of policy-holders. It provides merely that insurance companies shall deposit securities with the Government, and what distinguishes the measure from all similar legislation is that the lodging of security is always defined as the payment of money. It is essential in the interests of the policyholders and the insurance companies policythat action be taken by the Commonwealth Government to prevent large sums of money from being drawn from the insurance companies into the coffers of the State of New South Wales, there being grave doubt that such money would ever be available to protect the interests of policy-holders. Honourable members will note that it was not I who introduced this matter into the discussion; that responsibility rests on the honourable member for West Sydney. Since he has raised the issue, I have no hesitation in saying that, if there Were no other reason for introducing this measure, the action of the New South Wales Government makes it imperative that steps should be taken by the Commonwealth Parliament to protect the interests of insurance companies in New South Wales. It is extraordinary that the Government of New South Wales, which has so much to say about helping the poor and suffering, and those upon whom misfortune has descended, should introduce a measure, the undisguised object of which is to draw into the coffers of the State large sums of money from insurance companies, so that the Government may carry on a policy which, although it may believe it to be right, every thinking person recognizes-is bringing the State to irretrievable disaster. The honourable member for West Sydney asked why this measure was being treated as urgent. If he really wishes to know, my reply is that it is because of what is being done in New South Wales at the present time. This measure is urgent because it is necessary to take steps to protect the interests of insurance companies, which hold such a large proportion of the savings of the people of Australia. It is necessary to ensure the stability of those companies, in which the majority of the people are so vitally interested. There is no section of the community, hardly an individual, in fact, who is not concerned with the soundness of the insurance companies which operate in this country. I have no hesitation in saying that it is to protect these institutions, and through them the interests of the public, that this bill has been introduced. The honourable member for West Sydney stated also that other State Governments have received these deposits, used them for their own purposes, and, in short, done what obviously would be done by the Government of New South Wales if such moneys were allowed to reach its hands. The allegation against the other State Governments is absolutely untrue. In each State the Insurance Act prescribes what shall ""be done with the deposits when they are received by the - Government, and how the rights of the policy-holders shall be protected. The reflection upon the integrity of the governments in those States which already hold deposits from those carrying on insurance business, has not the slightest justification. A more sane and accurate view was expressed by the' honourable member for Darling who recognized that embarrassment would be caused to any State Government if it were suddenly called upon to hand over large sums of money because Commonwealth legislation had required a change in the custody and control of such funds. Such a demand was never contemplated in the insurance laws of any of the States. The 'Commonwealth Government has no desire to embarrass the States. It intends to introduce a comprehensive measure to deal with insurance, and, in the meantime, no hasty or ill-considered action will be taken to require the States to hand over to the Commonwealth the deposits they now hold. The State legislation under which those deposits have been made will be kept alive, pending further Commonwealth legislation on the subject. Mr Jlruce. The honourable member for Martin (Mr Holman) canvassed the possibility of the Treasurer investing the deposits of a company in freehold properties, and, subsequently, when the securities depreciated, requiring the company to restore its deposit to its original value. The Government does not desire that that shall occur, and no doubt in committee such a contingency can be provided against. Whilst this is not the comprehensive insurance measure that the Government aud other honourable members desire, it is at least a step towards uniformity throughout Australia. The measure is urgent, and I hope that the House will deal with it expeditiously. Question-That the bill be now read a second time-put . The House divided. (MR. SPEAKER-HON . G. H . MACKAT.)

That will allow twelve months beyond the date to which the bill is to be retrospective, and will afford the Government an opportunity to prepare and introduce a comprehensive insurance measure in accordance with the desire expressed by the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) and other supporters of this bill. On two previous occasions bills to deal with all phases of insurance throughout the Commonwealth were introduced into this Parliament; apparently there is still a general desire that this Parliament shall legislate comprehensively on the subject. My amendment, if agreed to, will give the Government a chance to do what is required, ancl, at the same time, preserve to New South Wales rights that are now enjoyed by 'other States. It will also serve to unmask the real purpose of this bill. If the committee does not accept my amendment discrimination will be shown, and the Labour party of New South Wales will at least know where the Government stands on this matter.",45
165,Mr ROSEVEAR,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"Dalley) [8.34] - I support the amendment. The clause is too vague, and the committee should fix a date for the issue of the proclamation. The argument has been advanced that only by action such as is proposed under this bill can uniformity be obtained.

172,Mr BBTJCE,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"Flinders-Assistant Treasurer) [8.52] - I agree with the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr. Beasley) that it is the practice to circulate printed schedules of any amendments of substance; but when it is discovered during the second-reading debate that minor amendments are desirable, these are usually made, although printed details of them have not been circulated. I am extremely sorry if the honourable member has not had a typewritten copy of the alterations which the Government j is proposing, and I shall see that he is furnished with one immediately; but I assure him that the amendments are of minor importance.",46
173,Mr NAIRN,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"Perth) [8.53] - Ob viously, there has not been sufficient time since the conclusion of the second-reading debate to print and circulate proposed amendments to the bill. I am glad that the Government isbringing this definition into conformity with the ordinary definition of "" insurance business"". Clause 15 of the bill gives wide power to the Treasurer to exempt certain classes . of insurancebusiness.",46
174,Mr BEASLEY,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"West Sydney) [8.54]. - The honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley) has courteously handed me a typewritten copy of the amendments which the Government proposes to move to this bill. It is apparent, therefore, that the Minister in charge of the bill has extended a courtesy to the official Opposition Which he has not extended to other parties. The right honourable gentleman may consider these to he minor amendments; but surely it is our right to determine for ourselves the real significance of them. I still feel that it is necessary, at this early stage in the life of the Government, to indicate that we expect Ordinary courtesies td be extended to us. I shall vote against this amendment as a protest against the procedure which the Government is adopting.",46
175,Mr BRUCE,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"Flinders-Assistant Treasurer) [8 55] - I do not desire to ; influence the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley) in the casting of his vote; but I trust that he will not oppose the amendment merely on the ground of a lack of the courtesy that should be extended to him. In order to remove any possibility of misunderstanding on that point, I offer the honourable member my most sincere apology if I have been guilty of what appeared to him to be a lack of courtesy. Any seeming discourtesy was, I assure him, entirely unintentional, and I regret it. Question-That the amendment (Mr. BKUCE'S) be agreed to-put . The committee divided. (TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN-MR .

This is the clause to which I referred in my second-reading speech, which specifically refers to the operations of Lloyd's in Australia. On examination it was considered that the words ""society of insurers"" was no? the correct designation for Lloyd's, and that that corporation could more accurately be described by the words which form my amendment, the phrasing of which prevents ordinary insurance companies from avoiding compliance with the deposit provisions of the measure. It merely means that a number of people acting as agents for Lloyd's may NOES. lodge one comprehensive deposit instead of a number of separate deposits. Amendment agreed to.

Discrimination is shown by allowing other States, which .now hold deposits from insurance companies, to retain those Baker, F. M. J. moneys. Obviously that is a necessary Blacklow, A.

182,Mr BEASLEY,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"West Sydney) [9.25]. - Sub-claus e 2, if my interpretation of it is correct, provides an opportunity for the Commonwealth Treasurer authorize, at his discretion, that whatever amount or security a State may have deposited with it, shall be returned to the - person by whom the deposit was lodged. During my second-reading .speech, I stated that this provision would .give power to the Treasurer to direct, at his discretion, that funds lodged with, for instance, the Queensland Government, which funds, according to the honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley) amount to £1,400,000, shall be returned to the insurance companies concerned. No reason has been given for the insertion of this sub-clause in the bill, although it will enable the Commonwealth Government to place in an embarrassing position a State that may, in the near future, be experiencing the conditions prevailing in New South Wales today. I have mentioned Queensland as an illustration, because there is likely to be a change of government there shortly, and if there is a new government, it may adopt an attitude to this bill similar to that which the Tasmanian Government is taking against another measure which has recently been passed by this Parliament. This legislation is coloured with part'- politics. I am not prepared to permit the Commonwealth Treasurer to exercise this ""ower to the detriment of New South Wales, and Dossibly, to the detriment of other States in the near future. According to Mr Barnes, the Queensland Treasurer, if his Government were forced to disgorge the funds lodged with it b-T insurance companies, the State would be in a serious position. I can imagine how ruthlessly this power will be applied by the Commonwealth Treasurer if a change of government takes place in Queensland. I warn the supporters of the Government, who represent States other than New South Wales, that this provision is likely to react against them. I refuse to *dace in the hands of this Government power which will enable it to sabotage the efforts of a Labour government to finance its operations. I move That sub-clauses 2 and .'i be omitted.",49
183,Mr BBTJCE,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"Flinders-Assistant Treabe surer) [9.28] - This sub-clause has inserted in the bill in order to assist the States. One method of dealing with the whole problem would have been for the to Commonwealth to require the immediate return of all securities and moneys deposited with the various States, to the insurance companies concerned, and the immediate payment by those companies to the Commonwealth of the prescribed amount of security. The Government does not believe that that would be a fair or wise thing to do. To demand that the transfers should take place immediately would dislocate the finances of some of the States. This demand is not being waived for the reason suggested by the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Beasley), namely, that the States have committed some breach of trust and spent the money; but because under the law of most of the States the Treasury may re-invest such deposits in State securities, and most of them have done so. This clause has been inserted to protect States against the inconvenience of having to call in these moneys at short notice. The change-over from State to Federal control of insurance can be made in an orderly manner, and when it is completed there will, I trust, be one federal insurance law dealing with all phases of insurance business.",49
184,Mr WARD,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"East Sydney) [9.32] The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Bruce) has said that some of the States would be seriously embarrassed if they were required to hand over immediately the deposits lodged with them by insurance companies. The suggestion is that if they were required to do so, they would have to repudiate the obligation - It is all very well to say that the deposits are represented by State securities, but the fact remains that the money has been spent by the State Governments for their own purposes. That is why the Treasurer is to be allowed to enforce the repayment of this money or not as he thinks fit. The Assistant Treasurer has said that it would embarrass some of the States if they had to refund insurance deposits. That is true, and the determination of the Commonwealth Government to enforce the provisions of the Financial Agreement against New South Wales is embarrassing that State. The other States would also embarrassed if they were treated as been this Government proposes to treat New South Wales. It is clear that this bill has been introduced in a vindictive spirit, Beasley, J. A. and represents a continuation of the Gander, Government's policy against New South Wales. If the Acting Treasurer were consistent he would strike out the words ""when so required by the Treasurer,"" and make it obligatory on every State to refund deposits. If he did that many honourable members on the opposite side of the House would vote against the Government, or, would be absent suffering from a convenient illness when the vote was taken. It is remarkable that the Commonwealth Government had no desire to protect the interests of policy-holders until the vernment of New South Wales introduced a measure for that purpose. Now this bill must be rushed through with all urgency. The Treasurer, according to the bill, is to be allowed at his discretion require States to refund deposits, and must be clear to every thinking person that the discretion which will be exercised by the Assistant Treasurer will be cised against the present Government New South Wales.

191,Mr FRANCIS,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"Moreton-Assistant Minister for Defence) [10.0] - The Government has given close consideration to representations which have been submitted by returned soldiers and other members of the Commonwealth Parliament, the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia, and other returned soldier organizations that a committee be appointed to inquire into the unsatisfactory circumstances of many purchasers' of war service homes, with the object of formulating"" proposals in the interest of purchasers and of the war service homes scheme. The Government is sympathetic toward these purchasers, and Wishes to ensure their continued occupation of their homes, provided this 45 can be done with justice to the men them5 selves, and to the taxpayers. Accordingly the Government felt that the matter could 40 best be dealt with in tUte first place hy means of investigation by an independent body. It has therefore appointed the following returned soldier members of the Commonwealth Public Service to act as a committee of inquiry:Chairman - Mr J. L.

In view of the financial position, the Government has decided to confine the personnel of the Inquiry Committee to suitably qualified returned soldier members of the Commonwealth Public Sertime, vice, who will conduct the inquiry at their existing salaries, plus travelling allowances. The Inquiry Committee will be requested(a) to inquire into and report upon the effect of the present industrial pression in, and economic conditions of, Australia upon the carrying out of contracts entered into by purchasers of homes under the War Service Homes Act 1918-1929, and upon the repayment of advances made under that act; and (6) to make recommendations as to the action which should be taken, having regard to paragraph (a) above, with a view to the completion of the contracts .entered into by purchasers and borrowers under the said act, and the continued occupation of the homes in course of acquisition by those purchasers and borrowers by virtue of their contracts.

192,Mr BEASLEY,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"West Sydney) [10.3]. - Earl y this year I had an opportunity Direcof visiting Tasmania, and through the courtesy of certain prominent gentlemen there, I was able to visit some of the large apple orchards. When inspecting one of these orchards, it was brought to my that certain regulations which are cause of great anxiety hang over the heads of the growers, although, up to the Inpresent time, effect has not been given to them. Large areas are planted with apple Clerk, trees of the Hoover and Prince Alfred varieties, and these are listed among the varieties the export of which may be prohibited. I understand that these are good varieties, and although they are now being exported, the Minister for Markets may give effect to the regulations at any and thus prohibit their export. On the 9th November, 1928, the Supervisor of Exports sent the following communication to the particular grower whose position was brought under my notice:In connection with the forthcoming overseas fresh fruit export season, attention is directed deto the following amendments to the Commerce (General Exports) Regulations, which have been submitted to the Minister, and which, on approval, will take effect from the 1st January, 1929:-""The Regulations are to be further amended as from 1st January, 1931, to provide that the export of the following varieties of apples shall be prohibited. . . . Then follow the names of several varieties of apples, including Alexander, Allington Pippin, Hoover, and Prince Alfred. This grower informs me that he has received very satisfactory account sales for his fruit, and he thinks that the growers should be permitted to export the varieties which they find to be payable, provided they market a good sample of apple that is true to description, so that the buyer receives a fair deal. Growers are the not likely to continue to produce fruit which is unsaleable; it is in their best interests to ship overseas only good export varieties. Honourable members, will, doubt, be surprised to learn that these growers stand in this position, that at any time the export of their fruit may be after it has been packed and to the waterfront. My correspondent So far as I am aware, plenty of these Hoover apples are shipped from Kew Zealand to the United Kingdom and find a ready eale there. I hope that the axe which continually hovers over the heads of those of us who grow the varieties of apples put on the prohibition as per quotation above, will be removed, so that we will be able to look forward to tending our trees with every confidence that we shall be permitted to market the fruit from the said trees continually. The Markets Department should see that the growers are not left in an uncertain position. They have been engaged in the industry for a long period. Some of their trees appear to be 30 years old, and are producing large quantities of fruit. I hope that the Minister will give careful consideration to this matter, and, if necessary, obtain additional information regarding it, so that the growers may be relieved of their anxiety.",52
193,Mr HAWKER,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"Wakefield-Minister for Markets) [10.8] - On e of the safeguards in a democratic Parliament is that certain members are prepared to take up any case presented to them by anybody who has a grievance, and although many unsubstantial grievances are dealt with in this National Parliament, it is certain that serious grievances will not escape notice. The case brought forward by the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr. Beasley) falls within the category of cases which are forwarded to members considered to be imbued with the spirit of agitation, because their correspondents know that theirgrievance will be ventilated. In taking up this matter, the honourable member for West Sydney is no doubt performing a useful public function. The particular complaint that he raises is that the export of certain varieties of apples may be prohibited, and he has dealt particularly with those known as Hoover and Prince Alfred. Some time ago, a considerable quantity of these apples was grown in various parts of the Commonwealth. They are early varieties, and being of a soft nature, do not carry well. But, on the other hand, there are occasions when, because they are ahead of the general crop, and, despite the fact that the loss to the growers may be considerable, they bring in a fair return, compared with the average price obtained for the whole of the apple crop. These varieties often arrive on the other side of the world in a relatively poor marketable condition, and this list, fact is detrimental to the good name of Australian apples generally. The honourable member remarked that some of the trees of this variety in Tasmania had been planted, I think, 30 years. On the other hand, there are many other trees of this variety in that State which have not been planted so long. The Tasmanian State Fruit Advisory Board, which is a semi-statutory body, has been advising the growers to graft over the stocks of such trees as the Hoover and Prince Alfred varieties to other and more profitable sorts. As the supply of these soft apples diminishes, the value of this fruit as an early variety increases, and therefore, a few growers who have persisted in their cultivation may have obtained exceptional returns; but in handling a fruit which does not stand the long period of transit to the overseas markets, they are doing something which may damage the good name of other varieties of Australian apples. The discrimination provided for under the proposed regulations complained of has been made only after the fullest inquiry by officers of the department, upon the advice on various matters of officials of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, and the experts in the State agricultural departments. If the honourable member will give me the name of the gentleman who has provided him with the information furnished to the House, I shall be pleased to have the grievance further investigated; but according to the information supplied by my officers, who, I understand, are guided by the best scientific advice obtainable, there is no justification for allowing the growers of one or two special varieties of apples to risk the good name of Australian export apples, the trade in which amounts to from 3,000,000 to 4,000,000 cases per annum. Nothing is more important to Australia than the maintenance of the good name of her exports. Every honourable member of the House, and particularly those who represent constituencies in which shipping is a.n important factor, should jealously guard our export standard, and do everything possible to see that the inspection of exports at the board is rigidly carried out, otherwise our good name may become tarnished.",53
194,Mr MAKIN,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"Hindmarsh) [10.16] I feel impelled to urge the Government once more to give us an assurance that it intends to do something definite relieve the deplorable position of the tens of thousands of unemployed persons in our community. A very serious time lies ahead of these people during the coming winter months. During the month approaching the Christmas season some reduction occurred in the unemployment returns; but Ave cannot anticipate that there will be anything but an increase those returns in the next few months, those who have been engaged in seasonal occupations in country districts will uninfection doubtedly, with the advent of the cold, wet weather, begin to drift back to the cities. This will intensify the unfortunate tion, which at present prevails in metropolitan area of the different States. The condition of industry throughout Australia has not been improved since the assumption of office by this Governwhich ment. The plight of the unemployed is likely to be accentuated this winter, cause many workers, who hitherto have been able to maintain themselves. their families out, of the slender savings which they have been able to accumulate in better days, are now reaching the end of their resources. This must mean that the condition of the workers will be less favourable this winter than ever before. Many of our people have been unemredwater, ployed for as long as three or four years, and are now in desperate, need of winter clothing and shelter. The Government recognized the paramount importance this problem, because it made reference it in the second paragraph of the .Speech which the Governor General delivered at the opening of this Parliament. I do .not suggest that the relief of unemployment the responsibility of any one party; but desire that we shall realise that there an urgent need for us all to bring our collective wisdom to bear upon the subpaying ject. This is undoubtedly the greatest problem which faces Australia, and it cannot be said that we have done our duty if we allow Parliament to go into recess at Easter time without having done anything to cope with the position. I seaurge the Government to provide an opportunity for the House to discuss this subject, and to make suggestions for the relief of the people. It is the obligation of all of us to do everything we can to get out of the present impasse, and to strive to solve the most perplexing problem which to faces us. The prospect of the coming winter for our unemployed fellow citizens is tragic in the extreme, and I appeal to the Government to give us an early and good opportunity to offer suggestions for or two the relief of the position.",54
195,Dr EARLE PAGE,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"Cowper) [10.22]. - I direct the attention of the Governin ment to the alarming spread of tick for among cattle in New South ""Wales, and urge it to do something to prevent the of fresh areas. In the past six weeks tick infested cattle have been found 200 miles south of the point where for posimany years infestation was thought to the stop. The Stock Department of New South Wales has made a close inspection of cattle-hides in the last week or two, and has discovered dead tick in hides came from places many miles west and south of the areas previously thought beto be infested. The danger is very much more extensive than it was thought to be and even a few weeks ago. Thousands of cattle with blood that in the presence of tick would cause the spread of redwater fever have been moved in different districts, and this means that other cattle far might with the spread of tick become infested with the disease, and may get with the resultant heavy mortality- a mortality which has varied in the past from 60 per cent, to 80 per cent, in some districts. If anything like of this happens it will be a national to calamity. I understand that the Stock Department of New South Wales has, after strenuous efforts, obtained £5,000 for the purpose of building new dips in is those areas which have recently become I infected. I urge the Government to enis deavour to find another £5,000, in addition to the subsidy which it is at present towards the cost of eradicating the pest, so that a sufficient number of new dips may be immediately constructed to ensure that cattle moving from place to place shall be clean. If possible, the tick should be forced back to the Queensland border. "" It was felt until a few months ago that the action which had been taken to prevent a spread of tick infestation had been successful, for there had been no southern extension of the plague for eight or ten years; but it is now certain that the plague is extending southwards at a rapid rate. The New South Wales Government is doing good work in trying to prevent the spread of the pest, but on behalf of the rest of Australia it needs and deserves the assistance of the Commonwealth Government in dealing with this subject. The spread of tick will be a calamity to the Australian cattle industry, and I appeal to the Government to do everything possible to prevent any extension of the tick-infested area.",54
196,Mr JAMES,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"Hunter) [10.26] - I regret that it is necessary to detain honourable members at this late hour, but the problem of unemployment is of such urgent importance that it is essential that we shall discuss it. The Prime Minister indicated today during question time that he would answer no further questions on the subject. That being so, honourable members are forced to take the opportunity which the adjournment motion provides to bring the matter more definitely under the notice of the Government. Everybody knows that during the recent election campaign the TJnited Australia party placarded New South Wales with a statement that if they were returned to power, unemployment would be relieved immediately, and prosperity restored in the country; but so far as I can see not one extra job has. been provided for the unemployed since this Government assumed office. As a matter of fact, all the attention of the Government has been devoted to an effort to crush the Lang Government of New South Wales. The electorate of Hunter has passed through a more serious time in consequence of unemployment than possibly any other electorate in the Commonwealth, for the mining industry was the first to feel the effects of the sion. There are men in my constituency who have not worked for five years. Where 14,000 men were engaged in coal mining in my electorate before the depression, only 8,000 are now so engaged; and where the 14,000 were working eight days a fortnight, the 8,000 are now working only four days a fortnight. If the Government would do something to stimulate secondary industries, a demand would be created for coal and other primary products, and a degree of prosperity would result which would benefit, not only northern New South Wales, but the whole Commonwealth. The Government of South Africa has provided a bounty of 9s. per ton on export coal. Surely this Government could do something to encourage the coal-owners to try to recapture the export coal trade which has been lost. Our export coal trade has fallen away since 1925-26 by 2,720,631 tons. Where, in previous years, the port of Newcastle was exporting coal to 35 different countries, it is now supplying the wants of only 24 countries overseas. The mine in which I used to work had an average output of 3,000 tons a day. That has fallen to 1,000 tons daily, and many other mines are similarly situated. The opportunity presents itself to the Government to assist the industry by granting a bounty on export coal. The Scullin Government imposed a primage duty upon coal, to discourage steamers which traded in Australian waters from taking in sufficient coal overseas-particularl y from Germany and South Africa-to do the round trip. Unfortunately, that has not had the desired effect. I suggest that a prohibitive duty should be placed upon coal that is burned in Australian waters by such vessels.",55
197,Mr THORBY,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,That would increase freights.,55
198,Mr JAMES,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"The honourable member must blame the Government which he supports for increasing freights, as it disposed of the line of steamers that brought about a reduction in freight rates which benefited the primary producers whom he represents. The bunker coal trade of Newcastle alone has declined in recent years to the extent of 49,000 tons per annum. If the Government depresadopted my suggestion, immediate relief would be given to a number of unemployed, with resultant benefit throughout Australia. I speak not for propaganda purposes, but in all sincerity, in a desire to better the conditions of these unfortunate people. I cannot make out why the miners of Wonthaggi do not insist that the right honourable member for Flinders (Mr Bruce) should cause his Government to take action to improve the coal trade. Unless the Government gives prompt effect to the promises that were made by its supporters on the hustings the existing discontent in Australia will attain greater proportions than honourable members opposite imagine.",55
199,Mr GEORGE LAWSON,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"Brisbane) [10.36] - I desire to bring under the notice of the Prime Minister (Mr Lyons) and the Assistant Minister in charge of Repatriation (Mr Francis) one or two matters in connection with invalid and returned soldier pension claims. Since my election as member for Brisbane, I have received numerous complaints from persons who have had their applications for invalid and soldier pensions-par ticularly the former-rejected . I have approached the authorities in connection with every complaint, and it has been pointed out to me that the reason why the claims for invalid pensions are rejected is that the persons concerned are not wholly and totally incapacitated. I am aware that that is strictly in accordance with the act; nevertheless I contend that if our legislation is framed in such a manner that it debars those whom I know to be totally incapacitated from receiving a pension, something should be done to amend it. I know of one instance in which an applicant was examined by three doctors, two of whom were private practitioners, and the third the government medical officer. Both private practitioners certified that the claimant was fit subject to receive an invalid pension, but the government medical officer certified to the contrary. In administering the Workers Compensation Act, the Queensland Government Insurance Office ordains that where there is conflicting evidence from two medical practitioners a third shall be appointed as referee, and his opinion shall be final. I urge the Prime Minister to have the Commonwealth Pensions Act amended so that a more liberal interpretation may be given to these claims, also that the honourable gentleman will issue a recommendation to the officers concerned that a referee doctor shall be called in when conflicting opinions are given;-jand that his decision shall be accepted.",56
200,Mr WARD,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"East Sydney) [10.40] I regret that it should be necessary for honourable members to discuss such an important - matter as unemployment on the adjournment, but seeing that the Government is refusing to answer questions relating to this subject, we have no alternative but to avail ourselves of the opportunity afforded by the adjournment to do so. Every time a question is asked as to what the Government intends to do concerning the unfortunatepeople who are unemployed, or to give effect to the policy on which Ministers were elected, it begins to make comparisons with the position in New South Wales. Such comparisons do not fill people's stomachs. In any case, Mr Lang is not Premier of other States, where there are large armies of unemployed; he is not President of the TJnited States of America, where there is also a large army of unemployed. When the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) was speaking upon the unemployed position, the honourable member for Grey (Mr MCBride) laughed. I can assure the honourable member that evfery opportunity will be taken to let the workers of Port Pirie know the attitude of their representative in this chamber. To show how far the Government is prepared to meet the requirements of the people, we find that it has driven, or intends to drive, from the Federal Capital Territory 30 or 40 unemployed. Surely thefinancesof the Commonwealth are not a so straitened that we cannot feed such a small number of unemployed, but must drive them out of the Territory.",56
201,Mr BEASLEY,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,Jus t as winter is coming in !,56
202,Mr WARD,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"Yes . The Government has talked glibly of holding conferences; but what are the unemployed to do in the meantime? Many conferences have been held, and the only tangible result has been piles of documents and reports; nothing in the shape of assistance to people who are starving. The Government believes that all it needs to do is to issue some used military and naval clothing to keep the unemployed warm during the winter months. If that is the best it can do, the sooner it gives way to a real - Labour government, which is prepared to do something tangible for the ""anemployed, the better. Every proposal that has been put forward, or attempt made by the Government of New South Wales to provide work, for the unemployed has been sabotaged by the representatives of the Federal Government and the other State Governments at the Loan Council. If the New South Wales Government is not able to provide employment for all the unemployed in New South Wales, it is at least prepared to feed them, which is more than the Commonwealth Government is prepared to do in respect of a handful of unemployed in the Federal Capital Territory. Indeed, the State Government is providing rations for 30 residents of the Territory whom the Federal Government is not willing to feed. Out of a total outlay of £12,000,000 the New South Wales Government sets aside £7,000,000 to feed the unemployed. It is determined, at all costs, that the people of the State shall be fed. One'of the first actions of the Commonwealth Government has been to throw out of employment, not men engaged in secondary industries or workers in industrial centres, but thousands of primary producers. Supporters of the Labour party are, therefore, not the only persons affected by the attacks of an anti-Labour government upon the conditions of the people in Australia. I support the suggestion of the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin) that the Government should set apart a time for the discussion of this very important question; not in the hope that it would be of any advantage to the unemployed, because I feel sure, judging members of the Ministry individually and collectively, it is of little use to hope for assistance for the unemployed from them, but because it would enable the people generally to see what the men they have elected to this Parliament are prepared to do to assist the unfortunate unemployed. Honourable members on the other side of the chamber do not know what it is to go hungry. Indeed, when the House sits after midnight they must be provided with a fourth meal for the clay. I offer no apology for admitting that I was one of the great army of unemployed before I entered this Parliament on the 7th March last, and I am not forgetful of the sufferings of those who have made it possible for me to sit in this chamber. I ask the Government to set aside a day for the discussion of this question, so that every honourable member can say where he stands, and so that we may see if this Government is really desirous of doing something beyond extending sympathy. I hope further that honourable members will not be whipped into line and prevented from talking as the honourable member for Indi (Mr Hutchinson) was prevented from talking when yesterday he wished to discuss the tobacco duties.",56
203,Mr BBTJCE,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"Flinders-Assistant Treasurer) [10.48] - The right honourable the Leader of the Country party (Dr Earle Page) has referred to the spread of the cattle tick from northern New South Wales southward. This is a matter of serious concern; but we shall not achieve very much by hasty action, or merely making available further sums of money. For many years the Governments of the Commonwealth and the States of New South Wales and Queensland have been spending large sums in attempting to prevent the spread of the tick. Cattle dips were established, and what were believed to be the most effective precautions were adopted to protect from the tick the herds in the southern portion of the continent. That expenditure is controlled by a board presided over by Dr W. A. N . Bobertson, the Director of Veterinary Hygiene, who is an officer of the Commonwealth, and on it are representatives of New South Wales and Queensland. Yet despite these precautions, the tick is advancing southward. The Government is not, as has been suggested, sitting idly by, and doing nothing. Dr Bobertson is at present in Canberra, and Ministers are in close consultation with him as to the wisest course to pursue. But, I remind honourable members, there is a considerable divergence of opinion as to what is the wisest course to take. We have to determine what is the best course, and I can assure the House, that any quarrel that may be taking place at present between the Governments of the Commonwealth and the State of New South Wales will not interfere with our co-operative action in dealing with this situation. n.There will be no stopping of any subsidies to New South ""Wales. If drastic action is necessary, action similar to that taken in connection with the rinderpest outbreak in Western Australia, the Commonwealth will not hesitate to co-operate with New South Wales.",57
204,Mr THORBY,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,The destruction cattle would not eradicate the tick pest.,58
205,Mr BRUCE,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"I do not suggest that it would; but we are prepared to co-operate with New South Wales so as to arrive at and apply the best and wisest methods of fighting this menace, just as we cooperated with the Government of Western Australia in stamping out the rinderpest outbreak. The honourable member for Brisbane (Mr George Lawson) suggested that certain action should be taken with regard to invalid and war pensions. He suggested an alteration of policy; the appointment of an independent doctor and the referring of disputes to an independent arbitrator or referee, whose decision the Government should accept as the basis on which action would be taken. There are many things to be considered before such a policy as that could be adopted. With regard to individual cases, I suggest that the most satisfactory way of dealing with them would be for those concerned to make representations to the Minister with a view to a thorough examination and investigation. Several honourable members have addressed themselves to the wide and serious problem of unemployment. I regret that I cannot deal with the speech of the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr. Ward) in quite the same way as I shall reply to the speeches of other honourable, members who spoke on this subject. When the honourable member began, he seemed to be speaking with deep sincerity, but almost in the next breath he gave utterance to expressions so appallingly political as to destroy the first impression made on my mind. The honourable member for Hindmash (Mr. Makin) and the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) dealt with unemployment, and the latter referred to its effect upon the coal industry. I quite agree with the honourable member for Hindmarsh that we should approach this subject free from politics; in an effort give material assistance to the unemployed. Yet it is difficult to discuss the subject in a non-political atmosphere, because of the fundamental divergence of views as to the manner in which the problem should be grappled with. One sugof gestion is that the Government should provide moneys for public works; another is to increase the sustenance allowance; and a further suggestion is to relieve unemployment by the conferring of the benefits to be gained by the free expenditure of government revenue or any loan moneys that may be raised. It is contended that we should adopt methods which at best' would be merely palliative. That might be a wise action within reason, in order to tide us over the worse of our troubles. But the real problem is how to start this country on the road to prosperity and to place our people in employment. It is difficult to keep politics out of this issue. Australia has made considerable progress during the last eighteen months towards the possiblility of a restoration of prosperity.",58
206,Mr WARD,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,I thought that possibility had arisen only since the 19th December last.,58
207,Mr JAMES,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,What is the Government doing to assist the coal industry?,58
208,Mr BRUCE,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"Immediatel y I begin to speak certain honourable members cannot resist the opportunity to create a political atmosphere. That bears out my reference to the remarks of the honourable member for East Sydney. He cannot help himself, because if is his nature to introduce party politics into all his remarks. Australia's position has materially improved in the last eighteen months, mainly because the costs of production in this country have fallen considerably. That has led to greater competition in the export trade, with benefit to the community generally. It has helped internally by increasing the value of wages, so that, although wages have been reduced, the workers are possibly better off than before. These factors help Australia, and if we can obtain the external assistance which practically every nation in the world requires, it will go a long way towards helping us out of our difficulties. Every nation is today in trouble. The United States of America is probably in a graver position than to any other country. The difficulties of the nations can be overcome only as a result of an increase in the price of world commodities. If that increase takes place and our production costs have been reduced, Australia's return to prosperity will be enormously accelerated.",58
209,Mr JAMES,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"How does the right honourable gentleman reconcile his present attitude with his attitude towards the mining, industry? At one time he urged the miners to accept a reduction in wages, and now that they have accepted a reduction, they are in a worse position than before.",59
210,Mr SPEAKER,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"Hon. G. H. Mackay). --Honourable members who have been interjecting have had an opportunity to put their case before the House. The Assistant Treasurer is endeavouring to reply, and, in fairness to him, they should be prepared to listen to what he has to say.",59
211,Mr BRUCE,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"We must reduce our production costs to a reasonable level, and not adopt the policy that so many people have advocated, of increasing internal prices. Although such a policy, might give us some immediate relief, it would not help us to return to prosperity, nor woiild it enable us to obtain any benefit from an increase in the price of world commodities. That is the basis upon which we have to build, if anything substantial is to be achieved. By forcing up costs of production we shall defeat what we all wish to see, the restoration of prosperity. There is a fundamental difference of opinion in the various political camps, because they all start from a different point, although all have in mind, I sincerely trust, the attainment of the same objective. I come now to the question, where does the Government stand in this matter? Many references have been made to the expectation that the Government would restore prosperity overnight. As a matter of fact, conditions have improved to a certain extent, because the feeling of confidence in the country has increased; and that is one of the fundamental conditions if prosperity is to be regained. But we must build on that. The question is repeatedly asked "" What is the Commonwealth doing in regard to unemployment ? Who is feeding the people who are; out of work?-The States!"" The manner in which that statement is made suggests that it constitutes a reflection apon the Commonwealth. The contrary is the case. Under the Constitution it is no part of the function of the Commonwealth to deal with these problems. They are State problems. The Commonwealth can give, and has given, a measure of assistance. I am certain that the Leader of the Opposition, the late Prime Minister (Mr Scullin) will agree with me that under the Constitution it is not one of the functions of the Commonwealth to provide rations for the unemployed. The honourable member for East Sydney will probably retort, ""What has happened in the Federal Capital Territory? This great Commonwealth, with its abounding revenues, cannot feed 30 people, and the State of New South Wales has to bear the burden on its behalf."" What the honourable gentleman overlooks is that, if unemployment relief were provided in this Territory on other than a travelling basis, we should have unemployed from every portion of Australia coming to Canberra. The honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) asked me incidentally what opinion was held of me by the coal-miners in my electorate. I admit that they have said some rather crisp things to me and about me, but not of the character visualized by the honourable gentleman. The only occasion when I did not have the usual cheery meeting at Wonthaggi - whe n there is always a considerable amount of backehat, but no particular animosity-wa s subsequent to my granting a subsidy of Is. a ton to the New South Wales coal-fields, to stimulate their interstate and export trade. The miners that I represent had not any use for me then. In the Newcastle and Maitland areas we have probably the best seams of coal in the world, judged by their width and the comparative ease with which they can he worked.",59
212,Mr JAMES,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,Has the right honourable gentleman ever tried to work them?,59
213,Mr BRUCE,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"I have never heen a coal-miner,- but 1I have performed a good deal of work and exercises.of a physical nature. I am not discussing the difficulty or otherwise of coal-mining, but am merely, affirming, that Australia, is better placed than other countries, in regard to the working of her coal deposits, because these are of a better class than most. Coal is the basic commodity of the whole industrial life of this country; consequently, can we hope for a return to real prosperity if we adopt the attitude that we are unable to work our coal-fields or produce coal at a price that will enable us to compete with the rest of the world? Is it right to say that we can keep going only by the payment of an export bounty on coal, or the absolute prohibition of the bringing of coal by the vessels that trade with this country from abroad? I invite the honourable member for Hunter (Mr. James) to give careful consideration to that proposition. A certain measure of assistance towards the relief of unemployment can be afforded by the Commonwealth in a time of crisis, to tide over the worse period of the nation's economic and financial sufferings; but in qrder to do this the necessary money must be raised. In all previous crises of this character there was the fjossibility of raising money either in this country or in Great Britain. On the present occasion, however, owing to our general position and the condition of our credit, it is doubtful if we could raise a loan, even on the Australian market. We might, by appealing to the patriotism of the Australian people, obtain sufficient to tide us over our difficulties. But so far as the external market is concerned, we already have ovx,t against us so many short-dated securities that whatever we could raise would have to he utilized in discharging existing obligations. question, how much further can we go in the direction of utilizing bank credits, is one that has to be very carefully considered. It must be remembered that we are today handling the whole of our huge deficits on that system, and that for a long time the money thus obtained has been used upon public works. though this might be a wise palliative to apply, there has still to be considered the question of what expenditure can be reduced, and what sum can be made available for this specific purpose. No good service will be rendered by following the oft-repeated suggestion to provide a little work here and there. The only result of such a policy would be to place a few men in employment for a short period, probably undermining still further our finanifr. Bruce. cial and economic structure, and eventually causing unemployment to become more widespread. To the question. "" What is the Government going to do; how is it going to solve this problem,"" I frankly reply that nobody can solve it in a simple fashion. The trouble is deeprooted, and the remedy must be a sound and well thought-out one. At the moment, the Government is exploring the whole question, in the hope that it will be able to make suggestions to the States as to a basis on which common action may be taken. Whether we can make any valuable suggestion has yet to be determined. I believe that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Scullin) will admit that the furthest point he was able to reach was that of saying that if the banks would make available credits for public works a certain number of men would be placed in employment. That is as far as any government has got up to the present time. Whether it will be possible to do something which will help to solve the problem, I do not know; we are exploring every avenue that suggests itself. It is useless to fix a day for debating the subject; that will not get us any further. What we want is a constructive lead, and when we have that we shall call the States together, and put the matter before them. The Government is not going to deceive the people by holding a debate on this subject in an attempt to make them believe that we can solve the whole problem. It cannot be done in that way, and I will The not be a party to suggesting that it can.",59
214,Mr MAKIN,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"If the Government cannot see its way to afford the relief which is necessary, will it throw the responsibility on the House, and permit the House, in its collective wisdom, to determine a course of procedure? Even Mr Bruce - The House may be afforded an opportunity of expressing its attitude on this matter, but the responsibility of saying what should be done belongs to the Government, and it cannot hand over that responsibility.",60
215,Mr JAMES,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,The Assistant Treasurer said that the Newcastle and Maitland coal-fields were easily worked. Is he aware that on the Maitland field there are more casualties than in any other field in the world?,60
216,Mr BRUCE,FINANCI AL AGREEMENTS,"If that is a fact, it is most regrettable, and I would be a party to doing everything possible to reduce the number of such unfortunate happenings. But when I stated that the coalfields of Maitland and Newcastle were among the best in the world, I meant only that they were among those from which it was possible, most economically, to extract coal. That is generally accepted, and surely the honourable member will not deny it. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 11.13 p.m.",61
