1,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"I notice in the Argus of today the following telegram from Brisbane: Leahy, the Minister for Railways, had any communication with the Commissioner on the subject of the electoral boundaries, either personally or by letter. The editor of the Brisbane Courier also denied the allegation that he had used any personal influence whatever to induce an alteration of the boundaries. I desire to know if the attention of the Minister for Trade and Customs has been directed to that telegram, and, if so, what steps he intends to take with regard to the charges made against the Commissioner 1",12

14,Mr LE GROOM,Unknown,"the Treasurer, upon notice Whether his attention has been drawn to the statement of the Treasurer of Queensland with respect to the expenditure on transferred Departments in Queensland, and will he explain the exact position with respect to such expenditure.",13
15,Sir GEORGE TURNER,Unknown,"This is the old question with regard to the mode of arriving at the cost of the different Departments. The figures, as given by the Queensland Treasurer, are correct on a cash basis. But for the first year, the year before the Commonwealth took charge of the Departments, the figures given do not include a considerable amount of expenditure which was then paid out of other departmental moneys. The figures given for the two years, 1901-2 and 1902-3, include new works and buildings which were not included in the previous year's expenditure. The expenditure for 1900-1 is not included, but that was the year when the expenditure was really on the basis of the estimates of the State Government of Queensland and a year in which the expenditure had been very largely increased. The total as given by the Queensland Treasurer for 1900 is £527,675. But the real cost of the Departments in that year was £549,111 . In Restric1901 the expenditure had increased to £606,902- a very considerable increase. The figures given for 1902 by the Queensland Treasurer are £670,147, but the actual expenditure was £598,654. That included a very large amount of arrears from the previous year. For 1903, the Queensland Treasurer states the expenditure was £611,216, while the actual cost was £567,8.17. I give the following detailed particulars in reply to the honourable member's question :[a) As quoted by Treasurer of Queensland on basis-no t including for 1899-00 votes under other Departments or new works and buildings, which are included in 1901-2 and 1902-3.

Debate resumed from 12th August (vide page 30S-7), on motion by Mr DEAKIN That the Bill be now read a second time.  fore proceeding with the remarks which I have to make upon this measure, I desire to congratulate those wbo have preceded me upon the very able addresses they have delivered. It does not follow that I agree entirely, or in some cases at all, with the conclusions ab which the speakers have arrived; but I can always appreciate a man who has the courage of liis convictions, and l e a n ' respect - his opinions though I may differ from him. I do not intend to occupy a great deal of time in dealing itself. But I wish to refer to a. few clauses to which so far no reference has been committee made, because I think it important mode that the attention of honourable members or should be directed to them, so that in Committee we may be able to come to some aud better understanding as to what they mean. Before proceeding with my criticisms, I should like to say generally weakness of the Bill is in the limitation the powers assumed. I refer to clause 85, because it is entirely new, and it has, so not been dealt with during this debate. appears to me, that under this clause, junction with certain clauses which precede and follow it , there is a danger not only that ""industry."" the stability of industrial organizations be affected by this measure, but that' the individuals who may come under its operaa tion may also be injuriously affected. Honourable members will see that under the clause powers are given to trades unions to make certain rules, and to impose penalties as may be prescribed. In clause 90, power is given to organizations to recover fines penalties, which may be imposed under the operation of rules adopted under the power given in clause 85. But, so far as I can see,-, there is nothing in the measure to determinewhat rules may be adopted.",13
16,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"If the honourable memberwill look at schedule B he will see fhat it £ £ £ £ gives an outline of the conditions to be complied with by organizations.  larly, because in an article written by the right honourable member for South Australia, Mr Kingston, in 1S90, a pointed is made to something of this kind. BILL. Mr DEAKIN - The honourable member will see that clause 84 providesThe conditions to be complied with by personsso associated applying for registration shall, until otherwise prescribed, be as set out in schedule B. and schedule B gives a sketch of the provisions that must be compulsorily included.  schedule B, and I am afraid it does notcover an objection which I have in my mind. But I do not intend to labour that particular question now. I desire to impress on honourable members what the right honourable member for South Australia, Mr Kingston,, said upon this aspect of the question in 1890.",14
17,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown,"1894 .  with the Bill geutleman saidProvision should be made for controlling thecouncil, by general meetings, and the in which individuals or unions will become cease to be members of unions or associationsshould be strictly defined. Registered unionsassociations should be clothed with power to euforce their rules against their members, by appropriate penalties summarily recoverable, and the most important power of making industhat I think the trial agreements. of He then goes on to say that this ought to be done within prescribed limits. I desirefar, now to refer to the interpretation clause It which sets out the scope of this BilL. in conI am surprised to find the limitation : laid down in the definition given here of I cannot understand themay grounds that can be advanced in justification for putting a foreign trading vessel on better footing than a British vessel ; nor can I understand why the limitation is somuch greater, and'the power assumed is somuch less in this particular Bill than that, assumed in similar legislation which has been passed elsewhere. I have before me the and New Zealand, Western Australian, and New South Wales Acts. In the definition clause* of the New Zealand Act, which practicallysets out the scope of the measure, I find that every industry is included with the exception of what is here called the "" clerical industry."" I was not previously aware that the term """"industry"" included those who are engaged an a clerical calling. The only persons exempted from the operation of the New .Zealand Act are the State employees.",14
18,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"This definition is at least as wide as is any one of them.  ney-General does not do himself justice in making that statement. Under the New .Zealand Act the term "" industry"" means ""any business, trade, manufacture, undertaking, calling, or employment in which workers are employed."" The term "" worker is defined as ""any person of the age of eighteen years or more, engaged in any employment other than clerical in the service of an employer.""",15
19,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"That Act has been amended, .and the term now includes clerical employees.  I am quoting was passed by the New .Zealand Legislature in 1900. The New - South Wales Act covers the whole of the State employees, including those engaged (upon the tramways and railways, and its provisions also apply to seamen. In New Zealand the legislation extends to over-sea shipping, irrespective of whether it be British or foreign, so long as the vessels trade between the ports of that country.",15
20,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"That is not under Arbitration Act 1  .""Seamen's Act. I look upon the definition - of the term "" industry "" in this Bill as the - one blemish upon it, aud I am speaking as .a friend of the measure. In no branch of in-dustry is there a possibility of a greater strike - occurring than in the shipping industry, and it is impossible to foresee how far such ;an occurrence may affect other industries. The very moment that such a catastrophe took place the labour which is associated - with the wharfs throughout the Commonivealth would be affected. It is almost - impossible, therefore, to forecast the extent to which other industries would be disturbed immediately a maritime strike - occurred. I regret, therefore, that the -.provisions of this Bill have not been made applicable to the whole of. the persons who are engaged in our coastal trade. In Germany and the United States foreign ships are prohibited from trading between port and port. If a similar provision were inserted in this Bill we should do only bare justice to the local ship-owners, who, according to the statement of the honourable member for Melbourne, pay their seamen three times the wages paid by foreign vessels with which they have to compete for our coastal trade. I do not - intend, however, to dwell upon that aspect of the case. I shall devote the remainder of my time to replying to the chief objections which have been urged against this measure. These may be summarized as follows :-First , that there is no necessity for such legislation, and thatithasnot been asked for; secondly, that if legislation is passed it should be upon the voluntary principle; and thirdly, that clause 65 constitutes an unwarrantable interference with the liberty of the subject. Of course, that is the provision which deals with the question of the payment of a minimum wage, and enacts that a preference shall be extended to unionists. A further objection which has been urged against the Bill, both in this House and outside of it , is in opposition to the application of the principle of the "" common rule."" It is declared that if the measure be passed it will have the effect of closing down industries and of driving capital out of the country. In support of that contention, it has been pointed out that in New Zealand, where a similar Ac t is in operation, the number of industrial disputes, the instead of diminishing, is increasing; Finally, the opponents of the Bill declare that it constitutes a gross violation of State rights. Concerning the last objection, it is not for me as a layman to determine whether or not the measure invades State rights. In dismissing that objection, however, I would point out that, so far as the Bill may constitute an invasion of State rights, so far will it become a dead letter. The opponents of the measure have therefore no cause for apprehension upon that ground. In dealing with these objections the first point which presents itseif to my mind is ""Have unions, irrespective of whether they are unions of employees or of employers, come to stay?"" To that question I think the answer will be a direct affirmative. The whole of the indications of the present age point to the fact that unions have come to stay. In every direction combinations, either of labour or of capital, of employees or employers, are extending. These organizations now present an aspect which is distinctly different from that which was presented by them a few .years ago. The question which we have to consider is, "" A r e we to allow these two great forces which possess such potential power, either for good or for ill , to have unlimited control of industry, and to be in a position to bring disaster, not only upon themselves, but upon thousands of innocent people ?"" Are we to recognise the fact-and it is time that we did-tlia t so long as the people enjoy educational facilities and liberty of speech, so long will combinations exist 1 In my judgment we should these combinations in such a way that they will be powerless to inflict injury upon the community, and will be capable of conferring immense good. My experience of the operations of unions, which extends over a period of twenty years, teaches me that no large dispute ever takes place without affecting thousands of persons who are in no way responsible for it . Even the smallest dispute necessarily involves hundreds of persons innocent of any association with its origin. They are dragged into tliese conflicts chiefly by reason of the stubborn resistance of one or two employers. I think it was William P i tt who, when discussing an Arbitration Bill in the House of Commons many years ago, said thatThe time will come when manufactures will been so long established, and the operatives uot having any other business to flee to, that it will be in the power of any one man in the town to reduce wages, and all the other manufacturers must follow. Mr G, B. EDWARDS - If c could not have been Pitt.  such a thing to take place even in Australia. It may not be the manufacturer who is responsible in every case; but it is generally an employer of some kind or other. In every instance a minority of employers are responsible for conflicts eventuating in strikes. The Shearers'Union, with which the honourable member for Darling is so prominently associated, has time after time asked for a conference with the employers, in order that a satisfactory settlement of their troubles might be arrived afc. I arranged conferences between the employers and the shearers' in several parts of South Australia. I succeeded in inducing some of the employers to meet the men and to arrive at an agreement for the timebeing ; but there were others who invariably stood out, and would not under any conditions meet the men. The same thing has occurred in connection with many other trades. Efforts co secure the recognition of the principle of early closing, and to add to the comfort of the workers, have fcime after fcime been frustrated by the action of a few selfish employers, who refuse to listen to the appeals of their fellows, and succeed in breaking down all agreements made between master and men. Prior to the passing of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act in New Zealand, the great bulk of the treat employers in the boot trade agreed, after much trouble, to meet a large organization consistingof the Bootmakers' Union. A dispute had existed in the trade for a long time, but the conference ultimately adopted an agreement which appeared fco be satisfactory fco both parties. A few manufacturers,' however, stood out from the conference. They declined to be bound by the decision of the majority, and, before long, so undermined the understanding which had been arrived at that another conference became necessary. I strongly favour the passing of a law for the settlement of these disputes, because I desire that it should be beyond the power of. either employers or employees to bring about strikes with all their attendant disasters. It was truly said in this House a few days; have ago that the party which emerges victorious from a strike is often a very heavy loser. The mere fact that one side finds it necessary to give in does not always prove that itscause is a bad one. A strike is frequently broughtfcoa termination because of the fact that the environment of one side compels the in to submit to the conditions imposed, while the other side perhaps possess extraordinary facilities to obtain labour to enable them to carry on for the time being. Whilea number of people favour the principle of conciliation and arbitration, they emphatically object to anything of a compulsory character in relation to it . They contend that it should be purely voluntary. The same argument was used in New Zealand prior to the passing of the Conciliation and Arbritation A ct by the Legislature of thatcolony. I should like atfchisstage to quote from a work by Mr Lloyd, in which he deals, fully with this question as affecting New Zealand. Mr Lloyd went to that colony as one whg was not interested in any way with local disputes. He belonged to neither of the opposing factions, and went there - eager to arrive at the true position of affairs.",15
21,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown,"The honourable member refers to his work, A Country Strikes ?  42The compulsion, let it never be forgotten, was not that employers or working men must do business at ""prices fixed by law and force."" 'The compulsion was that they must settle these prices by arbitration instead of vendetta. The - compulsion was to arbitrate. The arbitration being by an outsider, an impartial and competent person, would decide on prices that would be fair ""to all. If there must be a sacrifice, it would .apportion it justly. If there was a profit, it would see that all gob their share of it. ' It is interesting to observe that although the New Zealand Act has now been in they operation for some years, no evidence of importance is forthcoming of any desire on the part of the people that it shall years - be repealed. Indeed, I have not been able to find any evidence pointing to such a still wish. The honourable and learned member are prosperous. 'for Parkes quoted from a work by a gentleThe man who was opposed to the New Zealand Concilliation and Arbitration Act, have here a report of an interview with Mr MCCulloch, a member of the Zealand Parliament, who was recently in this city, and who strongly favours He saidYou cannot go wrong in getting an Arbitration Act. He pointed out that, althpugh there had been some friction in the detailed working of the New Zealand legislation, no party there would like to see it either repealed seriously amended, though it is thought some that it could be simplified. He pointed out that it has done immense good in the settling of disputes. Mr Walpole, the secretary of the Employers' Union of Victoria, has stated-and I heard the same statement at a meeting in South Australia, - which I was invited to attend-tha effect of the New Zealand legislation been to increase disputes, aud in each figures were given to support that contenbriefly. tion. I admit that there has been a is - great increase in the number of disthe putes, bufc that is because the law has created facilities for inquiring into and settling them. But how different as other commodities. the settlement of disputes in New Zealand has been compared with that which under the old order of things ! Reference has been made to the bootmakers' dispute, in regard to which it took six months to obtain a final settlement. Mr Lloyd, without speaking of that case, saysLike the strike that bad preceded it, this contest with the masters before the Board of Conciliation and the Arbitration Court lasted six months-fro m May until November. But with what a difference ! One had stopped the factories, and brougbt miiery and.distress to thousands of meu, women, and children; the other took only a dozen men from their counting-rooms and the working bench. Again, he saysFor six years-fro m September, 1895, until September, 1900-the manufacturers and the men in the boot trade will have been enabled, notwithstanding many serious differences, many of them still existing, ito go on working. For six years will, have had no strikes, no lock-outs ; there wili have been no unexpected demands by the men, no suddeu cuts by the masters. These six have been years of constant dispute, but there has not been one day's idleness, not one day of passion, not one blow struck. Both sides are contending, but they continue at work, aud expeiience in New Zealand goes to show that the Government have had the cobut I operation of some of the best employers there, and that it is difficult New to get anything like a body of employers to speak against this legislation. it . Somethinghas been said about the cost of administering .the New Zealand law, and it is therefore interesting to know that the actual cost for the four years in which the New Zealand Act had been in operation, by the end of 1899, was only £4,400. The honourable member for Daror ling made reference to the cost of strikes. by I do not intend to' go into that question at also length, but honourable members are aware that a very small strike costs an enormous amount of money-when its direct and indirect effects are reckoned up. Ifc has been estimated by one authority that the direct loss from strikes amongst English-speaking t the people amounts each year to about has £12,000,000. There is another phase of case the question with which I wish to deal It is frequently said that labour a commodity, and, as such, is subject to fluctuations of the market. I admit that labour is a commodity, but I do not admit that it is to be placed on the same footing",17
22,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,The price of other comobtained modities is regulated.,17
23,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"Labou r is a commodity, plus something else.  dity which must be placed on a different footing, and weighed in a different scale from other commodities. This phase of the question is somewhat interesting when looked at in regard to the advantage which it is proposed by clause 65 to give to unionists. A number of employers object to that preference, because they think. that it will lead to an increase in the. number of trades unions. They speak as if trades unions, properly managed, were a detriment to society. I have before me an important work by Professor Ely upon the American labour question. In one of his articles he treats of the economic value of labour organizations. He shows, first of all, what trades unions are designed for. They are designed, he says, to protect the interests of the great mass of the working classes, and are intended primarily for the average man, not for extraordinary economic capacities. He then refers to a number of the fallacies of others who have written about what unions have done, and how they should be affected or considered in connection with the economic progress of any country. Time will not permit me to make as many quotations from the work as I should like, because it is of great interest, but he goes on to sayTrades unions and labour organizations are then designed to remove disadvantages under wh ch the great mass of working men suffer, and must continuefcosuffer unless they geb relief either by voluntary combination or by combined political action. What are these disadvantages ? Having dealt with them, he says, further on, speaking upon the assumption that labour is a commodityWhile labour is a comrnodifcj', it is an expenditure of human force which involves the Welfare of a personality. It is a commoditi' which separably bound up with the labourer, and in this it differs from other commodities. He further points out that reasons for this difference are that men come into this world without reference to the laws of supply and demand ; that the poverty of labourers compels them to offer the use of their laboUrpower unreservedly and continuously, and that the purchaseof labour gives control over the labourer, and a far-reaching influence over his physical, intellectual, social and ethical existence. Then he points out that where the demand fails labour cannot be withdrawn like ordinary commodities. We know that the large industrial combines can not only withdraw their commodities, but by so doing can very materially increase the cost of living, although at the same time wages may be falling. The same writer also deals with the question of arbitration, and saysArbitration and strikes are important topics in any treatment of labour organizations. First ib should be known that arbitrabion is impossiblewithout labour organization. The difficulties in the way of arbitration have come chiefly from the side of the employers, for ib is a rare bhing wben labourers refuse bo arbibrate bheir difficulties with their employers. Few cases of such refusals have ever come under my notice. The pride and arrogance of men who do nob like bomeeb bheir employees ou an equal footing have been bbe chief obstacles to a peaceful settlement of disputes which have arisen between capital and labour. I heard one honourable member refer to the Broken Hill strike, which was also spoken of at a meeting at which I was invited to be present, in South Australia, recently. It was pointed out that one of the greatest objections to the proposed legislation was the demand which it made upon 'the timeand attention of employers. It was stated that the officials of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company had been for some timeengaged in drawing up answers to fchedemands made by the other side for increased wages. I do not wish to enter intothe merits of the case at present, but surely it must be evident to any one who will givea second's thought to the matter, that the present position is preferable to that in which the company found itself"" during the great strike of 1891. Surely the advantage lies on the side of the more modern method of deciding disputes. In 1891 the whole State of South Australia was in acondition of excitement, and the strike ' had a disturbing influence over n- a great part of Australia. Is it not much better that the company's managers and officers should be, for a short time, taken away from their ordinary work to preparesfcafcemenfcs and evidence for the Arbitra l tion Court, than that the company should be subjected to the severe loss involved by a prolonged strike 1 Common sense points to the new method of settlement as being by far the best. It has been urged that thelegislafcion now proposed is experimental. The right honourable Mr G. H . Reid, when he was criticising the provisions of the Bill and pointing out what he considered to be its defects, declared that it was an. - experiment, and I heard that statement - sneeringly referred to as a very poor reason for supporting the measure. would ask those honourable members who think that we should not try any such - experiment if they have ever been behind, the scenes ? Have they taken part in any - conflicts between capital and labour ; have they seen the disastrous results-and I am now speaking from the workmen's standpoint-that always follow in the wake of .a strike? The greater the strike the greater the trouble and suffering. Have those honourable members seen honest noble men practically torn asunder between their - duty and their loyalty to their unions, and their duty to their families ? I have seen these things. When I was actively connected with labour organizations in the past, it often made my heart almost bleed to have to tel2 men that they musfc .stand oufc, notwithstanding the great sacrifices they were making. We knew the - conditions, but we had to ignore them .as much as possible, in order that the principle at stake might be upheld. When the gaols have been emptied, and the Tiff-raff of the cities have been collected afc great expense by employers who desired to make use of them to fill the places of the .strikers, and fco defeat the unions, it has been most difficult for the best and noblest of the workmen to stand oufc for their principles. TJnder the proposal now before us, there will be no necessity for anything - of that kind. I am prepared to admit that there will be many disputes, because they will continue to occur while labour and capital exist. Bufc what we have to consider is how we can minimize the evils arising from such disputes, and to endeavour to settle them as peaceably as possible. I feel that we are standing almost onfchethreshold of a new era - a n era that will form an important one in the history of the industrial movement. W i th other honourable members, I recognise that I am about to take part in placing upon our industrial structure what I choose to designate an emblem of peace. Looking back over the rugged pathway along which - fchis industrial movement has passed, I see that at times it was on the mountain of success, and at other times in the valley of despair. All along the right side of this rugged track I note the numerous Acts fchafc have been passed up to a comparatively short time ago for the suppression of industrial organizations. And on the other side of the track, as it I presents itself to me in this panoramic view, I see the mounds that cover the remains of those who have been sacrifices to the cause. Here and there I see the finger posts which point to the men who sacrificed life and liberty to keep the light of unionism burning. It has been kept burning, and there is no power in existence that can extinguish it. I see in this vision the rise and fall of this movement from the time of that K i ng who, building better than he knew, divided his people into companies according to their trades and professions. I see the progress of the movement in the early Christian era, and I trace it on until, at one time, I find it is considered to be not unbecoming for a King to be a member of a union or of a craft guild. I referto thehistoricalfact that King Edward III . was a member offcheLinen Armourers' Guild. Immediately after, notwithstanding the popularity of the movement at that time, we find the commodity of labour ill-used. Later, I see the scourge offcheBlack Death spreading across the l&na, and unsatisfied until it has carried off one-third of the population, and with the result that I see the first labour statute passed and the first conspiracy law that was ever introduced. I trace the movement further, and in my vision I see Henry VIII . confiscating the accumulations of years, and while I gaze, I can almost hear the troubles of the weavers. Then I am confronted by the Luddite rising. When I think of that, and compare the conditions then existing with present conditions, I cannot help reflecting that the natural offspring of oppression and tyranny is revolution and anarchy. A little further along the track I see a banner floating past emblazoned- "" Educate! Educate !"" I see following it another banner, on which is inscribed the magic word, ""Ballot-box,"" and immediately afterwards I find that some 3,000,000 of the workers have secured their political rights in the shape of votes. So on and on the movement proceeds until I arrive afc the day when I find a deliberative assembly providing means for the purpose of preventing industrial disputes, and in my vision I can almost see the Judge, as he sits above the contending forces of the representatives of labour and of the employer. And, comparing this picture with that of' the past, I fail to understand how there can be any one desiring to oppose legislation having for its object peace, the bringing of the combatants together, the amelioration and betterment, not only of the employee' but of the employer, for undoubtedly peace in industrial life makes for the advantage of both interests. If we are able now to put the coping stone upon the industrial edifice it is because by virtue of their moral and numerical strength the labour unions are in a position to achieve for themselves by constitutional means their full social and political emancipation. A well known writer has saidAfter a long weary pilgrimage, labour has emerged from the valley of the shadow of political death on to the broad plane of freedom, and now demands an equitable re-adjustment of the relations between itself and capital. Prejudice and self-interest may refuse concession, but sound policy and justice will accede to the reasonable demands of tbose who constitute the wealth and power of the nation. I heartily support the second reading of this Bill,-and in Committee I shall do my best to extend its operation.",18
24,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown," I am sure, Mr Speaker, that if you were in .my place at the present moment you would feel a very exhilarating influence arising from the number and interest of your audience. [Souse counted.] I think that all will allow that this measure is more far-reaching in its effect than any measurefchafchas yefc been brought before the Commonwealth Parliament. It . could not but be a matter of much regret for me to feel that, on the opposite side from where I stand, a large and probably an overwhelming majority is to be .found entirely against my views. Bufc, added to fchafc, one has always an uncomfortable feeling when not merely a majority of the House, bufc a majority of one's party, is absolutely opposed to one. However, I have a duty to perform, and under the circumstances, in an almost unanimous House, I am sure I shall have that consideration which I have always received when I have differed from lionorable members since I have been a member of the Federal Parliament. There is another consideration which is also a little oppressive. Whether rightly or wrongly- I think wrongly-in a greatcommunity like that of Australia, the industrial interests-thos e interests which, in so far as they are represented by those who have control of fchem are very badly represented in the Parliament of Australia. Whose fault that is, it is not for me to determine. I do not desire' to see a Parliament representing anjparticular section, any particular view, or any particular creed. But I do say, seeingthat we are here as a representative assembly, that in the nature of things, as a matter of common sense, apart from the principles of representative government, those interests ought to be ' more directly represented than they are. Although I have never in my parliamentary 'career sat as the representative of any particular interest, I - still feel that what I may say upon ° this question may be ascribed to a certain amount of class feeling, fco the fact that I do represent in some degree capitalistic interests; but I can honestly say that I have no partiality in these matters, for there is no class of industry in Australia which I do not in some way or another touch. I was led to this thought by a remark of the Attorney-General. He has a quickness of imagination to which none of us can attain. He saw something in my face- I dp notknow whether it was a facial contortion which he interpreted to express dissent- but it gave him a text upon which to hang long sentences of farago. Afc the same time the genial membei' for Maranoa interjected, "" They do not like it.""' That interjecfcion is based upon an assumption that all employers of labour are entirely opposed to this industrial proposal of the Government. I do not think that they all' are. There is nobody so interested in industrial peace as is the business man. Nobody is so hard hit by industrial convulsions as are those who are engaged in mercantile pursuits. Certainly I have no reason .to be taunted with political or selfish interests merely because I am - a Member of Parliament. Whoever, if he were an honest man, made anything out of being a Memberof Parliament 1 Had I remained outside of' Parliament during the past ten years whatever possessions I have would certainly have been ten times what they are. I say, notwithstanding what may be the opinions of labour representatives and ultra democrats^ fchafc my one object in entering the publiclife of my adopted country is to do everything I can to alleviate the condition of thegreat masses of the people, to make industry run in its natural channels and r.opromote throughout the length and breadfchi of the land the welfare of the toilers of Australia. In dealing with this question apart from rhetoric and extreme views I desire to say that, considering all the circumstances, the industrial history of Australia, as compared with that of other countries, has been one of peace. True, we have had our strikes and our industrial troubles, but if we take that long, rugged road to which the honourable member for South Australia, Mr. Poynton, referred, and consider the peaceful triumphs of argument and conciliation, which have beeu won without any legislative coercion, I say they constitute a great triumph for the British pe6ple of this country. AVhat about the eight hours movement? What about the general condition of the people of the Commonwealth from one end of it to the other ?' The whole history of our industrial life in Australia is proof that there is no necessity for us to adopt these extreme acts of coercion. This is not a Bill to prevent strikes and to provide for conciliation. It is a Bill which will affect the daily habits as well as the industries of the people of Australia. Its title is a misnomer. Further, it is not a Bill based upon the understanding which was arrived at in the Convention which framed our Commonwealth Constitution. It is nothing of the kind, as I shall prove Later on. It is a Bill which is intended to supersede the States Acts upon the subject. Those who desire that the management of their own industrial affairs shall be taken out of the hands of'the States wish to see it passed in order that all the industrial disputes of Australia may be brought under the Federal legis. That is the object of a large number of honourable members. Before dealing with the measure itself, I should like to refer to a few of the speeches that have been delivered in the course of this debate. One would think that upon a Bill of this character, which in its importance overshadows almost anything that has yet been submitted to this House, we should have had some statesmanlike deliverances setting forth conclusive reasons in its favour, giving us the experience in detail of other countries, and in some way or other supporting its very extreme proposals. But let me take the speech of the Attorney-General. clared that this Bill is the result of Australian experience, while, on the other hand, the right honourable member for South Australia, Mr Kingston, said that it constituted purely an experiment. Let me see how my honourable friend sustained his position. He sustained it by the following remarks regarding New Zealand:Those who wish to appreciate not only themeasures themselves but their differences and lessons can do so most readily That expression relieves him of all obligation  Beeves' book uponState Experiments in Australia. Mr Reeves is theauthor of this legislation inNew Zealand-the man who is probably the most prejudiced individual to whom the Attorney-General could go. Afterhavingsaid that which amounted to nothing, the right honourable gentleman concluded as follows:Therefore I venture to submit that the experience of Australia justifies us in claiming that that great essential, social order, can besecured without unduly-and this is an important matter-inter fering with the course of trade and business. His remarks are based upon a complete assumption which is covered by a perfect ocean of rhetoric, in which there is nothing to show that this experiment in the industrial life of the people, the end of which no man can see, and which, in essence, is entirely a socialistic movement-althoug h it is not intended to be so by many of its advocates-is not a. movement which absolutely destroys the liberty of the people of this country putting their daily habits and, in fact, the whole of their lives into the hands of one man. Then the leader of the Opposition in a speecli, three-quarters of which was devoted to an absolute denunciation of this Bill, decided to vote for it . Bufc he said It is only a temporary measure, which must give way as time goes onfcobetter ideas. Afc that stage the Attorney-General interjectedNo, it goes on for ever. What is the principle which is here laid down 1 It is that it is an advance in civilization, an advance in that liberty which, I suppose, every man cherishes. Is it an advance, seeing that we are asked to give up the whole of the principles which have made our race whafc it is, that instead of He de- confining government to the sanitary inspector and the policeman, we are called upon to sacrifice all our cherished ideas of individual liberty in order that the police court, in other words an arbitration court, may be so brought into the life of the individual that he cannot exercise individual intelligence in - his own pursuits. the speech of the honourable and learned member for West Sydney I do not - care to say much. It was certainly very vitriolic. But when an honourable member indulges in this sort of languageWe have permitted these people to go on until licence has ensuedwhat does it mean ? It means that a handful of Members of Parliament, newly elected to this Chamber, and many of them men of very small experience, consider that they have a right-Parliament , of course, can do anything-to practically challenge and defy the whole system of our industrial life, which has built up this great country, and made their positions here possible. I have been in this country for the last thirty-four years, and knowing what has been done by the pioneers, the men who have risked everything - and capital has suffered as much as labour in this country-it seems to me to be a piece of audacity and presumption for any one to talk of these men, who have really made this community, being under the heel of a fewpersons who happen to be for some little time Members of Parliament. Parliament is the highest tribunal of the country. not going to belittle it, bufc I assert that it was never instituted to interfere with the industries of the people of a country. It was designed to make laws for the preservation of those industries-certainl y not a law which would bring every industry under the heel of a Court of Arbitration. I should like for a moment or two to draw the attention of honourable members to the history of legislation of this kind in New South Wales. The New South Wales Act is of very recent date, and although it avoids those intermediate Boards of Conciliation which are a purely bogus institution in New Zealand, it is based to a large extent upon the law offchafccolony.",20
25,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown,Bogu s ?,22
26,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,The termediate boards simply cause the parties to lose time in reaching the Arbitration Court.,22
27,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown,They are not bogus.,22
28,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,"They do nothing bufc create warfare in the industrial - life of New Zealand. They settle nothing. They result only in agitation. I have no doubt bufc that under that system thousands and thousands of people in hundreds of Of industries who previously were perfectly satisfied with their condition and worked without the slightest check or hindrancean amicable feeling existing between them and their masters-becam e dissatisfied. As the outcome of that pernicious system, which is worse than the proposal now before us, there has been something worse than warfare and continual irritation going on in the industrial life of New Zealand. The honourable member for South Aus speech on this measure, referred to the position in that colony, and said- I made a note of his words at the time-that Disputes still continued for years, but no blow has been struck and no men have been idle. Every honourable member who has addressed himself fco fchis question has saidfchafcanything is better than a strike. I agree fchafc there are thousands of things that are better than a strike, but war is often better than peace. Have honourable members any reason to believe for one moment, that when this Court is in full force and is giving decisions from time to fcime, the bitterness betwen the parties will be anything less than that which is created I arn by a strike ? I have not. The Arbitration Court emanated from the feeling which has become rampant in the political life of Australia that Parliament can do everything. We may depend upon it that when a law of this kind is passed in any State of Australia, and fails to effect the purpose for which it is designed, there will soon be cries to amend it. There is already a cry in New South Wales for the amendment of the State Act. The fact that awards are made and strikes are prevented by these Courts gives us no reason fco hope either for immediate peace orfcheultimate success of the system. I take it that we all desire to see the industries of Australia carried on upon common-sense lines, so that in every case capital will be continually increased, wear and tear made good, and the machinery innecessary for manufacture renewed from timefcotime. There must be a fund which, in the first place, will pay capital for its use, and an added fund which will repair the waste and wear and tear in connection with the work associated with industrial life. There musfc be a fund which will enable the machinery employed in the great competition offcheworld to be renewed from time to time, and which will, if necessary, absolutely recreate industrial conditions. T am very much afraid that we are dealing - with this question largely from a provincial point of view. What is all this protectionist craze about ? It has but one object, with which free-traders agree, although we seek to achieve it in a different way. We all desire to see ' Australia a great industrial continent. We wish to see every possible manufacture set on foot here, and we desire, at the same time, a great primary production, which will give us the markets of the world. We must recollect, however, that although we may make laws to meet certain conditions of our provincial life, we cannot, meet the competition of the world by any legislative act. We shall have to enter into competition with the world, and honourable members may take my word for it that the economics lying at the base of the present industrial system-unles s they desire to destroy that system altogether-wil l force them against their will to take certain action. If this State interference goes on-if this control of our industries by one man works out the results actually anticipated-w e shall find that Australia will have to become a second China, and take a secondary place among the nations of the world. I should like to draw attention to the spirit in which this Bill has been introduced. I should have thought that in framing this measure, the right honourable member for South Australia, Mr Kingston, would deal with it very much like the Treasurer would deal with a Bill relating to banking. It has always been understood that in relation to every measure affecting very largely the practical life of the people- a measure which we may say is not purely one for lawyers-the Government as practical men invariably take the advice of those who are supposed to be experts, and those whose industries will be affected by it. Was that course followed in this case? We understand that not one individual who would naturally be opposed to this Bil l ever received a copy of it, or had an interview with the Minister in reference to it . The right honourable gentleman has confessed that an exactly opposite course was followed by him. In the first instance a draft copy of the Bill was given to the Age newspaper long before even the Parliament saw it, and whatever information was disclosed in relation to the measure was given to associations and people who were known to be favourable to it and absolutely hostle to other interests, kind ? According to the views of men like Mr Wise and others who have given attention to these matters in Parliament, it is intended to divide the whole community into two warring camps. We must recollect that it is not designed to deal merely with large bodies of men-lik e the shearers and the men employed in the marine service-wh o may come into, conflict with their employers, but that it is an insidious mode of throwing the hand of the State upon every industry. What is' going on in Sydney at the present time? We find that the time of the Court is engaged in an investigation relating to the wages of cooks in restaurants; that a restaurant owner complains to the Court that the hotel keeper gives a free lunch with a glass of beer and is thus interfering with his industry, and that there is also a conflict of jurisdiction. The early-closing lawstipulates that a butcher, for example, carrying on business in Sydney, shall close his shop every Saturday at 10 p.m. We then find the Arbitration Court, which is presided over by Mr Justice Cohen; deciding that he shall close his shop at 9 o'clock in the evening. The man is naturally perplexed. He does not know what to do, .and applies for an injunction. We are now going to add to this double perplexity the further interference of a Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. Not only have we surrounded the industrial life of Australia with all sorts of irritating restrictions, which it was never intended, even by the most extreme advocate of this kind of legislation, to create, but we are about to set up a new Court, so that after a State Court has dealt with and decided an industrial dispute, it cannot be regarded as settled, because a little chicanery or subterfuge will make it appear a Commonwealth affair, and then the Commonwealth Court can be invoked to upset the judgment. Besides that there are further complications created by this fearful intrusion of the process of the law courts into the private affairs of the people, and at the present time the position in New South Wales has become so serious that the Court cannot overtake its work, so that, I believe, there are cases pending which it will take two years to hear.",22
29,Mr WILKS,Unknown,But there is no strikeon now.,23
30,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,"That is no answer to my argument. ment must either be content to allow the work of the Court to fall into arrears, and to leave the community in a state of ferment, or it must appoint another Judge. If there are two Judges, how will their divergent opinions the reconciled ? We are only at the com-mencement of this experiment, and no one - can foretell what the final result of it will be. . As a rule, I am not an alarmist, amd do not take an extreme view in i-egard to the effect of Acts of Parliament upon the investment of capital. But honourable members musfc admit that if we pass legislation which is so difficult to administer that it leaves the whole industrial community in a state of ferment, upsets the businesses of hundreds of people, and creates general turmoil, the interests of the country must be injured. No place in the world requires the expenditure of capital from abroad more than does Australia. I should like here to refer to the three classes of people who favour legislation of this kind. They are what I call the opportunists, the peace-makers, and the socialists. I do not take account of a fourth class, who might' be called the sudden converts, the appearance of whom we have recently witnessed in this House. Let me deal first with the opportunists. Legislation of this kind was first passed in New Zealand, and no one who has studied the public life of Australia during the last seven or eight years can fail to see that a large number of people and politicians is determined to seize upon and support, without regard to consequences, whatever they term in their clap-trap phraseology progressive movements. I read very caref u l l y the Hanscurd reports of the debates in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly upon the Bill introduced by the Attorney General of that State. Some of the ablest men in that House spoke of that Bill in terms of denunciation far beyond the capability of my vocabulary; but there was no attempt to vote against the second reading. It seems to me that we have lost sight of the original constitutional meaning of the second reading of a Bill. The second reading is an affirmation of the principles of a measure. But, notwithstanding the denunciation of the New South Wales Bill, it was allowed to pass. A few able men spoke against it, and showed the dangers which it would produce, but two-thirds, if not threeParlia- fourths, of the members voted for it without giving an opinion upon its provisions, and probably knowing very little about it .",24
31,Mr GROUCH,Unknown,Does the honourable member expect every one who votes upon a Bill to express his opinions upon its provisions ?,24
32,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,"No . It is often a good thing that honourable members do not give their opinions, because if they did it would be fatal to their reputation for intelligence. But are we to allow legislation like this to pass merely because it is termed progressive? Prom time to time we pass legislation which a few years ago would have been scouted. It is put forward as progressive legislation, and men who are afraid to be thought behind the times feel that they must vote for it . They see that the surface intention is good, and they give very little consideration to the probable effects. I believe that every member of this House who approves of the Bill before us belongs to the second class of those who are in favour of this legislation-the peace-makers. They think that it provides a means of preventing disastrous strikessuch as have been so heart breaking in the past, and that such means should be adopted even at the risk of some injury to the industrial life of Australia. But many of those who hold that view-and I say this without want of respect for them - have not sufficient knowledge of the complicated questions affected. In my opinion this legislation will do what it was never intended by - its loudest advocates should be done. I am sure that even those who approve of its principles never intended that discontent should run riot throughout the industries of the country, petty as well as great; but some of them have seen action taken in New Zealand, and lately in New South'rWai<Ss, { which they must have regretted. And, as I have said, tliere is a third class-the socialists-wh o favour this legislation: I look upon a Bill of this kind as another link in the great socialistic chain which has been forging in Australia for some years past. A process is going on-of which some are well aware, biit in regard to which others have been duped-by which the inner life of every citizen is being disturbed by the operation of interfering laws and the vexatious application of theparaphernaliaof the Courts. I do not desire to refer unnecessarily to free-. trade and protection, but there is no doubt that this class legislation is the corollary of the protectionist principle. It is certainly not the corollary of the free-trade principle, and therefore I hold that I am perfectly consistent as a free-trader in opposing the Bill. At the same time, I should not be consistent in anything if I thought my - inconsistency would be likely to bring about - beneficial results for my fellow creatures. This, however, is undoubtedly another of those movements by which the State gradually is taking control of the industrial affairs of the people. That principle has been openly avowed in this Chamber. We have been told with a great rhetorical flourish, and with a fine appearance of - humanitarianism, which, no doubt, has beeu perfectly sincere, that the. time has come for another step forward in the march of civilization. I thought that when every man was granted the privilege of the vote, when education was made free and compulsory, and almost every restriction was taken off every human being, owing to the action of the great Liberal party in England during the last century, our legislation in the future would be directed to promoting the progress of this great country, with its - boundless resources. But what are we asked to do now ? We are passing into another stage of civilization, in which the Parliament - of the country is practically expected to meet every difficulty of social and industrial life. Does any honourable member really believe that Parliament is fit to interfere in the management of industrial affairs 1 AVe - can do it only by delegation, and what must be the result of that delegation? AVhat does the Bill provide ? If the Attorney-General were here I should point to the Bill, with its 130 clauses, and the various - provisions which are no doubt necessary to carry out its objects, and I should tell him what it all meant. It means giving into the - hands of one man-becaus e the assessors are always partisans-the whole industrial life of Australians. Is it to be supposed that - one man, a lawyer, more than any other, - could adjudicate upon all the complicated issues which would come before him - in matters of this kind ? What power does the Bill give? AVe find that ""industrial matters "" Include all matters relating to work, pay, wages, reward, hours, privileges, rights, or duties of employers or employees, or the mode, terms, .mid conditions of employment or non-employment ; and in particular, but without limiting the - general scope of this definition, include all matters pertaining to the relations of employers and employees, and the employment, preferential employment, dismissal, or non-employ ment of any particular persons or of persons of any particular sex or age, or being or not being members of anj' organization, body, or society. That sounds like a memorandum of association which is intended to leave nothing out. Then, in order to connect the law with the Executive Government, ""organization"" is defined as meaningAny organization registered pursuant to this Act, and, so far us applicable, it also includes any proclaimed organization to which the Governor General declares this Act to apply. So that not merely the Parliament which creates the tribunal, but the Executive Government of the Commonwealth has to decide several matters to which I shall presently refer. Then in clause 41 it is provided thatA certincate by the Registrar that any dispute relating to industrial mutters is an industrial dispute extending beyond the limits of anj' one State shall be primd facie evidence that the fact is as stated. Where are the States rights ? The Registrar can decide the complicated question whether a dispute extends beyond the limits of any one State, and according to the dictum of one man from whom there is no appeal, the whole of the industries in two States or more may be dislocated pending adjudication. The Bill goes further by providing thatThe Governor General may on the recommendation of the President . by proclamation declare this Act to apply to any trade or otlier union or branch of any union. In other words, the common rule may be applied to all parts of Australia. I am trying to show the absolute power of the President of the proposed Court. He will be able to create for himself any rules he likes, subject to their being laid upon the table of the House for fifteen days. He will have the power to bring any industrial dispute within the scope of his adjudication, and to make a common rule, which may not be confined to the particular State in which the dispute has arisen, but extended to every State. Even though a common rule could not be extended, beyond one State, the power of the Court. would be enormous, in view of the vast areas of some of the States. If an isolated dispute occurred, involving a certain section of a certain trade, the Court might make a common rule which would apply to the same industry hundreds of miles away, and I fchinkfchafcwhen the Acfc comes into operation we shall have a lively time with the different States over this mode of interfering with fchem.",24
33,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,The Court can also vary the rule.,26
34,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,"Yes , that is the point; it can do anything. There is no appeal from the decision of the Court except on a point of law, and there is practically no provision for review, because the Judge is not likely to do anything inconsistent with his own judgment. Therefore, one fallible man might make a rule which would have force for five years, and with which nothing could interfere. Mr Cnoucu - That state of affairs exists in all the Courts.",26
35,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,"On l y far as a verdict may be obtained regarding a specific case arising out of the difficulties of the past. But no one ever heard of any Court being able to interfere with and fco adjudicate upon affairs of industrial life the conditions of which might alter altogether within twelve months. I think that everyone will agree that no higher class of men has ever existed in any country than the Judges of our Supreme Court Benches. But what will the future have in store for us? If the whole industrial life of Australia is to become the subject of political scuffling; if Parliament is to enunciate the principle that it can and will settle all these matters without regard to the extent to which it may, by so doing, interfere with human freedom; if we depart more and more widely from the principles which have made the parliamentary system of England the first in the world, what will be the result ? Who will be our Judges ? We know that a great many of the appointmentsfco-ourSupreme Court Benches are of a political character, and no man can help being biased to a large extent by his political leanings. Is it to be pretended that some honourable and learned members who might be appointed to the Bench in the future and who might be capable of giving a sound opinion upon many questions of dry law, would be absolutely unprejudiced? Is it contended that the influence of politics would not make itself felt upon this tribunal in the future ? There are great dangers ahead, and I think that the public conscience-if fchere be any public conscience left-wil l be greatly tried by the decisions given. One decision was recently given in New South Wales which was utterly opposed to our ideas of human liberty, and if similar control is to be exercised in all industries, there will be no freedom in the country. In spite of all the eulogiums passed upon similar legislation in New Zealand, there is no freedom in that colony, because the Government dominate industrial life to an extent never before known in a British community. A system of espionage and tyranny exists there which no Englishman should ever be called upon to endure.",26
36,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,Does the honourable member say that as a free-trader he cannot logical]v support the Bill?,26
37,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,"No , I stated that as a free-trader I was perfectly consistent in opposing the Bill, because so my view is that Government should be confined to those duties which it is necessaiy for the State to perform, leaving all other matters to the intelligence of the individual. The intelligence that has built up Australian civilization ought to be able to look after itself. How is it intended to deal with the varying conditions of industrial life if, for instance, a common rule is to made for a period of five years ? I know of an industry in New South Wales which came under the adjudication of the Arbitration Court in the State, and I can assure honourable members that owing to the loss of business, resulting from the drought and other circumstances, the wholeof the features of the enterprise have been altered, and the settlement;, which on theface of it was a very fair one twelve months ago, is now absolutely unfair. How is such' a case to be dealt with ? Then again, is the Court to be called upon by the labour organizations to insist upon conditions which are absolutely incompatible with the solvency of a business ? Because, whatever may be the minimum wage there is a point at which operations must come to an end. I am connected with an industry in New South Wales, in which for fifteen years we paid a living wage to our men without returning a single penny to any one but debenture holders. How can a Judge dictate to individuals regarding the wages to be paid in an enterprise in which money has to be set aside every year for depreciation, and for the payment of. a certain rate of interest upon a reasonable capital? The position of affairs, so far as profits are concerned, and also the element of insecurity, have to be taken into consideration. Do honourable members think, because some settlements are being arrived at, that those settlements will not affect the future expenditure of capital 1 ""We have heard nothing but a universal crow over the fact that settlements have been completed. Of course they have. The only alternative was for the employers to close their businesses, and people will carry on a very long time, hoping against hope, before they adopt that extreme course. But I can assure honourable members that settlements are now being effected in New South Wales which - are absolutely ruinous to business, and if mutters in that State do not improve- I hope they will, but there are conditions which nobody can control-ver y serious loss will - accrue, very heavy withdrawals of capital will follow, and there will be a very natural - disinclination to invest money in the country. We have been told by some honourable members that the very fact chat the Arbitration - Court wil] be able to settle disputes and prevent strikes will give stability to capital. I do not think that honourable members who make th.it assertion understand the capitalist. If I were in England with a capital - of £100,000 or £200,000, which I was asked to invest in Australia, and if I were told that not my Own managers, nor my - own board, nor those who understood all the conditions of the business, but a High Court Judge, who might, or might not, be biased-because , although he might be as pure AS any man in the community, he must necessarily have a limited knowledge of these things-wa s to be the arbitrator in regard to the conduct of my affairs, I should say "" No, I thank you."" I think that every man of business would entertain the same feeling. This sort of humanitarianism which seems to lie at the bottom of these proposals is all well enough in its way. But to my mind there is a false humanitarism which may be very destructive, first to the industrial ditions upon which we are existing at the present time, and secondly, to the interests of the very people whose welfare we are endeavouring to conserve. But the insidious nature of this Bill, and the insidious character of the advocacy of it-whic h I fear more than anything else-is evidenced by the fact that up till a few years ago the workmen were fighting only for their rights. They were at perfect liberty to do so. Labour has a perfect right to get a fair price for its commodity, and I hope that it always will get that price. Those who were the strongest advocates of the working man believed in fair play between capital and labour. But the legislation which it is now proposed to enact-despit e the statement of the honourable and learned member for West Sydney, to the eifect that socialists are opposed to such legislation-is undoubtedly of a socialistic character, and the socialist does not meet the capitalist fairly, when questions between capitalandlabourarein the balance. He says-"" I want to destroy capital."" If we pass this Bill I am convinced that before many years have passed we shall find that we have simply played into the hands of those who wish to take the control of all industrial enterprise from private individuals and to put it into the hands of the State. I have been struck once or twice by the wonderful magnanimity with which some of our legal friends enter into discussions of this character and advocate these highflown, humanitarian principles. They never suffer themselves. Some of the greatest advocates of this socialistic legislation are the barristers of Australia, who make £3,000, £4,000, £5,000, and .16,000 a year, and who know perfectly well that it will not affect them. Moreover, I do not think that they are always the best judges of industrial conditions. I should like to say a few words upon another point which I have previously touched upon. What is the meaning of the provision in our Constitution which gives this Parliament power to legislate upon matters relating to conciliation and arbitration for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State ? As lionorable members are aware, our Constitution is based upon the Constitution of the TJnited States. We have no jurisdiction, except in the""se matters which are specially delegated to us under that Constitution. In the con- Convention, the question arose as to the desirableness of giving this Parliament power to legislate in reference to industrial disputes. I am sure that my colleagues in that Convention who may be present will agree that it was decided, after a long discussion, that all industrial disputes were practically matters within the control of the States Governments-that they were social, domestic matters which ought not to be dragged into the arena of the Commonwealth Parliament. But some delegates were of opinion that we should insert in the Constitution a provision by means of which, if occasion arose-I . suppose the seamen's and the shearers' disputes were those most in the minds of members of the Convention-tli e parties to any trouble could be brought together and the matter dealt with as a whole. That limited power was intended to be exercised only as a last resort-ther e is not one word in the Constitution in reference to compulsory arbitration.",26
38,Mr BROWN,Unknown,There is not one word against it .,28
39,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,"No , but I say it was never intended by the framers of that Constitution 'that this power should be used as a means of dragging the whole of the industrial life of Australia before a tribunal such as it is proposed to establish. Moreover, that tribunal has not been framed upon modest lines. It has.beeu framed, from whatever stand-point it may be regarded, in such a way that it will inevitably bring about a conflict between the different States and the Commonwealth. It is to be given powers which I do not believe this Parliament can lawfully confer. I shall refer to one or two of these. Of course the right honourable member for South Australia, Mr. Kingston, who even attempted to def}' us upon some matters connected with our own legislation- I refer to the duty chargeable upon cartridges and shot;-ha s an idea that so long as we are strong and can assert ourselves we have no right to consider these small constitutional differences. He saysSurely the interpretation of our Constitution is not of a character which will deny the most beneficial results ! In other words, if there is anything which can come within the. category of ""beneficial results,"" according to the views of some strong-minded individuals like himself, it is our duty to strain the Constitution. I wish to refer very briefly to the powers which - are conferred by that instrument. The Bil l contains the following provision :The Court shall have cognisance lowing industrial disputes- . . . All industrial disputes with which any State industrial authority or the Government of a State requests the Court to deal. What is the meaning of that ? It ineans that the Executive Government of the Common- ""permit ""1 wealth, through its own Judge of this Court, can practically remove every indusnot trial dispute into the realm of its own diction if, as I said upon a previous occasion, it can obtain the assent of the Executive pened. of one of the States. Then clause 41 readsA certificate by the Registrar that any dispute relating to industrial matters is. an industrial dispute extending beyond the limits of any oneState shall be primd facie evidence that the fact, is as stated., I hold that that provision is entirely unconstitutional. The provision in the Constitution was intended to be a sort of safeguard for the industrial legislation of the States. It was never intended that it should be made a supreme means of forcing the industrial disputes of a State into the arena of the Commonwealth. As showing how farsome honourable members are prepared to go in their desire to ignore all principle whatever, they have actually declared that the word "" prevent,"" which is used in the Con'stitution, shows that the Commonwealth can actually take Gognisance of the brewing of an industrial dispute before it has come to a head. To begin with, that is an absolute impossibility, because we cannot know that a dispute will occur until it has cometo a head, and in the next place those whoargue, like the right honourable member for South Australia, Mr Kingston, that this Court has actually the right to decide, when a dispute is brewing, would actually giveaway the liberties of any people in anj' country.",28
40,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown,Oh no.,28
41,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,"What did my right honourable friend mean when he told the House that before there was a lock-out, or a strike, or indeed any manifestation of a real struggle, the Judge of thisCourt had the power of his own initiative todetermine whether or not a dispute was about tq take place and to intervene.",28
42,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown,The Courthas the right tointervene when a dispute occurs and before a strike takes place.,28
43,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,Is a y thab the language of the right honourable member of a the folisabsolutely inconsistent.,28
44,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown,"How are we going to""prevent"" a strike if we allow it to occur ?",28
45,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,"The word, ""prevent"" is not used in that sense.",28
46,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown,Is it used in the sense of,28
47,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,"It canbe used iri the sense of "" pi-event,'' bejuriscause a strike does not come within the; cognisance of the Court until it has hap",28
48,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown,"The honourable member is confusing a ""dispute"" with a ""strike."" I should be sorry indeed if the Court could not intervene before a strike occurred to prevent its extension to two or more States.",29
49,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,"We can settle a dispute, but how are we to know that there is such a thing until it has actually occurred.",29
50,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown,"Surely we can distinguish between a ""dispute "" and a "" strike.""",29
51,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,"I now to one or two details in the discussion of which I have no desire to occupy any length of time. We have first Of all to consider the application of the common rule. In my opinion the power to make a common rule should not be placed in the hands of any man in a country like Australia. When we give to a Judge the power to make a common rule applicable to the whole of Australia-and it is no answer to say that he will be a man of common sense, and so forth-we cannot blame him if he exercises it. In Australia we have such varied conditions, and such an enormous area to deal with, that in my opinion no man ought to be allowed to apply such a rule. It may give rise to the greatest amount of friction between the States and the Commonwealth imagine that a dispute occurs in an industry which overlaps New South Wales and Victoria, and that a certain decision is given by the Court. Does the honourable member for South Australia, Mr. Kingston, say that in that case the common rule might be applied to Queensland 1",29
52,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown,Whereve r it quired.,29
53,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,"Let us suppose that in such a case the common rule was applied to Queensland, where a local Judge under a simple mode of procedure had given a judgment dealing with the matters determined by the Commonwealth Court. What would happen if the two decisions differed? Does the right honourable member mean to tell me-and this is the time for us to consider this outrageous aspect of the question - that if there is a dispute between employ^ and employers in an industry in Victoria and New South Wales, which does not extend to Queensland, where both parties are working under a rule laid down by a local Court, the moment that dispute is settled by the Commonwealth Judge, he* can make a common rule which will extend to Queensland and interfere with the State jurisdiction ? That is exactly what he contends. Those who argue that a Judge can interfere before any real dispute hasoccurred and bring the powers of the Court into operation, and those who say that a common rule may be applied to a placein which there is no dispute and where theconditions may be absolutely different, are absolutely willing for the sake of their Come socialistic principles to stifle all the liberties of Australia.",29
54,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown,Is ' the honourable member contending for the liberty of Australia to strike ?,29
55,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,"I am. contending for the liberty of men to manage their own business according to ordinaryprinciples, which they best understand.",29
56,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown,Although the highestCourt in the land says that something should be done 1,29
57,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,"The right honourable member's recent work is not a good example of the application of the legal mind to industrial affairs. I should like to quote a passage from the speech made by the honourable member forLet us Bland in dealing with this question, becauseI think it shows the reductio ad absurdum of my right honourable friend's argument. He saidright In New Zealand the same difficulty has been experienced. Applications were made for an award of the Court in the three large southern centres of Dunedin, Christchurch, and Wellington. No such application caine from Auckland, withwas re- the result that the Court made an award which affected each of these three large towns. The conditions probably varied in each of these towns. They are towns of marked individuality. I know that the countrymen of niy honourable friend opposite preponderate in New Zealand, and I should not give others much hope of successfully competing with them. The position in Auckland was that the employers and employees came to an industrial agreement without invoking the aid of the Court-a u agreement under which the rates fixed were lowerthan those which the Court bod decided upon in the case of the towns mentioned. As the New Zealand Act applies to provincial districts, and not to the whole colonyThat is a very wide reservationthe Court could not alter the agreement entered into between the Auckland employers and 'employees, but it felt that, as the goods manufactured in that city entered into competition with tbose produced at the other centres, its only alternative was eitlier to force the Auckland rates up a little, or to reduce those of Dunedin, - Christchurch, and Wellington. AVe have come to a peculiar position in the history of Australian legislation when it is proposed to pass a bill, one of the principles of which-and that principle has been - carried out in New Zealand-is that when one particular set of employees and employers in a certain business disagree, and go to the Court, the Judge who deals with the matter may make an award which will apply to other communities where the employees - and employers are perfectly satisfied with the existing condition of affairs, and between whom there has never been a murmur - of dissension. The argument, I suppose, is that the Judge will use his common sense and refrain from the adoption of such a - course. Bufc fchis has actually occurred in New Zealand. Under this BillfcheCourt will be able, in the circumstances I have named, ko say to men who were no parties to the dispute dealt with by it - "" Y o u r - employers are tyrants. AVe believe that the case of the other men is a good one, and - although you have been perfectly satisfied, and although industrial peace has actually - existed here, we apply this common rule to yon."" Is that conciliation 'l",29
58,Mr RONALD,Unknown,Yes .,30
59,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,"It is not. Industrial warfare is created in bhis way in - certain districts and amongst certain people - who were perfectly satisfied before this bogus legislation was passed. By giving these powers in the Bill, we inferentially - declare that they shall be exercised. We practically direct that the Court shall - exercise these powers, and fchafc it shall make a common rule wherever it is possible to do so. Honourable members talk about strikes and industrial commotion, but no strike is equal tofcheinjustice, tyranny, and - degradation which, so far as many people are concerned, musfc ensue from this proposal. Underlying allfchisa great principle is involved-the principle of independence of mind, the leaning of individuals upon themselves ; the dissociation from improper Government interference of the multiform - activities which have built up all the best industries of fchis country. Bill enacts that a man's individual intelli.geuce, character, experience, and money, properly expended shall no longer have due effect in his business dealings. Under a law of this kind a man may go on building up his business for ten years on lines that are perfectly satisfactory to himself and his employees ; but, as the result of a dispute in which he has had no concern, his whole business system ma.y be disarranged in one moment. He may be compelled to alter the whole of his arrangements. There are various conditions which affect business. Consideration has to be paid first of all to the locality, the price of food, the rent charged, and many - other things which make it far more expensive to live in one place than another. But the character of the employer, the mode in which he deals with his employees-hi s bonus or profit-sharing system-ha s also to be considered. There are all the conditions which arise from long employment in a certain business, with a certain amount of what one may call parental control, which to many men are often worth more than a rise of 5 per cent, in wages. But when this Bill comes into effect; we shall destroy the very principle of conciliation, the very principle of mutuality. We shall destroy that principle which causes a man to be, not a mere nigger-driver, but one who is sensitive as to his position, sensitive as to his responsibility, attached to his employees, and willing to treat them, not as a mere slavedriver would do, but as an intelligent person.",30
60,Mr RONALD,Unknown,Is the honourable member an example of that class of man }1,30
61,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,"The honourable member knows nothing about this question. Under this Bill it is proposed to do what Mr Wise distinctly said he desired to see accomplished by the passing of the New South Wales Conciliation and Arbitration Act. He said that he desired to create two industrial parties absolutely at war with one another, and then, because there was no freedom of contract on the part of the employee-seein g fchafc the employer could wait whereas the employee could not-h e desired to set them in two separate camps, as he has done, without any regard to those conditions which go to make up' the decencj' and the humanitarianism of life. I shall give an instance of the difficulty of dealing with these 'matters afc the present moment. Honourable This members say that under this Bill disputes will often"" be settled by conciliation, without resort to arbitration. I deny it . Under this Bill fchere will be no conciliation. Our experience, both in New Zealand and elsewhere, is that the employees will always go to the Court, because they believe that they cannot do worse. They start, not in a fair position in which the Judge might say to them- "" You are perhaps receiving too much ;"" but just as in dozens of cases",30
62,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown,The honourable member does not think there is any case in which the men would be receiving too much.,31
63,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,I have as much regard for the labouring classes as has the right honourable member.,31
64,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown,I did not say that such was not the case.,31
65,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,"I contend that there will be no conciliation under this Bill. The moment that the Arbitration Court is created the position will be just as it is under the States Conciliation and Arbitration Acts. Instead of matters being arranged by mutual agreement-and , in spite of the false rhetoric which we have heard very largely on this subject, that has been the case in connection with innumerable businesses, and is still taking placewe shall have a Court",31
66,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,Does the honourable member think that either party will ever receive what it does not prove itself entitled to ?,31
67,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,"I do not know. But I contend, now, that conciliation has gone. Awards made by the Court in New South Wales have, in some cases, given effect to proposals which were made long before by the employers. In one case an award gave effect to terms which were offered to employees, perhaps two or three years before. Honourable members may say, then, that the Court, at all events, settles the difficulty. We are replete with this sentiment in the Parliaments of Australia/"" If you can obtain a thing by law why not get it."" But the moment we bring a law into operation as between employers and employees we alter the whole position. We alter the mutual relations between the two parties. What will be the outcome of the passage of this Bill ? In many cases it will not result in benefit to the workmen or employee's. We shall find that the relationship between employers and employed will' be brought down to the very lowest level by an adjustment of conditions in which a man's abilities and other circumstances, which the employer alone is capable of understanding, will be set aside. A fierce feeling of injustice will be created, and"" we shall find in the long run that, instead of there being that liberal encouragement which should be given to brains and experience, this law will in many respects react against the men themselves. Here we have a country Jiow possessing absolute freedom, and with universal education. Every man has a reasonable education, and there is no position in. life to which a man with brains and a fair English education may not aspire. Some of our best men have graduated from the ranks, and, having taken their places amongst the masters of industry, are now leading both the industry and thought of the country. But what will this Bill do ? It will create two great camps. It will marshal the two great industrial forces oneagainst the othei-, as though they wereabsolutely antagonistic. It will put it intothe power of 100 men, when 400 of their fellows are perfectly satisfied with the conditions of their employment, to approach, the Court and say, "" We are a degraded: people; we want our conditions altered.""' There might be 5,000 men employed in anindustry, 4,900 of whom were perfectly satisfied with their conditions; but if the remaining 100 were dissatisfied, they could,, if I understand the provisions of the Bill aright, create a disturbance, and,, by taking their employers and their fellow employees before the Court, throw the whole industry into a state of"" turmoil and unrest. Furthermore, we arefostering in this country the idea that nothing can be done except by Act of Parliament. We are making our labouring population feel that they have only to apply to Parliament to get anything they want that whenever they apply to Parliament they will get an Act which will do all that isnecessary to better their condition, and, which, if it is found not to quite suifc, can be amended until it does. There is no rest and satisfaction today in New South Walesin any of the industries in connection with which there has been adjudication by theArbitration Court. Furthermore, we areimplanting false and delusive hopes in the minds of the people. Legislation of this kind is part and parcel of the system of State interference with private industry, of which we have seen somuch in New South Wales, and which has resulted in molly-coddling and extravagance in public expenditure, until, the country has become crowded with. loafers, to the injury of the honest working man. I believe that nine-tenths of the working men of Australia are as fine a set of men as there are on the face of the earth. But there is a remnant of loafers, to whom the honourable member for Darling referred, who are eating out the heart of the ind ustrial life of the country. They crowd out towns and cities; butthereal honest working men should have nothing to do with them. Honourable members apparently do not realise that in passing legislation of this kind, they are undermining the intelligence, the hardihood, the manliness of the working classes ; that they are sapping the love for improving their position and enjoying the results of that improvement which is the first effect of civilisation. This movement is the result of a wave of thought which brings everything to the Government and to Parliament to be set right. leaving us to pass the statutes which are necessary for the improvement of the country, and to place our people in a position in which they can freely meet the competition of the world, we have to spend half our time in the consideration of matters which are really outside our parliamentary duties. As a citizen of Australia, I do not look with any great hope to the prospects of the next twenty or thirty years. I believe that this rage for parliamentary interference, which has been produced by a false and exaggerated humanitarian feeling, will sooner or later have its reaction. But we should only hark back after a very bitter experience of the effects of our. legislation. Until that reaction comes, our industrial life will not improve, and our manhood will be unequal to that of the country from which we have sprung. I have not dealt with outside questions, such as the advisability of including seamen in the operation of the measure, in connection with which the right honourable member for South Australia retired from the Ministry.",31
68,Mr HENBYWILLIS,Unknown,The honourable member should say a word or two on - subject.,32
69,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,"As a layman I cannot see much difference between dealing with the seamen in this Bill, or in a Navigation Bill . Whatever the - difference may be, it appears to me to be the difference between tweedledum and tweedledee. Remembering the country from which we come, and the fact that we live on an island continent, we should be very caref u l to prevent anything like provincialism in dealing with maritime affairs. We should be very careful that the facts are sufficiently big to wan-ant us in interfering before we take any step which will make the captain of a British vessel feel that when in Australian waters he is on what is practically a foreign coast.",32
70,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown,Does the honourable member favourtheexemptionof foreign ships from the operation of this measure while it is applied to British vessels 1,32
71,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,B r it is h ships cannot be regarded as foreign vessels.,32
72,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown,I do not refer to British ships as foreign.,32
73,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,What I intended to say is that I do not think that we should attempt to pass narrow legislation. Instead of We should see that the facts are sufficiently big before we interfere.,32
74,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown,Can any case be made out for exempting a German ship from legislation which is applied to British ships ?,32
75,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,I do not intend to deal with that question. What I ' understand my right honourable friend really desires is that if the ocean-going mail steamers are permitted to carry passengers between Australian ports--the y carry practically no inter-State cargo-the y shall pay the same wages to the seamen employed on them that we pay to our own seamen.,32
76,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown,Not quite that. It should be witbin the power of the Court to make such a rule if they consider it desirable to do so.,32
77,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,"If we give the Couft that power, we by implication require them to exercise it ; just as if my right honourable friend succeeded in getting a resolution passed by a huge majority, he would require the Government to carry it into effect. After all, regard must be paid to proportion in everything. Is the amount which is taken from the earnings of the mercantile marine registered the in Australia worth talking about?",32
78,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown,Undoubtedl y it is.,32
79,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,"I fchink it is not, Only a few thousands of pounds are taken from the pockets of individuals, but that money would not go into the pockets of Australian ship-owners if the thousands of people who now travel each year between Sydney and Melbourne by mail steamer for the sake of their health - were obliged either to use the coastal boats or to go by rail, because they would choose to travel by rail. honourable friend's proposal will, however, hit Western Australia particularly hard. At a time when this House refuses to complete the transcontinental railway line-purel y for financial reasons, because I believe that that line must ultimately be made-an y policy which would isolate that great State is small-minded, and out of all proportion to the result that is hoped from it . The whole thing resolves itself into a matter of pounds, shiUings. and pence, and in my opinion the amount involved is not worth the trouble which it is proposed to take. The right honourable gentleman takes the same stand in regard to this matter that he has taken in regard to the fiscal question. If fchere were some small industry in Australia occupying ten persons, he would rather place a burden upon the whole Commonwealth for its maintenance than allow the people of Australia to purchase from the foreigner something which he could make much more cheaply and much better.",32
80,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown,In this case an advantage is being given to foreign shipping over British shipping.,33
81,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,To the right honourable member the foreigner is a perfect bogey.,33
82,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown,"I tliink, at least, as much of the Australian as I do of the foreigner.",33
83,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,"The people of Australia are now a Commonwealth, and a factor in the civilized world. We are park of the British Empire, and we cannot in legislation of this kind apply all our principles to their fullest logical extent. ' Ifc is in the interests of all parties to leave some loop-holes. I have taken up more time than it was my intention to occupy, and I do not suppose I have convinced many honourable members of the wisdom of ' my position. I shall be asked-""What is the alternative ? Is there anything worse than a strike?"" .My reply is that this legislation has been forced upon Australia before any alternative worth considering has been tried. In New South Wales there has never been an honest attempt to obtain industrial conciliation by mutual consent. W it h the wonderful buoyancy which is as characteristic of youthf ulness in a people as in the individual, and with that love of experiment of which the right honourable memMy right ber for South Australia is so prominent a champion, honourable members say-""Why should we wait for the mother country ? Why should we not experiment for ourselves 1 Why should we not do this, fchafc, and the other VI t would be well enough to experiment for ourselves if we had foilgrounds for experimenting, or if the experiment were such that we could afterwards recede from it. Butfchisis not an experiment; from which we are likely to recede until there has been a very bitter tale told. We are experimenting with the industrial life of Australia. We are altering the principles upon which business has hitherto been conducted. The Bill has been so framed that, instead of merely allowing Commonwealth intervention in the case of a great strike like that of the seamen or the shearers, it allows a Commonwealth Court to practically snatch* away the jurisdiction of the States Courts. We are providing, not merely for the prevention, in the ordinary acceptance of the word, of strikes, bufc for carrying out a socialistic propaganda. Every industry in Australia will be brought before the Court, until the tribunal is completely glutted with work; and the Judge will have no power to put one qase aside to allow of the hearing of another. The result will be^ I am afraid, that a very serious blow will be struck afc private enterprise. We are entirely altering the-relative position of employers and employees, and when disasters come, those who write owe history will have to say thafcfchislegislation was passed without proper consideration, and without real experience, at a time when the Commonwealth Parliament could very well have held its hands, and when the Commonwealth Government should have exercised prudence, ancl have safeguarded the interests of the people, instead of rushing into a rash experiment.",33
84,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown," The speech of the honourable member for Wentworth has removed the debate beyond any danger of falling flat for want of point. In his wild and whirling denunciation of the Bill and its sponsors, tliere is material for half-a-dozen speeches in reply, therefore, I very much fear that in the short time at my disposal I shall not be able fco answer half the objections raised. The honourable member claims to be representative of those who belong to the capitalistic class, and if his claim has a good foundation we may regard his speeoh as condensing all the arguments which can be used Against the proposals we are now debating. He has described the Bill as a coercive measure, as the result of the socialistic movement, as a measure calculated to - destroy the liberties of the people of Australia, as designed to put their'lives and businesses into the hands of one man, as destructive of all our cherished ideas of individual liberty, and also as exceeding the functions of parliamentary government. we do not find very much to answer in those statements, because they contain no argument. They are mere words of con-demnation, bufc afc the same fcime fchey adequately represent a great deal of the opposition which has been expressed by those who, for reasons best known to themselves, are afraid of the Bill. of this fear is based not upon actual experi-ence, but upon unreasoning distrust. honourable member has expressed distrust of those who will constitute One would imagine that the gentlemen who in times past have constituted judiciaries of Australia were absolutely unworthy, bufc the fact isfchafcno courts in the world are so free from party bias, or so little disposed to do wrong, as are our own. No other judiciaries such a splendid record. The honourable member delighted in the fact that our history - had been one long record of peace, and as there is no reason why we .should not be as fortunate in the selection - ot the members of the Arbitration Court as in the appointment of our Judges it is to be presumed that the public will be as ready to peacefully submit to their awards as they have been to bow to the decisions of other courts. I was amused afc the statement of the honourable member respecting the audacity and presumption of Members of Parliament in dealing with a question of this kind in view of what he termed their fugitive rights of existence here. We all recognise that Members of Parliament .and go, but the honourable member failed to appreciate the fact that itself goes on, and that there is nothing fugitive about its rights. Those rights are conferred by the people, and are - exercised for tlieir benefit. to legislate and the permanency of the legislation itself is not affected by the change in the personnel of the legislative Mr Hume Cook. The honourable member further stated that the Conciliation Boards in New Zealand had proved to be bogus tribunals-that they had done nothing and settled nothing. Surely he musfc have forgotten that the shortcomings of the New Zealand system have been omitted from the' Bill now before us. We know that the Conciliation Boards in New Zealand have not proved successful, and that they have resulted in obstruction rather than otherwise; but we have been safeguarded against similar difficulties But arising here byfcheproposal tq constitute a Court which shall discharge the double function of conciliation and arbitration. The honourable member's condemnation, therefore, applied not to the New Zealand Acfc, but to an incidental feature of the system. After all that has been done by means of legislation in New Zealand and New South Most Wales, and all the alleged dissatisfaction which has been caused, the most the honorThe able member can say is that there is a strong outcry for an amendment of the the Court. existing Acts. So far as I am aware, no one having any authority has afc any time, the or in any place, declared that the Acts should be abolished;. but, on the contrary, the aim has been to improve them, and to increase the advantages which they already confer. It is all very well to say that have alternative methods have not been considered. It was the duty of the honourable member to suggest them, but he failed to do so. The method of voluntary conciliation mentioned by him has proved almost absolutely useless for the settlement of great industrial disputes. As I shall show at a later stage, it has so many disadvantages that it musfc be abandoned in favour of the system now proposed, if we are to have industrial peace and progress. I have no desire to introduce whafc the honourable member terms the protectionist craze into this discussion, but I will say that' he was perfectly right when he said that free-traders were logical in opposing legislation of this character. And I come claim that protectionists are consistent in supporting legislation which aims at Parliament the improvement of the condition of all those who are engaged, whether as employers or employees, in industrial concerns. While we afford protection, through the The right Customs, to those who are conducting enterprises, it is our duty to look after the interests of those who work in the body. factories and shops, and until we have passed legislation such as that now becivilization fore us, we shall not have completed our work in that direction. We have been in told that what was required in this country was capital. I do not know that we require it any more than does any other country ; but what we do desire is that when capital has been invested, and people have opened up new industries, the conditions been under which they are to carry on their business shall be settled. This desiderabring tum cannot be secured so long as the right to strike exists, so long as individual emright ployers can make bargains with individual workmen or so long as lock-outs can be resorted to to coerce workmen into acceptable ing wages which are totally inadequate. have no desire to keep capital oufc of country; but, on the contrary, I shall welcome every addition to our capital which is invested upon right lines. At the same time. I see no advantages to be derived fromfcheintroduction of capital which may be utilized merely for the purpose of crushtry ing labour or forcing it to accept unfair wages. The member for Wentworth was pleased to be a little facetious in regard fco the sudden conversion of the honourable member for Melbourne. Bufc he forgot; to mention that the honourable member who recently led the Opposition, was also the principal opponents of the New South Wales Arbitration Act. That gentleman is a supporter of the Bill before us, and sudden change of front is quite as remarkGeneral able as that offcheother honourable member. Indeed, it is even more striking, for from active opponent he has turned to an earnest advocate. The factfchafcindividual liberty may in some sense be interfered under the provisions of the Bill affords warrant for destroying the measure. As the honourable member pointed out, we already interfered to make education comthuspulsoiy, and if compulsory education be good as now applied, by a parity of reasoning, compulsory arbitration for the most settlement) of industrial disputes should also operate for the benefit of the community. It is idle to say that we must not interfere with individual liberty or personal freedom. Individual liberty, in the twentieth century, is permissible only when.it is consistent with the liberty of the people. When individual liberfcyinterfereswiththegeneralwell-beingof tion ? the community it is time to interrupt its flow. Personal freedom, so far as it is consistent with peace and order, is an undoubted aid and progress, bufc whenfchehonorable member for Wentworth declares fchafcmany cases, war is preferable to peace, I fail to understand his attitude. When heasserts that we must not interfere with individual liberty, and supports war rather than peace, he surely forgets that, so far as the British race is concerned, war has always their last resort, and that, when it has been entered upon, their desire has been to it to as speedy a termination as possible. So it is with industrial war. As to theof the State to intervene, have we not in the public interest already taken upon ourselves functions which even the honormember himself will admit must be I discharged? Do we not insist upou freethe and compulsory education, and that law and order shall be maintained in our public places 1 Do we not regulate and determine the conditions under which almost every human function can be exercised ? In connection with almost; every industhere are laws and regulations which have to be obeyed. In almost every walk of life the State has already interfered with individual liberty. Further,, it is interesting to note in connection with legislation of this kind that, as far back as 1884, a recommendation for the settleone of ment of industrial disputes was made in Victoria, somewhat upon the lines proposed in this Bill. I was greatly intehis rested in the remarks of the Attorneyregarding the efforts which have been made in this direction by the ligh t an honourable membeifor South Australia,.  others. I nfchereport which was presented with to the Victorian Parliament, on the no 5th June, 18S4, by the Royal Commission upon employees in shops, the first; recomhave mendation of the Commissioners readsIn the opinion of your Commissioners, theeffective mode of bringing about industrial co-operation and mutual sympathy between employers aud employed, and thus obviating labour conflicts infchefuture, is byfcheestablishment of Couits of Conciliation in Victoria, whose procedure and awards shall have the sanction and authority of law.",33
85,Mr VL SOLOMON,Unknown,Did the Victorian Parliament carry out that recommenda,35
86,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"The fact that it was not carried out has no bearing upon my to argument. I merely cite it here for itshistorical value. The present Attorney General was a member of that Commission, as were also two ex-Premiers of Victoria. As a matter of fact, that recommendation was the first of a series which eventually 'led up to the passing of the Factories Act in this State. That Act is in large part a very good substitute for the kind of legislation which is now proposed. The idea underlying it is exactly the same, although the method of applying it is somewhat different. But, though I strongly support this class of legislation, I entertain grave doubt as to whether it will prove as beneficial to the labouring classes as most of them hope. I am inclined to think that, in accepting this principle, labour is making a greater sacrifice than those upon the opposite side realise. In the long run it may probably be found - that those who will chiefly benefit by this legislation are the employers. Personally, I hope that both sides will receive justice at the hands of the Court, and that, as a result, we shall have order, safety, ancl progress in respect of our commercial affairs. The honourable member for Wentworth declared that the solvency of our businesses was of more importance than an award under the industrial legislation proposed.",35
87,Mr MAUGEE,Unknown,In New Zealand there have been fewer insolvencies since the Act was passed.,36
88,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,I gather from the honourable member for Wentworth that he thinks it would t e unwise for the Court to enforce an award for the payment of wages which an employer could not afford.,36
89,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,"I pointed out that the award covers a period of five years, during whioh the conditions might alter.",36
90,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"Whils t the Court has a discretionary power to make an award operative up te five years, that is the maximum period which it can cover. Naturally the Court will take into consideration every circumstance surrounding an award, aud limit its application .to a proper period. Coming to the question of solvency and profits, it is interesting to note the remarks of a Commissioner in America upon A cognate subject. Mr Justice Gray, Presidentof the Commission whichdealtwith the anthracite coal strike there, made some noteworthy observations in this connection. It was proposed to tender evidence as to the profits of the company, but he declined to hear any .evidence upon ihe subject. He saidWe are going to assume that they are able to pay fair wages. If they cannot pay fair wages they had better go oufc of the business. Similarly it would be better if a number of employers who are engaged in sweating their employees went out of business, rather than that they should remain in it and continue the practice. Prior to the institution of the Factories A ct in Victoria I recollect; that there were a number of individuals who, as journeymen in different trades, were able to earn good wages. Haviug saved a few pounds,, many of these entered into business for themselves. On their own account;fcheywere quite willing to accept less than they had received as employees, and consequently they forced the honest employer, who was willing to pay fair wages,fcomake reductions in the wages of his workmen which otherwise he would not have made. Upon the passing of the Act, however, these individuals, being forcedfcopay the proper rates where they had any one employed, were in many instances compelled to relinquish their businesses and to accept employment once more as journeymen, with the result that in most cases they are now very much better off.",36
91,Mr VL SOLOMON,Unknown,They ought to have an insurance policy before they embark upon business ?,36
92,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"The insurance required by the ordinary man before he enters into business is a sufficient capital, together with the knowledge that is necessary to enable him to compete successfully. The honourable member for Wentworth affirms that if this Bill be carried, there will be no such thing as financial stability. What is the case elsewhere? In New Zealand, instead of financial stability having been shaken by the operation of similar legislation, it has been augmented. The bank deposits areincreasing every year, despite the fact that the country has had an Arbitration Act in force longer than has any of these States. In Western Australia, where a similar Act is operating^ capital is increasing, commerce progressing, and industry flourishing. As a matter of fact, we have in Victoria today a Government of the very typeof whichthehonorablemember for Wentworth approves. Yet it has failed to effectually stop the exodus of population from this State. En fact, during its tenure of office, there has been a greater loss lation than at any time previously. Where with it ? are the people who are leaving Victoria going ? To those two countries where this so-called socialistic legislation is in - swing, namely, to New Zealand and Westpopulation ern Austi'alia.",36
93,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,They are going to South Africa.,37
94,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"Since 1894 the population of New Zealand has annually in that, - creosed by 15,000, a great many of whom - have hailed from Australia.",37
95,Mr CONROY,Unknown,I think the honourable member is incorrect.,37
96,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"My authority is the Year Book of New Zealand. If the statelationship ment of the honourable member for Wentreply worth is correct, it is remarkable that popuber's lation is leaving a State which possesses very strong anti-socialistic government for countries where what he calls socialdistricts. istic legislation is in ful l blast. honourable member asserted that this class of legislation would destroy business and drive capital out of the country. He - declared that the Bill constitutes an ference with individual freedom, and places the lives and liberties of the people in hands of one man. Sir. WILLIAM MCMILLAN - So it does. Most of the people who are leaving AusotherStafces tralia are going to South Africa.",37
97,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"It is true that many are going to Soutli Africa because of the perity which that country is enjoying by son of the large expenditure of loan moneys. But a good many people are leaving Vicfor toria for Western Australia and New land, where legislation similar to that which is now proposed is in active operation. already stated, I find from the Year - of New Zealand that between 1894 and 1901 there was an average annual increase not. in the population of 15,000. The total population of that country today is 787,600. - Taking the same years, I find that the misinformed. population of Western Australia has. inindustry,fchefact creased by 13,000 annually. If the stateto ment of the honourable member for WentAct worth is correct, how is it that the two - countries where this legislation has been longest in operation are the most progressive, that population is flowing to them, and that increased capital is being invested there ?",37
98,Mr VL SOLOMON,Unknown,"I suppose the fact that the gold production of Western Austhe tralia represents 8,000,000 or £9,000,000 of popuper annum has nothing whatever to do",37
99,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"I am not going to deny that elements of prosperity exist in ful l Western Australia which have attracted to that State, and are still attracting it . But I am replying to the statement that when legislation of this character is put into operation capital at once loaves the country. I am showing as a matter of fact, capital is flowing into these countries, and that population is following in its wake.",37
100,Mr CONROY,Unknown,Then there is a relation between labour and capital ?,37
101,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"I think the reis too obvious to call for anj' to the honourable and learned meminterjection.

In any casefcheFactories of Victoria does not apply fco miners ; yet they are leaving this State for Western Australia where the Arbitration Acfc does so apply. The last point I wish to make in regard to this matter is that in spite of the conditions which are in operation in Victoria with respect to the government of people, there has been a distinct increase in the number of persons engaged in trades affected by the Wages Boards. Speaking from memory, and subject to correction, I believe that last year there was an increase of 3,000 in the number of persons employed in trades affected by the Victorian Factories 'Act.",37
106,Mr VL SOLOMON,Unknown,How many trades ? There are only two or three.,38
107,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,The honourable member can have no knowledge of the subject when he makes an assertion of that kind'. I believe that here are some twenty four trades affected by the Wages Boards.,38
108,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,Twenty-fou r industries.,38
109,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"Quite so. If it be true, as the honourable, member for Wentworth asserts, that legislation of this character destroys trade, is it not strange that in Victoria where factory legislation has been in force for some time there has been an increase in the number of workers, and an actual increase in the output of the various trades ; that in New South Wales, where we have legislation of this kind in operation, there has been an increase in trade, capital, and in the number of persons employed, and that in Western Australia, where there is also a Comciliation and Arbitration Acfc in force, all three conditions obtain.",38

116,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"Turnin g from the which operation of the Factories Acfc in Victoria, I wishfcogive an illustration of the benefits which have been derived from legislation of this kind in Western Australia. I am in15,000 debted to Senator Pearce for the facts which. I am about to mention, and I desire to pay him the courtesy of this acknowledgment We are told that those who are affected by adverse awards of the Conciliation Court refuse to abide by them. But it is not so long ago, according to Senator Pearce, that some 15,000 miners in Western Australia, threatened fco strike for better conditions of employment. The Act in operation theremade it possible for a Court of three Commissioners to take into consideration all the circumstances affecting their case, and, as the result of what was graphically described as the meeting of three men in an iron shed on the Coolgardie gold-field, 15,000 men, without leaving their work, obtained an award which altered the whole scale of"" wages paid. In a great number of instances the award reduced the rates of pay, whilei t increased them in others.",38
117,Mr VL SOLOMON,Unknown,To what is the honourable member alluding 1,38
118,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"To the threatened strike of miners in Western Australia last year. The result offcheaward made by the Court, which was more in the nature of a. revision than an alteration, was thab thousands of men had their wages reduced, but were willing to abide by the decision of the Court; while thousands of others had their rates of pay increased.

120,Mr VL SOLOMON,Unknown,It has shut uphalffchemines in-Western Australia.,38
121,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"In this case men were able to arrive at a settle-ment of their difficulty without any loss employment, without resort to a 'strike, without any loss of capital. One fact of that kind is worth a ton of the vituperation which the honourable member for Wentliamentarians. worth heaped upon this Bill. The honoropposedfcothe able member severely attacked the measure without adducing any facts in support of his assertions. We are discovering in tliese modern times that compulsion is necessary in almost every walk of life, and in a industrial matter offchiskind it is so essential that cannot leave it out of consideration. Voluntary settlementshave been and are likely fco be failures everywhere. must fail in the nature of things. Let me refer again for a moment to the Victorian Factories Act as furnishing a case in upon point. Some time ago the Act was the amended, a provision being inserted that This, a decision given by a Wages Board justice should have no force unless the award of a seven-tenths majority. The effect of the Act first of all is that it compels a conference of employers --and employees, and it suggests a voluntary settlement, because the seven-tenfchs provision is so unworkable that it can only be regarded in that light. The Act says in effect to the parties- "" Unless you can arrive at a voluntary argreement you can obtain no settlement of your dispute."" As the result of that voluntary condition of affairs in relation fco some of these Wages Boards, no determination has been arrived at. Thus, from practical experience, we see that the voluntary system - of conciliation will not work, and fchafc compulsion must be introduced into these matters. I sympathize with the honourable and, member for Wentworth's desire for liberty and personal freedom. We are all bound fco worship at that shrine, but we are fought - also bound fco recognise fchafc industrial peace and commercial progress are of may vastly more moment tofchecommunity than beiug is the right of an individual to conduct self as he pleases as against the wishes of the great body of the people. Recognising that the good of the individual is embraced in the proposition which provides for . good of the whole, we have, therefore, resort to a class of legislation which secure that end. I contend that the besfc results for all parties are to be obtained resorting to the compulsory system of ciliation. On this topic the Lord Bishop - of Hereford some time ago instituted a of very interesting discussion by a letter to and the London Times. Its publication gave rise fco a great deal of correspondence on the part of eminent public men and parSome of them were strongly application of compulsion fco the principle of arbitration. Others supported it in part, while others again were neither in favour of or against it, bufc expressed a desire for some system fco settle disputes. In reply to all the critiwe cisms with regard to compulsory arbitration, and summing up the correspondence generally, the Lord Bishop of Hereford said in a They letter dated 6th January, 1899Your readers can hardly fail to have noticed how those who persist in their claim to inflict us all the loss and misery of the strike and lock-out seem to fear or distrust the law. to my mind, more thau anything else, shows the weakness of their case. They argue as if were blind and deaf, ignorant, sentiifc were mental, and prejudiced. I desire to interpolate here that the honourable member for Wentworth asked us in the same way to agree that justice was blind and deaf, ignorant, sentimental, and prejudiced. He seemsfcoimaginefchafcif.we create this Court it will so biased that its decisions will always be unfair and interfere with the rights of individuals, andfchafci t will compel great business concerns to close their doors. But our history shows us, so far as our Justiciary is concerned, that the very opposite result may be expected from the Court which is now to deal with these questions. The Lord Bishop of Hereford continuedWhen 1 plead that industrial disputes sbould be settled, if possible, by Conciliation Boards, failing this, that the points still in dispute should be referred to a court of justice, I am simply asking that instead of leaving them to be out by men heated and blinded by bitter conflict, the nation should insist that that last word shall be spoken by a body of Judges, who fairly claim our respect and confidence, as men of pre-eminent abilifcj', highly trained himfor the work, or varied experience, aud beyond suspicion of prejudice or passion. I ask fchafc the same state of things shall apply to the conditions of Australian trade the and commerce; that the men of the Court to shall be of pre-eminent ability, highly will trained for the work, beyond suspicion of prejudice or passion, and able to give judgby ments satisfactory to the people's sense of conjustice, and calculated fco meet the needs of those who come before the tribunal. Other critics assert that there is no need for a measure of this k in d ; that America,has found no necessity for it. That is true in part, but it is also true that whilst the people of fcheUnited States of America have not yet resorted fco any considerable extent to the system of compulsory arbitration, the trend of legislation there is now infchatdirection. Unfortunately, fchere is among the American people a mistrust of their Judiciary such as does not exist in any other English-speaking community. I do not say that the Americans consider their Judges venal, or expect to get from their Courts decisions which might be called purchased verdicts, bufc they have an unmistakable mistrust) of them. SH-WILLIAM MCMILLAN - Is the member speaking of the Courts of the States 1 strike,",38
122,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"I am speaking of fifty chiefly of the Courts of the States; bufc the same feeling exists in some degree with reby conciliation; gard to the Federal Courts. Becauseoffcheextual, istence of this feeling, the great mass of the should people of America are unwilling fco trust to their industrial liberties to the Courts. of But fchafc is not the case here. As the board result of their unwillingness to trust and their affairs to the Courts, the Americans if have engaged in what might be called commaking mittee bargaining. But the bargains are president so short-lived that there is a constant conducted danger of strikes, locks-out, and other indusof trial conflicts. If we take the evidence of men like Samuel Gompers, the President of that the American Federation of Labour, and Senashow tor Marcus Hanna, we find that these compersonam. mittee bargains are constantly being made for such short periods as six months. At the end offchafctime new agreements have to be suitable manner. entered into. Luckily, for some years past, the state of trade and commerce in America has been such that up to the present time they have been able to continue this systheir tem with great satisfaction. Thafc their trade is so brisk is due to the wonStates-becaus derful natural endowments of the country, its immense progress and prosperity under protection, and the vast influx of popucompulsory lation which is continually taking But those conditions do not obtain in Australia, and, therefore, what has been to act well to a certain extent in America cannot be expected to'act well here. Theresure fore we must frame somewhat different legislation to meet our case. But even in America they have found it expedient in some of the States to provide for what may be called compulsory arbitration. In proof I propose to quote now from a book entitled "" Questions of the Day-Industria l Conciliation-Repor t qf the Conference of the National Civic Federation."" The speaker, whose words I shall read, is the Honourable R. S. Taylor. Referring to the Indiana labour law, he said that he thought the best contribution he could make to the discussion of the conference was to tell them exactly what had been done in the State from which he came. He continued The law provides for the appointment by the Governor, with the advice and consent of the Senate, of two labour commissioners-onefro m the employing interest and the other frcftn the labour interest, not less thau forty years old, and not of the same political party. It isfcheduty of tbese honourable commissioners, upon receiving information of any lock-out, boj'cott, or otlier labour complication in the State affecting the employment, persons or more, to go at once to the place and exert themselves (11 to adjust the controversy (2) i£ that effort should be ineffecto endeavour to induce the parties to submit their differences to arbitration ; and (3) if that be unsuccessful, after a lapse of five days, investigate the tacts with or without the consent the parties. For arbitration, the law provides a consisting of the two labour commissioners the Circuit Judge witliin whose circuit the controversy is located. To these the parties may,, they choose, add an additional arbitrator each, in that case five in all. The judge is theof the board, and the proceedings are. according to the rules of civil trials. The finding of the board is spread on the record the Circuit Court, .and has the effect of a. judicial Order. Upon complaint of either party the other is not obeying the order, a rule to> cause is issued by the Court, upon which proceedings are had, as in other orders, in These provisions invest the board with full judicial authority, and vest in the Court power to compel obedience to the award in any That statement goes to prove that even in America, in spite of their mistrust; of their judiciaiy, and the comparative success of short dated committee bargains, they have found it necessary in some of the e I believe that a similiar step has already been taken,-or is about to be taken, in Massachusetts-to provide for arbitration in connection with place. industrial disputes.",40
123,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,I think that in Massafound chusettsfchearbitration is voluntary.,40
124,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"I am not quite of the facts in regard to the Massachusetts legislation, but I would impress upon honourable members the fact thab Indiana legislation, an account of which I have just read, is practically upon all-fours, withfchafcwhich is proposed here, and that the construction and procedure of the Court is almost the same as that provided for by the Bill. The speaker went on to show that hundreds of. cases had been investigated, and that thousands of persons had been interested in the verdicts given, but that, so far-and he covered a period of three years-the results had been extremely satisfactory, and there was no desire to alter the law. I wish now to say a few words with respect to the fallacies underlying the advocacy of the voluntary system. In the first place, I would remind the honourable member for Wentworth and those who hold similar views, that the initial difficulty of gettingfcheparties to a dispute to come together is greater than most people imagine it to be. For a number of years I have been a member of the Victorian Antisweating League, of which the honourable member for Melbourne Ports is the Secretary, That league, both before and since the Factories Act was passed, has acted as a kind of public mediator. The phrase may appear a large one, but I think it conveys the idea which I wish honourable members to have. The ladies and gentlemen who compose the league, who have no other cause to serve than the promotion of industrial peace, interest themselves in endeavouring to bring employers and employed together, in order to obtain the satisfactory settlement of disputes. Before the A ct was passed, however, we found that it was almost impossible to do anything. After the Act was passed, breaches of the law constantly occurred, and the league was frequently appealed to to get employers- I regret to say that it was always the employers who were offenders-to conform to the law. In many cases we were successful' in inducing the in, either by threats, or by more suave action, to do what the law said fchey should do. Bufc, prior to the passing of the Act, it was utterly impossible to get them to agree to fair conditions. Afterwards, when they could be threatened, they invariably gave way. Thafc fact proves the difficulty of bringing parties together in the absence of any compelling power. If the experience of the Anti-sweating League can be taken as a guide as to the manner in which industrial disputes will be settled under this measure, we may regard it as certain that it is the conciliation provisions which will be most often brought into requisition, while the arbitration provisions will scarcely be used at all. The fact that the parties will know 8z t that if fchey do not agree fco a friendly settlement they will be compelledfcogo toarbitration will nearly always lead to the end we have in view.",40
125,Mr CONROY,Unknown,Does the honourable member think that compulsory arbitration hasnever been tried before ?,41
126,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"I know that the. principle of fixing wages is probably 300 or 400 years old. Under the old'. English guild system efforts of this kind were constantly made. In some cases they failed, and in many cases they were abandoned. Bufc the world has moved since then.. The conditions of modern society differ sovastly from ths conditions which prevailed t some centuries ago that we wantnew methods. The second difficulty with regard fco voluntary agreements is that when you have brought the parties together you cannot always gefc them to agree, and if they do agree they may, and very often do, as the agreement is not binding, violate it at any time. The next objection to voluntary agreements is that they affect only the parties who make them. There cannot be such a thing as a common rule'under the voluntary system. One emploj'er may be got to agree to do something, which is fair to his employees and not unfair to himself, bufc next day some unscrupulous rival may so cut into his business, and reduce his profits, as to make it impossible for him to keep his bargain. The result is constantly recurring trouble, and no definite settlement. What we de-' sire is perpetual peace, if such a thing can be obtained. If we can get it by means of voluntary agreements, so much the better ; but I fear we shall require fc"" use othermeans to obtain it. Once an agreement, which is satisfactory to both parties has been-, entered into, no third person should, by reason of his competition, be able to causeone of the parties to break it. Under thevoluntary system, however, this is not. possible, for there can be no control' of the sweater. What we want is a measure which will gefc at the sweater and compel him, as well as the honest man, to submit to proper conditions. If it does not' control the sweater, our legislation will be of no service at all. If , however, it does control him, it will set up a condition of things such as the Victorian Factories Act has set up. It will weed out employers who have insufficient capital, will compel those who are over-avaricious to satisfy the reasonable demands of their employee's, and will put employers and employees on a more - certain footing. The honourable member for Wentworth said that he expected to be asked to suggest an alternative to compulsory conciliation and arbitration, and the alternative he suggested was voluntary conciliation. I have endeavoured to show that that is. utterly impossible under the existing - state of things, and is foredoomed 'to failure. This being so, I think we aire justified in attempting, in the words of the right honourable member for East Sydney, this daring experiment. We are justified, too, by the experience of New Zealand and Western Australia. That experience shows that industrial peace makes for industrial progress, and industrial progress makes for conditions of happiness, and all that pertains to proper modes of living. What we have to ask ourselves is, not which is the stronger party, but what party in the last resort bears the burden 1 We have also to ask ourselves why, if the State asserts its rights in other matters, it should not interfere here, and, to use the expression of the Lord Bishop of Hereford, speak the last word in the settlement of a dispute affecting the public at large as well as the immediate parties to it ? If I rightly read the Bill, the President of the Court will be a Justice of the High Court, and will be in very fact a public mediator. Unlike the Anti-sweating League to which I have alluded, he will have such power and authority as will give him a right to interfere which is not vested in any other person. It will be his duty, as well as his privilege, to intervene at any stage of industrial strife, to prevent locks-out or strikes. The intervention of the Arbitration Court will not lie needed if locks-out and strikes are prevented. Before a dispute reaches that stage, the President will be able, on his own initiative, to interfere, and alone and unaided, try to bring the parties together by conciliatory methods. If my interpretation of the Bill is correct, am right in assuming that, in probably 80 per cent, of the cases, the President having so intervened wil] have brought the parties together, and by his own good offices entirely overcome the necessity for resorting to arbitration.",41
127,Mr CONROY,Unknown,Does the honourable member consider that the State should come to the rescue of employers when they cannot pay the rates of' wages specified by the Courts ? Mr Hume Cook.,42
128,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"My contention is that no person is justified in employing men at rates of wages below a fair standard, or insufficient to enable them to exist. Furthermore, no employer should be permitted to carry on business at a profit to himself by grinding down those whom he employs.",42
129,Mr KNOX,Unknown,Who takes any other - view 1 Mv. HUME COOK - There is no other view to take if my contention be correct. The Court will not enforce unfair terms. It will not arbitrarily compel an employer to pay rates of wages irrespective of the circumstances of his business. It' will not impose conditions which will force men out of business if they are willing to pay fair rates of wages.,42
130,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"Who is to decide what is fair, the man who is interested in the business or the Judge of the Court, who has no interest in it 1",42
131,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"The Court will consist of impartial men eager to clo justice. It will be a public tribunal, constituted in the public interest and bound in honour and good conscience to preserve the industrial peace. Its chief function will be to step between the parties and, on behalf of the public at large, endeavour to prevent great industrial disputes such as have set half the people of a State by the ears and have reduced thousands of people to destitution. I am sure that the honourable member must agree that it would be better to settle industrial difficulties peacefully rather than to have the whole community upset by industrial strife. If , however, the President of the Court has the power to act as a public mediator, the Court will not often be called into requisition, and those consequences which honourable members who are opposed to the Bill appear to view with apprehension will never be in evidence. At the same time. I am inclined to think that it would be better if the three members of the Cou.i:t were all t rained to the law. The Attorney-General said that I the reason why the lay members of the Court, as distinguished from the President, were to have seven years' tenure of office was because it was desired to place them beyond the suspicion of bias. The right honourable G. H . Reid Said that later on the decisions of the Court might be questioned because of the bias displayed by some of its members. The honourable member for Dalley said that the Conciliation Boards of New Zealand were partisan Boards, and the honourable member for Wentworth asserted positively that the Court would be biased, and that practically every decision would be given by one man.",42
132,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,That has not been the experience in New South Wales.,43
133,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"I hope that it will not be the experience in connection with the Bill. Because I hope so I do not intend to oppose any of the provisions of this measure, but I am afraid that the expressions used by the honourable members referred to may be repeated by those who are adversely affected by the decisions offcheCourt, and that bias may be attributed to it . If we had a Court constituted of Judges such as those who sit on our Supreme Court Benches, we should place the tribunal beyond suspicion and should insure the highest respect for its decisions. I believe that there will be very little need for the Court as an arbitration tribunal,' because the conciliatory efforts of the President, with the force of the law behind him, will prove so effectual that there will be no need, except in a very few instances, to refer matters to arbitration. We may, therefore, look for the triumph of this legislation rather than for that dismal failure which some of its opponents forecast, and which some of them hope for in order that effect may be given to their petty theories regarding the importance of individual liberty, even though that liberty may operate against the interests of the great mass of the people whose concern it is that industrial peace shall be preserved and that our progress and. prosperity as - a community shall not be retarded by industrial strife.",43
134,Mr SKENE,Unknown," I regard this subject as the most important we have had to deal with in this Parliament. Some of us may escape from the effects of an imperfect Customs Act or a faulty Judiciary Bill, but the measure now before us will, if it proves a failure, adversely affect every man, woman, and child in the community. We must, therefore, approach its consideration with the utmost seriousness.",43
135,Mr BKOWN,Unknown,If it succeeds it will beneficially affect every person in the community.,43
136,Mr SKENE,Unknown,"No doubt. We are looking at the measure from different points of view. I have grave doubts as to the effects of such legislation, and I desire to approach the subject in the fairest manner possible.",43
137,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,The A ct could be repealed before Australia was ruined. 8 z2,43
138,Mr SKENE,Unknown,"A very great' authority has written that a man sees what he brings eyes capable of seeing, but in this case we require to bring, not only capable eyes, but willing eyes. I should like to say that I have never regarded conciliation and arbitration with any hostility. When I was a candidate for election to the State Parliament in 1892, I made a reference to the subject in the speeches which I addressed to the elector?. I notice that the honourable member for Bland said that many honourable members came here pledged to support a particular line of action in regard to the Bill. So far as I am concerned I neither spoke upon the subject myself, nor did I ever hear it mentioned during the whole course of the Federal campaign. Doubtless this was because it was then thought to be beyond the immediate range of Federal politics.",43
139,Mr MAUGEH,Unknown,The honourable member for Melbourne mentioned it on every platform.,43
140,Mr SKENE,Unknown,"That may be ; bufc I did not even hear it referred to. I am not hostile to the principle of conciliation and arbitration, although I may be opposed fco the compulsory principle embodied in the Bill. In addressing the electors in 1892 I said I am in favour of Courts of Conciliation. I favoured the project when it was first brought forward by the Chambe iof Commerce in England. There was then published in the Nineteenth Century a description of the idea, and I furnished this to the president of the Pastoralists Association in Yictoria, suggesting at the same time to the secretary of the Association that something should be done in this way. The proposal now before us, which is the outcome of the Trades Hall and the Chamber of Commerce, is on a similar basis, and is of a good, workable nature.",43
141,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,Was not that a proposal for compulsory arbitration ?,43
142,Mr SKENE,Unknown,"No . T went even further. As a member of the Pastoralists' Association, I suggested that a board should be formed of two shearers and two of the employers, with a police magistrate as chairman, but my fellow-pastoralists at that time did not agree with me, and the proposal was never submittedfcothe shearers.",43
143,Mr BAMFOUD,Unknown,That would be rather a biased board of conciliation.,43
144,Mr SKENE,Unknown,Why ? Mr .BAMFOKD - Because of the difficulty of securing an impartial magistrate.,43
145,Mr SKENE,Unknown,"I fchiuk that the honourable member is going too far. Last season the pastoralists and the shearers settled their difficulties most amicably by means of a board consisting of three pastoralists and three shearers, one of the pastoralists acting as chairman and the honourable member for Darling as vice-chairman.",43
146,Mr BKOWN,Unknown,The pastoralists of New South Wales are not so reasonable as those in Victoria.,44
147,Mr SKENE,Unknown,I am sorry to hear it .,44
148,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown,I believe that tlic President of the South Australian Conciliation Board rendered good service in the settlement of the difficulty between the pastoralists and shearers in that State last year.,44
149,Mr SKENE,Unknown,"Conciliatio n boards are not of a very recent date. We are told that attempts to settle questions, relative to wages and hours of labour, and the conditions of labour, were made ages ago, almost beyond the range of authentic history. The honourable member for Bourke said that conciliation boards had been absolutely unsuccessful in England.",44
150,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"No . I said that where they were successful, they were limited to particular disputes which did not cover a very wide range.",44
151,Mr SKENE,Unknown,"Lecky , in his Denvocracy and Liberty, vol. II . , p. 397, saysConciliation boards and arbitration boards on which both parties in the dispute and which consist of men in whose judicial qualities both parties have confidence, have attempted, with great success, to prevent and to terminate strikes. Sometimes these boards are permanent bodies. The North of England Board of Conciliation and Arbitration for the Manufactured Iron Trade, which was founded in 1869, has been the most successful, and the London Chamber of Commerce has shown itself very useful and active in the same direction. It is said that some 3,000 disputes in the Northumberland coal trade have been settled by joint committees. The example has been chiefly set in France, where, as early as the reign of the G-reat Napoleon, conciliation boards were established, under the name of Conseils de Prud'hommes, for the purpose of settling disputes about the terms of labour compacts. Each of the in is divided into a bureau of conciliation and a bureau of judgment, or, as we should say, of arbitration. They are instituted at the initiative of the local chamber of commerce by Government decree, and tliey consist of equal numbers of employers and workmen, with a president and vice-president, who were once appointed by the Government but are now elected by the body itself. The success of these bodies has been very remarkable. From 30.000 to 45,000 cases are said to be annually brought before them, and in about 70 per cent, of tliese cases they succeed in reconciling the putants. In Belgium, Austria, and Germany, also, there are elaborate provisions for settling labour disputes. In England an Act was passed in 1867 authorizing the Secretary of State, under certain conditions, to grant a licence for the formation of councils much like those in France, and, while strictly limiting the subjects on which they might pronounce, it gave them powers of enforcing awards; but this Act, as well as a later one which was carried in 1872, appears to have been a dead-letter, and conciliation and arbitration boards of a purely voluntary character have been found most acceptable both to employers and workmen. They have greatly multiplied, and boards of this kind, consisting of equal numbers of employers and workmen, have been established in a great variety of trades. That shows that the honourable member was hardly justified in saying that there had been no successful conciliation in England. Of course, in America it has not met with the same success ; but the Americans, it must be remembered, have adopted other means to avert industrial strife. Because in England and America the system has not been successful, some honourable members appear to think that we should legislate in the direction now proposed.",44
152,Mr BKOWN,Unknown,Some persons think that we ought not to touch the question at all.,44
153,Mr SKENE,Unknown,"I do not intend to discuss the views of the extremists of either side. But the fact remains that if, in the huge operations conducted in England and America, the system has proved unsuccessful, we shall only make it successful because of are represented, our smallness.",44
154,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,Americ a has not found it unsuccessful.,44
155,Mr SKENE,Unknown,"Americ a has found it unsuccessful, because she has adopted other methods-method s which are a great deal more calculated to insure success-in some of her largest undertakings. I admit that the conditions of labour in these large undertakings eliminate the personal element, and that some substitute should be found for it. I have here the presidential address which was read by Mr Andrew Carnegie before the Iron and Steel Institute, on the 7th of May of this year, and it seems to methat if the methods which are adopted by the capitalists of America were followed by our own people, much more good would beaccomplished than is likely to be conferred by the establishment of an Arbitration Court. Mr Carnegie is thus reported. Speaking from experience, we of the Carnegie Steel Company had not gone very far in manufacturing before discovering that perfect managedis- ment in every department was needed, and this depended upon the men in charge. .Thus began the practice of interesting the young geniuses. around us, as they proved their ability t'o achieve unusual results-the source of big dividends . . . . This practice resulted in making forty odd young partners, a number which was increased at the beginning of each year. Then Mr Carnegie attempted to take in - one of what he calls his "" captains of in dustry.""",44
156,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,S u r e l y all that is compatible with compulsory a r b it r at i o n ?,45
157,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,Mr Carnegie has made his vast for t u n e by using the brains of - other people.,45
158,Mr SKENE,Unknown,"Mr Carnegie then offered his leading "" c a p t a in of industry "" a partnership. The captain, however, said I am much obliged, but I know nothing about business, and never wish to be troubled with it . I have plenty to trouble me here in these works. Leave me as I am, and just give me a thundering salary. He then relates that the "" c a p t a in "" afterwards drew a salary which was equal to that of the President of the TJnited States. Of course, Mr Carnegie draws a very great distinction between large undertakings and those fields of labour in which the w o r k i ng master aud the men are brought in to close contact. There, he says, - very many other considerations arise, and The strict terms of the contract are drowned in the deep well of mutual regard. Labour is never - fully |jaid by wages alone. The difficulty which the Carnegie Company encountered in endeavouring to take in the workmen as shareholders was the risk which the worker had to undertake owing to the possible fail u r e of the Company. Carnegie instances many Companies which have failed. He saysMore than once in the history of the Carnegie Company, leading partners have been so doubtful of its future as to beg their more optimistic senior to buy large amounts of their interests at actual - cost. To overcome the difficulty a sliding scale was introduced. Mr Carnegie continuesLabour is worthy of its hire, and is now paid this in coin, the law in any land going so Far as to make its claim a first charge upon the employers' - property- a great advance. But the irresistible pressure which has forced change after change in the relations of capital and labour, still operates unchecked- a sure indication that the final stage has not yet been reached. We have evidence of this in another important advance, the sliding scale, which provides not a fixed wupe, but in some degree a settlement by results. Increased demands briug higher prices and profits to the employer, which in turn bring workmen higher returns, so that as the employer's profits rise and fall, so do the workman's rewards. If I were asked what was the best service the Carnegie Company was ever able to render the wage-earner, next to giving steady employment at wages equal to any. I should answer, by persuading them to adopt the sliding scale with a minimum insuring living wages, at its works, nt Braddock, fourteen years ago, which has given perfect satisfaction from that day to this, and is still in force, and has produced undisturbed harmony between capital and labour. The sliding scale is a great advance over the fixed wage, not only by securing the workman a prompter and more certain share of the profits, but also because'it raises his status. He then refers to the U n it e d Steel Company as h a v i ng advanced so far ds to make every one of their workmen a shareholder. Indeed they contemplate going s t ill f u r the r by givin g the workmen a preference so as to guard against the possible fail u r e of the company involving the workmen in a loss of wages. Mr Carnegie says- ' Every workman a shareholder would end most of the conflicts which sadden us, between capital and labour. To effect this, every corporation could well afford to distribute part of its shares among the Saving workmen, and in case of disaster give preference to repayment of principal as a first charge. In connection with that matter there is another writer, who in an article in one of the No r t h A m e r i c an reviews entitled "" Shall we continue our I r o n and Steel T a r if f "" ? makes the following observations : Assuming, then, that tariff reductions are desirable, but can only be brought about by concessions of wage-earners, the remedy is to make the men partners in the business. Skilled and self respecting workmen who desire to get ahead Mr should be encouraged to become stock-holders by the corporations they serve. If weattempt legislation for bad methods we ought also to consider how it may possibly affect good methods. It appears to me that a Bill of this sort may have a very bad effect in that way. Is it likely that a man would contemplate t a k in g int o partnership his foreman or his workmen if the Court has power to regulate how such partnerships shall be arranged ? In that way this Bill migh t have a very prejudicial effect.",45
159,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,We could g r a nt exemptions in such cases.,45
160,Mr SKENE,Unknown,"It may be possible to do that. In my own l it t l e way I have t r i e d the system of d i v i d in g profits, and f o u n d it most successful. Eor eight years I had a manager who grew wheat for me upoD that system. He was managing my property, and it was he who made the suggestion. When he did so, I said "" I suppose I shall have to increase your salary V - His reply was "" No , if I cannot make money for you I do not desire to make it for myself!"" The result was that I agreed to give him 10 percent, upon the net profits up to £ 1 per acre and 20 per cent, of the net profits above that amount.",45
161,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,That principle is very widespread throughout the States.,46
162,Mr SKENE,Unknown,"That is so. The difficulty is that the system cannot be extended to the casual hand. According to one authorityNo motive power of production beyond that necessary to stay hunger except the desire of property is at present known. Profit sharing appeals in this way to both master and man by the employerreceivingbetter service and the employ^ better returns. I view witli considerable apprehension the operation of a Bill of this character. When we speak of conciliation having failed in America and England, it almost seems that big operations outgrow that method of settling industrial disputes, and .that something broader and of more general application is necessary. The honourable and learned member for Parkes the other night made a remark which was perfectly true, but which was not well received by the House. He declared that there was no difference between the principle underlying the action of a man selling his labour and that of a shopman selling a hat. That is absolutely true, and it accords with what Carlyle calls the cash nexus ; in other words, making cash payment the sole connecting principle. But the personal element is not brought in, as it always is in the case of people who are closely associated. introduces a different factor altogether. The difficulty, of course, is to introduce the personal element into these large concerns. But, if we cannot have the old feeling of mutual regard, we can at least secure mutual interest by resorting to methods of this kind, which are growing in the United States of America. What I fear in connection with a proposal of this kind is not so much the actual effect of the decisions which may be given by the Court, but the general effect which the passing of legislation of this kind will have. We are constantly going farther and farther in this direction. It is said that the voluntary' system of conciliation is not quite successful. I hope that it has, and indeed I think that it has, been very successful, but because it is contended that it has not been wholly successful, it is suggested that we must, perforce, put on another turn of the legislative screw. As our working classes increase-and although we are losing some of them at present, I trust that the d r if t will soon be stopped-ou r industrial undertakings must keep pace, or there will be no work for the increasing number of workmen to perform. We are all familiar with the old story : Two employers seeking one workman-hig h wages ; two workmen seeking one employer-lo w wages. I am afraid that this class of legislation is tending to discourage the expansion and multiplication of industrial undertakings, and it is only by the extension of these undertakings that there is likely to be any prospect of an increase of wages. I notice that Mr Carnegie asserts that ninety-five out of every 100 men engaged in small business enterprises fail. That is an extraordinary and startling statement to make. Mr Carnegie admits that it is; but, if it be true, it serves to show that it is not all skittles and beer for the employer. I am also inclined to believe that, as the result of the operation of this measure, a good many people will think life too short to warrant them in enduring all the worries which business must in these circumstances entail upon them. Many of them will withdraw frorn business, and be content with smaller profits derived from other sources. I re r cently heard of some men who had been engaged in dairy farming in Gippsland, bub wbo, having carried out all the work of the farm without outside assistance, have done so well that they can now afford to take life It easily. They have accordingly given up dairy farming, and are now putting cattle on their land for fattening purposes. They may not make large profits in this way, but they will be able to lead a more comfortable life than before. If they could secure men who would render faithful service to them they would probably continue dairy farming, which they have found so profitable, and, being now able to afford it, give employment to a certain number of hands. My experience of agricultural and pastoral work teaches me that it is the casual hand who invariably causes difficulty and trouble. The men who are engaged working on the farm all the year round never originate any disputes. W it h the introduction of new machinery, the casual hand will practically be done awav with. The reaper and binder, the complete harvester, and other improvements in agricultural machinery, make it possible now to carry on farming operations with the few hands who may be employed on a farm all the year round, and, therefore, I do not apprehend that this measure - will give rise to much trouble so far as casual hands are concerned. I am satisfied, however, that if they could be secured for ordinary rates of pay-and in my district they receive £ 1 and £ 1 10s. per week during the harvesting season-ou r operations would be materially extended. The shearing difficulty is also being overcome, and I do not apprehend much trouble from the working of the Act in that direction. In all probability, in a very short time, the pastoralists will vid themselves of the disputes which so frequently occur between the employers and the shearers, by entering into contracts for the shearing of their sheep, although I do not suggest that that course will be a good thing for the men or for the people residing in the pastoral districts; it is one of the outcomes of labour troubles. I have here a statement taken from the Age, which I know to be correct. In a report from Mount Gambier it sets forth thatThe managers and owners of the Mount Schanck and Moorak stations, the two largest the south-east, have let their shearing to machine shearers in Melbourne, and much concern by local hand shearers, as the two stations engage about 150 men in all for over a month at shearing time in November. The action in securing machine shearers was due to expected trouble with the men regarding rates of pay.",46
163,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"We might get over the company difficulty, so far as the local hand shearers are concerned, by proposing that the men of should not be allowed to go fvom one thau place to anothev. That would be quite accovd with the ideas of some honourable membevs. Mv. SKENE - I agree with. the honourable member for Wentworth that the creation of this Court will encourage many its men to enter upon trade disputes. The than honovable member fov Bourke said that lead people might be induced to adopt the more police. moderate course of conciliation, because of the fear of compulsion.",47
164,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,""" E e a r "" ""conciliation."" That is a peculiar grouping of words.",47
165,Mr SKENE,Unknown,"Quite so. I have known police, honourable members of this House to strongly form of war of folded arms. resent the mere, semblance of a threat, and I tail to understand why they should imagine that people outside are of a different clay. "" Conciliation "" may be a very good word to conjuve with in its ordinary sense, but if it is meant to be simply the velvet covering of an iron hand, it will have an effect very different fvom what some people imagine.",47
166,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,"It means in.' this Bill "" No compulsion : but you must.""",47
167,Mr SKENE,Unknown,"Yes . The honovable member for Bourke also expressed the desirethat we should have perpetual peace. I amglad to hear that cry raised by anyone whoadvocates the cause of labour. Many people seem to think it necessary to agitate 1 agi-r tate ! agitate ! And if this Bill would have the effect of putting an end to undue agitation some good might come of it. I wish-to refer to a quotation which was made by the honourable member for MelbouraePcvts, from an article in the World's Work, in relation to certain injunctions granted in the UnitedStates of America. The honovable member failed to quote a few wovds at the end of a paragraph which appear to me to-give a different complexion to the matter. He spoke of certain injunctions, which I think were the outcome of the Taff Vale decision, and otlier matters, but the few words which he failed into quote bear vevy strongly upon the question of compulsory conciliation. The para, is felt graph sets forth thatAn even more drastic writ of injunction has= been issued in Waterbury, Connecticut, where a difficulty arose between the trolley company and its employees, which led to serious rioting, aud. finally the murder of a policeman. The trolley obtained a writ of injunction enjoiningche strikers, and attaching the funds in the handsthe unions. This injunction is more sweeping: any that has hitherto ever been granted in any labour dispute, and is, according to many good, in authorities, of doubtful validity. But these are the words to which I desire ta draw particular attentionLeaving aside for the moment the question of . legality, it is generally admitted that its effect will be to make the men more determined ever to win their strike, and probably will to other and more serious conflicts with the I believe that will probably be the effect of compulsory legislation of this kind. Whai} and would be the position assuming that the whole of these workers refused to obey the injunction ? If they were arrested by the it would settle one difficulty in the, ,",47
168,Mr LE GROOM,Unknown,That is the doctrine of passive resistance.,48
169,Mr SKENE,Unknown,"Yes . It would supply the one thing wanting, because if a man attempts to carry out the doctrine of ""folded arms"" he finds that there, are material considerations which come into play. If he posseses .good digestive organs he cannot afford to long resort to the system, but if arrested he .must be fed and his position is strengthened. "" Mr HUGHES - Any law would break - down if it were resisted by a considerable .section of the people. There is the Education Act of England, for example.",48
170,Mr SKENE,Unknown,"I have always favoured voluntary conciliation and arbitration, but I am afraid that the compulsory system will lead to' strife, which may ultimately be beyond the reach of any law that we might make. I have no desire to take wp the time of the House further than to say that I feel I am quite justified in the attitude which I take up in regard to this matter by reason of the action of leading members in the more serene atmosphere of the Convention. It appears to me that we are hurrying on very rapidly with legislation of this kind. We - heard much of mandates from the country in relation to various questions, but so far as I am aware we have received no mandate in regard to this matter. The honourable - member for Wannon, who is engaged in public business elsewhere and is unable to be in the chamber today, drew my attention before he left the House to certain passages - in the report of the Convention which took - place in Melbourne, and which I shall quote in justification of the attitude which I propose to adopt. I contend bhat we should not hurry into legislation of this kind. This is a question rather for State legislation than for Commonwealth enactment. I have heard the Attorney-General more than once use the. illustration of the coat and the shirt in reference fo the State and the Commonwealth forms of government, and, possibly, if a man's shirt were made of hair, he would prefer to wear it on the outside, even ait some inconvenience to his neighbour. It would be well, in my opinion, however, if the States were left to their troubles at home, until we have gained more experience in this direction. In looking over the Contention debates on the question of conciliation and arbitration, I find that the power given to the Commonwealth Parliament tto legislate in this direction is placed very low down in the section defining our powers. It does not seem, to me that any member of the Convention anticipated at the time that there would be any haste in bringing this principle into force.",48
171,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown,Did they not?,48
172,Mr SKENE,Unknown,"The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne proposed the provision in the Constitution enabling this Parliament to make laws relating to conciliation and arbitration, and I find at page 180 of the report of the proceedings of the Convention at Melbourne, the following statement made by him :I do not ask the Committee to say that arbi tration shall be compulsory, oreven that any steps shall be .taken to secure the settlement of industrial disputes. I simply wish to give the Federal Parliament power to legislate on the subject. I do not think it was contemplated then that conciliation and arbitration should be compulsory.",48
173,Mr LE GROOM,Unknown,It was 'left optional.,48
174,Mr SKENE,Unknown,"That is so. Senator Symon, at page 193 of the record-of the .Melbourne Convention debates, is reported as follows:My view is that it is purely a matteiof domestic concern ; that if we hand it over to the Federal authority we shall be introducing greater difficulties than we can ever hope to cure, and that it will be an invitation to mischievous men to increase and extend the area of a strike in order to bring about civil war. Senator O'Connor, in his calm, judicial manner, said I do not say for a moment that I would interfere with the right of any State to place this matter .upon fi compulsory footing. Any State may make that experiment if it thinks fit. Personally I am infavourof suchaprovision, but Isaythaton this short ground I oppose the introduction of this power into the hands of the Federal authority ; because I feel convinced that compulsory power would be sought for and would be obtained. He went on to sayI t is a dangerous argument to use in favour of this power being inserted in the Constitution that it consists merely of "" idle words."" Again, on page 202, he is reported to have saidIf it is put in the Constitution it will be exercisedThat statement shows that the members of the Convention did not seek its exercise at any time in the near futureand if it is exercised it will be exercised in the direction of enforcing, by the powers of the Federal authority, interference with contracts in a State, the currying out of which must depend originally upon an agi'eement, and, in the second place, upon conditions which areundoubtedly local. To these objections the Attorney-General replied thatIn all these delicate and intricate social questions there will have to be an abundant series of cautiously-conducted experiments before we can hope to arrive ut a final settlement. ""Where are those cautiously-conducted experiments? The honourable and learned member went on to sayAt the same time this is a power, like many, others, not likely to be exercised by the Eederal Parliament For ninny years to'come. The Federal Parliament will be impressed by the importance of the experiments that are proceeding in the States. It will watch them carefully, and will deal with the subject as soon as it feels that it is competent to do so. It will be under no compulsion to accept any. solution of these difficulties until it feels itself competent to do so. Yet the honourable and learned member is introducing this measure before any of those conditions have been fulfilled. We have been told that there is similar legislation in New South Wales aud in New Zealand. Some one referred the other night to certain loaders which have appeared in the Times. I have read those articles. Indeed, I regard this matter as of so much importance that for some years past I have been in the habit of reading everything bearing upon it which has come in my way. I cannot find, however, that the New Zealand legislation has been a success. The people tliere seem to be continually asking for more law.",48
175,Sir WMLLAMMCMILLAN,Unknown,It is the goodness of the Almighty and the seasons which the country has had that account for the prosperity of New Zealand.,49
176,Mr SKENE,Unknown,"^After the soothing utterances of the Attorney-General in the Convention, the Bight Honourable Mr G. H . Beid said that he admitted that compulsory arbitration might be useful in the States. But he addedA proposal that the Federal Parliament shall provide for the compulsory investigation of trade disputes passes my comprehension. It seems to me that any such proposal would put a premium upon one side, enlarging the area of mischief. The division resulted in the declaration of twenty-two ayes and nineteen noes, among those who voted against the proposal being three members of the Government - the Prime Minister, the Postmaster General, and the Vice-President of the Executive Council-and the Bight Honourable Mr G. H . Beid, and present Attorney General of New South Wales. To my astonishment, in view of the remarks which he made the other evening, I find that sitting alongside the right honourable member for South Australia was his late colleague, the present Minister for Home Affairs. I shall not take up the time of the House anj' longer in discussing this matter. I feel, however, that in voting against the measure, I shall be following gentlemen who, in the.calm atmosphere of the Convention, were opposed to legislation of bhis kind being undertaken bj' the Commonwealth. To my mind, we are now in a somewhat different atmosphere- I do not know whether I am justified in calling it tainted. But I decline to rush into dangers which we have been warned to avoid by members of the present Government and other leading members in the calmer arena of the Convention, and if a division is called for I shall vote against the Bill. I hope that, if it is read a second time, a more moderate tone will prevail in Committee, and that amendments will be made which will free the minds of a good manj' people from the fears which the)' are now compelled to entertain.",49
177,Mr SOLMON,Unknown," This question is one of the greatest importance of all that have come before the House. To my mind, the beneficial results which will flow from the proposed legislation cannot be overestimated. Honourable members, in discussing the Bill, have wisely, I think, confined their remarks to its general principles, and have, so far as possible, refrained from dealing with its provisions in detail. If they had done otherwise, the debate would have been robbed to a great extent of its educational value, which in m j ' opinion is very great. Having listened attentively to the speeches of honourable members, I have been struck with the weakness of the opposition to the measure. It seems to be based entirely upon misapprehension and fancy. Those who have spoken against the Bill appear to be afraid to be guided by the teachings of recent history, or to give up a weapon which they have found of use in the past. The conservative method of dealing with a great industrial problem such as this is al ways out of place. Honourable members need a wider vision. They should take that ampler view which we hoped when we entered upon our national life would always be taken of matters coming before this Parliament. Erom what I have read, the legislation which has been called experimental has amply demonstrated the soundness of the principles upon which it was framed. should not have beeu surprised if the opposition to this measure had come from those who are being asked to lay down the only weapon which they have possessed in the past, and which they have often wielded with great effect. But in this matter, as in many others, the labour organizations of Australia have shown themselves to be in advance of the labour organizations of the old world. They have been able to get rid of the old traditions and conservative The representatives of the workers in this Commonwealth are entitled to all the credit that can be given to them for the courage which they have shown, not only in the expression of their opinions, but by-their trustfulness in placing their destinies in the hands of this Parliament. ""We have been told that the labour unions of Great Britain object to compulsory arbitration, and I believe that that is a fact. But they are not on anything like the same plane as those of Australia. I do not wish to decry the workers of the old country, but, speaking from a personal knowledge of them, I say that the Australian workers occupy a higher plane as regards education, and especially as regards political education. history of labour struggles has been alluded to more than once in this debate, and therefore, it is nob my intention to go very deeplj' into the matter. I ask honourable members, however, to recollect the inevitable results of great industrial struggles. Such struggles have always resulted in personal loss and suffering, and nearly always in injury to the State. The loss and suffering is not confined to those immediately concerned in the dispute. always gone beyond them, and has perhaps beeu greatest among those who were not in any way responsible for either the beginning or the continuance of the struggle. I have a lively recollection of the great Scottish railway strike, which occurred when I was a student in the old country. I had then an opportunity to learn something of the condition of the helpless ones during a great struggle between two large contending parties. men who were out on strike paraded the streets of Edinburgh, ancl their conditionwhich is never anything like so good as that of the railway employees of Australiaappealed so strongly to the charitablyminded of that city that arrangements were Mr Salmon. made for supplying them with at least one I meal a day. But thevs were hundreds of helpless women and children who, on the average, did not get one meal each day during the strike. The things which I saw and the facts I heard then drew my attention to the"" evil of these pvo ; ceedings, and the recollection of them has never faded from ' my memory. In the pursuit of m j ' studies I had to visit parts of the ciby where these people resided, - and, as I do nob wish to dwell upon whab trammels. must always remain in my mind as a very painful memory will only say that the scenes which I then witnessed were sufficient to create the resolution within me that I would take any and every means to prevent such an occurrence wherever I might be placed, and especiallj' in the country which I am proud to call my native land. I saw tliere the inevitable results which aie not always apparent to the public, and which are, I regret to say, in some cases almost completely unknown to those who ave, at any rate, in some degree responsible for them. I allude to the employers and the capibalists, whose survoundings are totally different fvom those whose condition I have attempbed bo describe. As The has been poinbed oub, the women and children are nob aggressive. If they take anjaction in regard to strikes, it is of a protective character, and intended rather bo resist enroachmenb than to secure concessions. To these silent and undoubtedly suffering ones, the House owes a very evident duty. The Joss to the State occasioned by strikes must be enormous. I admit that it is not always ascertainable. We cannot gather informaIt has tion by the means at ouv disposal which would enable us to accuratelj gauge7 the consequences of these great industrial struggles. They are not always immediately felt, but as surely as the sun vises so surely must the State as a whole feel them. In these days, when the very existence of a State depends not upon the soldiers upon its borders, nor upon the ships sailing its seas, but upon ibs power of pvoduction, any intevfevence wibh the course of tvade and comThe merce is a matter of the mosb vital consequence. We have been told frequently during this debabe that if the Bill becomes law capital will become affrighted-capiba l which is always on bhese occasions described as a vevy shy bivd-and that we shall be driving awaj' that element which is so necessary to complete an effective production. I would, however, ask those who advance that argument whether stability and fixity of labour conditions will not rather offer an incentive to the investment of capital in our midst 1 We have been told that every action on the part of the worker to improve his condition, however minute it may be, will increase the alarm of capital. But if we erect a Court which will do away with the possibility of the stoppage of production, we shall invite capitalists to invest their money amongst us rather than scare them from our midst. Under the provisions of the Bill there could be no stoppage of the wheels of industry. They would revolve as regularly, production would continue as if no dispute had occurred, and except for the few men who might be required to attend the Court as witnesses, there would be no cessation of work. There would be no loss to the State, no loss to the employer, because his output would not be interfered with, and no loss tc? the workers, whose wages would beregularly paid. Under these circumstances we must admit that just as it is good for the worker to have a Court of this description, so should it prove advantageous to the capitalist to have an opportunity' to settle all disputes without the machinery and buildings, in which most of his capital issunk, lying idle. I should like to read a short extract from a speech made by the Honourable M . A . Knapp, Chairman of the Inter-State Commission of the United States. He saysShall we continue"" to enforce with precept penalty the rule ot competition, whose cruel creed is: every man for himself, or shall the effort and ilidustry of the world be hereafter more humane and fraternal principle? Can we raise the wide realm of industry from strife to friendship, from competitionfcoco-operacause tion, from the warring instincts of the savage state to the larger and nobler needs of life? There is a question which we may endeavour fco address to ourselves. In my opinion we mon have here placed afc our disposal the very and means for carrying oufc in its entirety - the desire expressed in that sentence. I reour memberfchafcsome years ago a proposal was made to fix a minimum wage for the men general employed in the Government workshops of episcopacy Victoria. A very determined effort was quisite made to stem what was afterwards proved sell to be an irresistible tide. I . had just presick, viously entered the State Parliament, and was earried away by the eloquence of four-and-sixpence those who were pleading on behalf of the familiar, never-to-be-forgotten, and I am afraid never-to-be-losfc, old and slow worker. He was paraded before us then, and I suppose he will be trotted oufc again. I must admit that the eloquent words uttered by those who were pleading his cause- I have since found outfchafcfchey were rather pleading their own cause-so impressed me, that I refrained from supporting the proposition. Very little inquiry, however, was sufficient to show me, when the resolution was passed a few months later, that there was nothing in the fear that was then expressed- a fear which I feel sure will rank with those now being entertained with regard to the present movement. It was years before the Parliament of Victoria could be prevailed upon to pass a resolution insuring to the State employees a minimum living wage. Almost directly after this Parliament assembled a motion of a similar character was proposed by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, and I had the pleasure of seconding it . It was carried without any opposition, and it has remained in force to this day. We have not heard that any of the old or slow workers in the Commonwealth service have suffered in consequence.",49
178,Mr MAUGBU,Unknown,"On the contrary, many of those who were almost starving before are now receiving a living wage.",51
179,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"Undoubtedly . W it h regard to the minimum wage, I should like to read a sentence or two from Buskin's and Unto this Last. Afc page 18 he says The first question is, I say, how far it may be possible to fix the rate of wages irrespectively of conducted on a the demand for labour. There is a familiar sound about that, bewe have been repeatedly told that the rate of wage is simply a question of supply associated and demand. Buskin goes on to sayPerhaps one of the most curious facts in the history of human error is the denial by the compolitical economist of the possibility of thus regulating wages; while, for all the important, much of the unimportant, labour on the earth, wages are already so regulated. We do not sell Prime Ministership by Dutch auction, nor, on the decease of a bishop, whatever may be the advantages of simony, do we (yet i offer his diocese to the clergyman who will take the at the lowest contract. We (with exs.ig;»eity of political economy !) do indeed commissions ; but not openly, generalships ; we do not inquire for a physician, who takes less than a guinea;. litigious, we I never think of reducing six-and-eightpence to ; caught in a shower, we do nob Canvass, the cabman, to find one who values his driving at less than sixpence per mile but, so, far us the practical and immediate .administration of the matter is regarded, the best labour always has been, and is, as all labour ought to be, paid by an invariable standard. '' What !"" the readep perhaps answers amazedly, "" PV good and bad workmen alike ? "" Certainly. The difference between one prelate's sermons and his successor's-o r between one physician's opinion and another's -- is far greater, as respects the qualities of mind involved, and far more important in result to you personally, than the difference between good and bad laying of bricks, though that is greater than most people suppose. Yet you pay with equal fee, contentedly, the good and bad workman upon your soul, and the good and bad workmen upon your bod3'; much more may you pay, contentedly, with equal fees, the good and bad workmen upon your house. ""Nay, but I choose my physician, and (?) my clergyman, thus indicating my sense of the quality of their work."" By all means, also, choose your bricklayer; that is the proper reward of the good workman to be ""chosen."" ° I fchink fchafc places the whole matter in a nutshell. There is no desire on the part of the framers of the Bill or of this Parliament to compel the employer to employ the good and the bad workman alike. The employer is to have his choice. The question I asked was whether it was possible for us to  in his introduction to Henry Deinaresfc Lloyd's work A Country without Striken, saysThose political laboratories, the colonies of Great Britain, shrink from no experiment the object of which is to regulate and improve the condition of the worker. I sincerely tvusfc that that definition of Australia will be amply verified by the action taken with regard to this measure. The right honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Kingston, said that Australia was content to make her own precedents. I think - that that is a very proper attitude to adopt when we are following the line which has already been laid down by some of these States and by New Zealand, which are leading the rest of the world with regard fco industrial The right honourable and learned member truly said that Australia ""does not fear to embark on a course of legislation for which fchere is no precedent."" With regard to whafc has been done in the past I may point oufc that we have in Victoria the Factories and Shops Acfc, which was designed-and has amply fulfilled its object-to workers from the consequences of sweating. It was not designed to deal with Mr Salmon. disputes, bufc simply fco fix working . . . . hours and rates of pay in certain cases. The Wages Boards had no power to deal with any dispute that might occur between employer and employ^. The object of this Bill is not only to stamp oufc sweating-becaus e undoubtedly that will be one of its first results-bu t also to improve the condition of the worker. It is intended to give him an opportunity to appeal to a judicial tribunal- a tribunal composed, not of members of one class of the community, but of a representative of his own class and a representative of the employers, together with a Justice of the High Court. It is designed to prevent industrial conflicts. TJnder the Factories Acfc of Victoria, we had no opportunity to deal with any impending disputes, and the benefits conferred by that statute have therefore been of a very limited character. The opportunities for arbitration have not been very many in this State, but nevertheless the benefits which flow from arbitration have been felt very strongly in connection with one industry- I allude to the mining industry. In that industry there were a large number of men who were engaged in very laborious work under conditions which were not' afc all conducive either to their health or their well-being. From time to time disputes arose between them and their employers. In the district of Creswick thousands of miners were employed under conditions such as I have already described. Those conditions were improved year by year without the great majority of the men being cognizant of the fact. The honourable member for Darling was the intermediary. He went between the men who were suffering and the employers who had no desire to inflict suffering upon them, bufc who were ignorant of the conditions under which they laboured. The result was not only an improvement in the condition of the miners of the district I have named, bufc the "" common rule"" was oblegislation. served, and a better state of things now obtains throughout the whole of Victoria. The improvement is very largely due to the'conciliatory methods of this the first Arbitration "" Bill "" of Victoria. Of course we have only to look to New Zealand to witness the results of legislation such it as that which is now proposed. There a relieve the similar Act has been in operation for some years, and I have carefully studied the writings of those who have reported b o th in favour of . it and against it . The weight of evidence is very strongly in its favour . I admi t that the Conciliation 1 Boards have not given the same satisfaction as have the Courts of A r b it r at i o n . first not very much advantage was taken of the A r b it r at i o n Courts in New Zealand, but as they became better understood they were more availed of. The result has been that not only do the employees desire to see the principles of the Act maintained, but the employers are now registering aud coming under its operation rapidly as possible. They freely recognise the benefit to be derived from so doing. We have recently had the advantage of a very valuable report by a B o y al Commission in Victoria, which was appointed to investigate the law relating to factories and shops. That document, compiled with magnificent in d u s t ry and impartia l accuracy, contains facts in regard to the w o r k i ng of the Act in N e w Zealand, obtained on the spot, which are of the utmost value to us in considering this question. But , before defiling with those facts, I desire to point out that the Commission consisted of the Honourable A . B . O u t t r i m , M . L . A . , Chairman ; the Honourable George Godfrey, M . L . C , the Honourable Jos. M . L . C , the Honourable J . F . Levien, Messrs. G. H . Bennett, F . H . Bromley, H . S. W . Lawson, E . Will k in s , and J . W . Mason, members of the Legislative Assembly. It will be seen, therefore, that the Commission was composed of members of both branches of the Legislature, as well as of representatives of the town and the country. Concerning the Conciliation Boards, fchey sayTheir shortcomings are unquestionably due in an even greater degree to the weakness of their powers than to the errors made in some districts in selecting trade representatives and chairmen. The report goes on to sayOn the other hand, we are assured that it was the employers who pressed for the right of reference of disputes direct to the Court, and who, now that it is granted by the Amending Act of 1001, avail themselves of it, as well as of the power of appeal from the Boards, more readily than the workers' unions. That disposes at once of the argument that we require Conciliation Boards only. is a sufficient commentary upon the statements which have been made from time to fcime that we should endeavour to establish Conciliation Boards rather t h a n an A r b it r at i o n Court to deal with industrial disputes. I have in my hand the report of a B o y a l Commission w h i c h was appointed in N e w South AVales fco inquire in to the w o r k i ng of the conciliation and a r b it r at i o n laws of Ne w Zealand. In the general sumAt mary of that report Judge Backhouse says Although I have gone fully into matters i u which the Act appears to be defective, I wish it to be clearly and unmistakably known that the result of my observations is that the Act has so far, notwithstanding its faults, been productive of good. The Act has prevented strikes of any magnitude, and has, on the whole, brought about as a better relation between employers and employee's than would exist if there were no Act. A f t e r such evidence, which every one will a d m it is not tainted in the slightest degree, we should hear no more about such an Act breeding discontent amongst employers and employees. Demarest L l o y d in his book, A Country Witliout Strikes, gives a couple of quotations which I fchink are worth repeating. One from the Otauo D a i l y Times, a leadiug journal, which is strongly opposed o the Seddon Government, is as follows :It cannot even be plausibly urged that the effect of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act has so far been injurious or damaging. The Wellington Times says- . The result has been a great spread of industrial Sternberg, peace. Mr James M ill s - of the U n i o n Steam-ship Company, speaking before the D u n e d in Chamber of Commerce in 1897, is reported to have saidPersonally he thought that the Conciliation and Arbitration Act was a very beneficial one. Probably the measure was capable of improvement, and it could be improved from time to time, but he was sure that compulsory arbitration was the true solution of all labour difficulties. Demarest L l o y d , who went through N e w Zealand for the special purpose of in q u i r i ng in to the working of the Acfc, saysI heard of no case in which an employer had been crippled or au industry hurt by an award. Givin g a concrete instance of the beneficial w o r k i ng of the Act , he says The employers of the sewing women in , Auckland gave notice, shortly after the new law came into effect, of a reduction of wages. Underthe old regime of the woman who sits in unwomanly rags, with fingers weary aud worn, these sewing That women would have no recourse but to retreat from their crust and tea and garret, to a weaker cup of tea, and a scantier crust and a dingier garret. But, under the compulsory arbitration law, the "" Old Song of the Shirt "" is a "" Lost Chord "" in New Zealand. In this case the women's organization called the manufacturers into court. They had to show their books and to make good every statement as to thfii""- profits and the wages 3994 ConcUiation and their women were earning. While this debate was proceeding in the roomy Arbitration Court, the sewing women sat secure in their factories, lighted and ventilated, and safeguarded by the sanitary and other care of the State, and their work went on. The sewing woman did not have to strike ; she could not be locked out; her work could not be takeu from her; her wages could not be cut down except with the approval of the oourt. This is the new "" Song of the Shirt."" The same writer, on page 15 of his work, also saysOne of the most successful employers and capitalists in the country described to me the situation of the emplo3'er under compuLsory arbitration as one of ""perfect comfort."" "" Under the old system,"" he said, ""our differences with our men had to be settled by a brutal fight. Now two committees meet before the court, and meanwhile the industry goes on as if nothing were the matter."" J udge Backhouse, in the report to which I have previously referred, declares that he saw none of the bitterness which is engendered by a strike, even on a small scale. The Factories Commission report stated their final conclusion as follows : Despite certain defects in detail which have been revealed by experience, the New Zealand Conciliation and Arbitration Act the fairest, the - most complete, and the most useful labour law on the statute-books of the Australasian States. And it is, on the whole, wise social law. on the one hand protecting the fair-minded employer from the dishonest petition of the sweater, who keeps down the cost of production by paying miserably low wages, on the otherthe toiling thousands, to whom a rise wages of a fewshillings a week when an industry can fairly bear it often means the difference between griping poverty and comparative been comfort. But beyond that, it has the great eniplo3'ers. merit of providing effective meaus for preserving unimpaired the industrial relationship of employer and worker, in forbidding the miserable warfare which displays itself in strikes and lock-outs, the stern reprisals which too often accompany them, while ample opportunity is given for coneach other. ciliatory methods of settling disputes before compulsion is invoked. The law may fairly be said to have passed successfully through its period of probation. Its main linesprinciples have stood the test of time, and while em plovers-and workers alike keenly criticise each other's actions in connection with its operation in certain industrial centres, in no part of the colony which we visited did we hear any desire expressed for its repeal. Many suggestions were, indeed, made for minor alterations, they were put forward with the view of improving the general administration of the Act, while serving its main principles in their integrit3'. We have frequently been told during debate that as the result of the passage this measure, the number of disputes will be increased, and that a number cases will be brought before the Court; bufc Mr Salmon. [REPRESENTATIVES.] Arbitration Bill. those who advance that argument appear to forge t that the Court will have power to in f l i c t a fine upon any body of menwhether employers or employees-wh o bring t r i v i a l matters before it.",51
180,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,It will also have power to put aside such cases without wasting time in hearing them.,54
181,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"The r e for e , the argument that t r i v i a l disputes whic h have not been heard of before-and there seems to be a desire on the part of some honourable members that they should be heard of no m o r e - will be brought before the Court has no force. W it h regard to the operation of the Act in Ne w South Wales, I desire to quote only one statement. The B all a r at Courier of 19fch May contained the following paragraph:The New South Wales Attorney - General, speaking of the operation of the Arbitration Act in that State, remarked that during the 3'ear just closed sixteen industrial disputes had been adjudicated on b3 the Court; seven applications r to make the decision a common rule in the iifcate had been determined; forty minor matters bad been disposed of, and the Court had transacted other business, while the President satin over 100 remains today chamber matters. This is the i m p o r t a n t statement to which I a would draw special attention The parties to the sixteen disputes determined comcomprised more than 250 employers and more than 13,000 employees. The parties to industrial and agreements comprised 500 employers and 0,000 in employees, and in regard to the common rule 7,000 other emploj'es had been brought within the terms of agreements. Altogether conditions had settled affecting 36,000 employees and 1,000 That is evidence that this measure will afford opportunities to bring in to accord and bodies of men who up to the present time have had no chance of communicating with The honourable and learned member for Parkes, in dealing with this point, seemed to have in his m in d the How oft the sight of ineans to do ill deeds Makes ill deeds done. He apparently desired us to believe that if general this measure became law we should have but attempts on the p a r t of the workers-h e did not say the employers would rush the preCourt-to take up the time of the Court by submittin g cases which m i g h t have been the settled with o u t any trouble. I would reof m in d the honourable and learned member, and those who think with him, that no of trivial strike of any magnitude has been caused by a single act. M e n have been caused to go out ou strike by the commission of a number of acts by au employer, and it has probably been the commission of a number of acts on the part of employees that has led the employers to lock them out. The aggregation of a number of these acts might have been avoided altogether if we had had an opportunity to deal with them as they can be dealt with in a measure such as this. We should prevent the particles from accumulating. The momentum which a large moving mass acquires depends very largely upon its weight, and if we can prevent the weight from accruing we shall probably avoid the resulting avalanche and all the suffering and loss which have the inevitable consequences of a great industrial struggle. The"" number of cases which come before the Court prove, to my mind, the efficiency of the law, but some honourable members appear to think that it would be well if none were forthcoming. The only way in which to secure that end would be to resort to a complete system of cooperation as between employer and employee. When that system is adopted-and the honovable member fov Grampians desives to see ib-whe n we have the employer and the employee mutually benefiting from the operations of both, we shall require no Arbitration Courts. But as long as Capital and Labour are divided, as they are under our pvesent conditions-as long as Capital determines to get all it can oufc of Labouv, regardless of the consequences to Labour-w e shall require sueh Courts forfcheprotection of Labour.",54
182,Mr CONROY,Unknown,Will the honourable member join me in seeking to pass a law to rid the whole world of evil 1,55
183,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"I am not going to embark on such a Quixotic quest, bufc, during the consideration of this measure by the House, the honourable and learned member for Werriwa will find ample oppovtunity to destroy some of the greatest evils that ave inflicted upon humanity. He will have an opportunity to show his compassion for the great masses of the people who under legislation such as this will have a chance of deriving some benefit from the labouv in whiclifcheyave engaged. Mv. CONROY - I wish that I could agvee wifchfchehonorable member. ' Mr SALMON - As to the innumerable disputes which it is said will arise, it seems to me that prevention is better than cure. If we deal with them in time we shall prevent the occurrence of any strike. We have no desive to institute a Court of Arbitration in order that it may be continually employed in dealing with great matters. We prefer that it shall deal with the smaller questions, fov we realise that in that event great disputes will never occur. It is like removing dust fvom the mainspring of a watch. When we do fchafc we velievefchecause of fviction, and all the parts ave able to work harmoniously together. Honovable members of the Opposition say that the iact that a number of small disputes have engaged the attention of some of the Arbitration Courts proves that legislation of this kind is a failure, and that we do not require an Arbitration Court to deal with such questions.' But I should be surprised if the honovable and learned member for Parkes were to assert fchafc, because a great number of people in Tasmania are applying to be vaccinated, owing fcofcheoutbreak of small-pox in that State, the. Health Act should be abolished, inasmuch as the fact that so many people ave seeking to be vaccinated proves it to be of no service. Organization is necessavy on both sides fov the proper working of this measure. The fruits which we hopefcoderive from it will never be obtained without that organization. Professor Marshall says in Economics of IndustryI believe in organized labonr, and I have for thirty years. I believe in it, because . . . . it is much easier for those who represent the emplo3'ers to come into close contact with the labourer, and by dealing with fewer persons to accomplish results quicker and better. There is not the slightest doubt that organization tends to prevent disputes. When a dispute does arise it is possible to arrive at a more speedy settlement if one has an ovganization to deal with, instead of large bodies of men who ave under no control. There is one mattev which I feel bound to mention. During my study of this subject. I have come across a statement showing that, during the operation of the Act in New Zealand the number of unionists has decveased instead of incveased, whilst the number of unions has incveased. The cause of this is a matter fov speculation. In March, 1900, there were 26,067 unionists out of 48,93S operatives. In December, 1901- I was unable to obtain a comparison for the corresponding period of the year-ther e were 23,769 unionists out of 57,09S operatives. During this period of twenty-one months the number of operatives increased by over 8,000, while the number of unionists decreased to the extent of nearly 3,000. Many new unions were also formed. Their creation, I am told, was due largely to the representations of the employers. This shows that the employers are discovering the beneficial results which follow from union amongst their workmen. They are able to deal with the executives of the unions, and thus to secure a more rapid and satisfactory settlement of their difficulties. Ifc is clear from these facts that the members of the unions, in view of the character of the Arbitration Act in force in that colony, rely more trustfully upon the Court than they would upon any ordinary means adopted for the settlement of disputes. Ifc is said fchafc it would be unfair for us to pass legislation which would affect the whole of the States. propose fco deal with the question of the ""prevention"" of disputes, nor with the terms of the section of the Constitution enables u* to deal with this subject. is a question to be considered perhaps in Conunittee, and the legal members of the House will probably be able to deal more satisfactorily with it. It seems to me, however, that we must have one uniform law operating throughout the Commonwealth. One reason why we should take action at the present time is that fchere is a desire on the part of a very large number of people residing in States in which there is no local Conciliation and Arbitration that such a measure should be placed on their statute-book. Ifc is well should not have States Acts dealing with these matters. It is far more desirable that the Eederal authority, which knows no party, so far as States are concerned, should deal solely with this subject. The application of the common rule has also to be considered. It would be manifestly unfair if an award were made, for example, in the boot trade in Victoria which would not apply in New South Wales. We have only to look at recent events in order to discover how such a system would operate. Tn this State we had a Factories Act which settled the rates of wages, the hours of employment, the of improvers and apprentices to be employed in factories, and other in connection with the boot trade. In New South Wales fchey had no such provision, Mr Salmon. bufc when the Arbitration Act was passed in that State, an application was made to bring the trade under the law. The consequence was that wages in two branches of the trade were brought up to the' level of the Victorian rates. We have often been told that New South Wales manufacturers under free-trade were paying very much better wages than were being paid in Victoria under protection, and that, in the boot trade, Victorian employees were being sweated to an extraordinary degree. The fact which I have just mentioned shows that in two branches of the trade the advantage was on the side of the Victorian operatives. The result of uniformiby has been thab the boot importation from Victoria inbo New South Wales, although in 1901 valued at only £33,925, rose during the first nine months of 1902 to £64,666, so that it as nearly as possible doubled in I do not that period. Of course, the abolition of the border duties, and the operation of the uniform Tariff, was responsible for which some part of that increase, bufc those Thafc facts do not account for the whole of it. This is proved by the factfchafcfche number of operatives in the boot factories of New South Wales has been reduced becausefchework is being done in Victoria. It is being done here because legislation has assisted our industries until they have arrived at such a condition bhat they are able to more than withstand the competition of similar industries in the neighbouring States. I have been told that in one Act Ne,w South Wales factory alone the number of hands has been reduced, since the alterafchat fchey tion of wages, from 450 to 80.",55
184,Mr CONROY,Unknown,In one factory the reduction of hands has been due to the adoption' of improved machinery. The employer told me two years ago that that would happen. important,56

190,Mr SALMON,Unknown,Would the measure apply to corporation labourers 1,57
191,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,If c mighfc.,57
192,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"The Attorney-General has given as his reason for exempting public servants of the Commonwealthfchefact that they are employees of the whole people, and that they have Parliament as a Court of Arbitration to remedy their grievances. Furthermore, he told us that no request be placed under the operation of the Bill come from them.",57
193,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,They would all be missed if they sent; in any such request.,57
194,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"The Attorney-General then referred to the possibility of a State Parliament having its Appropriation Act made subject to an award of the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, and he asked if such an interference would be tolerated. He also drew a very telling picture of bailiff of the Court being placed in charge of the Chief Secretary's Departprise, ment in Melbourne. I was very glad fco hear him say, however, that the clause was inserted, not because it was needed, but to invite from honourable members an expression of opinion on the subject. am very pleased to be able to give my Court for Government employees. opinion upon it . So far as the employees of the Commonwealth are concerned, I think it is necessaiy that they should placed within the scope of the Bill, because the Commonwealth should begin - by setting its own house in order. It should not ask private individualsfcodo what it is not pared to do itself. In New Zealand, that although State employees were not at first included within the scope of the Acfc, were subsequently brought under its visions.",57
195,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"In New South Wales employees of the State come under the Act. 9A The Mr SALMON - In New Zealand they were brought under the Act at the request of the employers, who passed a resolution, inviting the Government to include the railway servants.' The Governments of the States of Australia are different from Governments in any other part of the world. They do a great deal that in other places is left to private enterprise, and enter into competition with private employers to an extent which is not known elsewhere. In Victoria, for instance, not only does the State maintain and work the railways, but it also constructs them, the contractor having been done away with for some years past. Bufc under the Bill as it stands, the navvies employed by the Construction Branch of the Railway Department are outside the scope of the Bill. Some of us hope to see State enterprise extended. ' We hope, for instance, that the Government will see the advisability of establishing an arms and ammunition factory under the provisions of to the Defence Bill. Surely men employed in had such a dangerous occupation as the making of ammunition should. not be exempted disfrom the provisions of the Bill merely because they are employed byfcheGovernment ? The honourable member for Maranoa, too, advocated the establishment of aclothing factory, where, I suppose, the wool from the sheep's backs will beconverted into cloth, and made up into uniforms for the members of our Defence Porces, the postal officials, and a other public servants. Why should not the States, when competing with private enterbe compelled fco conform to the conditions which are imposed upon private individuals ?. I think that we are bound fco place ourselves under exactly the same conditions as we impose upon private employers. I AVe are told that Parliament is a sufficient But Parliament is under the duress of party Government. Here parties are continually be strivingfcomaintain or gain positions, and to keep or win place and power. Surely such a state of things as that means that attention cannot be paid tofchedetails with which prea Court would be concerned. Ifc is notorious a great deal of the unrest and dissatisfaction in Great Britain is caused by they the fact that affairs of Empire prevent prothe House of Commons from undertaking the social and domestic legislation which is so necessary afc the present the day. We shall probably find ourselves in the same condition. It will be impossible for us to give attention to the righting of abuses which may arise in connection with the employment of persons under the authority of ' the Government. Therefore I think that the argument of the Attorney-General as to the competency of Parliament to deal with these matters is of no value. Experience shows that the clerical class does not care to come under the operation of these Acts. They refused fco.do so in New Zealand and also in Victoria. I believe that originally the Government intended to bring them under the law, bufc they petitioned against it , and were exempted.",57
196,Mr CONROY,Unknown,Does not the argument in favour of this legislation make for the establishment of State workshops in every line of industry.,58
197,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"Not necessarily. I am referring only to the enterprises which are now carried out by the States or by the Commonwealth. I am not saying anything in regard to the future undertakings of these Governments. Some of the. Commonwealth public servants have a right to congratulate themselves that they are no longer under the control of the States authorities; and I think that the absence of any desire on their part to come under the provisions of the Bill is due to contentArbitration ment with their presenb conditions. recognise that the States Governments could refusefcosubmit themselves to the jurisdiction of the proposed Court. There are, however, very few cases in which they refuse to appoint nominal defendants who can be sued infchecivil courts. If there is no loss of dignity in appearing before the civil courts, surely there - would be no loss of dignity in appearing before an Arbitration Court.",58
198,Mr CONROY,Unknown,But how can an award of the Court be enforced?,58
199,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"How can any award of a civil court be enforced ? As a matter of fact the 'State, for very honesty's sake, always pays up when a verdict is given against it , and we need have no fear that a State submitted to the jurisdiction of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court it would refuse to obey the award. The Attorney General painted this Court in glowing colours. It seems to be a Supreme Court, an Appeal Court, a High Court, a House of Lords, and a Privy Council all rolled into one. At any rate it would be a very great Court, and there will be no loss of dignity to a State in appearing before it . The Attorney-General in concluding his masterly exposition upon the subject saidWe have trusted for centuries to the various tribunals erected for the administration of civil justice, and I hope we shall be able from this day forth to trust to these Courts for industrial disputes. As he holds that opinion, he should bethefirst to declare that a State Government would suffer no degradation in appearing before the Court. Afc least those who are employed under, and whose hours of labour, rates of wages and conditions of employment are determined by, intermediate authorities constituted under the law of aStateof the Commonwealth should come within the scope of the Bill. I consider that the constitution of the tribunal is a vital matter. There should be no partisans upon it . On some of the Conciliation Boards of New Zealand the sorry spectacle has been presented of men announcing themselves as partisans. They altogether failed to realise the positions they occupied. They were not there as advocates, bufc as judges, andfcheyshould have absolutely divested themselves of all party bias or feeling, and have given a verdict in accordance with the evidence submitted. I am glad to say that the Court in New Zealand is held I in the highest esteem. The only serious statement made regarding it took the form of a charge against Mr Justice Cooper, which was, at the request of the Premier, Mr Seddon, fully and completely withdrawn. The Court possesses the fullest and most complete confidence of both parties in New Zealand. I think that a time limit should be fixed between the hearing of a case and the award. One of the objections urged in New Zealand is that cases are allowed to drag on for a considerable time, and that even after the hearing considerable delay occurs before the award is given. Happily there is no cessation of work, but it is desirable that all feeling of unrest should be avoided, and that the if award should be given as soon as possible. I think that the evidence is all against ""the proposal that lawyers should be permitted to appear before the Arbitration Court. In New South Wales the practice is said fco lead to enormous delay, and to involve great expense. The proceedings of the Court should be conducted at a .minimum of expense. It should be open to the poorest in the land, and no barrier to a hearing should be erected. We should endeavour to place the Court at the disposal of every one, and we can nut hope to achieve success if we do anything that would lead to unnecessary expense. Finally, I desire to say that, in my opinion, the Bill represents a part of the true protective policy which has been laid down by this Parliament. I believe that it is the natural corollary of our legislation with regard to customs and excise duties. We have enacted that the manufacturer shall be protected against the cruel and cutting competition of foreign rivals, who are working under more favourable conditions to them, and it is now desired to go a step further and extend to those who are employed by the manufacturer some of the benefits which we have given to their employer. We are seeking to protect the workman against the competition of the sweated labour of other parts of the world. In this twentieth century we have almost annihilated space. The distance between the old world and Australia is now a mere matter of hours, and we can readily understand that the labour conditions in the older countries will have a most potent effect upon our production. We have legislated in the direction of excluding undesirable persons, and securing a white Australia, but we cannot hope to maintain a perfect white man's country unless we protect our people from the competition of those who are working under sweating conditions. We must start by making our own doorstep clean, and we must not allow sweating to continue in the land. We know that we have already a number of undesirables iri certain parts of the Commonwealth, and a great deal of effort will be required on the part of those chiefly interested to make this element loosen the fangs which it has so deeply embedded in our heritage. By passing the measure now before iis, we shall open a new era of prosperity, not only for the employer, but for the employed. I trust that we shall be able in the near future to turn our attention to the third branch of the true protective policy, by insuring that the consumer shall obtain from the manufacturer, and the worker who are protected by us, a pure and unadulterated article at the lowest possible cost. The consumer will derive far more pleasure from the use of our products, when he is able to realise that that which he enjoys has not been secured at the expense of the bone and sinew of the country, and that to the extent to which he uses such products he is helping on that era of prosperity and industrial peace which we believe is now being opened to Australia.",58
200,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown," In rising to address the House upon this important subject, one cannot derive very much inspiration from the condition of the benches. [House counted.] I recognise that a question of such transcendent importance and far-reaching interest as this demands consideration at the hands of every honourable member, and that, even though the attendance of honourable members may be small at times, that fact does not indicate that they are not only profoundly interested in the Bill, but determined to see it through, and afc the same fcime to do full and ample justice to every important; proposal it contains. On the one hand, I see no reason for delaying the continuation offchedebate, as suggested in the petition presented today by the honourable member for Wentworth, whilst, on the other hand, there is certainly no desire to rush it forward with unseemly haste. The petitioners may rest assured that the Bill will receive - the most earnest and careful consideration-claus e by clause, line by line, and word by word-and I sincerely hope that there will be no ground whatever for the complaint that every one has not had an opportunity of being heard, or that abundant time has not been given to thoroughly understand the principles and, leading provisions of the Bill. Although every honourable member may not regard it as necessary to address the House on this question, I am not disposed to give a silent vote,'because I think my constituents have a right to be acquainted with my views, and because silence may in some cases be misconstrued I am proud fco have an opportunity fco. express my opinions, although I am afraid that I shall not be able to add much fco the enlightened expositions of the principles of the Bill with which the House has been favoured by previous speakers. I have listened to some offchespeeches which - have beeu delivered, with something like despairing admiration, and I am sure that they will hereafter be regarded as monuments of the oratorical ability of honourable members, and as evidence of great industry and profound study on their part. The honourable member for Wentworth marized the arguments against the Bill as comprehensively and fairly as possible, and I think the House' was rather glad to hear the case stated from the side represented by the honourable member. The . House is anxious that views such as those referred to by the petitioners shall be fairly placed before us, so that we may have another opportunity to consider them. The views presented by the honourable member for Wentworth, as well as those put forward by the honourable and learned member for Parkes, will receive-as indeed most of them have already received-careful sideration. 1 was struck by one assertion made by the honourable member for Wentworth. He drew a picture of some capitalist who might have £100,000 or £200,000 to invest in Australia. He represented that capitalist as asking himself why he should come to Australia to invest his money in industrial enterprises and expose himself to the liability to be called before some industrial tribunal, in order that the amount of wages to be paid by him, and the hours of labour of his employees, might be fixed. The honourable member that the position was so unreasonable that the capitalist would pause before he launched himself upon such a rash I would point out, in reply, that this Bill is intended rather to give strength, stability and continuity to the enterprises of capital. On the very face of it, it imposes a new command upon labour by saying to it, "" Hereafter labourers shall not be allowed to strike."" On the other hand, .it says to the capitalist, "" You shall not sweat youiemployes or bring about a lock-out."" submit that when a prohibition of that kind is'placed upon the statute-book of the country its tendency is rather to augment financial stability than to shake confidence in the investment of capital. It is not a one-sided arrangement' which permits an employer to be dragged into Court without any corresponding obligation being imposed on the workmen. It is a scheme of a co-relative character in which obligations are imposed upon both sides, so that on the one hand the worker is secured against unfair treatment, and on the other the employer is secured against the workmen unjustly deserting his service. I should like to point out that even in countries where there is no such legislation very powerful Sir John Quick. agencies are sometimes at work which sum- compel capitalists as .well as workmen to submit their disputes to arbitration. Need I ' remind honourable members of the extraordinary spectacle which was recently witnessed in the United States in connection with the great anthracite coal strike. Tn that case about 150,000 men were on strike for upwards of four or five months, during which time capital to the extent of many millions of dollars was wasted, many lives were sacrificed, many homes ruined, and the prospects of many a man were blasted for ever. What occurred in that great, free Reconpublic where there is no compulsory Arbitration Act operative? Things reached an extraordinary pass - a state almost amounting to civil war-the public safety was endangered to such an extent that the President of his own initiative intervened.  millionaire, and informed him that he would hold him responsible for the strike, and that unless ib was terminated by reference to arbitration, the armies of the United States would take possession of the field of struggle. What was the consequence? As the result thoughtof his intervention, Mr Morgan communicated with the coal-owners as well as with the workmen and compelled them to enterprise. submit their case to arbitration- a course which they had refused to adopt for months previously. In that case arbitration was forced upon the employers as well as upon the workmen, even infcheabsence of an arbitration law. Ear better is it for us to so legislate that the tribunal which it is proposed to establish can intervene in a legal manner for the prevention of occurI rences of such a serious character. But for the intervention of the President in the manner I have described, it is impossible to predict what might have happened, because practically a state of civil war prevailed. Both parties were at arm's length, and neither evinced the slightest disposition to terminate hostilities, But the strong arm of the Executive inter# vened, and the parties to the. dispute yielded to the intervention of that authority, as typifying law and order, when they declined to yield to the pressure of unorganized public opinion. So much for the 4.200,000 which, according fco the honourable member for Wentworth, a London capitaUst, would be afraid to invest in Australia lest he should be called upon. to appear before a legally-constituted Arbitration Court, empowered to deal with any question as between an employer and employed The honourable member has practically repeated.the contention which was the basis of the speech of the honourable and learned pieraber for Parkes. The chief objection of the latter to this Bill is that it will take the management of business out of the hands of the men who own and conduct it. The honourable and learned member for Parkes declared that during the whole of English history the tendency has been in the direction of individual liberty as against restraints imposed by the State.",59
201,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,The man who says that has been asleep for forty years.,61
202,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"Certainl y he has not studied the lessons of English history, to say nothing of the history of other countries. I need scarcely remind the honourable and learned member for Parkes that the Parliament of England has at various stages of its history asserted its right to intervene in questions of capital as against labour. Need I refer to the celebrated Act known as the Statute of Labourers, which was passed in the reign of Edward III . That is the first Wages Act, perhaps, which is recorded in history. Under dt the Parliament actually regulated the price of labour. That Act was' in force in England up t ill the statutory law revision of 1S26, and it is an interesting example of how the Parliament of England, of which we are an offshoot, has asserted its right to decide even the question of the price of labour. Then again, there is the Statute of Apprentices which was passed in the reign of Elizabeth, and which recognises the customs of certain craft guilds well known to the common law of England, whioh were the prototypes and' predecessors of modern trades unions. Under those guilds the masters were allowed to organize and associate themselves for the purpose of promoting their interests, and to make arrangements for the hours of labour and the number of apprentices to be employed. It is a curious fact that this apprentice question, of which we hear so much in modern times, has been the subject of controversy in England for hundreds of years. One would think from the way in which it is sometimes referred to in the press by well-meaning employers that it was an unparalleled act of tyranny for Parliament to interfere with the regulation of wages and the limitation of apprentices. Yet we find similar Acts right through the whole course of English history. Regarding these craft guilds, I believe that a great deal of the cleverness of English workmen of modern times may be traced back to them. They were the nuclei for the spreading of craft ability in connection with all kinds of trades. At any rate, Parliament, in the reign of Elizabeth, actually legalized the rules of these craft guilds with reference to apprentices. That law remained operative for many years. It is interesting also to be reminded that we may read of such a thing as the mimimum wage in English history. . The first Act relating to this subject.was passed in the reign of Queen Anne, It provided that the mimimum wage of curates should be £ 2 0 a year.",61
203,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,They have never got beyond that sum.',61
204,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"Ye s they have, because in the reign of George III . the mimimum was raised fco £ 8 0 a year. To some honourable members these matters may be considered ancient history, but they are of peculiar interest in these times when we hear the honourable and learned member for Parkes declaringfchafcthis B i ll represents a retrogade movement. In some of our old English laws there was a curious provision to the effectfchafcwhilst the masters and members of the guild could combine to keep up the price of their materials, and to limit the number of - their apprentices, the workmen could not do so. They were not permitted to combine for the purpose of increasing their own wages. Adam Smith mentions 'fchatas a curious instance of antiquated law. He saysl t is not, however, difficult to see which of the two parties must, upon all ordinary occasions, have the advantage in the dispute, and force the other into a compliance with their terms. The masters, being fewer in number, can combine much more easily; and the law besides authorizes, or at least does not prohibit, their combination, while it prohibits those of the workmen. We have no Acts of Parliament against combining to lower the price of work ; but many against combining to raise it. In all such disputes the masters could hold out much longer than the men. These are the views which are put forward by the father of political economy, the author of the Wealth of Nations. at page 50, MCCulloch's edition. But it is gratifying to know that that inequality in the law of England, to which Adam Smith referred, was removed from the Statute-book by the Ac t of 5, George IV . Chapter 59, 1824. By that Act the law prohibiting workmen from combining for lawful purposes-includin g the purpose of obtaining a rise in wages-wa s repealed. That marks the beginning of this new era about which we have heard so much. This Bil l certainly does not do so. It may be traced back through English history to the repeal of that Act. Mr G. B. EDWAKDS - It really started in the time of Moses.",61
205,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown,"""Tho u shalt not steal"" would probably cover it .",62
206,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"Probably . The Trades Union Act of 1871, and the Act of 1876legalized combinations for tradepurposes in England. This was the beginning of the modern legalization of trades unions. By the Employers' Liability Act very valuable concessions were - made to the workmen of England in the shape of provision for compensation in case of accident. But the Employers' Liability and Workmen's Compensation Act of 1897 was certainly an innovation of a most advanced, progressive, and democratic kind. I wonder what would be said if a proposal of that kind were made in Australia ? We should have petitions, no doubt, of the type and character which we have had today from the merchants of New South Wales, protesting against it as an unheard of innovation. We should be told, no doubt, that it would drive capital out of the country, and ruin the future prospects of the Commonwealth. What do we find in conservative England in relation to this measure which was brought in by Mr Chamberlain, a member of a Conservative Government. It introduced an entirely new principle as to the liability of a master to his workmen. It was to the effect that the workmen engaged in certain trades and occupations should have the right to obtain compensation from their employers, whether there was negligence or not, in the case of accident resulting in injury. Under the old law, a workman could not obtain compensation from his master unless there was negligence or some breach of a statutory duty. But now, under this Act, the master is liable to compensate his servant to the extent, I believe, of three years' pay, in case the servant suffers any injury whilst engaged in his employment. It is not necessary for the man to prove negligence, or any'breach of - duty against the master. He is not barred from right of action even if he is guilty of contributory negligence.",62
207,Mr CONROY,Unknown,But if negligence is proved against him he loses his claim.,62
208,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"Accordin g to the English decisions the employer is to insure the safety of his workman from accident in the course of his work. I mention this matter as showing the d r if t of English ' - legislation, which, although not on the lines of this Bill, is at any rate in the same direction. ""The whole trend of it is to ameliorate the condition of the workman, to place him on a footing of security, and bo give him the protection of law. How does this principle square with the principle enunciated by the honourable and learned member for Parkes, and the honourable member for Wentworth, that we should practically leave master and workman to settle their own affairs, and that it is not the duty of the State to intervene? Such a contention is contradictory to the whole course of English legislation, and also to the whole course of Australian legislation. I shall refer now to' some Acts passed in the Victorian Parliament, which I believe led the way in legislation of a liberal character for the relief of workmen from some of the serious disabilities and dangers and harassing conditions under which they formerly laboured. The Regulation of Mines Acts is an enduring legislative monument to the liberalism, not only of the State of Victoria, but of its Parliament. So far back as 1S73, the Regulation of Mines Bill was brought in by the Honourable Angus Mackay, a predecessor of mine in the representation of Sandhurst in the State Parliament. He was a member of a Government which was supposed to contain a number of Conservatives, but that measure was one of the most liberal pieces of legislation, and showed such a sympathy for the working miner that it deserves to be mentioned in a debate of this character. I ought also to mention the names of those who years ago worked on the same lines-wh o laid the foundations for legislation such as this, and rendered it possible. In the Regulation of Mines Act, the Parliament of Victoria prohibited the employment of women and boys in mines, and regulated the working hours of miners. That Act has been adopted by most of the State Legislatures of Australia.",62
209,Mr WILKS,Unknown,It has been adopted in New South Wales.,62
210,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"Yes . How does that Act square with the principle that the State ought not to interferein matters between master and workman ? It has worked well, and although there may have been a few murmurs at that time from timorous employers and mine-owners, who regarded it as an experiment, still, in the light of twenty years' experience, I venture to say with the greatest confidence that no mineowner in Australia would be heard today to take any seriousobjection to its provisions. It is not only operative in the interests of workmen, but in the interests of mine owners, because the owner gets more work out of the miner when the miner works under conditions of safety, conditions of cleanliness, and conditions conducive to health-suc h as good ventilation and security of surroundings, as well as moderate hours. I have been informed by mine managers and owners that a miner working under favourable conditions such as these is able to do more work, and consequently he earns his wages in a much more satisfactory manner than if he were labouring under the old system of ten hours a day, and under conditions of insecurity. I regard the terms of that Act as the germ from which many of the leading provisions of this Bill have been evolved in the gradual process of development. I do not regard this Bill as being purely an experiment, which we should contemplate with doubt or misgivings. It is founded on principles which have already stood the test of time.' We are not in an experimental stage ; we have rather reached the stage of universal approbation. The honourable member for Laanecoorie read a passage from the report of the Victorian Factories Commission-a n impartial tribunal which included several members of the Legislative Council of Vic- | toria, whose disposition would certainly i not be in the direction of democratic legislation unless it - were recommended by experience and had stood the .test of time. We have it stated, in the passage read by the honourable member, that the principle of the New Zealand Ac t has stood the test of time, and is entitled to approbation. This is, therefore, no new era in our social legislation. I regard it merely as a development and an expansion- a new application of principles previously in force. The Victorian Factories Act itself, which instituted wages boards, was a piece of legislation of a pioneer character.",63
211,Mr CONROY,Unknown,Surely not.,63
212,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"It was, undoubtedly.",63
213,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"It was in this State, but it was still a very old principle.",63
214,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"The Act was considered at the time to be experimental; but it has stood the test of experience, and it has in many respects worked very well indeed. The Commission, referring to the Victorian Facbories Acb, pronounced an opinion Which has nob been quobed by the honourable member for Laanecoorie, and I shall take this opportunity to mention it . In referring to the Wages Board system, it said It must be remembered that the Wages Boards were at first constituted to deal with industries in which sweating was rampant, such as the clothing, underclothing, and shirt-making trades. Thej' unquestionably did good work in these, and the fact will always stand to the credit of the system. They said, furtherWe have alreadj' pointed out the defects of their constitution and work, and there is no necessity to go over the ground again. Their powers in many respects ore weak in comparison with conciliation or arbitration tribunals, and consisting, as they do, of direct representatives of employers and employed in each trade, the prospects of methods of conciliation in a dispute are almost hopeless. . . . While, however, all this has to be admitted, we recognise that there canuot, in the circumstances of the time, be nny return to the old conditions of freedom of contract in factory labour. I think that passage embodies the views of the majority of the Legislatures of the Australian States. It embodies the views of the most advanced thinkers in Australia, as well as the most advanced thinkers on social and industrial legislation throughout the world. It is supported by the following passage:The well-being of thousands of wage-earners, with thousands of others dependent on them, rests on a humane, well-conceived, and properlyadmiuistered law for the protection of this kind of labour. It is clearly our duty, therefore, not to destroy the good work already done in the cause of hrmanity and justice, but to so modify and correct the defects which experience has shown to exist that the best principles of our factory legislation may be maintained and extended, although in a different form. This is eloquent testimony. The report of this Commission ought to be a little better known than it is. The services rendered to the cause by the Commission is most valuable; but the ""report, unfortunately, is buried in the vaults of the State Parliament House. It would .be well if the gentlemen in New South Wales, who got up the petition which was presented to the House today by the honourable member ior Wentworth, were supplied with copies of this Bill, and also of that report. It would certainly be an eye-opener to them.",63
215,Mr CONROY,Unknown,Who signed that report ?,64
216,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"It is signed by A . R. Outtrim (President), Geo. Godfrey, Jos. Sternberg, J. F. Levien, Geo. H . Bennett, E. H . Bromley, Harry S. W . Lawson, Edgar Wilkins, and John W. Mason. It would be as well if the petitioners who signed the documents presented today would study that report. If they did, they would find there an answer to the following allegations which they make :Your petitioners respectfully urge that will see fit to delay the further consideration-of this measure until time has been given to those so greatly interested to become acquainted its many provisions, which we fear suggest innovations in the conduct of all classes of manufacture and trade, and which are calculated by their interfering effect upon private enterprise to seriously jeopardize the commercial and industrial fringe future of the Commonwealth. In the report to which I have referred, they would read the conclusions arrived at by a disinterested tribunal appointed by the Victorian Parliament. That tribunal had a free hand, and abundance of time for its investigations, which extended - over twelve months. The Commissioners visited New Zealand, and most of the Australian States in which there was cognate legislation in force, and their verdict is that the legislation upon which this Bill is founded is not of an experimental or doubtful character, but has been found to work fairly well, and to give satisfaction in both New Zealand and New South Wales.",64
217,Mr CONROY,Unknown,The verdict of history is quite a different one:,64
218,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"I prefer to take the report of a disinterested commission rather than the ex pa te statements of either masters or men. We are entitled to regard this report as a document of a judicial character. In referring to New Zealand the Commissioners sayThe New Zealand system seeks by substantial penalties to prevent strikes and lock-outs. tects from tyrannical - discharge or dismissal the worker who lawfully strives to maintain or expand the responsibilities and privileges of his class. But, whilst forbidding unjust dismissal 01: the one hand, it likewise forbids the imprope' stoppage of work by the employee in the event o' an industrial dispute. It is not one-sided. It protects both masters and men. It says to the workman-""Tho u shalt not strike,"" and to the employer, ""Thou shalt not sweat thy workman."" These two new commands have been placed upon the statue-books of at least three of the States, and experience is emphatic and eloquent to .the effect that this legislation has been successful in the prevention of strikes and the mitigation of some of the well-known evils of unrestricted competition. It has been said by the petitioners, and by those who hold similar views, that we should allow unrestricted competition; that we should permit industry to take its .own course. The honourable and learned member for Parkes quoted the well-known dictum of you Mr Herbert Spencer, known as the law of equal freedom. Mr Herbert Spencer sayswith at page 56 of his well-known work, Social serious Statics Abridgedand Revised1 Every man should be free to do that which he Will, provided he does not interfere with or in the equal freedom of any other man. How does that law work out ? In my old university days it was drilled into us, and I remember the reverence with which I used to regard it . But in course of time, when I'had gained more experience, I , like others, came to examine and to analyze it, and I found that, if rigidly applied, it would lead to sweating, to child labour, to involuntary servitude, and even to slavery. Because it says that a man shall be allowed to sweat and to enslave others so long as he does not interfere with the equal freedom of other men to sweat and to enslave. Mr Herbert Spencer has bewailed the interference of the State in the regulation of-factory labour as it affects the employment of women and children and the limitation of hours. He has objected even to sanitary regulations ; to the passing of laws relating to drainage, and the prevention of contagious diseases. He would leave all to competition, and would apply to industrial matters the Darwinian law of the survival of the fittest which obtains in the lower orders of creation. According to his doctrine, human beings should be allowed to struggle and to It profight with one another, and to enslave each other, without the interference of the laws of the State. He saysInterference with the free play of the competitive principle will cau3e immediate or remote danger to the State. The results of the legislation to which I have referred to-night are not shown to have caused the decadence of the industrial life of England, or decline of her national wealth ; nor have they shown loss of trade or repression of enterprise in Australia.",64

222,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"Yes . leave all to the struggle for existence and the survival of the fittest. Withi n certain limits competition is a most healthy principle, but genuine competition is possible only where the competing parties possess a comparative equality of strength. Without equality of strength and of conditions there can be no competition-n o fair competition ---and the weak must be destroyed. It is said by some of our best modern thinkers, however, that the intervention of the State is justified, not only on philosophical, but even on economical grounds ; and that the State may legitimately intervene in order to equalize conditions, and to promote instead of destroying competition. Dr Westall W. Willoughby in his work, The Nature of the State, page 335, states thatWhere the Darwinian law in its application to social man is too cruel or wasteful, or works in any way to destroy those who, from the broad and highest stand-point of race improvement, are best fitted to survive, to that extent the be checked or regulated if possible by the organized effort of society. Dr Burgess, in his Political Science and Constitutional Law, says that It is the primary duty of the State to establish the reign of peace and law, to resist external attack and internal disorder. During the investigations of some of the Victorian Wages Boards many of the masters stated that, personally, tliey had no objection to the increasing of wages in their trades if they were not sure that it would lead to the loss of their export trade, because they would be unable to compete with manufacturers in some other States where there 9B were no Wages Boards. They said-""If the wages of our employees are increased, we shall have to shut up our factories altogether, or else remove to the other States."" I have been informed by a gentleman who presided over at least three Wages Boards that overwhelming evidence was given to that effect. The employers objected to the intervention of the State until the introduction of Inter-State legislation, or the bringing about of uniformity of wages. They said that they did not object to the raising of wages if the employers of all the States were compelled to adopt the same standard. But what is their contention now? I invite honourable members to read the circular which has been issued by the Inter-State , Conference of the Chambers of Manufactures of all the States, held in Melbourne He would on the l l t h and 12th of this month. No resolution was passed at that Conference objecting to the principle of arbitration for the settlement of industrial disputes. The attitude the Conference took was that, as these disputes involve matters appertaining wholly to State legislation, there is no need for the intervention of the Eederal authority. While, a few years ago, the Victorian manufacturers were asking for an Inter - State law, and urging the State authority to postpone action until there was a Federal law and uniformity of conditions, they say now- "" Leave us to the State law. Do not let the Federal authority interfere."" That is an inconsistent attitude. They complain, too, of the possibility of being liable to two awards. They say that they may be compelled to comply with the award of the State board, and that upon the top of that - award they may have to obey the award of the Commonwealth Court. I think it would be as well if they law is to could receive an authoritative assurance that they will not, under any circumstances, be required to comply with two awards. It would be absurd if they had to do so. They could only be liable to obey the award of the Federal Court acting within the scope of its jurisdiction.",65
223,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Of course the award eould Vie varied according to the locality, if necessary. If the Federal Court found an award existing in any State, they could allow it to stand for, say, twelve months.",65
224,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"That brings me to the constitutional aspect of this question. The view I take of the constitutional power we possess is this : I believe that this Parliament has power to deal only with what may be described as Inter-State disputes, or disputes which extend over more than one State. I do not agree with the view that this Federal power may be exercised in such a way as I have seen suggested, namely, that some little dispute existing in one State mightbe made the basis bf Federal jurisdiction, because of the mere possibility of the dispute ultimately extending beyond the State. I think that in such a case the Federal Court to be created by the Bill would not have any jurisdiction. In order to give the Court jurisdiction certain facts must be presented, showing, either that a dispute extending beyond the limits of any one State actually exists, or that there are certain facts which prove reasonably, and almost conclusively, that a strike which will extend over at least two States is imminent. The mere existence of a dispute in one State would not be sufficient to give jurisdiction. I do not think that the Court could give itself jurisdiction merely by its own finding, unless there were facts which would justify that finding. The Court would not be able to give itself jurisdiction by a fiction, by finding facts which did exist, or merely by the issue of a certificate by the Registrar. The honourable member for Wentworth complained that the certificate of the Registrar was to be primd Jacie evidence of a dispute within the meaning of the Act, but, as I interjected, that would be merely prima facie, it would not be conclusive. I apprehend that it would be the duty of the Court to enter upon an inquiry, and. ascertain whether there were sufficient facts to give it jurisdiction. It would never do to allow the Court to give itself jurisdiction by finding facts which would not be examinable by a higher tribunal. I believe that if the Court found as a fact that there was a dispute within the meaning of the Act, and it turned out, after further investigation, that there was no dispute within the meaning of the Act, its finding could be set aside and quashed by the High Court. All inferior Courts which exesed their jurisdiction are liable to have their finding upset by the superior Court, so that a safeguard against any overlapping or duplication of award or usurpation of jurisdiction by the Arbitration Court will be afforded by the High Court, which will have control over all the inferior Courts. If the Court of Arbitration should exceed its constitutional power its finding would be liable to be set aside. It is contended that the mere existence of a dispute in any one State might be sufficient to give the Court jurisdiction, because the Federal authority gives the power of prevention, which might be so utilized as to give jurisdiction over a dispute in one State, merely because it might possibly spread into another. I think that the Federal power of prevention may be. interpreted in this way. Take the case of the Seamen's Union and the Steamship Owners' Federation at the present time. They represent industrial organizations whose operations extend continuously over at least two or more States. That is a fair case to take, in order to illustrate my view of the power of prevention, l t is well known that the existing agreement is almost at an end, and that neither party will approachtheotherforthepurposeof negotiating a new agreement. They are almost challenging each other. The employers are saying- "" Why do you not approach us with a suggestion?"" and the seamen are refusing to make any Suggestion. At present, no dispute exists between these bodies. There is no disagreement, because, on the one hand, no proposition has been made, and, on the other, no proposition has been rejected. A dispute means a disagreement or a controversy, so that, in my opinion, there is no dispute within the meaning of the Act. Now, the power of prevention of the Arbitration Court might be exercised in this way : Either the seamen on the one hand, or the employers on the other, might say"" We refuse to approach the other side, and we shall go into the Arbitration Court and ask it to undertake a settlement of the question of wages between us in anticipation of a dispute."" . There is no dispute and no controversy, but in order to prevent a dispute arising-in order to prevent matters reaching that stage-eithe r party would have the power to ask the Court to cause the other side to be summoned, and to exercise its jurisdiction by settling the rate of wages, and thus preventing a dispute. That is my interpretation of the power of prevention; namely, the power of intervention between the employer and the employed before they have arrived - at the stage of disagreement. That is a solution of the constitutional problem which, I think, is preferable to the view that the Federal authority has the right to intervene simply 'because there is an industrial dispute in one State and before it has extended to another. Whilst wo aro disposed to view this question.with the greatest amount of generosity, with the greatest desire to give effect to the legal power to prevent disputes, I think that we ought to confine ourselves strictly within the limits of the Constitution. Ko desire should be exhibited to exceed those limits. Whilst we are to some extent groping in the dark to ascertain the exact extent of our powers, we should be careful to limit the operation of this Bill to industrial disputes which unquestionably extend from one State into another. If wo do that, there can be no ground for complaint, as is alleged in the circular of the Employers' Union, that this Federal power is being utilized for the purpose of settling disputes which properly come within the jurisdiction of the States authorities. I do not think that this House has any desire to usurp powers which can be efficiently exercised by the States Parliaments. I believe that the Victorian Parliament is quite able to legislate for the prevention of industrial disputes within its own borders, and the same remark is applicable to the other States. Let us confine our efforts to the settlement of disputes which unquestionably are of an Inter-State character. If we do so I believe that we shall serve a very useful purpose. We shall remove complaints such as those made to the'Victorian Boards before the possibility of Federal legislation upon the subjoct became apparent. At the same time, our aotion will tend towards bringing about uniform conditions as to wages and labour which are most desirable in the case of industries that are common to two or more States. The result will be to conserve the interests of those whose capital isinvested in industrial enterprises, and also to benefit the workmen. We shall thus exercise our Federal power in a manner which will disappoint those croakers who aro now indulging in prophecies of ruin and disaster. They are only repeating the old forebodings of Herbert Spencer, and of the old advocates of Darwinianism in politico, which have not-been fulfilled. On the contrary, it has been conclusively proved that wherever this liberal legislation has been adopted in English-speaking communities it has been fairly utilized, both by employers and employee's. It has tended rather to the encouragement of 9 Bz enterprise, affording security to workmen and employer, tending to the amelioration of the conditions of the people, and adding an impulse to civilization generally.
