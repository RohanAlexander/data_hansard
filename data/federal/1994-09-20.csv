1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Stephen Martin) took the chair at 12.30 p.m., and read prayers. NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional",11
2,Mr LAVARCB,BUSINESS,"Dickson-Attorney General) (12.30 p.m.}-I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the routine of business for Tuesday, 20 September 1994, being as follows, unless otherwise ordered: 1. Notices and orders of the day. 2. Questions without notice (at 2.30 p.m.). 3. Presentation of papers. 4. Ministerial statements, by leave. S. Matter of public importance. 6. Notices and orders of the day. I understand that this motion is to rearrange some of the routine of government business, particularly to move forward question time to 2.30 p.m. so that ministers involved in the ceremonies associated with the visit to Australia of Mr Reynolds, the Prime Minister of Ireland, can attend to that business. Question resolved in the affirmative. AT SIC AMENDMENT (INDIGENOUS NA FUND) BILL 1994 Consideration in Detail Clause 3. Consideration resumed from 19 September.",11
3,Mrs GALLUS,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,Hindmarsh) (12.32 p.m.)I return to amendment No. 13. Overnight I have had a chance to have a look at the minister's comments on the amendment and I say again how disappointed I am in the approach the minister has taken to this amendment. I also refer the minister to a radio interview that took place last night on 3LO on this very amendment. I would like to quote to the minister what was said by the Aboriginal person who has a regular time spot on 3LO on Monday nights in reference toMr Tickner-Who was this?,11
4,Mrs GALLUS,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,It was an ATSIC councillor. The minister might like to look up which particular ATSIC councillor. Mr TIckner interjecting,11
5,Mrs GALLUS,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"The minister is asking questions across the table which I would Orders prefer not to answer at this time, but I would be very happy to talk to the minister privately. If the minister wishes to know, the name of the counciIIor is Sharon Firebrace. The interview was about the indigenous land fund. In reply to a question about the amendment. we are discussing today, the amendment which the minister said had no support from Aboriginal people, Sharon said, 'It is vital that the bill must have this amendment in it.' So much for this minister claiming that nobody in the Aboriginal community wants these amendments. What the minister means is that the people he has talked to and the people he is getting to act on his behalf do not want this amendment. May I say how disappointed I was in the minister's trying to raise controversy over these amendments when on Sunday he sent to the press his own press release calling for the total support of the coalition on this fund and at the same time orchestrated several Aboriginal groups to send almost identical press releases. What does this say about the minister's approach to this amendment? Does the minister really want to set Aboriginal person against Aboriginal person, saying that these Aboriginal people support the government and these Aboriginal people support the opposition? I say to the minister: if that is the sort of game he really wants to play, it is not in the interests of the Aboriginal people and it is not in the interests of the wider Australian community, which is looking for reconciliation on this issue, which genuinely wants reconciliation and which does not want to see the government playing politics at the expense of the Aboriginal community. I turn to some of the quite interesting points the minister raised in his speech yesterday. He said: ... the coalition again seeks to fetter, constrain and restrict the board of the Indigenous Land Corporation. Yet it was this very minister who, when the coalition tried to widen the debate on this issue, said that we were acting against the interests of Aboriginal people. When the coalition put forward an amendment which would widen the powers of the Indigenous Land Corporation, what did the minister say? The minister said, 'You can't do this.' But on this amendment, the minister accuses us of trying to fetter the ILC. So what is an argument from the minister on one of these amendments turns out to be an opposite argument on another amendment. I tum to the second of the minister's arguments. Yesterday, he said: Conversely, it may be that there are areas which are owned under native title and can be proven before the Native Title Tribunal which are of great cultural significance, but which may be of relatively little economic development potential for that community. (TIme expired)",11
6,Mr ROBERT BROWN,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"I think this amendment indicates better than any other the nature of the fraud that is involved in the amendments generally that are being moved to this legislation. I refer to a comment that was made by Mike Seccombe in the Sydney Morning Herald a few days ago. He said: The National Party opposes the whole idea that is, of the land fundSo do a lot of the Liberal Right. But to try to maintain some pretence of progressiveness, the Libs are persevering with the fiction that they only to amend it. That is, of course, the objective of the opposition in this matter. As I have said, this particular amendment, better than any of the others, gives evidence of that. It refers to the need to give priority in the purchase of certain land, the need to ensure that certain land is not acquired. That reflects in the first place quite a clear lack of confidence in the proposed Indigenous Land Corporation and the responsibilities that the land corporation will have in fulfilling its tasks under that legislation. But even more important is the last reference, to the need to give the upgrading of Aboriginal pastoral property priority. That is a completely different issue, as the opposition well knows. This legislation is concerned with setting up a fund to make it possible for land to be purchased for those Aboriginal people who have been so dispossessed that they can no longer now indicate or prove any continuing association with the land on which they currently live or any land with which they may have had some previous relationship over the last 60,000 years. That is the purpose of this legislation. I suppose one would almost feel excused in showing some sympathy for the opposition, knowing the very serious disability that it operates under in connection with these amendments. The most serious disability is the fact that the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) is the shadow minister. We well recall the fiasco just recently when, in connection with issues of this kind, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) had a tour through the Northern Territory. He took with him the shadow minister to act as his adviser. The tour turned into a fiasco and that had the effect of turning the Leader of the Opposition into a figure of ridicule as far as Australia was concerned. It was also this shadow minister who bravely asserted in connection with this issue and this legislation, after she was appointed as shadow minister, that she would be supporting the land fund and she would swing the opposition. They swung her. The shadow minister was soon pulled into line by the Leader of the Opposition. She want went to water. I said yesterday that there was a possibility of her, depending upon the elements of goodwill on the part of the opposition, being able to carry the opposition on this matter. She has shown no courage and no competence. She has become a joke as far as her responsibilities are concerned. Yesterday, when we had a group of national Aboriginal Australian leaders sitting in the gallery, she deliberately offended them. One of them was the Deputy Chairperson of ATSIC, Charles Perkins. The reason she offended and insulted the people in the gallery-they were in a position where they could not respond-was that the minister quite courteously acknowledged their presence with a smile. She used that as an opportunity to insult and offend them. She has no more likelihood of surviving in her position than the Leader of the Opposition does. She is incompetent. She is a failure. The best thing for her to do is to save herself and the opposition any further embarrassment by resigning from her shadow portfolio.",12
7,Mrs GALLUS,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"Hindmarsh) (12.41 p.m.)I think the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) was offended yesterday when I said that he had passed his use-by date. We have had some sort of reaction by the honourable member for Charlton. I am sorry that he was offended. I am glad that he got to his feet because, in doing so, he has supported our amendment. It seems that he is a little confused, but even in his confusion we are grateful for his support of our amendment. This fund is meant for people who have been dispossessed and who cannot claim under native title. I thank him for his support. He is a little confused in that he does not realise that the government's own bill directs funds to the upgrading and maintenance of properties. In questioning that, he is questioning his own bill. The honourable member keeps saying that we are opposed to the land fund bill, which shows that he has not followed the debate. I refer him to the speech of his own Prime Minister (Mr Keating)-I quoted this yesterday but I will quote it again-in which he says: In the event, the veracity of the opposition's claims of concern for indigenous people will be tested by two events-the vote on the second reading in the House of Representatives ... What did the coalition do when voting on the motion for the second reading? There were no dissenting votes, which showed our support at the second reading stage. If the honourable member wishes to come into this House and enter the debate, first of all, he should read his own government's bill and, secondly, he should follow the debate to see what has been said by the minister and the Prime Minister. If he did so, he would not continue to make such an absolute fool of himself.",13
8,Mr ROBERT BROWN,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"It is important for us to understand the motivation behind amendments of this kind so that we can better assess the value which they mayor may not contribute to the legislation finally. The government has made it clear that it does not and will not accept these amendments. To a very large extent, this exercise must involve, as it does, a filibuster by the opposition in an attempt to ensure that the legislation is delayed for as long as possible. This bill will pass through this chamber as soon as we have disposed of these amendments, as the opposition knows. It will then go to the Senate. It is the intention of the opposition in the Senate to refer the bill, as it has said, to a Senate select committee for. consideration, despite the fact that for hours and days this chamber has given detailed consideration to the proposed amendments which the opposition has brought forward. There is one other point I want to make in connection with this matter: the legislation provides for funds to be made available for the purchase of land, under the provisions of this legislation, 30 days after royal assent. Let that not go unnoticed: 30 days after the legislation is given assent the funds will be made available; so that for every day the opposition continues to delay this legislation the funds will not be available and those most seriously dispossessed Aboriginal people who would benefit from the application of this legislation will not be given an opportunity to do so. I think it is relevant as well for us to recent acknowledge the fact that the shadow minister has found it necessary to have with her all the time the member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan). She is supposed to be the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs; she is supposed to be able to act as an adviser to the opposition. But she has had her hand held by the honourable member for Barker on every occasion that we have given consideration to this matter. The honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) is one of the best informed members of the opposition in connection with Aboriginal affairs. He is one of the most genuine and committed; and he is a former shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs. It is the honourable member for Aston who, in connection with these amendments, should be at the dispatch box looking after the interests of the opposition. He would do it with some level of competence.",13
9,Mr MCLACHLAN,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"I notice that the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) has accused us of delaying procedures here. In fact, he has spoken on this issue more often than even his minister. Mr Robert Brown-Not so.",14
10,Mr MCLACHLAN,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,We will add them up. Mr Robert Brown-I have interjected more frequently.,14
11,Mr MCLACHLAN,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"No-one, I suggest, has raised the decibel level here more than the member for Charlton has. I suggest that he take a leaf out of the Speaker's book; he has now reduced his decibel level and I am hoping that that will be a permanent change in this chamber. I will raise two points. One is that the member for Charlton said the last time we were in this chamber on this matter-and said again today-that this land fund was supposed to be for those Aboriginals who were so dispossessed of their previous land that they were not able to acquire title under the Native Title Act. Not only did he say that but it was stated on page 3 of the preamble to the Native Title Bill. It says: It is also important to recognise that many Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders, because they have been dispossessed of their traditional lands, will be unable to assert native title interests and that a special fund needs to be established to assist them to acquire land. In other words, when we put in an amendment which says exactly that, no matter what, those opposite will disagree with it. The member for Charlton said that just a minute ago. He said, 'No matter what it is, we the government are going to oppose it.' It does not matter what amendment we put here-the government will oppose it. We know why the government could not put this clause in the bill. The minister, the government and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) were telling us that all these claims under the Native Title Act would be quickly fixed. The fact is that if we do not know who is going to get native title, because the claims will go on and on with court case after court case and decision after decision, we cannot acquire land under an acquisition fund for those people who are not going to get some benefit from native title. The government had to change its whole tack because its arrangements under the Native Title Act have turned out to be hopelessly inefficient and are not going to work. So it is terrible hypocrisy of this government to say that it is against the first clause of our amendment-that is exactly what it said in the Native Title Bill explanatory memorandum. I will read it again. It states: Recognising that many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people will be unable to secure native title and to benefit directly from the High Court decision, the Bill establishes a National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund. Clause 192 of the bill was principally devoted to the acquisition of land. Of course, when we put forward that simple clause, in almost your own words, you will oppose it because you will oppose anything we suggest, however good it is or however much you might in fact have approved of it in times past.",14
12,Mr TICKNER,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"Hughes-Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs) (12.50 p.m.)-I understand that this is one of the amendments the coalition is going to call a division on. Therefore, it is appropriate that I respond to at least some of the things that have been said in the course of this debate. I rights and must say, we have had a very revealing contribution from the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan). In that contribution we saw yet again the strident opposition of a very senior coalition front bench member to the Native Title Act. The rest of the world knows that those in the coalition who determine Aboriginal affairs policy are the people who have contributed very much to this debate. The honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) is well known for his sympathy for the Aboriginal cause. The member for Barker, only a matter of four months ago, went on the public record and gave an ironclad commitment not only that the Native Title Act would be repealed but also that the land fund bill would not be supported. The member for Barker cannot deny that. He has always been opposed to the land fund and he got his way because the coalition has adopted a policy that simply leaves the government no alternative but to proceed with its bill. These are not genuine amendments. They are not amendments that have been put forward by the coalition in any attempt to improve the bill. Let me record the history of the government's attempts to get the land fund package right as a negotiated outcome. Firstly, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) wrote to the former Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), a matter of four or five months ago. The Prime Minister also wrote to the state and territory leaders, to the National Farmers Federation and to other industry bodies because he, like the of the government, wanted to get the best bill. Despite that letter to the coalition, no response was forthcoming. Again, when the legislation was introduced into the House of Representatives not two weeks ago, not three weeks ago, not a month ago, but two months ago, the Prime Minister wrote again to the new Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) and invited him, in a spirit of goodwill and cross-party cooperation, to put forward proposals for improvements to the bill. Not only was there not a reply over that period of weeks and months, but it was in fact at the eleventh hour, when the bill be debated in the House of Representatives, that members in this chamber were seeking to get information about the coalition amendments. What we got was a cobbled together version of some amendments that were first described by the coalition as a refocus of the bill with significant amendments. If we search the public record, we will see that that is the case. We now find that on the ABC radio program Australia Talks Back, the shadow minister described the amendments as 'some slight changes'. Only one week ago she described the amendments in their totality as 'very slight'. Given that, by the coalition's mission, these are very slight amendments, will the coalition support the bill when it comes to a vote in the House of Representatives? The available information we have suggests that at least some members of the coalition, including members of the front-bench, would like to do just that. This morning's Daily Telegraph Mirror reports: Several senior Liberal MPs are ""angry and dismayed"" over Opposition Leader Alexander Downer's staunch refusal to back the Aboriginal land fund. Well may they be angry and dismayed! Twenty years ago in this chamber Sir Billy Snedden-and before him Sir William MCMahon-speaking for the coalition of yesteryear was prepared to support land acquisition by Aboriginal people. In 1974 a fund was established with the rest unanimous support of this parliament. That fund was the fledgling effort of the Commonwealth to address the position and rights of dispossessed people. Twenty years on we find that the coalition has turned back the clock: it will not support the government's bill. These so-called amendments are just a smokescreen to hide that strident opposition. When the legislation goes to the Senate there will be more amendments and an attempt to establish a Senate inquiry-every trick in the book will be used to try to stop this legislation. (TIme expired)",14
13,Mr MCLACHLAN,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"Barker) (12.55 p.m.)I really cannot let that ridiculous tirade pass was to without making a comment or two. The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) is saying that we, on this side of the House, are standing in the way of land acquisition for Aboriginals. I think the minister comes from New South Wales. I do not recall how much land has been provided to Aboriginals by successive New South Wales governments, but my guess is that it is of the order of the size of one sheep station. Twenty per cent of the land of my state has been provided for Aboriginals, and more will eventuate. That land has been provided by the state government. The hypocrisy that comes out of Victoria own adand New South Wales on this matter of looking after Aboriginals is starting to annoy me somewhat. The state from which the minister emanates has not provided land worth a damn to Aboriginals-and Victoria has provided less. One cannot even measure it; it is not statistically measurable on any piece of paper that one can get from a Victorian government department. So this business of standing up here and blatantly telling what is not true-that is, that the party on our side of the House has not been providing land for Aboriginals-is wrong. Mr Tickner-In this place.",15
14,Mr MCLACHLAN,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"Are you saying that it was never provided in the territory under a Liberal government? If you are, you had better check that as well. Mr Tickner-This is a debate about national government policy.",16
15,Mr MCLACHLAN,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"Okay. Are we now just correcting it a bit? That is fair enough. Let me just point out to the minister that the amount of land provided by governments of both political persuasions in Western Australia-which is one of the states much accused by the minister-would look like the Pacific Ocean when compared with the amount provided in New South Wales. For the minister to get up here, bleed his heart all over the floor of this chamber and not tell the truth is starting to annoy some of us to the point where we will have to do something about it publicly. The minister generalises every time he gets on the radio and raises these sorts of issues. The shadow minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs and I are simply asking the minister to look at the amendment. The honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) has already said that he agrees with amendment No. 1. In fact, he gave a rather heated dissertation on the subject. Amendment No.2 simply expands amendment No. 1 and I cannot see how anybody could possibly disagree with amendment No.3. The fact of the matter is that this minister has been told by the Prime Minister (Mr KeatiTlg)-and the minister knows that this is true-who most certainly has never read and does not have the slightest intention of reading the amendments, to oppose all these amendments.",16
16,Mr ROBERT BROWN,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"It is important that we keep in mind the particular amendment with which we are dealing. The honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) and the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) have made claims in connection with our response to this and other proposed amendments that simply cannot be substantiated. It is quite clear that there are two essential elements of the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill, the first being the land acquisition function and the second being the land management function. Those opposite are attempting to claim that paragraph (t), which amendment No. 13 seeks to add to proposed subsection 191N(2), is designed in some way to complement or to improve the land management function. It does no such thing. The land management function within the context of this legislation is able to stand by itself. This part of the amendment suggests that, within the context of the national indigenous land strategy, there is: the need to give the upgrading of Aboriginal pastoral properties priority over the acquisition of land in areas where there are already substantial land holdings by Aboriginal people or corporations. That proposal does a number of things. The first thing it does is deliberately confuse the purpose of this legislation and particularly the provision in this legislation for land management considerations. The second thing it does is give credence to the claim made by the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) earlier in the debate on another amendment when he said the real intent of the opposition is that the land should be used productively. That is an important provision. We would not retreat from that, but there are other considerations as well. In the context of proposed new paragraph (t), how would it be possible for the Indigenous Land Corporation to deal with a critical and important sacred site in an area where there are already substantialland holdings by Aboriginal people or corporations? How would it be possible for the Indigenous Land Corporation in a physical situation to give consideration to the purchase of land on which Aboriginals are actually living? I do not know where these proposals came from, but when we make the claimand this claim is echoed by people around Australia-that this is a deliberate ploy on the part of the opposition to delay, to frustrate, to circumvent and to damage this legislation we make it on good grounds. The honourable member for Barker made an interesting point in his most recent contribution to this debate on this amendment. When defending South Australia, he said that 20 per cent of the state had been made available to Aboriginal people. Let it be clearly seen on the record that this accords with the claim made by a member of the National Party some time ago that Aboriginal Australians, who represent something like three per cent of the Australian population, have ownership of about 17 per cent of Australia. It is said that a disproportionate area of Australia is under their ownership and control. We all know what that land is. If it was any good they would not have been allowed to keep it. The most productive areas, the coastal areas, the fishing areas and the areas where settlement was possible were acquired and alienated by European Australians. We left Aboriginal people in the desert. We left them 17 per cent of Australia. Everyone knows that South Australia is essentially a desert state. The 20 per cent of South Australia that the Aboriginal people have been allowed to have, acquire or keep is obviously the worse part of the desert. I bet they are not grazing many stock per hectare. That claim is a deliberate attempt to misrepresent the situation and make it appear that Aboriginal Australians in some way have been given a fair deal with land. They have not.",16
17,Mrs GALLUS,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,I will not waste any time answering the claims of the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) because the things he is saying are becoming quite a joke and not worth replying to. I would like to put the record straight about one point because it concerns me that the wrong impression has been given. The member for Charlton said that I had offended some Aboriginal people in the gallery by my comments. Mr Robert Brown-You insulted them.,17
18,Mrs GALLUS,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"That I 'insulted them', using the words of the member who insists on yelling across the House. I will give a direct quote from Hansard as to what actually took place. I said: I also realise that the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) is playing incredible politics, especially to the gallery in which, I notice, there are members of the Aboriginal community. After the minister interjected by saying that he did not know they were there, I went on to say: Why would you be nodding to them if you did not . know they were there? How that could be taken as an insult to the members of the Aboriginal community, I do not know. But I want to clarify the record by giving the absolute assurance that there was never any insult intended to any member of the Aboriginal community, and the only insult perhaps that was intended concerned the behaviour of this minister, who has promoted division. I would now like to address my comments to the minister, who unfortunately is engaged in another conversation. I would like him to listen to what I have to say. Minister, you know very well that the divisiveness of this debate need not have gone on and that I came to you and said, 'Yes, we will give you in principle support for this fund, but I would like you to come back to us and have a look at our amendments.' This was an olive branch. You could have rung me up and said, 'Okay, Chris, let us sit down and discuss these amendments.' If you had been genuine, that is what you would have done. You may not have agreed with the amendments; we may not have been able to come to an agreement on some of them. But when that was all done it would have been seen by the population that, although the coalition and the government disagreed on some of the amendments, their goal was a united one and was for the benefit of the Aboriginal people. But this minister deliberately and utterly took the decision to play politics. Despite the fact that he goes around the country calling for bipartisanship, when bipartisanship is offered he turns his back and says, 'No, we will play politics.' He has played politics from the very beginning. I have referred before to the minister's efforts. He sent out letters to the churches saying to them, 'I urge you to urge the coalition to support the land fund.' Did he come to the shadow minister and say, 'Let's sit down and talk about how we can get together on this. '? No, he did not. He sent letters straight to the churches. At the weekend he sent out press releases saying, 'I urge the coalition to come out and support it fully,' which we had done, I might say, in the second reading debate. Did the minister send that press release to me? Did he phone me up? No, he sent that press release to the press and then he got the Aboriginal people to send the same one. Did it appear in the press? I got phone calls from members of the press, and they were laughing at these efforts of the minister who unfortunately has soiled his own reputation in this debate because he can no longer go around the country, as he has been doing, claiming bipartisanship. I have been very disappointed in the minister. I was disappointed in the minister when I attended a meeting of the Central Land Council where I heard him take credit for what bipartisanship had been achieved under the previous Prime Minister, Prime Minister Hawke. I heard the minister say, 'I did this. I achieved this. I got bipartisanship.' Did I once hear the minister refer to the coalition's previous shadow minister, the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), and give him credit? Not one word was mentioned of the honourable member for Chisholm, who had worked so hard. There was not one mention of credit to the member for Chisholm, but when the government was asked why it had not done certain things, do you know what the reason was? It was, 'The coalition won't let us.' Every time this minister gets on his feet he cannot resist mentioning the coalition, and he mentioned it in such an inappropriate place as a meeting of the reconciliation council which was being videotaped and at which everyone was being non-political except the minister, who stood up and mentioned the coalition. (Time expired)",17
19,Mr TICKNER,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"Hughes-Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs) (1.09 p.m.)-I simply rise to tell the shadow minister, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), that she did not even know where she was. She was not at a meeting of the Central Land Council; she was at a meeting of the ATSIC regional councils in central Australia.",18
20,Mr WAKELIN,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"I heard the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) dispute the claim that 20 per cent of South Australia is available to Aboriginal people. As that area is in my electorate, I want to make the point that it is not poor land; it is the land on which the Aboriginal people have lived for thousands of years; it is their land. Many Aboriginals criticise this legislation because, under the current land rights act which is administered by the state government, they no longer have access to that land in a way which is culturally appropriate to them and which would allow them to move into the 21st century with appropriate economic benefits. I stress to the minister and to the honourable member for Charlton that much of the Pitjantjatjara land is recognised as some of the best cattle country in Australia. It is certainly pastoral land; nevertheless, it is excellent cattle country. Part of it receives an average rainfall of 14 inches per annum, and in the previous 12 months it has received up to 22 inches of rain. So it is absolutely magnificent country. What is more important-and of cultural significance-is that it is the natural home of so many of our indigenous people. To say that we have not given them a fair deal or otherwise is inappropriate. In effect, we have quite rightly given them access to their own land; however, they do not have sufficient freedom to manage it in a way which many of them would like.",18
21,Mrs GALLUS,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"I wish to make some pertinent points about our proposed amendment to the bill. Firstly, the amendment that the coalition has put forward was exactly the reason that the land fund was mentioned by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). Earlier in the debate I quoted from a letter that the Prime Minister wrote to Marshall Perron in the Northern Territory. He said that the land fund is for Aboriginal people who cannot benefit under the Native Title Act. This amendment will simply add to this bill that very important goal which all Aboriginal people thought would appear in the bill. It has been supported by Aboriginal people as recently as last night on the ABC. Mr Tickner-By one.",18
22,Mrs GALLUS,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,By an ATSIC councillor and other Aboriginal people around the country who believed that this bill was for those people who cannot benefit from the Native Title Act. Last night on the radio I said that I have talked to Aboriginal people throughout Australia who have not had the benefit of reading this legislation. They understood that the land fund was for those Aboriginal people who had been dispossessed and who could not claim under the Native Title Act or under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. That is the pertinent point of this amendment. The minister has not been able to argue against it because the Prime Minister's words stand in stark contrast to what the minister has been saying. That is the essence of this amendment which the minister will not even discuss.,19
23,Mr ROBERT BROWN,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"I cannot allow the shadow minister to get away with this. Everyone knows that this effort on the part of the opposition is fraudulent. The purposes are not to improve the legislation; the purposes are to destroy the legislation. The shadow minister has indicated on the record that she did not discuss the opposition's proposed amendments with the Aboriginal community. As she just indicated, she gets her information about Aboriginal attitudes from the television. She then misrepresents the response of the Aboriginal people by referring to the comments of one ATSIC commissioner. She claims that what that one ATSIC commissioner has said represents the interests and the attitudes of Aboriginals right across Australia. It does not. The attempt by the shadow minister to misrepresent these circumstances brings to her no credit.",19
24,Mr MCLACHLAN,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"I do not want to break the record of the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), who has now spoken 15 times on the bill. He has just misrepresented the shadow minister's position who, in the time that she has had this position, has been assiduous in getting around the Aboriginal industry and making sure that she listens to its views. To make sure the minister understands that not everybody in the Aboriginal industry is with him, I will quote from a paper that was put out in Western Australia called 'The Lawman's Vision'. There were quite a lot of rather revealing things said in that paper. One was about the gas pipeline company. Amongst other things, the paper said: An office has been established by the gas pipeline company to study sacred sites along the route. It then disagreed with the people who have made much of the sacred sites. It continues: All authority is hereby withdrawn from land councils and other self-appointed bodies. Let all Australians know that these organisations do not speak for the tribal lawmen or their people. That was signed by Arnold Franks and Billy Dunn on behalf of a number of Aboriginals who totally disagree with the minister. I can tell the minister that there are some more people in the Pitjantjatjara lands who disagree with the general thrust of what he has been doing. So please do not stand up here and try to represent the position that you are speaking for all Aboriginals because, increasingly, as your Native Title Act falls to pieces under the weightMr Tickner-You can't help yourself, can you!",19
25,Mr MCLACHLAN,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"I cannot because it is so dreadful. I really cannot help myself talking about the Native Title Bill, which necessitated 200 amendments. While we are on the subject of those amendments and the timing of these amendments, many of those amendments were brought into the Senate by Senator Gareth Evans as he delivered them! This was the great bill that was going to solve all the problems! You know as well as I do that the Native Title Act is falling into a mess. The other day Mr Justice French was calling for more decisions to decide how he is to administer the Native Title Act. Great stuff! So your great solution is falling asun- Brown, R. 1. der. The problem you will have, which has been really exampled by this amendment and your opposition to this amendment, is that you cannot have a clause in the bill that enables this land acquisition fund to be for those who do not receive benefits under the Native Title Act because we will never know who will get benefits under the Native Title Act-it will go on forever.

26,Mrs GALLUS,PAIRS,"Hindmarsh) (1.28 p.m.)by leave-I move: (14) Clause 3, page II, lines 11-13, omit proposed subsection 191 N(6), substitute the following subsection: Copy to be given to Minister "" '(6) The Indigenous Land Corporation Board must give a copy of the national indigenous land strategy and a copy of any changes it has made to the national indigenous land strategy to the Minister within 2 months of the Board agreeing to the strategy or change.' "". (15) Clause 3, page II, after subsection 191N(6) add the following subsections: Copy to be tabled in each House "" '(7) The Minister must cause a copy of the national indigenous land strategy or of any changes made to the national indigenous land strategy to be presented to each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after the Minister has received the document. National indigenous land strategy etc to be disallowable by either House of Parliament "" '(8) The national indigenous land strategy, and changes made to the national indigenous land strategy, are disallowable instruments for the purposes of section 46A of the Acts Interprefunds tation Act 190 l. Land not to be purchased, moneys not to be distributed etc until after national indigenous land strategy has been tabled etc. "" '(9) The Indigenous Land Corporation must ensure that no land, or interest in land, chased and that no moneys are distributed for the performance of its functions under sections 191D and 191E before the time has expired during which either House may disallow, or be deemed to have disallowed, the national indigenous land strategy and, if the strategy has been disallowed or deemed to have been disallowed by either House, the Corporation must ensure that no land or interest in land is purchased unless and until a new strategy has been prepared and tabled.' "". Amendment No. 14 is a very minor amendment and deals with clause 3, page 11, lines 11-13 of proposed subsection 191N(6). Amendment No. 15 is much more substantial. I refer in particular to parts (7) and (8). The reason for these amendments is simply one of accountability of the ILC. Organisations that have a responsibility for spending public money-and especially organisations that are responsible for providing the best possible benefit to Aboriginal people-should be accountable. Unfortunately, recently we have had in the newspapers distressing accounts of money that has been meant for Aboriginal people going astray and not reaching the communities it has been meant for. Since I have taken on this portfolio, not a week has gone past when I have not received phone calls from members of Aboriginal communities saying, 'We have money that was directed to this community. Something has happened to it. Either it has been misappropriated or for some reason we have not got the money we expected to have because of some sort of failure of administration.· That is distressing to the Aboriginal community but, worse than that, by the time this is reported in the press it is often taken to reflect on the Aboriginal community. So Aboriginals are twice losers: they lose out when their community does not get the money that was earmarked for it; and they lose out when somehow they are deemed to be responsible for it. When Aboriginal people approach me they say, 'Look, we want to get out of this. These must be as accountable as any other fund.' They say, 'To have it any other way is total paternalism.' To think that Aboriginal funds have to be treated in different ways is paternalism. This is why we have moved that the ILC-which is responsible for the grantis puring of this money-put forth a strategy. The ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill 1994 itself gives absolutely no goals to the ILC. It does not say what the goal of the ILC is or what direction it should take. The only thing the bill does in relation to giving direction to the spending of the funds and the investment of the funds while they are waiting to be spent is state that the ILC has to have a national land strategy. But there is no requirement that that nationalland strategy actually be formulated before the ILC goes out and spends funds. It is possible to have the ludicrous situation where the ILC, responsible to Aboriginal communities to spend money on behalf of Aboriginal communities in a logical and sensible wayin a way that assists Aboriginal communities-could go ahead and start the purchase of property or some other strategies before it had drawn up that national strategy. These are important amendments and we wish to add them to the bill.",20
27,Mr TICKNER,PAIRS,"Hughes-Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs) (1.32 p.m.)-I rise to explain why the government is not prepared to accept the amendments. The first amendment proposes to impose a requirement on the Indigenous Land Corporation board to give a copy of its strategy to the minister within two months of the board agreeing to the strategy or making the change. There is a very simple reason why the government does not accept this amendment. It is yet another example of why these cobbled together amendments have been rejected by most key Aboriginal organisations and representatives around the country. The reason the amendment is not accepted is that there already exists a much stronger power in the legislation. I direct the honourwithin able member's attention to clause 191N(6) the bill, which already requires the Indigenous Land Corporation to do this on request. The amendments, therefore, are unnecessary. I the shadow minister on the telephone calling chamber. for reinforcements, and well might she call for the reinforcements because of the paucity of the arguments presented by the coalition in respect of this debate. But there is even a more substantial power conferred on the minister under clause 191M(1) of the bill, which is the general power of the minister to seek information. As wants a copy. the minister who will be responsible for the Indigenous Land Corporation, I have to tell the shadow minister that, if the board took six weeks or two months to furnish me with copy of that key strategy document, I would be very angry. It is a woefully inadequate amendment. As the minister, I will give an undertaking that, pursuant to the power that I will have under clause 191M(1) of the bill, I will be asking the Indigenous Land CorporaIf tion to furnish me with a copy of that strategy forthwith. But it is a power I already have and it is a power that I would use. Therefore, the entire amendment is unnecessary. The second amendment is probably one of the most insidious of the amendments forming part of the coalition package, despite the that they are now being described by the coalition as rather minor. I challenge the opposition-the shadow minister can rise to votes in it. her feet after I have spoken if she wishes to do so-to tell me which other similar organiresent sation has a requirement not only for its strategic documents to be tabled in the parliaat ment but also to confer on a potentially opposition controlled Senate the power disallow the core document that would allow the land fund to function. Is it any wonder that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, most of the key land councils around this country and informed Aboriginal opinion have rejected absolutely this attempt by the coalition to further sabotage this bill by including the clause in the legislation? The fact is that a commercial operation, properly working its charter, should not have its operof ations potentially paralysed by a hostile Senate, especially one motivated by the sort of anti-Aboriginal sentiment we so often see see manifested on the opposition side of the I would also like to emphasise that clause 191R(1) of the bill imposes a mandatory requirement on the Indigenous Land Corporation to make a copy of the national indigenous strategy or the regional indigenous land strategy available to any person who wants one. That is, it would be made available not just to the minister but to any person who What we heard from the shadow minister was a very disappointing smear on Aboriginal people and the issue of public accountability. a The shadow minister said that public accountability in Aboriginal affairs was inadequate. I remind the House that the ATSIC legislation was unanimously supported by this parliament-that includes the shadow minister and the member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan). there is something wrong with that public accountability why did any of you not rise to move some amendments in the course of the debate on the ATSIC legislation? The answer is: because it is the most publicly accountable statutory authority in this country. It should not be the role of the shadow minister to fact smear indigenous people and their organisations every time she rises to her feet just because she happens to think there are a few",21
28,Mrs GALLUS,PAIRS,"I absolutely and totally the line taken by the minister. If he would like to take a look what I said, I said that Aboriginal people have come to me when funds meant for them to have been misappropriated to other areas, often by white bureaucrats-more usually by white bureaucrats. When these people come to me they also say, 'We have rung Robert Tickner's office. We have asked for help from the minister and it has not been forthcoming.' In the points I have made there has been no slur on Aboriginal people. The slur is on this government because Aboriginal people have not got the funds that were meant for them. The minister asked me to list some other organisations that have disallowable instruments. I asked the Parliamentary Library for this information and it sent to my office five pages of disallowable instruments. Under the ATSIC Act of 1989 the disallowable instruments are, I believe, sections 4A, 40, 113, 116, 119, 127C, 130, 138 and 194. Disallowable instruments are not unusual. I reiterate that I resent absolutely the minister's efforts to play politics. Read my words in Hansard and see whether you can find anything that I have said that constitutes a slur on Aboriginal people. The truth is that in this House the only person who has tried to create division and indicate that there is any criticism of Aboriginal people is you and you stand condemned for it.",22
29,Mr SNOWDON,PAIRS,"Northern TerritoryParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training) (1.39 p.m.)-I too heard what was said by the shadow minister. I have to concur with what was said by the minister in his contribution. The second of these two amendments reveals the agenda of the opposition. Using its numbers in the Senate, it wants to be able to frustrate the ambitions of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. That is very clear. I saw an interesting article in one of the newspapers today. It quoted an unnamed frontbencher from the opposition. That frontbencher was lamenting the fact that the opposition was not going to support the land title fund. The article in the Telegraph Mirror by Kim Sweetman states: A key frontbencher yesterday revealed sections the party wanted to support the Government's Aboriginal land acquisition fund legislation. I do not doubt that that is true. Those people in the party recognise, no doubt, the validity of the government's attempts to pass this legislation through this House. They have seen through the tawdry attempts, as the minister has said, of the opposition to frustrate attempts by Aboriginal people to manage their own affairs as they would want them to be managed and as we want them to manage them. The opposition is saying to Aboriginal people, 'You cannot make assessments or judgments. You have to table them in the House and they will be made a disallowable instrument.' That is what the amendment says. The opposition says to them, 'If we do not like the fact that you are going to purchase particular sets of properties around Australia we will disallow it.' Why would the opposition disallow it? It may not like the fact that they happen to be buying into country which it might want other people to purchase. Could it be that? Let us ask ourselves what the motives behind the opposition's approach to this particular issue are. I am not normally a cynical person, but one would have to approach the propositions of the opposition with a degree of cynicism. There is nothing surer than that the government will oppose this amendment, yet the opposition's support for the government's legislation rests on our accommodating its amendments. If the opposition were at all genuine in approaching the issue of the support of the land fund in a bipartisan manner it would see the amendment for what it really is: an attempt to obstruct and subvert the interests of Aboriginal people as represented by the ILC. The shadow minister's saying that Aboriginal people have been ringing her on a regular basis saying that funds have been diverted now takes a slightly different tack. Funds are not being diverted by Aboriginal people; they are being diverted by white bureaucrats. That is not a bad tum, but I suspect that nothing can be proven. They are allegations of misappropriation about which the shadow of minister has no proof, and allegations which she should not raise unless she has some proof. She should not malign people who are working for and on behalf of Aboriginal people through ATSIC. I assume that is the organisation she is talking about because it has the bulk of funds appropriated to Aboriginal people in this country through the federal government's programs. Or is she talking about misappropriation through state government agencies? In that case, she should say so. Let us ask which state governments she is talking about. If we are talking about the use of government funds, if people in this House are saying, 'Let us have a disallowable instrument on the way in which state governments use funds which are made available by the federal government,' then let it come from the opposition. As the minister rightly pointed out, the fact that this is a tawdry political stunt by the opposition. There is no way the government will support these amendments. The shadow minister knows that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) has recently said-I am not sure what they call him these days: Bozo?that if the government does not support these amendments the opposition will not support the legislation.",23
30,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Mr Truss)Order! The honourable member for the Northern Territory should refer to members by their title.,24
31,Mr SNOWDON,PAIRS,I called him the Leader of the Opposition. The fact that other people call him Bozo is no fault of mine.,24
32,Mrs GALLUS,PAIRS,"Hindmarsh) (1.44 p.m.)On a point of clarification, the point of having a disallowable instrument was simply to show that the strategy had been formed. It would not refer to individual parcels of land. The idea is that the strategy would be presented to parliament, the parliament would determine that there was in fact a strategy in place and that that strategy was in accordance with the act. After that, the strategy would be put in place by whatever the ILC determined. That is just a point of clarification.",24
33,Mr GIBSON,PAIRS,"Moreton) (1.44 p.m.)Despite the clarification provided by the shadow minister, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), that is not what her amendment says. Amendment No. 15 is very strongly and vigorously objected to by the government and will be opposed by the government for a very simple reason. The shadow minister might suggest that it is a very innocent proposal, a very innocent process, whereby the land strategy becomes a disallowable instrument, but the fact is that once it becomes a disallowable instrument in this House or in the Senate it can be obstructed or blocked for any reason. The worse part of it is that part of the amendment which proposes a new subsection (8) to make it a disallowable instrument, followed by proposed new subsection (9), which says that no moneys can be expended at all, no purchases of land can be made at all, until a new strategy that is approved by is the House of Representatives and the Senate is put in place. Therefore, it can very easily become a manipulated process whereby the Senate continues to block and block and block, and continues to say, 'This strategy is not acceptable for reason X, reason Y or reason Z.' Meanwhile, no funds are expended and no land is being purchased. I am particularly concerned that the shadow minister once more has raised allegations of misappropriation of funds. Once more, we have the process happening in this parliament where Aboriginal organisations or organisations which are supplying services to Aboriginal communities or groups are accused of misappropriation of funds. This allegation is made continually, particularly in the Senate but also in this House. It was the manner in which Aboriginal debates occurred in this House for eight to 10 years. On every single occasion that those allegations were made and there was a subsequent inquiry by the Auditor-General, by standing committees or by a whole range of other organisations there has never been any shred of evidence to prove the allegations. It is very easy to come into this place and accuse people of misappropriating funds. But those opposite are very silent when the Auditor-General tables a report in this place which says there is no evidence of misappropriation of funds. That is what occurred just recently. The Auditor-General conducted an inquiry into the Northern Land Council. That organisation had been subjected to vicious attack in the Senate, with allegations made about misappropriation and misuse of funds. But when the Auditor-General's office conducted a major inquiry into the Northern Land Council it found no evidence at all of misappropriation of funds. Did any opposition senator who had made those allegations get up in the Senate and say, 'I'm sorry, I was wrong, I apologise for misleading the Senate; I apologise for besmirching the reputations of those people'? No, and it will not happen on this occasion either. It is very easy to bandy about allegations misappropriation of funds but it is not so easy to prove them because in the vast majority of cases they do not exist; there has been no misappropriation of funds. What has often occurred is that particular groups have been unhappy that their proposal has not been funded but another organisation's proposal has been funded. So they ring up opposition members and say, 'Look, organisation X has got this money; we should have got this money. There is some funny business going on. The ATSIC regional councils are rigging this to suit themselves,' and opposition members are falling for that line. They see this some great evidence of misappropriation of funds. As honourable members know, there is never enough money in the pool to satisfy all the communities' needs. That is one of the points that all the regional councils will tell us-that they have 100 submissions for funding and they only have money to fund 15 or 20. Of course, that is always going to be the case. There will always be a greater level of demand than there is funding to support those submissions. But for the shadow minister to accuse the regional councils, the white bureaucrats who run ATSIC or whoever it is that she might be accusing of misappropriating funds because they make deliberate, strategic decisions to fund one organisation over another is a misuse of her role as shadow minister and an abuse of her position as a member of parliament. I believe the shadow minister should not make such allegations in the context of this debate unless she has some evidence to substantiate them. The fact that she receives a few phone calls from a few disgruntled people who were not able to be funded is not evidence of misappropriation and it is no reason to put into this legislation the process of a disallowable instrument. (TIme expired)",24
34,Mrs GALLUS,PAIRS,"Hindmarsh) (1.49 p.m.}-I thank the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) for his very sincere contribution to this debate. It stands in stark contrast to the contribution made by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner). I will take on board what the memof ber for Moreton says because I believe that he sincerely wants to see the controversies taken out of Aboriginal affairs so it can be shown that we are all working towards the same goal. As one aside, I would not want to feel that I had misled the parliament in any way on this matter when I said before that I had in my room what looked like five or six pages of disallowable instruments. In fact, all I have with me at the moment-and I am not sure that this is the total list because it starts with the Telecommunications Act-is three pages of all types of disallowable instruments that as come before the parliament, probably 99.9 per cent of which pass without comment. One that I have picked out, for no good reason, is the Fisheries Act management plans. They are a disallowable instrument, as are all the others on this paper. That is simply to correct something I had said before about the number of pages of disallowable instruments I had. The honourable member for Moreton has made a very valid point. I thought I had made it very clear-if I had not, I will reiterate itthat there is not an accusation against any particular group or anything else. But we do see, with horrible regularity, suggestions in the newspapers of misuse-mismanagement is probably a better word-of funds. In Victoria, Ian Viner has been appointed to investigate some such charges. I think this causes enormous distress to all of us. What we are asking for is that when this strategy is drawn up and given to parliament it be drawn up in such a way that management goes ahead. The management should be clear so that everybody can see, ahead of time, the structure that has been put there so that there is no danger of these accusations and problems occurring. People should know how the organisation is working. They should know that there is a strategy of how government, public and Aboriginal funds will be distributed to the community and they should be able to see how that strategy is working, and that the strategy appears to be like all other disallowable instruments before parliament. I know this House has a very low opinion of the Senate, but to suggest that the Senate would quite maliciously single out this particular strategy for special treatment is perhaps unfair to the other place. If those opposI ite are suggesting that the combination of the Liberal Party, the National Party, the Greens and the Australian Democrats will disallow this instrument, then perhaps there would be something wrong with the way the strategy had been set up. I would then suggest that perhaps it should go back to the Indigenous Land Corporation for a wider strategy to be submitted. But I do not think we can suggest that those in the other place, however misguided they may be, are being deliberately malicious. I think that probably goes beyond the pale.",25
35,Mr ROBERT BROWN,PAIRS,"The shadow minister, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), is not going to be allowed to slide out from under this as she has attempted to. She first of all made a claim that she had five pages of disallowable instruments in her office and now she admits that there are only three. She got a list of disallowable instruments from the Parliamentary Library. She made no request to the library to be provided with a list of similar organisations which have had their strategic documents subject to disallowable instruments. The point that the minister made. I thought he made it admirably and clearly enoughwas that no similar organisation has had its strategic documents made disallowable instruments. So it is part of the fraudulent approach to this whole issue. It is like the claim that was made earlier today about 20 per cent of South Australia being owned by Aboriginal Australians-the implication, of course, being that they have enormous areas of valuable, productive land. It was admitted by the honourable member for Grey (Mr Wakelin) in his response to that question that it is grazing land. Those people are trying to live on it. Mr Dodd-And marginal land.",26
36,Mr ROBERT BROWN,PAIRS,"It is most certainly very marginal land. I said that if it was of any quality it would have been alienated by white Australians some time in the last 200 years. The second point that I want to emphasise is that we must be forgiven if we believe, as have asserted, that the opposition's approach is fraudulent and is designed to filibuster, delay, destroy or damage this legislation because this particular proposal the opposition has brought before the House simply does not make sense within the context of the legislation. The opposition wants to amend proposed subsection 191N(6), which states: The Indigenous Land Corporation Board must give a copy of the national indigenous land strategy to the Minister on request. The opposition wants to amend that by putting a time limit on it. But there is no time limit on the minister. The minister can request a copy of that land strategy at any time. I do not know whether opposition members have read the legislation. If they have, they certainly have not understood it. If they had read it, they would have understood it and, for that reason, I have had my very firm conviction confirmed that the opposition's approach is fraudulent-and everyone in Australia knows it is fraudulent. These alleged phone calls to the shadow minister are a joke. Why, in heaven's name, would any Aboriginal person in Australia phone the office of the shadow minister? I get tired of the stupidity of the opposition. The minister has already drawn the opposition's attention to 191R(l), which states: The Indigenous Land Corporation must make a copy of the national indigenous land strategy or a regional indigenous land strategy available to any personany personwho asks for a copy. Not any person who offers to buy a copy. If anyone asks for a copy, under the legislation the corporation is required to make it available. What a stupid farce! Amendments negatived.",26
37,Mrs GALLUS,PAIRS,"Hindmarsh) (1.58 p.m.)by leave-I move: (16) Clause 3, page 11, line 18, omit ""from time to time"", substitute ""annualIy"". (17) Clause 3, page 11, lines 31-33, omit proposed paragraph (a), substitute the folIowing paragraph: ""(a) the acquisition of interests in land in the regional area for the purpose of making grants of those interests to: (i) Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander corporations; or (ii) aboriginal persons; or (iii) Torres Strait Islanders; or (iv) trustees of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander trusts."". These are consequential amendments. I will not even bother to read them out at this stage because they will be listed in the Hansard.",27
38,Mr TICKNER,PAIRS,"Hughes-Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs) (1.59 p.m.)-I will gently respond, although someone with a greater killer instinct might be drawn to do otherwise. The government opposes both these amendments. It opposes the requirement for an annual revision of the regional strategies. We believe that this is an unduly onerous requirement. The public accountability of the Indigenous Land Corporation is already provided for through the tabling of the corporation's annual reports as provided for by clause 1931. In respect of amendment No. 17, this issue has already been exhaustively canvassed in relation to the first amendment moved by the coalition, and I am sure my colleagues do not wish to further canvass that amendment. Amendments negatived.",27
39,Mrs GALLUS,PAIRS,"Hindmarsh) (2.00 p.m.)by leave-I move: (18) Clause 3, page 11, after proposed subsection 191P(4) insert the folIowing subsection: Moneys not to be distributed until regional strategy prepared "" '(4A) The Indigenous Land Corporation must ensure that no moneys are distributed from the fund for the performance of the Corporation's functions in a region until the regional land strategy for that region has been prepared.' "". (19) Clause 3, page 12, after paragraph (a) of proposed subsection 191 peS) insert the folIowing paragraph: ""(aa) must consult with the State, Territory and local Government or Governments relevant to each region so as to ensure that regional indigenous land strategies complement existing State, Territory or regional land acquisition and management programs; and"". The reasons for these amendments are fairly obvious. Most of the states, I think with the exception of Victoria and Tasmania, have their own land funds. It is important that, when the Indigenous Land Corporation is working out its regional land strategies, it actually consult with the land funds that are already existing in the states. Otherwise, we will have the absolutely ridiculous situation that in New South Wales, for instance, the New South Wales land fund will be purchasing land on behalf of the Aboriginal community, ATSIC will be purchasing land on behalf of the Aboriginal community and the Indigenous Land Corporation will be purchasing land on behalf of the Aboriginal community. Unless those bodies actually consult with one another, obviously cross-interests and problems will arise. As I say, the reasons for these amendments are fairly obvious.",27
40,Mr TICKNER,PAIRS,"Hughes-Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs) (2.01 p.m.)-I am sure that my colleagues would also agree that these are not amendments that warrant an epic debate. Given the fact that we have a very substantial amendment coming up, amendment No. 23, which will no doubt take some time of the House, I will be necessarily brief. The government opposes proposed amendment No. 18 because, as with amendment No. 15, we see that the proposal could make the Indigenous Land Corporation unworkable. It essentially says that, until there is a regional plan, there will not be a capacity to purchase land. That, of course, does not make a lot of sense. Those of us who know how the world works recognise that it will necessarily take some time to properly devise that regional plan. There may well be a great many reasons why the immediate purchase of key and strategic areas of land is desirable. So the government does not accept that amendment. Amendment No. 19 places a mandatory requirement on the Indigenous Land Corporation to consult with state and local governments. The shadow minister made the point that, in the state of New South Wales, we could have the New South Wales land fund, the Indigenous Land Corporation and ATSIC all purchasing land. There needs to be coordination; that is quite right. But this amendment says nothing about that. It really focuses on the question of state and local governments, neither of which are in a position to bring about that coordination that is so necessary. It is no doubt for that reason that the governand ment has always supported the view that strategy ATSIC should be represented on the the fund to bring about the greatest degree of coordination and, consequently, accountability with respect to the management of the fund. But I have to tell those opposite that government and indigenous people see right through the coalition with respect to this particular amendment. Can we imagine what Aboriginal people wiIJ say if the federal government passes this preeminent social justice law and, in doing so, 'Nothing'. imposes a mandatory requirement to consult with the Court government in Western Australia or a mandatory requirement, as those geration, too. opposite are suggesting, to consult with a range of local authorities in some parts of country which have a notorious antinot Aboriginal hostility? If those opposite do believe what I am saying, they should consult with Aboriginal people and they wiI1 be told how badly some sections of local government have let them down. That is not to say that many areas of local government in this coundictionary try do not have a great and commendably improving relationship with indigenous people; they do, and that is one of the focuses of the process of reconciliation. The point is that there ought not to be a mandatory requirement to consult. But there ought to be encouragement to do so and ought to be a capacity to do so. That is why we have included clauses 191N(3) and When 191P(5) in the biI1-to allow the corporation to consult with state and local governments. For those comprehensive and very considered reasons, the government does not support this requirement. I am not aware of any Aboriginal organisation or any Aboriginal person in the country who would advocate that compulsory requirement to consult with state and local governments. We therefore reject the amendments.",27
41,Mrs GALLUS,PAIRS,"I want to make just a couple of minor points on what the minister has said. He said, 'Well, isn't this terrible? It means that until you get the regional plan up you cannot buy any land.' Yes, that is exactly what we do mean. We do not want any organisation rushing out performing a function before it has got a on the function it is performing. That board of does not make any sense. Yes, that is exactly what we intend-that you actually have a plan before you go and do something. That is common sense. If the the minister is suggesting that an organisation should go out and perform its function before it has a strategy, I suggest that he knows very seriously little about business. Mr MCLachlan-Nothing.",28
42,Mrs GALLUS,PAIRS,My colleague says Mr MCLachlan-That would be an exag,28
43,Mrs GALLUS,PAIRS,"He also says that that this would be an exaggeration. The minister does seem to understand the English language. not The word in the amendment is 'consult'. We are requiring the Indigenous Land Corporation to consult with the states. We are not saying that the states have a veto; we are saying there should be consultation. I do not have a with me, but I believe 'consult' means talking with, discussing, finding out what the other person is doing. It does not key mean giving them any power over you; it means talking with them. That is all it means. Unless the minister has a stipulated definition of the word 'consult' which I am not aware there of, his comments make little sense.",28
44,Mr MCLACHLAN,PAIRS,"Barker) (2.07 p.m.)the minister was trying to justify his opposition to these amendments, he said that the board should be encouraged-I think that was the word he used-to consult with state governments and other authorities that are in charge of land as to policy and so forth. As the shadow minister has just pointed out, what we are trying to get into the government's head is that it is not just Aboriginals, only Aboriginals, that we are concerned about. Aboriginals are taxpaying Australians. Aboriginals are not just Aboriginals; they are Australians as well. Earlier I read from a document put out by the lawman from Western Australia. Many of them are just as concerned that responsible decisions are made. The requirement to consult with a state, territory and local government would seem to me to be absolutely obvious. The minister said, 'We know what you're up to. You're actually going to make us consult with the Court government.' What a dreadful requirement! What a lot of nonsense to suggest that everybody in Western Australia is of some dreadful hue that is anti-Aboriginal. Mr Tickner interjecting",28
45,Mr MCLACHLAN,PAIRS,"That's the point. Mr Tickner-Court is a wrecker, like you.",29
46,Mr MCLACHLAN,PAIRS,"That is your view and you put that around all the time. The fact of the matter is, as I pointed out, you come from a state that has done nothing for Aboriginals-not a single thing. Maybe you are trying to remedy your conscience by imposing some of these things on the states that have done something for Aboriginals. I suggest that, instead of objecting to every single amendment we put up, the government might actually look at one or two of these amendments on their merits. In regard to amendment (19), the bill restricts consultations in the preparation of regional land strategies to ATSIC, regional councils and others of similar hue that the board considers appropriate, no doubt. Our amendment makes it compulsory that there be consultations with the state, territory and local Connolly, D. M. governments or governments within the region-just consultations. That does not mean that you have to do everything they want, but it does mean that you get a coordinated set of arrangements. This is vital to ensure that the existing programs-land acquisition and improvement programs-run by the state and local governments work in harmony and not at cross-purposes with the ILC strategy. I have to say, quite in opposition to what the minister has just said, that it is outrageous to contemplate a major land strategy in a region without it being an absolute prerequisite to consult with the state, territory or local governments which have, after all, day-today management of land as their responsibility. I would have thought that if government members had a genuine desire to look at any of these amendments, rather than simply being told by their leader not to look at any of them at all, they would understand that it is vital to avoid waste and duplication and to therefore ensure that the limited resources of the Commonwealth, working in cooperation with other levels of government, are directed to the maximum benefit of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. This clause in the bill fails to mandate that consultation with any other communities or organisations than those corporations. We would like to see a more definite mechanism provided to ensure that that consultation takes place. Question put: That the amendments (Mrs Gallus's) be agreed to. The House divided.

47,Mrs GALLUS,PAIRS,"Hindmarsh) (2.21 p.m.)by leave-I move: (20) Clause 3, pages 12 and 13, proposed section 1915, omit ""body corporate"" (wherever occurring) substitute ""person"". (21) Clause 3, pages 13 and 14, proposed section 191T, omit ""body corporate"" (wherever occurring) substitute ""person"". (22) Clause 3, page 14, proposed section 19IU, omit ""body corporate"" (wherever occurring) substitute ""person"". These amendments are consequential amendments-consequent on amendment No.1, which we introduced as our first amendment-which have been circulated in my name. Other comments have been made by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) since we put forward amendment No. 1. It remains a matter of curiosity to me how the minister could have argued so absolutely determinately that amendment No. 1 was subversive, intended to widen the flexibility of the Indigenous Land Corporation. That is what we were trying to do in amendment No. I-to allow the corporation to buy land not only for corporations but also for Aboriginal trusts, for Aboriginal persons and for Aboriginal families. That was what amendment No. 1 sought to do. I believe that at one stage in a radio interview the minister considered these amendments subversive. The language he used when he talked about this amendment certainly would suggest that trying to widen the flexibility of the Indigenous Land Corporation went to the heart of the Aboriginal community. At absolutely no time did these amendments require the Indigenous Land Corporation to consider trusts or persons; they simply gave the Indigenous Land Corporation the flexibility to do so. Yet the minister said this is totally and utterly acceptable. However, the minister rejected later amendments simply because they constrained the flexibility of the ILC. Minister, you cannot have it both ways. You cannot object to one amendment because it widens the flexibility of the ILC and object to another amendment because it constricts the flexibility of the ILC. You must have it one way or the other. The absolute vituperativeness with which you spoke of these amendments earlier on indicates your whole attitude to this debate-that is, to raise as much division and diversion as possible on what is a very innocent amendment.",30
48,Mr TICKNER,PAIRS,"Hughes-Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs) (2.24 p.m.)-This is a consequential amendment on the first amendment the coalition moved. That amendment has been exhaustively debated. I do not intend in the course of my remarks to do any more than respond to the shadow minister. I think my colleagues also wish me to do that. When the coalition talked about the amendment that it sought government support for, it neglected to say what the nature of the amendment was that it was seeking to introduce into this bill. I place on the public record the fact that since the national parliament started to make laws with respect to Aboriginal affairs-it gained that power in 1967; it was not actively taken up until the time of the WhitIam government and it continued through the period of the Whitlam government, the Fraser government, the Hawke government and the Keating government through the whole operation of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission-the consistent cross-party position has been that grants of money would not be handed over to individual Aboriginal people to buy land. That has been a consistent hallmark of Commonwealth policy for in excess of 20 years. That has always been the policy. What did we find? At five minutes to midnight, when we were well into the debate on this legislation in the House of Representatives, the shadow minister pulled out an amendment from her back pocket which sought to overturn over 20 years of crossparty supported policy in Aboriginal affairs. Then she says to the government in mock horror and indignation, 'You reject our amendments. You do not want cross-party support.' She not only did not consult with the government before the amendments were brought in but also did not consult with one Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person in this country. In the course of the debate today on one of the amendments, a transcript of a radio interview yesterday was dragged up involving one Aboriginal person on one regional council. There are 35 ATSIC regional councils in this country. Is it any wonder that the government is not prepared to support this amendment? It is poor public policy. It is not just the government that is not prepared to accept the amendment. If those opposite talk to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people around the country they will find that they do not want this amendment either. They do not want the amendment because it not only lowers the public accountability of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs to the Australian parliament and the people of Australia but also lowers the public accountability of Aboriginal policy to indigenous people themselves. This amendment is not supported by either indigenous people or the government. I challenge the shadow minister to go on talkback radio programs like the Sattler program in Western Australia and try to sell this policy publicly. She should go and tell people listening to those talkback programs how the coalition wants to make grants of money to individual Aboriginal people to allow this land fund to proceed in this way. It is not the government's policy. It is not the policy of Aboriginal people. It overturns 20 years of cross-party support for good public policy in this area. We absolutely reject this amendment.  about a minute and half to contribute to the debate on this amendment. I put on record the coalition's position in regard to these consequential amendments, which deal with sections 1915, 191T and 191U. The government has to understand what the coalition is seeking to do by these amendments. The coalition is seeking to expand the range of people who can be affected by this legislation. Far from trying to narrow the effect of the legislation to corporations, we seek to include individuals and trusts to broaden the effect that the land fund will have on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. In the past the government has seen fit to adopt a bipartisan approach with respect to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. I need only refer to the debate on the ATSIC bill which was introduced in the last parliament-when I was not a member of this place-to see that the government and opposition sat down and deliberately worked out amendments that would change the bill to ensure that it had bipartisan support. The government has not done that on this issue because it is trying to drive a wedge into the debate about Aboriginal affairs. It is trying paint the picture that the coalition is against Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. It has done that with respect to the Native Title Act and now it is doing it with respect to the land fund bill. We are quite genuinely seeking to amend the bill to improve it and ensure that the government's intentions are met.",31
49,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Mr Jenkins)Order! It being 2.30 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with the resolution agreed to earlier this day. The debate may be resumed at a later hour. The honourable member will have leave to continue his remarks when the debate is resumed. NA Commonwealth-State Financial Relations",32
50,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to yesterday's address by the Premier of Queensland entitled 'Reinventing the states' in which he forecast the de facto disappearance of the states by the tum of the century unless federal-state relations were overhauled. Does the Treasurer agree with Mr Goss that the last serious attempt to do something effective about federal-state financial relations was three years ago? Was the 1991 initiative of the then Prime Minister not torpedoed by the current Prime Minister in the course of his drive to become Labor Party leader? Will the government respond in a practical way to the challenge thrown down by the Queensland Premier?,32
51,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have not seen the speech by the Premier of Queensland, but I did see the press report to which the Leader of the Opposition refers. I must say that it does seem to be a somewhat dramatic exposition of the position about federal-state relations. Mr MCGauran-Tell that to Wayne Goss. Mr Downer-He is. Mr MCGauran-Yes, you're right.",32
52,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"True. The future of federalstate financial relations is being considered through the COAG process. At the last COAG meeting in Darwin, there was to have been a discussion on the roles and responsibilities to between the Commonwealth and the states. That discussion did not take place because the whole of the discussion related to other matters, such as the Hilmer report, and we did not get around to that topic. But that will be very much on the agenda at the next COAG meeting in February next year. Mr MCGauran-It is a bit more urgent than that.",32
53,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Gippsland!,32
54,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It does involve the Commonwealth and the states reassessing their relationship. Various matters being worked on through joint federal-state committees will be reported to that meeting. So this is a matter which has not been buried or forgotten. It is a matter which is under active consideration by the Commonwealth with the states. At the appropriate time, which will be February next year, we will further consider the issue. Mr MCGauran-Is that all you can say?",32
55,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Gippsland! Natural Gas Industry,32
56,Mr HARRY WOODS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Can the Minister for Resources inform the House of recent developments in the natural gas industry in Australia and their associated economic benefits?,32
57,Mr BEDDALL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I point out that some of the debate that has taken place between the states and the Commonwealth through the COAG process, particularly that which occurred at the meeting held at Hobart in February last year, has led to some significant changes in the Australian gas industry. For too long in this country gas was locked up in individual states and the movement of gas, particularly that of natural gas, between states was restricted. We have now seen the real benefits of the COAG process in the gas reforms that it is bringing forward. Last week I was able to sign a contract that allowed the construction of a new ethane pipeline from Moomba to the ICI Botany plant in Sydney. The pipeline which will be owned by ICI will cost some $300 million$200 million for the construction of the pipeline and $100 million for the infrastructure at the Botany plant. What is significant about this is that this the first time this type of process has been able to take place. To a large extent, there is private investment in the Australian gas industry. For Australia, this is just a good news, good news story. In the past, the ethane was reinjected into the ground because there was no efficient use for it in the Moomba field. This project will create 1,000 jobs at the height of the construction phase, a $35 million investment by the Cooper Basin producers at Moomba and a $50 to $100 million expansion of the petrochemical industry in New South Wales. More importantly for Australia, it will produce $100 million per annum of import replacement over a lO-year period, which amounts to in excess of $11 billion. The ethane pipeline is a landmark project and shows that cooperation between the Commonwealth and the states can lead to significant changes in our infrastructure program. Other major projects that are under way or are on the drawing board include the goldfields project in Western Australia. Again, it will be a private sector pipeline with the Western Mining Corporation, Normandy Poseidon and BHP Minerals involved. The other ones that are of significant benefit to Australia are the Bass Strait to Sydney pipeline and the Otway to Adelaide pipeline, which could be providing gas to those areas. Interest Rates",33
58,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. Given that you have conceded that you may have to speed up your budget reduction strategy, why are you refusing to consider action until May next year when you know that delayed action will push up interest rates and force home buyers to pay the price of your fiscal irresponsibility? Since you will not revise your budget for this year, can you rule out a further rise in official interest rates before Christmas?",33
59,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is no fiscal irresponsibility at all. We are pursuing a deficit reduction program which is more challenging than that of any other OECD country which has announced one. So our objective of having is the deficit at near balance by 1997-98-1ess than a half per cent of GOP is the projected outcome at this stage-is exceedingly challenging compared with those of other countries. I guess that the big exception to that is New Zealand, which has already moved into surplus. But I say this to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition: note that that has not stopped interest rates increasing in New Zealand. Mr Downer-Yes, but they are not as high as they are here.",33
60,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,They are. They are higher. Mr Downer-Real interest rates.,33
61,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Actual official rates are higher in New Zealand and they have gone up more. They went up by two per cent in the course of this year, and certainly from the trough. That is compared with the increase in official rates here of three-quarters of one per cent and despite the fact that the New Zealand budget is moving into surplus. So it is just an absurd argument that we keep hearing from the opposition that if we were to immediately announce some tightening of budgetary policy that would have some dramatic impact in terms of monetary policy. Presumably, if we had a tighter fiscal policy in the order of a couple of billion dollars less this year, which those opposite were arguing that we should have, that would have avoided any increase in official rates. It has not done that in any other country. The conservatives in BritainMr Costello-Ted Evans seems to think it is a good idea.",33
62,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Your political bedfellows in Britain simply increased interest rates recently because they said they needed to do that to pre-empt an outbreak of inflation in the future. They used much the same arguments as were used by us in announcing our official rate increase. They did that despite the fact that their public sector borrowing requirement is higher than ours. It is something which is happening around the world. Interest rates have been moved by authorities in most of the Western developed countries except those that are lagging in the recovery. Mr Reith- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order understanding order 145. The Treasurer was asked very simply whether he would rule out a rate increase before Christmas. He should answer the question.",34
63,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member will resume his seat. The minister is in order.,34
64,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I was saying, it is something that is not confined to Australia. The absurdly simplistic assumption of the opposition has been shown to be nonsense by what is happening in New Zealand. A tighter fiscal policy does not mean that you will therefore be able to keep monetary policy in a state of perpetual isolation with no movement at any time. That is the whole thrust of the absurd argument. Monetary policy in this country is at a level with which I feel quite comfortable. We have taken an appropriate step to increase interest rates, along with fiscal policy which is quite responsible. Of course, the stance of both fiscal and monetary policy will continue to be assessed over time as to its appropriateness. If we decide at some stage that we need to tighten policy then we will do so, but that is not something that we are going to announce in advance. If we make any such decisionand we have made no such decision at all-to tighten any element of policy, we will announce that when we have made that decision and not before. Whether it is appropriate to tighten policy is something that we will need to consider as we go along. Of course, a major factor in that is the outlook for the economy-whether the growth is going to continue to be strong and whether growth is likely to get even stronger unless there is some tightening of policy to confine growth and confine inflationary outbreaks. Apparently, the opposition now believes that the economy is growing so strongly that, unless we do something to increase interest rates in the near future, there is going to be some increase in inflation. That is presumably the position that you are starting to argue. Mr Costello-No, we are against interest rate rises.",34
65,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,34
66,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You want to slash the budget because you think that the growth is so fast that we should be slashing the deficit to bring growth under control. So that is the argument? Okay. Either way, you want to tighten fiscal policy, not monetary policy, because otherwise you think growth will be too strong. In other words, the opposition is saying, 'This country has really got its recovery going. The recovery is very strong.' Opposition members are so concerned about the strength of the recovery that they think we need to be tightening policy. That is what opposition members are saying. I am pleased to accept their acknowledgment that we do have an economy which is growing rapidly and that, despite all their forecasts of dismal outcomes, second dip recessions and all those sorts of things, their position now is that they strongly believe we have an economy that is growing very strongly-so strongly, in fact, that policy needs to be tightened. We are very pleased to see that you have accepted the view that the economy is in a very good position. Taxation",34
67,Mrs SILVIA SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Treasurer. I refer to previous OECD statistics showing that Australia was the lowest taxed country in the OECD. Is this still the case? How does Australia's tax share compare with that of Asian countries and what implications does Australia's low tax level have for the provision of public services?,34
68,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You have just lowered it a bit for the wharfies.,35
69,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member for O'Connor was missing yesterday. That might have been appreciated, but he will remain quiet.",35

71,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Bennelong!,35
72,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You should not reflect on him.,35
73,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Bennelong!,35
74,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As the questioner mentioned, last year statistics from the OECD showed that Australia's tax revenue as a proportion of GDP was the lowest of all Western developed countries-the lowest in the OECD. There are new statistics around now, however, which show that that position has changed slightly. We are no longer the lowest because the Turkish statistician has, with a stroke of a pen, changed the situation dramatically by revising the Turkish GDP up by some 30 per cent with new methodology. With this rather spectacular change in the Turkish GDP, we have moved off the bottom rung from the lowest taxed country in the Western developed world to the second lowest. But I assure the House that we are still indeed a low tax country by comparison with other Western developed countries. Figures for the latest year, 1992, show that our figure of 28.5 per centMr Costello-That was before the Dawkins horror budget. Mr Downer-And the 1993 budget!",35
75,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Yes. Remember all the tax cuts in the budget? Tax cuts were in the budget. They were in November.,35
76,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,35
77,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,35
78,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The figures show that our 28.5 per cent of GDP was 10 per cent below the OECD average, which was 38.8 per cent. The highest country of all was Sweden at 50 per cent, so we are indeed a low tax country. The questioner also asked about comparison with east Asian countries. Certainly we are higher taxed than most of the east Asians but not all of them. Japan is slightly higher taxed than us. We have been aware of the importance of ensuring that our tax regime, so far as is possible, does not provide a disincentive to investment in Australia. In that respect, we have been conscious of the business tax regimes operating in Asian countries and we have moved to provide some comparability with various recent moves related to accelerated depreciation and investment allowances and the cut in the company tax rate from 39c to 33c in the dollar. With that we have made Australia reasonably competitive. If we look at the corporate tax rates of Australia and of east Asian countries, we see that Australia has a rate of 33 per cent which compares with Japan at 37 1h per cent-it is higher than us-Indonesia at 35 per cent; and the Republic of Korea at 34.4 per cent. Below us is Malaysia at 32 per cent-only fractionally below us; Thailand at 30 per cent; Singapore at 27 per cent; Taiwan at 25 per cent; and Hong Kong at 16 1h per cent. So we are obviously, apart from those at the lower end of that spectrum, very much in a position of comparability with the Asian countries in our business tax regime. I was also asked by the honourable member about the implications of all of that for public services. The public services of Australia are such that we, with a low tax regime, have to ensure that we have a well targeted welfare and other public service system if we are to provide proper services to those in need whilst keeping taxes low. We have been, essentially, very successful in doing that. A report by a group at the Australian National University-my colleague the Minister for Social Security mentioned it yesterday-shows that Australia's incomeMr Ronaldson-Come on; wind it up!",35

83,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on my left will come to order.,36
84,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"has been the most efficient at targeting assistance to those in need compared with nine other OECD countries. This has not been at the expense of the effectiveness of our system. The study also showed that our targeted welfare system had the second lowest level of administrative costs among OECD countries. That is a considerable achievement, given that one would expect that a means tested system would be more costly to administer than a universal system. So in terms of providing an efficient welfare service, we have done very well, as this study shows. It is important for us to do that if we are going to have a relatively low tax regime. That level of taxes is too high for some people. The opposition continually says that it should be lower and points to the Asian taxation regime. But if we are going to have the Asian taxation regime, then we have to have Asian public services. That means that we do not have things likeMr Downer-Why talk about Asia?",36
85,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Why do you keep talking about it? You are the one,36
86,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Treasurer will ignore the interjections and conclude his answer.,36
87,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition is the one who keeps pointing to Asian tax rates and saying that our taxes are too high because other tax regimes in Asia are rather less and that we therefore are taxing too much. The implication of that is that we need to have welfare systems like the Asians, which means no things like unemployment benefits and no family payments at all. Mr Downer-This is just silly. You should be",36
88,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition!,36
89,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There are no family payments anywhere in Asia. The implication of those who argue that we should be looking at Asian tax rates is that we should be emulating Asia's welfare services. At the same time, the opposition tries to make out that it is profamily when it would pursue a position which gives no family payments.  point of order with respect to a ruling given by Mr Speaker on 9 May 1994. He directed that ministers keep their answers shorter and more precise. The minister has gone on far too long in this answer. Due to the fact that he is completely out of control, I would ask you to call him to order.",36
90,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Treasurer will conclude his answer.,36
91,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have virtually concluded. I will just repeat the point that those who argue for Asian tax regimes are arguing, in effect, for Asian welfare systems. For them to describe themselves at the same time as profamily is just the most ludicrous hypocrisy. If you want to be pro-family, you cannot have Asian tax rates because you then cannot afford transfer",36

94,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition will cease interjecting!,36
95,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Asian countries do not have family payment systems. They do not have any transfer systems. We spend $5 112 billion on that. Mr Downer interjecting,36
96,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I take it from what the Leader of the Opposition is saying now that one can be pro-family and have no transfer payments to families. If that is your family policy, we will be pleased to hear you spell that out. Interest Rates",36
97,Mr COBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Is the Treasurer aware of headlines in today's paper 'Interest rates set for one per cent rise'? Is the Treasurer aware that total farm debt in this appalling drought is currently $17,000 million? Does the Treasurer agree that it would be perverse to design a drought package worth $100 million when a one per cent rise in interest rates would cost the farm sector $170 million? Bearing in mind that we have already had a three-quarters of one per cent rise, what assurance can the government give the farm sector that the cost of any further interest rate increases will not swamp the benefit from your drought package?",37
98,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government will be considering a drought package tomorrow. That package will doubtless result in a considerable expansion of assistance to farmers who are affected by the drought. The interest rate issue is one which, obviously, for farmers who are in debt-of course, those affected by the drought certainly are-has necessarily an impact on them. But it is not this government's policy, in any way, to have any higher level of increase in interest rates than is absolutely essential. So we are pursuing policy which will give us, in my view, the least increases in interest rates over the course of the cycle that could possibly occur. That is our objective. That means you have to set in place appropriate fiscal policy. As I have said, we have in place the most substantial deficit reduction program of any country that has announced one. Of course, the aid to farmers will not assist in that respect, but that is something that we will accept and swallow on the way through. That is important to try to minimise the increase in interest rates, but it is not the factor that applies. Of course, for farmers it is also important that inflation is kept low. That is always very important to the rural sector. We have low inflation now. We have inflation at an underlying rate of around two per cent. The last thing that farmers in Australia would want is for Australia's inflation rate to take off. So policies will be set in a way which will try to bring about an outcome which will assure farmers that we have a low inflation future. I think the biggest structural change of all the structural changes that have been made in this country in recent times is to move to low inflation. To lose that structural change would be an enormous tragedy for this country, not least for the rural sector. We will be doing our best to ensure that we hang onto that structural change. Mr Nehl- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The question asked by the honourable member for Parkes was: what assurance could the government give to the farm sector that the cost of interest rate increases would not swamp any benefit from the drought package? Under standing order 145, which deals with relevance, the minister is just waffling on about other things. He is not answering the question.",37
99,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Treasurer will continue his answer.,37
100,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have answered the question. Commonwealth Employment Service,37
101,Mr HORNE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. How well is the Commonwealth Employment Service performing? Is it adapting to meet the challenges of Working Nation and the white paper on employment and growth?",37
102,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. Many people do not understand the magnitude of the task that the CES undertakes. For example, last year the CES was responsible for referring people to two million jobs. It registered 1.9 million job seekers. It placed 540,000 of those in jobs only and a similar number in labour market programs. All this was done with a staff of 8,400 spread around the country. If achieved outcomes that were second only to Japan in terms of outcomes per staff member. Also last year, the CES was responsible for placing 160,000 long-term unemployed into jobs in this country. The CES is continuing to make important inroads into the long-term unemployed. The labour force figures that will be released at the end of this month reveal that the figure for the long-term unemployed is now 290,100-the lowest in 31 months. Mr Charles- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. If the minister wants to a ministerial statement, there are other forms, times and places for him to do that.",37
103,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member will resume his seat.,38
104,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The continuing fall in the number of the long-term unemployed is very welcome. We still have a long way to go. It is important to note that, of the 350,000 jobs that this government has created since the election, 76,000 have gone to the long-term unemployed. Contrast that with the 1980s when only 109,000 of the 1.6 million jobs that we created went to the long-term unemployed. That is the difference in targeted measures. That is the difference in case management. That is the difference in having a CES that is responsive to the needs of the long-term unemployed and having programs that can help get them back into work. The white paper adds to those initiatives, particularly in expanding the capacity to introduce case management. Pending the legislation being passed, which is before this parliament, all the case management activity currently is being handled by the Commonwealth Employment Service. As at the end of August, some 116,000 people are being case managed. A 30,000 plus positive outcome has already been achieved in respect of those being case managed. This is a commitment to ensuring that the long-term unemployed are not left behind in this recovery. The CES has made a major contribution to ensure that they are not left behind. It will continue to do so under the policies that this government has introduced. Shipping: Australian National Line",38
105,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Will the Minister for Finance confirm the comments made by the Minister for Transport that the government is considering removing fuel excise for the shipping industry, costing $26 million per year? Additionally, is the government considering increasing depreciation rates for shipowners as part of its sweetheart deal struck with the Maritime Union of Australia to save ANL? Is this another attempt, on top of the $20 million income tax exemptions to seamen, to throw more taxpayers' money at the Maritime Union read of Australia-an example of Labor government rorts for mates that could end up costing taxpayers in excess of $50 million in total each year?",38
106,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do not dispute the right of the honourable member to ask that question; it is a perfectly reasonable question to direct to me. But, having gone out in public and advocated all those positions, to come in last here and argue them with me as a point of criticism is a trifle strange, you must admit. You have gone out there and argued for every one of those measures-that is fine; I accept that you feel these to be very sensible things-but get somebody else to ask the blinking question before coming in here and putting it to me. There are a couple of points that I want to make about this proposition which you support. The first thing that should be said about the proposition is that there would be nothing done on any of this without some additional measures from the industry for a more effective labour relations package, including different crewing arrangements-both the crew to berth ratio and also the size of crews on ships-and a range of other issues that are being considered in the context of shipping industrial reform. The propositions that you have put forward, that you have advocated in the past and which you have put to me would only be considered in the context of delivery in that area. The second point that ought to be made is this: none of these taxation concessions are directed towards putting additional income in the pockets of seamen-none. All of these propositions are directed towards improving the competitiveness of the international shipping industry-all of them. Mr Costello-What about doing that for the farmers?",38
107,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Have an argument with him; he disagrees with you. Mr Costello-Why not give the same concession to the farmers?,38
108,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The mate minister will ignore the interjections Deputy Leader of the Opposition will cease interjecting.,39
109,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Have an argument with order. him; he agrees with that, goose! No prizes for second. I suppose the truth about the honourorder. able member-and this is increasingly the case as he gets out there and tries to defend his leader-is that his leader takes the if you have a dog, why bark yourself?",39
110,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The shadow minister asked a quite specific question, asking the minister to answer two very explicit queries-the first, whether there would be a relief of fuel excise; and the second, whether there would be increased depreciation rates. The minister has now been on his feet for a minute and a half and has not addressed either of those two trial questions. I think he ought to be required you to do so.",39
111,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister will continue his answer.,39
112,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Acting Speaker, I point thank you for your ruling. I would point out that absolutely everything that I have said this point of time in answer to the question of direct relevance to it-manifestly. Everytions. thing that has come forward from the opposition in these points of order that they have been raising systematically through question time is disorderly-manifestly, from all Minister shadow ministers. We are not obliged in this chamber to stand up and give yes or no answers; we are obliged to provide informaCommonwealth's tive answers-and that is what you are getrange ting, an informative answer, Mr 23 per cent. Mr Downer-You are obliged to answer strategy? the question that is put to you.",39
113,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister will direct his remarks through the Chair.,39
114,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, I am very happy to do that.",39
115,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise point of order. I stand on the relevance question. The minister, of course, says he does not have to answer questions. Well, your Parker found out all about that, didn't and the he. Tell us where you stand on that.",39
116,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member will go to his point of,39
117,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of,39
118,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister will resume his seat. The honourable view: member for O'Connor is not assisting by coming to the dispatch box with those types of comments.,39
119,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is about as relevant as every other point of order that they have raised. I will continue with the point that I was making to you in terms of the question that you asked. The point I was making was that all those benefits, which would only flow in return for substantial changes in the indusrelations system in the shipping industry, by are of course benefits that will flow to the companies and, through them, to the users of the services. You have recognised that yourself, and you have said that that is a sensible course to pursue. I just suggest that, from this of time onwards, you start to have a chat with your shadow Treasurer and others, to or else stop getting out there amongst the is public and advocating these sorts of proposiBudget: Deficit Reduction",39
120,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the for Finance. Is the minister aware of media reports of a claim that it is possible to significantly improve the quality of the programs across a broad of areas while simultaneously accelerating the pace of the budget deficit reduction Can the minister verify the accuracy of the professional costings on which that claim is based? Does the government intend to embrace that package of proposals?,39
121,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, I have seen those propositions. They were in the document that sank without a trace a couple of weeks ago and they were subsequently guyed by the a gentleman who delivered them. In that particular document, The Things That Matter, we have identified thus far 22 separate spending proposals, 14 separate tax cut proposals and no savings proposals. However, we are assured by the opposition spokesman on Treasury matters that there are costings. Paul Lyneham asked him in an interview: And pardon me, Mr Costello, have you done any costings? PETER COSTELLO: ... We have an idea of all the amounts that are involved in this, and I can you that these amounts are matters that are achievable ... Then it goes on: PAUL LYNEHAM: So there are some sums somewhere? There are some columns of numbers, are there? PETER COSTELLO: ... Paul. Paulhe got biblicala lot of these proposals have been costed. Various proposals have been costed by independent finance houses in relation to all sorts of things. The Bjelke-Petersen disease on circumlocution descends below the border. He goes on: For example, the ANZ has put out a savings proposal. Mr Willis is actually workingone of the great non sequiturs of all timeon his own savings proposal at the moment. After 11 years he popped out at the press conference the other day that he's had Treasury working on this very idea of the Opposition's. We do not mind doing that. If there is a set of propositions that comes forward in some clearly reasonable definable matter, we will give the opposition its dues and cost it for it. Members of the opposition say that they have these propositions. They say they have these proposals out there costed, but this is a little secret that they do not wish to share with the rest of the world. I suggest there are three reasons for it. They are: that what they propose is so insubstantial as to be derisible; that the results of the propositions that they have put forward are so heinous that they would not dare to present them because the savings would obviate any possible political gains that would be obtained from their expenditure or tax cut proposals; or that these figures do not exist. I am inclined to think that the latter is the case and that this is just a piece of obfuscation by the opposition spokesman on Treasury matters, who does delight in standing up in this place and querying the government's fiscal deficit reduction strategy whilst at the same time letting his minions on the opposition front benches streak out there and make any particular set of promises that they feel like making at any point in time. If you have a set of propositions on the table with 22 separate spending proposals and 14 separate tell tax cut proposals, you do in fact have to ante up or leave the debate. Shipping: Australian National Line",39
122,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Finance. Is it a fact that the government's commitments to maintain a minority interest in ANL, to support a share ownership plan and to guarantee the ANL's debt on a transitional basis-to quote from your document-will only become operative if the proposed union consortium acquires a majority interest in ANL? In the light of this clearly preferential deal to your mates how do you support what the minister said-that it would be a fair and open tender?",40
123,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Our position is available on all aspects of an open tender process. Going down the particular roads that you suggest, when we arrive at conclusions on those matters, after we have tested the economic viability, that position would apply to any particular set of arrangements that we would put in place. I reiterate the position put by the Minister for Transport the other day. As far as the taxation changes that may in the end be incorporated within all of this if the various industrial relations trade-offs are achieved is concerned, the vast bulk of the beneficiaries in terms of shipping companies in that regard will not include ANL; the vast bulk of them will be the other international shippers, which is why they have welcomed it. Australian Broadcasting Corporation",40
124,Mr GRACE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can the Minister for Communications and the Arts inform the House of the findings of the recent inquiry held into the financial management of the ABC's Asian satellite television service Australia Television? Mr LEEI thank the member for Fowler for his continuing interest in the ABC. Members would be aware that the Australia Television satellite television service was launched by the ABC in February 1993. This service is, in my opinion, an important activity for the ABC and it is making a valuable contribution to promoting Australia in the region. The service's ability to achieve a balance between cultural sensitivity and editorial independence has been well received in the region, particularly in the area of news and current affairs. It is the government's view that the involvement of the ABC in Australia Television has been supported by the government. Earlier this year I became aware of some expressions of concern about the financial viability of the Australia Television service and the level of separation between ties of Australia Television and the ABC's national services. I commissioned a review of the service, which focused on financial and management aspects, and the review was conducted by senior officers from my department and the Department of Finance with the cooperation of senior officers from the ABC. After I received the review's report last week, I forwarded it to the ABC board for its comment, and last night I received the board's response. The key findings of the review are that, while the service costs twice as much as originally estimated, it has been successfully established and it is making a contribution to Australia's objectives in the South-East Asian region. To date, the financial support of the service by the ABC has not involved the diversion of resources from budget funded activities and there is no evidence of adverse effects on the ABC's core activities because of the operation of Australia Television. However, these findings are dependent on the service's ability to repay to the ABC an internal line of credit with interest, and that has been extended to Australia Television over the last two years. The review has also raised some issues of financial accountability, which is of relevance to all of the ABC's commercial enterprises. I wrote to the Chairman of the ABC about these issues and I have now received the board's comments. I am pleased to table the review, a letter of my own to the Chairman of the ABC, Professor Armstrong, and two letters in reply from Professor Armstrong. Having completed this review and having received the board's response, I am confident that the service will now be conducted in a way that complements rather than detracts from the core activities of the ABC. I have seen some comments recently by the opposition spokesman in this area. This week Senator Alston has been criticising private sector involvement in ABC co-productions. But this is a very different view from that held by the opposition before the last election. On 9 July 1992 the then shadow spokesman for communications said in the Australian: A coalition government would retain the ABC but it would have to generate more income from the the activi- private sector. You can understand why that was the opposition's view because Mr Smith went on to say that by sponsoring the ABC the Commonwealth was providing free television for the wealthy and the well educated. That was the view of the opposition about the ABC. This week the current shadow minister for communications and the arts, Senator Alston, has been criticising the ABC's involvement in pay television. Yesterday he said, 'The ABC is increasingly making money from the private sector, as we know, but all that does is encourage it to get off and get into highly speculative commercial ventures such as pay television.' That was the view of Senator Alston yesterday. On the Sunday program, on pay TV, he said: You're up against some of the deepest pockets in the world when you get into the pay television market. He continued: To have a very substantial news channel, as the ABC is proposing, must inevitably have serious consequences for the quality of its free to air service. They are the criticisms of Senator Alston this week, yet in June 1992 the same Senator Alston moved an amendment in the Senate to ensure that 'one transponder on the satellite must be allocated for the exclusive use of the ABC'. So the man who today says he has concerns that the involvement of the ABC in pay television will undermine free to air was the man who moved that the ABC must be involved in pay television. Mr Crean-He has caught Alexander's disease.",40
125,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He has caught the Leader of the Opposition's disease. We have an example of gross hypocrisy on the part of the opposition. The same man is arguing on the one hand that the involvement in pay TV undermines free to air, yet he was the very person who moved to try to force the ABC to be involved in pay TV. Perhaps the real reason the opposition is arguing for the ABC to be involved in pay TV is that it believes that involvement undermines free to air services. Before the last election, Mr Smith, the then shadow minister, said that there might be a time when the ABC would drop its free to air service in favour of pay television. There has been a history of opposition spokesmen on communications wanting to shut down the ABC's free to air television service and leave nothing but pay TV. This is being continued by the current shadow minister. Australian Broadcasting Corporation",42
126,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Communications and the Arts. Why have you and your office sought to undermine the credibility of the ABC by extensively briefing the media so as to isolate its managing director, Mr David Hill? Why have you insisted that the Chairman of the ABC be present whenever you meet Mr Hill? Why do you choose to let selected journalists know that you and the real minister for communications, Mr Keating, have serious reservations about the ABC's venture into pay television, yet you do not have sufficient gumption to commission an inquiry or even speak publicly on the issue? When will you do something to arrest the ABC's malaise rather than get others to do your dirty work for you?",42
127,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"First of all, Mr Hill has my full confidence. Secondly, the claim that Professor Armstrong must be present for every meeting that I have with David HiII is completely incorrect. Unlike the opposition, I believe that a minister who deals with a statutory corporation such as the ABC should do so on a proper basis. On occasions that means that I meet Professor Armstrong and on occasions that means that I speak to the managing director. I certainly do not believe, as the opposition does, that one day the ABC should be involved in pay TV when a couple of years later it thinks that the ABC should not be. The government does not have the hypocrisy which has been demonstrated by a series of shadow ministers for communications who believe that the ABC's future role should be undermined. They believe the ABC should cater only for the wealthy and the well educated. As I have demonstrated, the assumptions on which the question is based are completely unfounded. Health Services: Rural Areas",42
128,Ms FATIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Human Services and Health. I refer to the exceptionally bad drought afflicting rural and remote regions in New South Wales and Queensland. What is the government doing to support the health needs of rural and remote Australians? What action is being taken to address the long-term shortage of health professionals in these communities?,42
129,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am sure that all members of the House agree that we need to pay special attention to rural health, not only during a time of drought as we have now but also in the long term. I notice that members opposite agree with this because there have been a series of press releases from the shadow spokesperson and the National Party recommending that the government undertake certain action, which in many cases it has already undertaken. I draw the attention of honourable members to a number of programs because there are clearly difficulties in the provision of rural health services-difficulties which many members would be familiar with, particularly members on our side of the House who represent the majority of rural seats in this country. I hope that honourable members are aware that some $15.3 million has been allocated under the rural incentives programa very important program to ensure that general practitioners relocate to country areas where there are substantial shortages of GPs, unlike the cities where we have an excess. We have succeeded in relocating some 78 GPs, with a further 55 in prospect. That means that a lot of small country communities will again have their general practitioner, supported by the government, to ensure a high quality of primary care. In addition, I noticed that a recent press release of Senator Sandy Macdonald stated: Training in rural health must be accelerated with more medical students attracted from country areas willing to return to work in the bush and to provide more facilities to support rural medical practitioners. I am delighted to tell Senator Macdonald that in fact that is already occurring. In this year's budget funding was provided to ensure that the medical schools around this country have a proper rural health curriculum. I have recently approved significant funding under the $1.7 million available this year to ensure that they not only include proper training for rural health but also have placements for students in training in country general practice so that more general practitioners are familiar with it. One element of Senator Macdonald's proposal was that we should send some of our country students back to the bush. They are the ones in fact more likely to go and practise in the bush-not only nurses but doctors, too. I am pleased that the medical schools themselves have indicated their desire to see more country students selected-a form of affirmative action, I might say, for country students-to ensure that we get a better balance between country and city practitioners. It is one of the few occasions, including the membership of the shadow cabinet, where the National Party appears to support affirmative action, but in this case I agree with the medical schools. In the short term, I would like to draw the attention of members to another very important set of programs. We are all aware of the fact that during drought and difficult times such as these we have higher rates of suicide, marital breakdown and mental health problems in the rural community. Again, I am delighted that the shadow spokesperson indicated we should put money into counselling for people in these drought affected areas. I am pleased to inform the member that we are doing that. Already some 18,000 clients have been through the program providing counselling since 1986. This year there are 5,000 people-a sad number-currently involved in a counselling program worth some $3.5 million in the current budget. In addition, in the current budget we have provided some $2.7 million, and 24 projects are being undertaken around Australia, particularly to address mental health issues. Mr Tim Fischer-Long overdue!",42
130,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"These are very important questions and I hope members opposite, who are trying to interject, will not make light of this. This is very important in the light of the package that will be announced by the government tomorrow because these measures in health will complement a range of other measures to support the rural community in this country. It may be that members opposite find this matter of no particular interest or of passing interest to them. The government's point of view, and particularly my own point of view as someone who was brought up in a country wheat belt town and knows the effects of drought, is that we need to take it seriously, and I urge members opposite to do the same. Campaign Funds",43
131,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Administrative Services. At the trial last week of the former Labor Deputy Premier of Western Australia, David Parker, the President of the Senate, Senator Beahan, gave evidence of the use of Labor Party campaign funds to pay the private gambling debts of a Labor electoral candidate. Mr Knott-Get out of the sewer and back into the gutter where you belong.",43
132,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,43
133,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The House will come to order! Mr Knott interjecting Mr Tuckey interjecting,43
134,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Gilmore! The honourable member for O'Connor!,44
135,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Will the minister confirm that the form of disclosures required under the Commonwealth Electoral Act of campaign gifts and campaign expenditure do not enable a donor to know whether a campaign gift was used to pay the gambling debts of a candidate? From the point of view of a donor to a campaign fund, what is the difference between a candidate using campaign funds for the purpose of paying the candidate's private debts, for which Parker was convicted of stealing, and a party using campaign funds to pay the candidate's private debts?",44
136,Mr WALKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am responsible for the Electoral Commission, and to that extentMr Downer-You are the minister.",44
137,Mr WALKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I know I am. I only say that because someone questioned whether I was the minister responsible. I listened with some interest yesterday when the honourable member for Tangney raised a similar question with the Speaker. Mr Thckey-You should have an answer.,44
138,Mr WALKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Do you want an answer to the question or not? The question raised the issue of whether the election funding return revealed that gambling debts had been paid. That is the issue that was raised yesterday. The obvious answer to the question I am now asked is that it has nothing at all to do with the election funding return legislation because payment of debts outside election debts need not be revealed under that legislation. However, the real question asked yesterday was whether people who have donated money for the purposes of election campaigns should reveal that fact. As the honourable member knows, there are provisions that donors to election campaigns must themselves reveal that funding in certain circumstances. That is the real issue that is being raised today. I have no knowledge of the facts of the matter raised by the honourable member, but I will certainly have those investigated. It well be that there has been some breach of the legislation so far as third parties failing to file returns is concerned. As far as I am concerned, a payment that is not related to an election is obviously not something that should be included in the return. Child Support Agency",44
139,Mr GIBSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Assistant Treasurer. Can the minister advise the House of the progress being made in implementing world's best practice into the Child Support Agency?,44
140,Mr GEAR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I can inform the House that I will be introducing legislation next month to make the child support scheme more flexible. The legislation will allow all regular payers to pay privately. That will speed the system up. It will allow stage one parents who become unemployed to skip the court process and change their payments by simple agency notification. It will also allow for simpler proof of parentage requirements. The big improvement for the Child Support Agency will be in the area of phone contact. Most child support offices have already installed new telephone technology, which has dramatically reduced delays. I can inform the House that all offices will be equipped with this new technology by the end of January. By that time we will have a voice messaging system up and running. This will allow parents to ring up 24 hours a day and get details of payments and arrears. The exciting news is that we are working on a vastly superior phone service-an autobank service for child support clients which will be known as the Child Support Infobank. This package is already in use in Massachusetts, and 60 per cent of calls there are answered electronically. In addition to the benefits of the voice messaging system where details of payments can be obtained, the infobank will also give information on things like arrears, the review processes, how to contact the local representative on the registrars advisory panel, the law and the operation of the child support act. People can receive a hard copy of that information by pressing the may star button. If they want to go through to an operator they can just press the hash button. I am told that this service has been enormously popular in Massachusetts. Like electronic banking, people have learnt to use it fairly quickly. Evidence shows that the clients in Massachusetts are attracted by the privacy that the child support infobank offers. It has greatly improved its client service and it has freed up staff for the difficult cases. Best of all, it is not all that expensive. In relation to world's best practice, I can tell the honourable member that in many areas we are the model for the world's best practice. With collection rates at around 70 per cent we are amongst the best in the world. By comparison the United States, which has had a service operating for about 20 years, has a collection rate of about 19 per cent. Over the next few years, we will also be employing another 150 staff to assist with the collection of arrears because we know that we can do much better. We are also amongst the world leaders in public education. In fact, the British and the Americans are very excited about our schools information kit which gives students at school information on the Child Support Agency and which instils the message that parenthood is a lifetime responsibility. This video has been requested by the United States and the United Kingdom and it will be distributed throughout their schools. The British are eyeing our child support scheme with a lot of interest. In fact, they asked one of our senior Child Support Agency officers to go to England and give evidence before a parliamentary committee. Two members of the British Parliament on that committee came out to Australia to have a look at the secret of the success of our agency. Just last night",44

148,Mr BARRY JONES,PRIVILEGE," Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a matter of privilege. I wish to raise an issue of potential applicability to us all. When the proposed new electoral boundaries for Victoria were released by the Australian Electoral Commission in August, members of parliament and electors generally were given an opportunity to object and to submit amendments to the redistribution, as provided in the act. One honourable member from this side of House made such an objection, and proposed new boundaries. As I understand it, he was told that his objections could only be considered today, 20 September, a parliamentary sitting day. If this is correct, then the honourable member was given Buckley's choice: he could attend the AEC hearing or he could attend the parliament and lose the chance to put his case. The process adopted by the AEC appears to be one of blatant disregard to the primary obligation of members to attend the parliament when it is sitting. I submit that, if the AEC has insisted that the honourable member should attend during this sitting week instead of hearing his objections last week, next week or Friday of this week, which is not a sitting day, it has forced to him to absent himself from a parliamentary sitting and, therefore, he is in breach of the privileges of the House. Mr Deputy Speaker, I draw your attention to section 49 of the constitution. I also draw your attention to section 14 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987, which states: (a) a member shall not be required to attend before a court or a tribunal ... on any which the House of which that Member is a member meets. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) is in a comparable situation. He was also told that he could discuss matters that concerned him, but only today and only by a telephone call which would be made at a time that suited the commission and not him. It seems to me that there has been a prima facie breach of privilege. On behalf of the House, I ask you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to draw to the AEC's attention its obligation to observe the rules of the House and to recognise the primary obligation of members to attend. I ask you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to write to the AEC, drawing its attention to section 14 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 and inviting it to observe the act when calling members before it.",45

153,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAPERS,"Mr Speaker received a letter from the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The escalation of the severe drought crisis resulting from the lack of Government policy the delay and inadequacy of its response. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen places",47
154,Mr ANDERSON,PAPERS,"Tomorrow, the government, having been dragged kicking and screaming to reality and having been embarrassed by the generosimental ty of so many Australians doing what it ought to cope with. to have done in the first place, is going to release what we are told will be a substantial response to the horrendous problem of severe drought that is stalking our land at this It will want to be a substantial response. This drought is now a major national problem which demands a proper national response in the national economic interest. The whole tragic scenario has been far worse than it needed to have been and should be because of a lack of appropriate government policy in the years prior to the drought and the years building up to the drought and national economy. because of a belated reaction when the inevitable happened and we hit a biggie-a severe drought. This fundamental principle in sound ecointerim nomic management ought to be drawn to the attention of those opposite: a stitch in time cannot only save nine; it can produce substantial extra wealth. Carefully targeted, wellconstructed economic policies can help farmers do three critical things: first, to prepare for downturns, including regularly recurring drought; second, to survive downincluding regularly recurring minor droughts; and, third, to recover from drought. . We have not had those carefully targeted and policies in this country. We have had Drought a set of misdirected policy approaches that have left farmers almost totally unprepared for has what has descended upon them. The farm sector went into this severe drought. This is not merely some recurring environmental reality that farmers have to live with, as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) told Queenslanders in Townsville a few short weeks ago. He has now seen the error of his and ways. He spent 21/2 hours face to face with farmers. How much time did he spend with the fashion parade the week before in Sydney? He spent 21h hours with farmers in Queensland and he is now an expert on what in their is happening in the bush.",47
155,Mr HOWARD,PAPERS,Four years for seamen and Leader four hours for farmers.,47
156,Mr ANDERSON,PAPERS,That is right. He has seen the error of his ways. He is now not saying that it is a naturally recurring environphenomenon that farmers have to learn Mr Ruddock-Walshie is.,47
157,Mr ANDERSON,PAPERS,Walshie put farmers in time. a position where they could not cope. So much for his understanding. Mr Beddall-He was a farmer.,47
158,Mr ANDERSON,PAPERS,"Yes. He stripped IEDs at the very time when they could have saved a lot of this national heartache. The Prime Minister, having done a 180 degree tum, now acknowledges that this is a national problem in blighting one of the major sectors of the But I digress. The point I wanted to make is that, largely because of the sort of environment the government has given them to operate in, farmers went into this horrendous circumstance financially stricken. As we sit here today, our farm sector owes $17.3 billion. There are five major areas of culpability on this government's part. Firstly, it ran for a high inflation economy. Farmers who export most of their product-and have to compete on international markets, where they cannot pass on the increased costs of productionfound that their costs were rising by anything from 10 per cent to 14 per cent every year throughout the 1980s. That undergirded a major collapse in their terms of trade. Secondly, we had interest rates way above those levels that our competitors enjoyed, if that is the word. For one stretch, farmers paid interest in excess of 20 per cent for over 18 months. Even today, my rural counsellor friends tell me that most of the people they have on their books are paying between 14 and 15 per cent in interest. So much for the sort of salvation through lower interest rates that we hear about endlessly in this place. As the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) pointed out today, while the government is talking about what it is doing to help the farmers, it is running an economic policy that is seeing interest rates continually rise. We have just had a rise of three-quarters of one per cent. That cost the farm sector $120 million. We are told that we are going to get another one per cent increase before Christmas and that will cost the farm sector another $170 million. Thirdly, the government is culpable because it expected farmers to cop the full costs of deregulation. It left everyone else featherbedded-insulated from the harsh realities of economic life-while it stripped away every modicum of assistance that the farm sector got. So why is it, for example, that, after all the reports throughout all those years highlighting this problem, it still costs up to times more in this country to process a kilo of meat than it does in America, or twice what it costs in New Zealand or Argentina? They are countries we actually have to compete with in Asia. While you mob talk endlessly about how competitive we are now in Asia, you refuse to get on in the area of reforms which will actually make us competitive.",47
159,Mr HOWARD,PAPERS,Wally Curran's executive.,48
160,Mr ANDERSON,PAPERS,"Wally Curran. He would know a lot about improving productiviyears ty. Building on that, why should it be that Australia's producers miss out year after year on the returns they ought to be getting for their primary production because you mob refuse to allow those other sectors that impact on their competitiveness to face the chill winds of deregulation, of real competition, of real pressure to perform? Why is it that we have just had an IC report indicating that Australian beef producers have to take much lower farm prices for their product so that we can be competitive on international markets as everything post-gate in this country is so ineffective? Mrs Moylan-Shipping doesn't suffer that way.",48
161,Mr ANDERSON,PAPERS,"Shipping? Let us not get into shipping. We ought to just remember that the minister over there who keeps saying that he is the farmers' salvation reckons that he will do for farmers what he did for wharfies. That will be a great start, will it not? Yes, $400 million would be a good start, but it would be a damn sight better if he would do something about getting in there and cleaning up the mess.",48
162,Mr HOWARD,PAPERS,Do farmers have to pay income tax?,48
163,Mr ANDERSON,PAPERS,"Farmers do have to pay income tax. Just as a matter of interest, since it was raised, if the same largesse were extended to the farm sector as has been to the waterfront workers-who have just got their special deal on pay-as-you-earn tax-the farm sector would get a farm relief package of $350 million. If you wanted to do away with indirect tax burdens, you could find well over three $1 billion as well that none of our farm competitors abroad face. Can you lot over there not understand that the refusal to institute proper industrial relations flexibility and pro-business tax reforms in this country guts the capacity of the rural sector not only to survive downturns like this but to prosper and to put aside reserves in good times? Fourthly, you are culpable because you gutted lEOs-the prudent farmers' drought insurance-just when they were most needed. Farmers could have put away hundreds of millions in those couple of years when they did have a bit of cash in the late 1980s and there were a few profits about. But, no, the government wanted the tax. I put it to you in very simgJe terms that that decision was made at a costl1ot just to the farmers involved but to the nation as well. It was a short-sighted policy not just for farmers but for the national economy as well. Fifthly, the government, having stripped away the mechanisms that were in place for coping with severe drought in this country, despite constant warnings that a different approach would be needed for severe drought as opposed to the normal dry spells we get in this country, did not heed those warnings. The inevitable happened: we ran into another severe drought and the government was caught with nothing in place. Let me just state the obvious: there is a difference between those regular dry spells that we get every three or four years in this country that farmers should be enabled and facilitated to prepare for and the sort of severe natural disaster type of drought that we get every 15 years or so, which has plainly now descended upon us in many areas. The cost in human terms of this policy inadequacy from a party that says it cares about people is enormous. It is highly visible. It comes in at us virtually every night now on our TV screens. Australians have been generous. They have done what the government would not do and we applaud that generosity. Personally, I am very glad it has been there, but I believe it is a disgrace that one sector the Australian community finds that, when hard times decimate it, it has to rely on food parcels provided by the rest of the community through its generosity. That has done a lot to build stress levels out there. They have been massively increased. People have to cope not just with seeing their life's work disappear before them but also with the agonies of wondering how on earth they are going to provide for their families' basic needs. It seems to me that this has been something of an unsung story, particularly in its impact on women. Women are often the unsung heroes out there, supporting stressed out, overworked husbands while they too feel stressed out and overworked. They are supporting their husbands out in the paddock as they try to keep their livestock alive. Mr Charles-Do they get stress leave?",48
164,Mr ANDERSON,PAPERS,"They do not get stress leave. They are out there trying to run homes and keep life on as even a keel as possible for their children. The kids are bearing the brunt, too. They are bearing the frustrations as they boil over at home. In some instances they are also facing the appalling problem of taking on board guilt. A social worker in Toowoomba told me a couple of years ago now-this problem has been around for quite a while; the government has just woken up to it-that often the kids see mum and dad going through hell and say to themselves, 'Mum and Dad are going through this to give me a chance. They are doing this for me. If I were not here they would not be in this mess. If I were not here they could escape it all,' and they start to take on guilt. I find that pretty gut wrenching. This is not simply a welfare matter. It is a question of the national economic interest. Having made the problem so much worse by its appalling economic management, the government must now act to keep as much of this nation's farm assets intact as possible against that day when rain does come, against that day when we then expect the rural sector to get back on its feet quickly and start producing national export dollars again. The costs of not doing so will be immense. Report after report from Queensland in of particular, but now increasingly from the rest of the nation, highlights the sell-off of breeding stock in this country-particularly cows in calf in Queensland-and the loss of export income both now and after the drought from the biggest rural export industry is potentially enormous. If we do not take some steps now to prevent it happening, those costs will go on for years after the drought ends. Wool International-it is interesting that seems to be more observant about what is happening in this context than the Australian government-reckons that international wool buyers are worried that wool growers will not be able to restock if they lose their flocks now. They are watching the scene and saying, 'There is plenty of wool now in the stockpile, but if growers lose their flocks they are not going to be able to rebuild them because they are so financially weakened.' Wool International sees the problem, yet this mob opposite apparently cannot. The government does not seem able to perceive that, without adequate measures now not only to meet the welfare needs-if you like, the relief side of the equation-but also to ensure retention of our farmers and their asset base and recovery when rains come, very expensive things will happen. We will lose more farmers and their production. We will payout still more in re-establishment grants and subsequent welfare payments. Let me put it to the House that, if we lose another 4,000 farmers as a result of this drought and the government's inactivity, and they all claim their re-establishment grants, the government will have to payout well over $200 million directly in re-establishment grants and it will then have to support them on welfare. We will see more and more people lose their jobs in post farm gate activities-the feedlot industry, the abattoir industry, the food processing industry. I remind you that the biggest sector of the manufacturing industry in this country is the food processing sector. Above all, we will lose much needed export income, in very large slabs, on an ongoing basis. We have consistently tried to highlight the critical importance of preserving breeding flocks and herds. In a severe drought, feed grain becomes the major fodder reserve. We have seen prices rise from $100 at silo to around $200 now. It is cold comfort for graziers to know that they are now getting close to as high as they will go because they are hitting the cap of international grain prices. Just as it did in 1982, lack of supply is driving the price. It happened in 1982 it before the subsidy was introduced; it has happened again this time. The problem is that graziers, not knowing how long this will continue and faced with their own huge financial problems, are right now making the decision to let their stock go or, worse, simply die. The Commonwealth should stop ducking this very important national issue and address it squarely. This country cannot afford a wholesale reduction in such an important asset as its breeding flocks and herds. Therefore, the test against which tomorrow's package must be evaluated is whether it properly meets the three Rsrelief, retention and recovery. (Time expired)",49
165,Mr BEDDALL,PAPERS,"Rankin-Minister for Resources) (3.51 p.m.}-May I say at the outset that never has it been so clearly shown that the once great National Party is out of touch. If you listened to the 15-minute speech by the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia, the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), you would know that there was nothing in it about what the National Party would propose. What we heard was a history recital. Anybody can sit there and write history. A few weeks ago the Deputy Leader of the National Party launched a so-called drought policy. After that attempt at a drought policy sank without trace, you have an absolute gall to bring on this MPI. It is really about members in drought affected electorates getting attacked by farmers saying, 'What does the National Party think? What does the National Party propose?' Of course the answer is: absolutely nothing. The farm sector is saying that only the Labor government can help it. What you all forget, sitting over there in your smug numbers, shrinking at each election, is that the Labor Party represents more country seats than the National Party. The reality is that you are no longer a country party. Thankfully you have changed your name to the National Party and do not pretend to be a country party any more. Let us look at what the Deputy Leader of the National Party put up last week. The government's national drought policy was introduced in July 1992. It followed a unanimous decision reached by all state and federal ministers. There was no dissent. I remind the Deputy Leader of the National Party that in July 1992 we were already in a drought. We all knew that there was a drought at that stage. In contrast to your policy, our drought policy is forward looking. It is based on the need to encourage sustainable farming systems, promoting greater self-reliance and, importantly, providing support for farmers who are caught in exceptional circumstances-circumstances that are outside what usually occurs in normal drought. Your policy wants us to go backwards. You want us to bring in elements that all the state and territory governments unanimously agreed were totally inappropriate for the long-term sustain ability of the Australian farming system. You talked about fodder subsidies then, but we have not heard a word about them today. In the Courier-Mail the other day, Peter Charlton said: Recently National Party deputy leader John Anderson astounded his colleaguesyes, astounded his colleaguesby proclaiming his support for fodder subsidies. This form of drought relief popular in the past has been widely rorted and thus discredited. Those are comments I made to you in the House when you asked me a question about it. Carlton went on to say: Mr Anderson put forward the policy without consulting his colleagues or the rural lobby groups such as the National Farmers Federation. What more damning criticism could I make? The farm lobby and the bankers have done it for me. You know as well as I do that the real beneficiaries from subsidies such as you propose are the freight transporters and the fodder suppliers. What price signals does this coalition policy send? Does it support those who have planned well or those who have failed to plan for the future? The message delivered in your policy is opposite to that which was unanimously agreed to by all state and Commonwealth governments.",50
166,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAPERS,Mr Rocher)Order! The honourable minister will direct his remarks through the chair.,51
167,Mr BEDDALL,PAPERS,I am. I am talking about the policy. I am directing them to you.,51
168,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAPERS,I will just explain to the minister that they are not my policies. I do not have a view on them.,51
169,Mr BEDDALL,PAPERS,"I should say its policies. Its policy is backward looking, encourages resource degradation and could well jeopardise our future farming potential. The opposition proposals are based on untargeted assistance to farmers in drought affected areas. It will only encourage unsustainable farm management practices by encouraging farmers to maintain stock at levels the farm cannot sustain. It targets support at freight contractors and suppliers, not at farmers. You would build in a price increase for all farmers who use fodder. Not only farmers who are drought affected but also those who are not drought affected would have to pay the cost of increased fodder prices. Our national drought policy is forward looking. Unlike yours, it follows extensive discussions and agreements with the states. As I said last sitting, all you are interested in doing is",51
170,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAPERS,Order! The minister is still doing what I asked him not to do. The minister will direct his remarks through the chair.,51
171,Mr BEDDALL,PAPERS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I take your point. As I said at the last sitting, all the opposition is doing-is that better?",51
172,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAPERS,"Yes, that is all right. You should know that.",51
173,Mr BEDDALL,PAPERS,"AII the opposition is trying to do is score political points. We have had a positive response to the announcement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) over the last few dayscomments that recognise the seriousness of the issues that this country faces. On television this morning, Rick Farley of the National Farmers Federation said that the government was heading in the right direction. The opposition wants to play games with one of the most serious issues facing this country. The opposition should be putting forward real policies. Not once in 15 minutes did we get a proposition put forward by the Deputy Leader of the National Party. Just look at the situation the opposition is playing around with while we are facing this issue seriously. Parts of Queensland and northern New South Wales have been in drought for some four years. The drought in a number of areas is amongst the worse on record. Unfortunately, the outlook is for little improvement. Australia could be in drought until April 1995 at the earliest and drought could persist into the spring of 1995 in northern Australia. Let us hope that these predictions are wrong. Drought will reduce the net value of farm production by $1.3 billion and the value of farm exports by some $450 million in 199495. Australia's winter crop is forecast to fall by 40 per cent to around 17 million tonnes this year. For the nation at large, economic growth is likely to reduce by five percentage points in 1994 as a direct result of the drought. Yet all the opposition wants to do is try to score some cheap political points. The opposition knows that the cabinet has drought on its agenda for tomorrow. The opposition has tried to get up with this weak MPI. The opposition does not have any real answers. The opposition re-runs old discredited policies. We will wait for the announcement of a new opposition policy while we get on with the job of providing relief to the farm sector. The opposition also tries to argue that we delayed a response to the drought. I take this opportunity to debunk this myth. Since September 1992 the Commonwealth has allocated $47.2 million in direct drought assistance through the rural adjustment scheme. The government has also agreed to match, on a dollar for dollar basis, the 'Farmhand' public drought appeal brought forward by Channel 9. At present, the 'Farmhand' appeal, through the Nine Network, has raised $4 112 million and the estimates are that, with the Commonwealth matching commitment, the total could amount to $10 million. The states have also provided significant drought support. Since 1991 the Queensland and New South Wales governments have provided over $60 million for drought relief. Last August the Commonwealth provided an extra $14 million package. It included an extra $2112 million in exceptional circumstances support under RAS to Queensland. This was in addition to the $4.5 million for drought assistance under RAS for Queensland in the last budget. The package also contained an extra $5 million exceptional circumstances support to New South Wales as well as the extension of the Task project in Queensland and into New South Wales. There was also some $1.39 million to increase financial and family counselling and communicate financial assistance measures available for drought. We have also announced relaxation of guidelines for eligibility under the assistance for isolated children's scheme. Our policy approach encourages primary producers to adopt self reliant approaches in managing risk. That is what has been done to date and cabinet, of course, will go much further tomorrow. We have never sat back and said that it was a one-off effort. We always review our policies to make sure that they keep on hitting the mark. A special task force has been established in the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, and a Commonwealth interdepartmental committee has been convened to consider the adequacy of Commonwealth programs. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) and the department have consulted widely with key groups, including the National Farmers Federation, rural counsellors, private charity groups and the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council. Continuing talks have also taken place with affected states. A special meeting of the Agricultural and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand has been called for Friday to discuss the drought issues-in other words, all state and Commonwealth ministers will meet this Friday. Senator Collins has also undertaken to review the RAS exceptional circumstances guidelines, and the advisory council has been asked to provide the minister with advice on possible changes to RAS to address perceived problems. In the past-in the opposition's time-drought assistance measures provided by the state and territory governments varied significantly but generally took the form of concessional loans for carry-on purposes or for very specific purposes, such as financial aid for eligible activities. Since the signing of the national drought policy statement in 1992, the states and territories have moved towards implementing its range of measures-measures based on the principles of sustainable development, risk management, productivity growth and structural adjustment in the farm sector. This has generally involved the phasing out of transaction based subsidies that may have been provided during periods of drought. Unfortunately, these things are way beyond the comprehension of the National Party, which is only on about rhetoric and trying to look good and present an image of caring. But all of us know of its faults because its own spokespeople are saying these things to the government. The government has never run away from recognising the seriousness of the position facing our farm sector. In New South Wales, average farm cash income for broadacre farms is expected to fall, unfortunately, by around 50 per cent in 1994-95 to $19,500 per farm. It is a great tragedy that some 26 per cent of farms are expected to have negative farm cash income in the financial year 1994-95. The largest relative falls in income are expected in the wheat and other crops industry, where average farm cash income is expected to fall from $161,700 in 1993-94 to around minus $8,300 in 1994-95. Many of these farms had well above average crops in 1993-94, which highlights the variability the rural sector faces. Farm cash incomes in the livestock industries in New South Wales are expected to remain relatively unchanged in 1994-95. In the sheep industry, higher prices for wool are likely to offset slightly lower production and increased fodder costs, but the level of income is forecast to continue to remain at depressed levels. In the beef industry, forced slaughterings are expected to maintain incomes in the short run. However, the cost of restocking properties is likely to reduce incomes in later years. Average farm cash income for broadacre farms in Queensland in 1994-95 is expected to fall by around 15 per cent to $33,200. Unfortunately, some 38 per cent of farms in Queensland are expected to suffer negative farm cash income in 1994-95.

179,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAPERS,The honourable member will remain quiet.,53
180,Mr BEDDALL,PAPERS,"Not one of the National Party's peak organisations supports it. Unfortunately, as we know, the impact of the drought does not stop at the farm gate. The decline in rural output as a result of drought affects other sectors in the economy. It is estimated that for each one dollar in decline in net value of production in the farm sector there is a decline in the non-farm sector of around 50c. This is why the government sees this as an important issue to he addressed by cabinet tomorrow. Consequently, the reduction in Australia's national income as a result of the drought is estimated at around $2 billion. This is equivalent to economic growth of around 0.5 perfodder centage points lower than in 1994-95. Mr Bruce Scott-82-83?",53
181,Mr BEDDALL,PAPERS,"In 1982-83 it is estimated that national income declined by around 1.1 per cent as a result of the drought in that year-the last drought. Remember 1982-83even the last big drought. The 1982-83 drought ket. also coincided with the general economic goes up. recession in Australia, which would inflate the estimateMr Bruce Scott-Was it a normal part of life like the Prime Minister said?",54
182,Mr BEDDALL,PAPERS,The honourable member for Maranoa should learn a bit of history.,54
183,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAPERS,"He should the remain quiet, too.",54
184,Mr BEDDALL,PAPERS,You want to try to say that the policies now in place with the states are ineffective. Let us look at them again. Let me take you back over them. I know you are all very slow learners. As I said before national drought policy was agreed to by states and the Commonwealth in 1992. The policy outlined a new approach to drought whole. throughout Australia. It was agreed that transition based subsides would be eliminated and the support provided to farmers experiencing drought-(Ttme expired),54
185,Mr WAKELIN,PAPERS,"This is a cartoon in last week's Australian. Perhaps it is inappropriate to make jest of what talking about. It shows this wonderful cartoon of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on the wonderful trip he made last week talking to a farmer. The farmer is saying, 'The rain seems to have missed us again,' and just to the right we see this big black cloud and money bucketing down on the maritime unions. In between, in the citadel, we see a remote little Parliament House in the picture. If ever there was a way of describing to the Australian people what this government's attitude is to agriculture and to farmers, that high cartoon says it all. I will deal quickly with the fodder ABARE estimates that fodder prices rose by only 15 per cent while the subsidy was in place in 1982-83. But that is only half the equation. The other thing to remember is that prices rise substantially during drought anyway. It was happening in 1982-83 when !he subsidy was introduced and it is happentog now. In fact, feed grain prices have doubled from about $100 a tonne at the start of the year to $200 a tonne now. That is the problem with the government. It does not understand the fundamentals of a marIf there is a shortage of supply, the price The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) talks about the benefits going to the freight forwarders and to the fodder suppliers. It is a bit like saying, 'If you provide OSS or CES benefits, then the benefits are going to the office of the CES or OSS.' That is what you are saying. Because people are actually employed in the social welfare industry, they will receive the benefit. That is the nonsense of it. . Fo-er Senator Walsh had an interesting pIece to the Australian Financial Review this the morning. Over the years he developed to an all art form the ability to hate farmers.",54
186,Mr COBB,PAPERS,Like the Labor Party as a,54
187,Mr WAKELIN,PAPERS,"It is typical of the Labor Party. But the cynical part about Walsh was that I think it was his ticket for preselection to the Senate. He climbed up on the backs of farmers to get into the ALP and to get into the Senate. He has done it for 20 years and he we are is still doing it. That is the tragedy. I remember 1988 very well. I was a farmer on the Eyre Peninsula and Walsh pulled drought out of the natural disaster relief arrangements. What had the government done just five years before? It had abolished IEOs. The then opposition offered sensible amendments which would have overcome any difficulties. What did this government do? It threw the baby out with the bath water. There were no IEOs in 1983. We went through the interest rates, we struck the crash in commodity prices and then, in 1988, the government pulled the rug on NORA. That is subsidy. the way Walsh does it. Mr Bruce Scott-And the Labor Party.",54
188,Mr WAKELIN,PAPERS,"Certainly the Labor Party. Let us talk a little about drought. We now have an urban dominant culture in this country. But at least on this side of the House we have people who have had some experience with self-employment and agriculture. Many of us have experienced the effects of drought. There is a lot of nonsense talked about subsidies. I do not know a farmer who, if he had a choice, would not take a better price or a profit. He would always take that ahead of a subsidy. He will never look for a subsidy while he can get a decent margin out of what he is trying to do. The government loves to do it this way. It loves to get farmers to their knees, because it does not understand them, and offer two bob at the end of the day. Let us look at agriculture. This government is very good at telling us how good it is at diversifying this economy and that we no longer depend on agriculture; agriculture is not much value to the economy any more; we have all this value adding and all these wonderful things that we do. But it is estimated that about 30 per cent of the Australian work force depends on the agricultural industry from paddock to plate. It is estimated that, for every person employed in agricultural production, 5.7 people are employed in the economy. Thus 1.95 million people are employed in the total industry, from farming to retailing. Yet here we are saying that agriculture is not of much account, not much value to the country, and tomorrow we are going to talk about a $100 million package, which, as the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) said, will be wiped out by a $170 million interest rate rise. Just one interest rise doubles the effect of any benefit that a government package might bring. Mr Bruce Scott-It is $120 million already.",54
189,Mr WAKELIN,PAPERS,"Exactly. That is not to mention the 1993 budget. There was an increase in excise, an increase in indirect taxation, in all those various imposts that ultimately come back to the export sector. But let us not look too narrowly. Let us look at the wider political implications. This government talks about regional development. It offers $150 million over four years, but it will take $2 billion by way of extra excise in 1995-96. That is the government's equation: it gives two bob and takes $2. I do not know how long it will be before regional Australia wakes up to this. I think many of them are waking up to it. But, for the 35 per cent who rely on agriculture for employment, the people who are employed in small businesses in every town in this country, except, fortunately, in Western Australia, this drought is spreading right across the nation. The people who are employed, the small businesses, the machinery dealers, all those people who make up the infrastructure of a town, have been damaged by 10 to 12 years of neglect by Labor governments. We accept that drought is a phenomenon of our cycle in this country. We do not accept that it is to be run alongside all these imposts, all these burdens and all these crocodile tears that we see from the government at times like this. The Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) made some play about country health. The massive generosity that has gone to country health is very interesting. The reality is that of the 600 people that will go into universities to become medical practitioners, as I understand it, about 80 males and 220 females will be available to the whole country. That will not even be a replacement rate for the whole country. Guess who will again miss out? Regional Australia. We cannot even get from this government the right rate of replacement for medical practitioners. Guess who will get hurt because of rate that? More than anyone else, regional Australia. I mentioned at the beginning of my speech the hypocrisy regarding ANL. After a fiveday strike-bang, all the money is provided and away we go. There is no problem in providing $150 million for the Cahill Expressway. Mr Sciacca-Get into him, Harry.",55
190,Mr WAKELIN,PAPERS,"The minister at the table says, 'Get into him.' I do not think that will achieve anything. I think that the government needs to face up to its responsibility of 10 years of neglect of agriculture and focus on the reality of the benefit it brings to this country. It should overcome its national schizophrenia which does so much damage not only to rural Australia but to the whole country. That is what we have to come to terms with.",55
191,Mr HARRY WOODS,PAPERS,"page) (4.16 p.m.)From the very outset let me say that the federal Labor Party is vitally concerned with the rural sector and the difficulties that it is presently facing. Over recent years, the rural sector has experienced a great deal of hardship. Successive years of weak commodity prices, world recession and declining terms of trade have resulted in low incomes for many. Farmers have responded to these financial pressures by increasing on-farm productivity and/or reducing expenditure. However, for many farmers, the capacity for adjustment and productivity is stretched. This has been exacerbated by the present widespread drought. The federal Labor Party has had policies to address those problems in the past. It presently has, and will in the future have, policies regarding drought, including the package that will be presented tomorrow. For the opposition, particularly the National Party, which at the present time is absolutely discredited in a policy sense, to come in here and carry on in its hypocritical way-the same way that it has done for years-shows an enormous amount of gall and hide. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) has recently been criticised for going to various meetings-Liberal Party meetings in Western Australia, League of Rights meetings and other meetings-and simply telling people what they wanted to hear. He did not tell people what the policy was; he let them know what they wanted to hear. I do not know whether he has learnt that from the National Party, but that is what the National Party has been doing for years. The National Party suffers from chronic hypocrisy. It goes out to its meetings and morning teas in the bush and thinks all it has to do is say 'cow', 'church' and 'fodder subsidy' a few times and it will get away with anything. People are starting to wake up to the hypocrisy of you lot. Nothing in that hypocrisy is more plain than the tripe in a paper put out-or leaked-a few months ago by the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott). For the benefit of the rest of the honourable members, I will tell them a bit about that paper. The honourable member talks about winning the vote of influential community leaders. This concerns rural and regional development because he is the shadow spokesman. He talks about infrastructure. He says, 'We need to set a figure-$1 billion, $3 billion.' He further says, 'The actual number is insignificant.' In other words, go out and promise people the world; forget about having to pay for those promises because they will not be carried out. In the same paragraph regarding those promises he says, 'We should then allude to some sort of assessment procedure by which regions can seek direct funding out of that $1 billion or $3 billion.' He says we must create a perception of reducing costs of businesses-for example, reduce payroll tax. He says similarly that any reduction in business regulation, most of which is state based anyway, will be well perceived. Then he goes on about community services in much the same vein as infrastructure. He says we need to make a commitment. This commitment traverses several portfolios, including health, education and telecommunications. Again, the actual dollar value is unimportant. So he says, 'Let's go out there and promise the world.' That is exactly what the National Party does time and time again. It has a leader, the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer), who is an embarrassment not only to the National Party but to the whole of the government. He goes well with the Leader of the Opposition, who is a joke in the whole of the country. No wonder they cannot come up with policies with well-constructed ideas. We heard the Deputy Leader of the National Party, the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), talking about well-constructed policy, yet in his media release he stated that the central piece, the key element, of his policy was to support the immediate introduction of a drought relief fodder subsidy scheme to help offset the massive cost of feeding livestock. We certainly do not doubt that there is a need and a massive cost in feeding livestock, but he says support is needed for the immediate introduction of a drought relief fodder subsidy similar to that provided in the 1982-83 drought. What do other people have to say about it? On Wednesday, 31 August the Canberra Times reported that Gary Goucher, the National Farmers Federation director of policy, said that the opposition-and I think he understated it-was a bit out of step with the industry. I think it is one of the great understatements of the century to say it is a bit out of step. With regard to the fodder subsidy, those opposite should realise-and I am sure they do-that it sounds good when they go out and talk in the country halls and say 'fodder subsidy'. They think it sounds good. Fodder subsidies encourage bad managers to retain overstocking on land for much longer than the stock should be carried on the land. It leads to massive land degradation and loss of topsoil. It is an appalling proposition from an economic perspective and from a planning, management and farm perspective. Fodder subsidies are the centrepiece of the opposition's drought policy. Those opposite interject about understanding what is going on and having the right policies-and they come up with this tripe. It was stated in the Courier-Mail recently that the farming industry rejected the coalition's drought policy as incomplete and unsubstantial. The National Farmers Federation policy director, Gary Goucher, said that the centrepiece of the coalition's policy, a subsidy for fodder, was riddled with problems. He said there was a range of unexplained areas. How do you get over that? You stand up here and say, 'We know all about it,' and come up with that sort of absolute rubbish and tripe. Mr Bruce Scott-The Prime Minister said it's a natural part of life.",56
192,Mr HARRY WOODS,PAPERS,"In my view, after what I have just said about your sort of policy you would be well advised to keep your mouth shut. The programs and policies of the federal Labor Party are designed for the long term and the short term. They are programs to improve farm productivity by encouraging an efficient and technologically advanced agricultural base which is commercially and market oriented, internationally competitive and participates fully in value adding and strong linkages. Elements for the structural adjustment include the rural adjustment scheme, the farm household support scheme, the jobsearch allowance and the rural and financial counselling programs. This terrible drought is hurting a lot of country people. We have the national drought policy, which involves publicity and awareness campaigns, property management planning, education and training, farm management bonds, resource management, income tax incentives and drought research and development. We are encouraging the pick-up of the technology through the rural research and development corporations with heavy government backing and commercialisation extension and demonstration support. There are landcare, water and vegetation, sustainable development and a whole range of other programs that try to address the problems. If we compare that with what the opposition offers, it is no wonder that the farming organisations have realised that their only hope is this government. The weak and shillyshally leadership of both the National Party and the Liberal Party can never provide an answer for them. It worries the National Party and Liberal Party when they look at the recent polls. The poll that came out today was conducted after the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) visited drought affected areas in Queensland and it shows that the government has an enormous lead. I do not take any great comfort from that. It would be good if the National Party or the opposition came up with policies that made sense and that we could take notice of and work together on. Whilst the National Party continues with this hypocritical tripe and rubbish and continues to have an absolutely inexcusable lack of understanding for the needs of country people things will not change. The hypocrisy of the opposition was demonstrated very amply in the paper produced by the honourable member for Maranoa. (Time expired)",57

I have moved these amendments together because we will not call divisions on them. Amendment No. 23 seeks to add after proposed subsection 191U(2) that 'section 47 of the Native Title Act 1993 does not apply to land acquired by a body corporate, person or trust under subsection (1)'. We believe it is extremely important that Aboriginal people who acquire land have the same flexibility as others with respect to what they do with their land. The amendment will not affect Aboriginal occupation and use of the land. The community can make the choice as to what it wants to do with the land. However, it allows greater flexibility for the community to sell or mortgage the land or use it as security. In other words, it can operate the land commercially through normal commercial practices. This offers Aboriginal communities the chance to establish an economic base as well as a social and cultural base. Amendment No. 24 seeks to omit paragraph (a) and substitute: 'a Chairperson appointed by the Prime Minister'. This is in relation to the board of the ILC. Under the present bill, all members are appointed by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. Under the circumstances, we feel that there is the danger of the minister having too narrow a focus. We have widened this to have a chairperson appointed by the Prime Minister and a deputy chairperson appointed by the Minister for Finance.",60
200,Mr SNOWDON,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"Northern TerritoryParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training) (4.35 p.m.)-I want to address amendment No. 23, which seeks to override a key element of the agreement reached between the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), on behalf of the government, and Aboriginal people in the native title negotiations so that the Native Title Act would not apply. It seems to me that amendment No. 23 exhibits very clearly for all the world to see the true intention of the opposition's position. It is effectively saying for that Aboriginal people who may purchase land under the land fund biII should, as a result of those purchases, disallow themselves from making application under the Native Title Act in relation to that land. I must say that I find that very difficult to understand. I cannot quite understand why the opposition is so opposed to it, unless this is another way of indicating its opposition to the Native Title Act. If that is the case-I assume that it is-it clearly demonstrates that the opposition has learnt absolutely nothing about the concerns and aspirations of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. In the course of this debate, the opposition has posited 37 amendments. Its support or otherwise for this bill is contingent upon the government accepting those amendments. Does it honestly believe that, given the passage of the Native Title Act, the Commonwealth would contemplate supporting a proposition which would deny Aboriginal people, who through this land fund bill would be able to purchase land, access to the Native Title Act? Frankly, I cannot think of anything sillier in terms of where the government is coming from and where the Aboriginal community is expecting the government to arrive at. It reflects very poorly on the opposition. In conversations with my constituents, a large proportion of whom are Aboriginal peopleroughly 23 or 24 per cent of the population of the Northern Territory is Aboriginal-I have not heard one Aboriginal person indicate one jot of support for these sorts of propositions. I invite the shadow spokesperson at the table, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), to indicate what ground swell of opinion amongst Aboriginal people has led them to this proposition. Why do you not just tell us truly what your agenda is? Why do you not make it clear to the Australian public that you have never had any intention of supporting this land fund? I doubt it but, given today's performance, she might have been the person who bleated to the Sydney Telegraph Mirror this morning that members of the opposition parties who want to support this land fund bill are being denied the opportunity to do so because of the tactics of the opposition. If that is the case, it reveals two things: firstly, the tactics of the opposition have been designed wholly and solely at frustrating the passage of this legislation; and, secondly, the opposition is. denying not only Aboriginal people in Australia access to the land fund bill-it has indicated its intention to oppose and frustrate it through the Senate-but also those people who have been dispossessed as a result of activities over the last 204 or 205 years to the native title legislation. I cannot see how the shadow spokesperson, who supposedly represents the interests of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians, can stand in this place and put forward those propositions. They have no substance, validity or credibility. These propositions which she has put forward have none of those attributes.",60
201,Mr MCLACHLAN,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"I think it is very important that speakers on the government side give some people on this side of the House some credit for having spent a considerable amount of time trying to design some responsibility into areas of the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill 1994. Time and again, government members have got up and said to us, 'This is what the Aboriginal people want and that is what the Aboriginal people want.' I can tell you that in this drought, which may be one of the greatest of all time, farmers want a lot of things too, but we know that good sense means they cannot have all of those things that they might want on any particular occasion. The government's duty is obviously to come up with a responsible bill which not only deals with the aspirations of Aborigines but also reassures a whole lot of other Australians that their rights are not going to be infringed either. The purpose of amendment No. 23 is to separate native title from the land acquisition fund. I will just take honourable members back to what was said in the preamble of the Native Title Act and in the explanatory memorandum: the land acquisition fund was for those Aborigines who had been dispossessed of native title. For reasons I explained earlier, it is now gone. Now we are going to acquire pastoral leases with the land acquisition fund. The government member who just spoke, the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon), said that Aboriginal people should not be prevented from attempting to establish that native title existed in those areas. But the whole purpose of this fund is to go into areas where native title was not able to be established. As the honourable member for CharIton (Mr Robert Brown) said a fortnight ago and again here this morning, that was the purpose of this bill. That is why we tried to get that previous amendment brought into this land acquisition fund biII-which you would not have. It was a perfectly innocuous amendment. It was actually almost word for word along the lines of your intention in the Native Title Bill. So here we are trying to separate the two so that you do not have a situation where tenure or title that exists at the present time is confused with native title. Let me give you one very good reason for that. Perhaps the minister sitting at the table, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), can explain something when he gets up. Let us say that we get foot-andmouth disease in this country. Can the minister tell me whether or not those areas subject to native title-with, in some cases, stringencies of access for other people-will be subject to the sorts of ingredients, terms, conditions, and instant and urgent actions that will be required to stop the progress of a disease like foot-and-mouth disease? I will the minister something. If he can answer that, I will be very surprised because the bureaucrats responsible for dealing with that matter in South Australia do not know the answer. I hope he can answer that in a positive sense. There are all sorts of problems and reservations that local councils have to deal with. They have the right to go onto people's properties and so do other institutions. As we have tried to do in several parts of the biII, we are trying to make sure that those original titles stay as they are: acquired by Aborigines under the ILC but with the title staying the same. I know that the minister does not know the answer. He has to ask his advisers but he might take some time to find out the answers to those questions because it is a very important matter for the future administration of country-by states, by local councils and by all sorts of authorities who have responsibility for those areas.",61
202,Mr GIBSON,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"The honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) is now introducing another element into this debate by talking about footand-mouth disease. It is a genuine concern and a genuine issue and I appreciate the fact that it is an issue that needs resolution, but let us not hide what is the real motivation behind this amendment. It has nothing to do with foot-and-mouth disease. It has nothing to do with any of the extraneous matters that the member for Barker might wish to bring into the debate. This is all about a re-run of the native title debate which the opposition so culpably failed to participate in last time by just ruling itself out of the debate by saying that it opposed the whole bill. It excluded itself from the process. It marginalised itself from the debate about native title. It exposed the shallowness of its policy position on native title in November last year and it is trying now to have another bite at the cherry by re-entering this whole debate about native title legislation. By this amendment the opposition is attempting to defeat one of the principal clauses in the Native Title Act to make sure it cannot apply. The honourable member for Barker in his tell contribution said that opposition members have tried to show some responsibility in designing amendments that they felt would make the legislation stronger and better, but the big problem opposition members have is that they have designed these amendments in total isolation. It is not a question of the government saying that we want to give everything to the Aboriginal community. Of course we know that that is not possible. Government will always have many more demands placed upon it than it can ever actually meet. The government has not tried to give everything that the Aboriginal community could possibly ever want through this legislation, but we have tried to negotiate with Aboriginal people about how they believe this this fund should operate and what types of operations should occur. There have been meaningful, mature negotiations between two sides to come up with a package of proposals that not only reflects the government's needs and responsibilities and the processes of accountability that are required in such legislation but also meets the aspirations and needs of Aboriginal people. That contrasts completely with the opposition's proposals and its modus operandi. It sits in its own quiet, little room and thinks up ways to sabotage this bill. That is what this amendment is all about. This is just one more plank in the opposition's attempt to sabotage the land acquisition fund and at the same time try to sabotage the native title legislation. It has nothing to do with higher, principled issues such as foot-and-mouth disease, which the honourable member for Barker knows that members on this side of the House would of course be very concerned about. Of course we would be making sure that every effort is made to ensure that we have procedures to handle that on native title land or on pastoral land or any other form of land. We have as much a sense of responsibility for the country and for pastoral activity as the opposition does. Let us not try to hide the real motivation behind those fine objectives. We know that the opposition is seeking in this legislation to discriminate against indigenous people who obtain land through the land fund and prevent them from exercising their rights under the native title legislation. The opposition has no right to do that. It is certainly not something it has arrived at because it has tried to consult with Aboriginal people and has found that this is something they want. This is something the opposition has dreamed up in its little committee room with no consultation whatsoever, with no consideration of the true aspirations of Aboriginal people. The government will not wear that. The Aboriginal communities around this country will not wear it and it is about time the opposition understood that, to arrive at good public policy, to handle Aboriginal and islander aspirations and needs, it cannot just think it up in its committee room the day before legislation is about to be presented in the House and then suggest that it has done the good deed of coming up with amendments. It actually has to go out and talk to people. It actually has to find out what they really want. I assure the opposition that Aboriginal people support the land acquisition fund as the government has structured it because the government consulted widely in structuring this legislation. It talked with Aboriginal organisations and individual Aboriginal people throughout the length and breadth of this country. They want the clauses as the government has provided, not the opposition's shoddy little amendments which are an attempt to in fact rewrite the native title legislation and deny Aboriginal people their legitimate aspirations.",62
203,Mrs GALLUS,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"I would just like to point out to the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) that one of the problems we are facing at the moment is the banks. Aboriginal people acquiring land have aspirations. Unfortunately, at the moment, where native title is involved the banks are refusing to lend money. So, when land is bought for Aboriginal people so they can develop that land-and I am not saying it has to be bought for that purpose, but when it is-and the land is subject to native title, the banks will not lend money. Those Aboriginal people are prevented from going through the normal means of commerce to obtain loans and mortgages from the banks to use that land in a profitable, economic way, to develop it and do all the other things that people want to do when they hold land for commercial reasons. So for the member for Moreton to suggest that there is something shoddy and underhanded about this does him no credit. I am surprised and disappointed that he has entered the debate in this way. I think you will find that it is in the interests of everybody that Aboriginal people have land that can be used to the fullest.",63
204,Mr ROBERT BROWN,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"I think it is important for us to put this amendment, together with a number of the other amendments, in context. I refer to a cutting from the Australian dated 26 August 1994-not so long ago. It referred to and quoted directly from a statement that had been made by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer), who said on Sydney radio on June 16: We've said that is the oppositionthat all along we would oppose the establishment of the fund. There were no qualifications-no ifs, no buts. It was a very firm, clear and unambiguous statement by the Leader of the Opposition. This item, credited to Lisa MCLean, is also interesting because the last paragraph refers to the shadow minister and states: Ms Gallus is a supporter in principle of the land acquisition fund and told The Australian on the day after she was appointed Aboriginal spokeswoman that she would support the Government's fund. We are going to test that. We will see whether in fact you support the government fund. You cannot claim that you are going to and then vote against it. You cannot claim that you are going to support it and then attempt to sabotage it. The honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) has admirably indicated in this debate the way in which you have attempted to do just that. The honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) made some quite reasonable observations, and I acknowledge them. He said, in effect, that we, the government, should give some credit to the opposition for the effort it put into building changes into this bill. That is a perfectly reasonable proposition, but I suggest to the honourable member for Barker that in order to obtain credit you have to earn it. We have all of these amendments that those opposite have proposed to this legislation, some of which they have acknowledged in the course of the debate are essentially peripheral and unimportant. But apparently they went through the whole of the bill and looked for every opportunity that they could find to build amendments into it. I gave reasons earlier today why they sought to do that. The honourable member for Barker also said that the government says that this is what the Aboriginal people want. Yes, we do. We say that because we asked them and we talked to them. You know that your shadow spokeswoman for Aboriginal affairs indicated that she does not do that. She indicated today that she got a comment from the Aboriginal community from television last night. It is all right for the shadow minister to sit at the desk, huff and puff and show exasperation, but that is what she said. She also said, according to Lisa MCLean-and I repeat iton the day after she was appointed Aboriginal spokeswoman that she would support the land fund. We will see. The honourable member for Moreton drew attention to the fact that in connection with .the Native Title Bill those opposite made themselves irrelevant. They marginalised themselves. For goodness sake, they left it to the minor parties and the Independents in the Senate to make the running as far as these issues were concerned. Now, through the back door, they are attempting to achieve in this particular legislation what they were not able to achieve and what they did not seek to achieve with the native title legislation. All members on the government side are generous people. We would seek to give credit to those who make a genuine attempt to build strengths into the legislation-not to people who make, from their point of view, a genuine effort to sabotage or to destroy the intent of the legislation. This proposed amendment threatens the whole thrust and purpose of this legislation-legislation through which the government and, coincidently, the Aboriginal community in Australia are seeking to achieve their goals.",63
205,Mr MCLACHLAN,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,I will respond to the comment made by the member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) that this is a continuation of our attempts to sink the Native Title Act. Mr Gibson-Oh!,64
206,Mr MCLACHLAN,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"I quite publicly say that the government's Native Title Act is a rotten act of parliament. I say so because-as I predicted-it is not working. Here we are 21/4 years after the Mabo decision was announced and how much native title has been allocated to anybody anywhere? Not much. Of course, there have been some land grants made under the Western Australian legislation-some hundreds, as I understand it-but they are quite small. Mr Tickner-They are not worth the paper they are written on.",64
207,Mr MCLACHLAN,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"Maybe that is right because maybe the High Court will reject them. Maybe, on the other hand, it will find that some things in the Western Australian legislation have some effect on your Native Title Act. You know that that may be the case as well as I do. Let me go back to the point that has been made by a number of speakers on the government side-that we do not talk to Aboriginal people. I have been to the Kimberleys. I have listened to Peter Yu, Noel Pearson and quite a lot of Aborigines in my life because I have spent some time working in areas where they work. There are some very fine people amongst them. Some of them actually do not agree with you. That is interesting. Some of them took the trouble to write down some words recently in Western Australia-the minister will laugh because these are only old and rather revered Aboriginal people-and they called the document The Lawman's Vision. They said: We reject the Federal Government's Native Title Legislation. This is the time for reconciliation. These huge Native Title claims will not lead to reconciliation, they will set Aborigine against Aborigine and Aborigines against other Australians. They are not my words; they are their words. Do not give us this stuff that all Aborigines agree with your version of events-because they do not. The member for Grey (Mr Wakelin), who I think is the member for the second biggest electorate in this country, has itemised a number of times in this House how people of the Pitjantjatjara lands disagree with the fact that they do not have the ability to financially use that enormous and wonderful asset which is the Pitjantjatjara lands, to which they have inalienable freehold title. It is something that is going to have to be addressed, because the land is locked up. Amendment No. 23 refers to the Native Title Act. I thought I would raise those matters because government members like to give the impression that they are the only people who speak for Aborigines. I can assure them-as they very well know-that there are many Aborigines who disagree with many of their views and much of the legislation they put through.",65
208,Mr TICKNER,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"Hughes-Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs) (5.00 p.m.)-A number of amendments are being debated at once at this point of time in the debate. No doubt one of the most significant amendments moved by the coalition is amendment No. 23-despite the fact that all the amendments moved by the coalition make very slight changes, as described by the shadow minister in the last week. The member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) is quite right in saying that the time to be counted is fast approaching. I would hope that before the hour is out we can see where the coalition stands with respect to the land fund bill. Amendment 23 seeks to override a key element of the agreement reached between the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), on behalf of the government, in his and the government's negotiations with indigenous representatives over the Native Title Act. I remind the House that section 47 of the Native Title Act is designed to allow Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders who are also owners of a pastoral lease over the same land to claim native title, notwithstanding that the grant of the pastoral lease would ordinarily have extinguished native title. Section 47(3) of the act importantly goes on to make it clear that the effect of a native title determination is essentially-and I emphasise this point-that the pastoral lease will continue to apply to the land, including any covenants in the lease regarding the use of the land. This means, in very clear and precise terms, that the land will remain subject to the pastoral lease. That, in part, answers the issue earlier raised by the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan). But I do particularly refer him and the South Australian government to section 8 of the Native Title Act, which says: This Act is not intended to affect the operation of any law of a State or a Territory that is capable of operating concurrently with this Act. Quite clearly, on its face, the intention of the parliament is that the ordinary laws of the land will continue to apply. I do suggest that the South Australian government needs to get better legal advice if it is in some doubt about foot-and-mouth programs. Mr MCLachlan-it has nothing to do with legal advice; it is how the bureaucrats have been operating.",65
209,Mr TICKNER,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"The South Australian Liberal Party is in no position to lecture the government about respect for the rule of law in view of the reported approach, at the behest of the South Australian Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, to a judge of the Federal Court in respect of current proceedings-one of the most, I would think, extraordinary revelations I have ever seen in any media reporting. What we are seeing here isMr Gallus interjecting",66
210,Mr TICKNER,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,Are you defending that? Mrs Gallus interjecting,66
211,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,Order! The honourable member for Hindmarsh will cease interjecting. The minister has the floor and I will ask him to direct his comments through the chair.,66
212,Mr TICKNER,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I think it is important to put on the public record what we are seeing here: the shadow minister defending a decision by the South Australian Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to approach the associate of a judge in respect of proceedings currently being heard before the court. If that is the attitude of a federal shadow minister, heaven help the coalition! Returning to the matter before the House, other amendments are also the subject of debate at this particular point of time. They relate to amendments 24, 25 and 26. The coalition is proposing here that the Prime Minister or the Minister for Finance appoint positions in respect of the operation of the Indigenous Land Corporation. Somehow or other, we are expected to believe that this is an amendment of substance, of principle and one that will promote good legislation. The change is to say that, instead of the appointments being made by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, some will be made by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Finance. If anything reveals how long it has been since the coalition was in government, even had the whiff of government in its nostrils, it is this amendment. I would have thought that a first-year student of the process of government would know that every single appointment of this kind is not made at the whim or behest of a single minister; these are cabinet appointments. This concept of cabinet, thankfully for this country, is something that the coalition knows nothing of in practice, and it will not for the foreseeable future. (TIme expired)",66
213,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"The question is that the amendments be agreed to. No other member having risen, does the Minister want to continue?",66
214,Mr TICKNER,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"Hughes-Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs) (5.05 p.m.)-Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I want to return to amendment No. 23 and make some concluding remarks in respect of that amendment. I want to emphasise to the House that what we are seeing here is undoubtedly the first salvo of the attempt by the coalition to attack the Native Title Act in practice and in this parliament. It is the first step of the on the record commitment of the federal coalition to attack what is the most important human rights legislation enacted by this parliament pursuant to the 1967 referendum. The clause it seeks to attack is not some peripheral clause. It is an essential element of the agreement, the negotiated outcome, that occurred not only with indigenous people but also with other major industry participants in this country, in particular the National Farmers Federation. While the coalition was marginalised, out on the fringe, isolated and alone, it was the government which was dealing with the main players, talking to the pastoral industry and getting this very significant negotiated outcome. I urge the coalition to have a look around the world and just see what comparable conservative parties are doing in their negotiations with indigenous people. I tell members of the opposition without hesitation that they are out of step with their comparable conservative parties around the world. In Canada the former conservative government of Mr Mulroney was taking the leadership to negotiate with peak representatives of indigenous people on the issues of constitutional reform. Their representatives were sitting at the negotiating table with provincial governments. In the United States of America, going back not only to the time of Ronald Reagan but indeed to the period of Richard Nixon, it has been people on the conservative side of United States politics who have been recognising the rights of self-determination of indigenous people. It is not some pinko plot. This is mainstream conservative politics in the United States of America. In New Zealand the government of Mr Bolger, a conservative government, is seeking to negotiate a settlement of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840. In the United States of America President Clinton earlier this year, on 29 April, issued a major executive order reaffirming his commitment to some of those principles that his opponents on the other side of politics had supported but indeed taking it further into a modem day dimension of respecting the rights of indigenous people. So it is in this country that when the history books are written not only will they and future generations applaud the Native Title Act but they will also applaud the processes that reached that just outcome. I believe those negotiations and that process that led to the final legislation is in many respects as important as the final outcome. After all that, and despite what is happening in the rest of the world, what is the coalition's position? The coalition's position is, as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) has put on the public record before, a commitment to repeal the act. If he moves away from that to become moderate, he leaves a hanging threat to repeal the Native Title Act because not once has he ruled out the threat to repeal that legislation. When the coalition's Aboriginal affairs policy is up for review the most important element of that policy, the Native Title Act, will be excluded from the review. When the shadow minister comes in here and purports to express coalition policy with respect to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Isiander affairs, the rest of us in this parliament and in the wider Australian community can be forgiven for thinking that the people who really call the shots in the coalition are the leader himself, the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer), the member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan), the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) and those whom I would describe as the hard men of the Liberal Party front-bench. In describing the hard men of the coalition cabinet I exclude the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop), who by her own actions has somewhat marginalised herself in wielding influence in the coalition. The bottom line is that we are seeing a hardline anti-Aboriginal policy being manifested in amendment 23. It seeks to gut a key element of the Native Title Act. The government will not accept the amendment. (Time expired) Amendments negatived.",66
215,Mrs GALLUS,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"I move: (27) Clause 3, page 16, lines 9-14, omit proposed subsection 19IX(4), substitute the fol1owing subsection: Qualifications "" '(4) Each appointed ordinary member of the Board is to be a person who the Minister is satisfied has experience in: (a) land or environmental management; or (b) business or financial management; or (c) Aboriginal community life or Torres Strait Islander community life, and the Minister must ensure that at least two appointed ordinary members of the Board have experience in business or financial management.' "" Amendment No. 27 to proposed subsection 191X(4) includes a phrase which deals with the composition of the board of the ILC. It is: ... and the Minister must ensure that at least two appointed ordinary members of the Board have experience in business or financial management. If we look at the bill and at our amendment, we will see that this is exactly what the government intended. However, our amendment requires: (4) Each ordinary member of the Board is to. be a person who the Minister is satisfied has expenence in: (a) land or environmental management; or (b) business or financial management; or (c) Aboriginal community life or Torres Strait Islander community IifeThe bill definitely mentions business or financial management, but the bill has been worded so that it can be one or the other. So it would be possible to constitute a board where all the ordinary members have experience in land or environmental management or Aboriginal community life or one of the others. There is no requirement in the bill for anybody on the board to have financial and business management. The honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd) is shaking his head. I suggest that he should read the bill very carefully because that is exactly the effect of it. With this amendment we are saying that we want two people on that board with financial and business management. I think that even the minister, with his lack of knowledge in this area, must recognise that to have a fund of $45 million operating without somebody on the board with business or financial management is quite extraordinary. I ask the minister to look at the reason for this amendment and to acknowledge its necessity to clean up what is undoubtedly one of the messier bills.",67
216,Mr TICKNER,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,Hughes-Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs) (5.12 p.m.)-The honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) asks me: why object to this provision? I ask the coalition to tell me what comparable institutions have a specific requirement for their appointments to have experience in business and financial management. Is it in the ABC legislation? Is it in the legislation for the board of Qantas? Mr MeLaehlan-You picked a beauty.,68
217,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"Order! Let the minister stick to the amendment, please. Mrs Gallus-He is asking us questions, Mr Deputy Speaker.",68
218,Mr TICKNER,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,I know the answer.,68
219,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,The honourable member for Hindmarsh can answer the questions when she has the opportunity to speak. The minister has the call.,68
220,Mr TICKNER,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"I know the answer, and the answer is that there is not such a provision in the legislation regarding Qantas, the ABC or, as far as I am aware, in any other comparable legislation. So I pose the question: why put it in this legislation? The answer is, of course, because the coalition has the same old agenda of smear, smear, smear. The intent of the shadow minister is to raise public doubts about the public accountability of the Indigenous Land Corporation. That is the agenda. The fact of the matter is there is no comparable provision in any other legislation. I can give an assurance to this House that that board will have a very broad spread of representation and will certainly include people who have business or financial management. But what I am not prepared to do, and what the government is not prepared to do, is to accept a discriminatory clause, one which has no precedent anywhere else and one which will not serve to improve the bill. I ask people to judge me on my record of appointments. Let us look at the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation, a comparable body which has appointments that I am responsible for. Let us look at who I appointed to the board of the commercial development corporation. In addition to highly competent Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and, indeed, a number of other people who have financial and business experience, I also appointed Professor Bob Walker, who must be one of the most highly regarded experts in the area of public finance and government corporations in this country. I had the pleasure to meet him when I chaired the public accounts committee inquiry into the Australian National Audit Office, which the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) also participated in. If those opposite want to know why we are not accepting this amendment, it is because it is patronising, discriminatory, it has no precedent and it serves no useful purpose whatsoever. We reject this amendment absolutely.",68
221,Mrs GALLUS,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"I am fascinated by the minister, who is, unfortunately, now striding out of the chamber. I would have liked to have answered the minister to his face. What he has said to this House is, 'Trust me. I am going to appoint these people with business and financial interests.' I am delighted that the minister is going to do that, but will somebody of the minister's integrity replace him? If that is the case, we will trust him. If it is the minister's intention to have somebody with these qualifications on the board, why does he not include it in the legislation? If that is his intention, should include it. The minister said that the reason he is not accepting this amendment is that it is patronising. Why does he think it is patronising? Is he suggesting, as has been suggested on other occasions, that there are no Aboriginal people with financial and business interests? If that is so, he is totally wrong. Off the top of my head, I could mention quite a few Aboriginal people who have excellent qualifications in this area. I would be very interested to know why the minister thinks this amendment is patronising. He referred to his appointment on the board not only of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people but also of Professor Walker. I do not know Professor Walker but, from the context of the minister's speech, I presume that he is not an indigenous person. I think that is very strange. I expect that, when appointing someone with business and financial interests to the ILC, the minister should look at Aboriginal people. There are a number of Aboriginal people in this country with enormous ability in this area. If the minister wishes, I would certainly be happy to name some.",69
222,Mr MCLACHLAN,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"I listened very carefully to the minister to see whether he had a reason to oppose this amendment. The only reason he gave was that he was going to oppose it anyway, which is hardly a reason. As the shadow minister has said, the minister is saying, 'Trust me. I will appoint somebody that will be good in business or financial management.' The second reason that he put forward was that it was a smear. You really are unmatchable in the gutter when you try. You should get out of it occasionally and see what it is like. Mr Tickner-That is what it is about.",69
223,Mr MCLACHLAN,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"It is not about that at all. There is absolutely no doubt that it is possible, under this arrangement in the bill, to appoint people to be ordinary directors with no business or management experience. Mr Tickner-Like Qantas.",69
224,Mr MCLACHLAN,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"I would not be as he rough on Qantas to say that it has appointed nobody with business experience. I know that the minister has just said that, but I would not say that. Qantas seems to be going along a little better than it has at times under your management in the past. It is possible under this legislation for the minister to appoint people with land or environmental management experience or Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community life experience but nobody with business or financial management experience. To make a big deal of this is quite amazing. All we are asking for everybody else out there, in an accountability sense, is for this minister-he is not known as the world's greatest businessman; nevertheless, he could get some advice from somewhereMr Tickner-I've got more economics degrees than you've got.",69
225,Mr MCLACHLAN,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"Wrong. Perhaps we could persuade him to put on at least two people with business and management experience-just two people out of four. That does not seem to be too much; the others can have other experience. I was quite surprised that the minister used as a reason for rejecting it the fact that he was going to do it anyway. That is the first time. I have ever heard anybody say, 'I'm actually going to reject this dreadful amendment of yours because I'm going to do it anyway.' All it shows is that you were told to reject every one of our amendments. You were told by your boss to reject it-and, as he said the day before, he did not even look at it for five minutes, let alone the five minutes you had. Mr Connolly-Out of hand.",69
226,Mr MCLACHLAN,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"Out of hand. You do not even get to make any of these decisions. Do not think that the whole world does not know it, because the fact of the matter is that Rocher, A. C. that is exactly the position you find yourself in. You do not make the decisions. When we put up an amendment which requires just a little bit of accountability, you get down in the gutter-a position in which you are un matchable.",70
227,Mrs GALLUS,LAND CORPORATION AND LAND,"Hindmarsh) (5.20 p.m.)As nobody on the government side has stood up, I will take this opportunity to say, 'Isn't this pathetic?' The government is opposing this amendment and it cannot even find one of its members to stand up and tell us why it is opposing the amendment. I invite the member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), the member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd) and the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) to get up and tell us why this is such a terrible amendment that it has to be opposed by the government.",70

These four amendments combine to change the bill. The bill currently divides the $45 million that comes out of the ILC-$21 million for ATSIC and $24 million for the ILC. Our proposed amendments to these clauses seek to have all the money going immediately to the ILC. As such, there would be only one land fund-not two. As the minister has indicated that he is extremely anxious to get this bill through before 6 o'clock, I will limit my comments to the substance of the amendments. However, should the minister want to debate the amendment, I will return to my feet.",71
230,Mr TICKNER,PAIRS,"Hughes-Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs) (5.31 p.m.)-I do not wish to debate this matter, but I note that these are transitional provisions. ATSIC has built up its own expertise and its own role-lam sure that is conceded-in relation to land acquisition. Applications have already been received for the 1994-95 financial year. We believe that the continuation of ATSIC's program until 1996-97 will allow an efficient phasing in of the new fund.",71
231,Mrs GALLUS,PAIRS,"I said that I would not debate this bill; however, I want to add that we think it is important that there be only one land fund-not two.

(36) Clause 3, page 39, line 3, omit ""body corporate"", substitute ""another person"". I will not take up the time of the House in debating these amendments. The government has infonned me that it would like to have the bill finished by 6 o'clock and the opposition concurs with that. These amendments are mainly consequential on other major amendments we have moved to the bill and I ask the government to agree to them. NOES Mr TICKNER (Hughes-Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs) (5.42 p.m.)-The government does not agree to the amendments for very substantial reasons which have been comprehensively outlined to the House in the course of this debate. In essence, the government believes that the very long standing policy supported by Liberal and coalition administrations going right back to the early 1970s should continue to stand. We do not believe it is a proper use of public moneys to have grants made to individual Aboriginal people to buy land. It has been a consistent policy of both sides of politics that that should not happen and, for that very substantive reason, we do not accept the amendment.",72
233,Mrs GALLUS,NOES,"I NA was asked by the government if I could rush these amendments through and I agreed to do that, but it was my understanding that we were not actually going to comment on them. As the minister has gone back to amendment No. 1 of the 37 amendments, I shall also take that right. Our amendment to this bill was a very appropriate one. The minister has been saying all through this debate that the ILC needs flexibility. In our amendment No.1, we gave the flexibility that Aboriginal people had asked for, so that Aboriginal trusts and Aboriginal individuals, as well as Aboriginal corporations, could have land. We stand by that and by the Aboriginal people who have asked us for that amendment. Amendments negatived. Clause agreed to. Clause 4 agreed to. Clause 5.",72
234,Mrs GALLUS,PAIRS,"Hindmarsh) (5.45 p.m.)I move: (37) Clause 5, page 43, after the proposed definition of ""Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander corporation"" insert the following definition: "" - Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander trust' means a trust in which beneficial interests are held by: (a) Aboriginal persons; or (b) Torres Strait Islanders; or (c) an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander corporation."" . This amendment relates simply to the definition of 'trust' as we had sought to insert 'Aboriginal trust' in amendment No. 1 to the bill. It is consequential on that amendment No.1.",72
235,Mr TICKNER,PAIRS,"Hughes-Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs) (5.45 p.m.)-I will not take the time of the House in view of the fact that, once again, the government's very strong and decisive reasons for opposing this amendment have been put on the public record in the Hansard. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Remainder of bill-by leave-taken as a whole, and agreed to. Third Reading Motion (by Mr Tickner)-by leaveproposed: That the bill be now read a third time.",73
236,Mrs GALLUS,PAIRS,"I will take a few minutes to sum up what has happened in this debate. I have said before to the minister at the table that it is of great regret to us that we have gone through such an acrimonious debate on this bill. The opposition passed the land fund bill at the second reading stage. I again refer to the second reading speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) when he said that the test of the opposition would be how it acted at the second reading stage of this debate. The opposition passed the land fund bill at that stage. It was after that that the minister at table suddenly changed his tack and started vilifying the opposition, accusing the opposition of motives that it did not have. The minister at the table could not explain in any way why he was rejecting what were basically sensible, appropriate and necessary amendments to this bill. Worse st iII , at no time would the minister sit down with the opposition, discuss the amendments with us and say, 'These are the reasons we do not like this amendment and that amendment.' There is no doubt that there were amendments to this biII that the minister could not find objection with, yet he would not even sit down and discuss them with the opposition. Therefore, it is with deep regret that the opposition will have to vote against this bill at the third reading stage. The minister has made and is seeking to make a great deal of this. I again refer the minister to the Prime Minister's second reading speech in which he said that the test of the opposition's reaction to this bill would be at the second reading stage. We supported the biII there and all we have asked the government to do is look seriously at our amendments in order to have the bill passed at the third reading stage. The government has deliberately rejected any discussion of those amendments and, as I said before, it is with great regret, as a consequence of the government's action, that the opposition must now vote against this biII at the third reading stage.",73
237,Mr TICKNER,PAIRS,"Hughes-Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs) (5.49 p.m.)-in reply-In view of the fact that the shadow minister has made some remarks that deserve a response, I propose to speak very briefly at this time. I think it is important to place on the public record the government's commitment throughout the whole of this process to try to achieve the unanimous support of the Australian parliament for the establishment of the land fund. That public commitment on the part of the government goes right back to the time when the member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) was the Leader of the Opposition. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) wrote to the him many months ago seeking the coalition's views on the land fund. There was no response to that letter. The Prime Minister then introduced the legislation into the parliament over two months ago and sought coalition support for that legislation. Further to that, he wrote to the now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) seeking his constructive comments to the legislation. No response was received to that letter from the Prime Minister. I think it is again important to place on the public record that the government's legislation comes to this House only after the most exhaustive process of public consultation, involving in the end key representatives of indigenous people and a negotiated outcome that I think makes very important gains for indigenous people while balancing the advance in human rights with very significant principles of public accountability. After all that, the government then moved to debate the legislation in the House of Representatives. The debate began but there were no coalition amendments. The debate proceeded and still there were no coalition amendments. Throughout the course of that day I was given a number of documents, some of them stamped 'confidential', being drafts of the coalition amendments. Those were the documents that I worked on and which the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission advised me on and, ultimately, I advised the Prime Minister what the government's response to the legislation should be. I took the view that, ultimately, what was important was to get legislation through the parliament. It was very important, if we could, to get unanimous parliamentary support. But what I was not prepared to support and what the Prime Minister and the government was not prepared to support were amendments that were going to cause great concern to Aboriginal people and that were going to be strongly opposed by them. It came to my attention that before the coalition introduced the amendments into the parliament not one single Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person in this entire country was consulted about the content of those amendments. Mr Thckey-That is not so. I certainly did. Mrs Gallus-That is not true, and you know it.",73
238,Mr TICKNER,PAIRS,"Not one single Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person was consulted before those amendments were introduced in the parliament. The shadow minister confirmed that in a public interview. I am used to the member for O'Connor interjecting on the opposition side. It is a bit difficult when he is on the government side, even though it will be for a fleeting period. The fact of the matter is that not one indigenous person was consulted prior to those amendments being introduced into the parliament. When I took the responsibility of trying to at least give some basic information about the coalition amendments to indigenous people, the response to those proposed amendments was an overwhelming rejection the length and breadth of this country. What an irony it is and what a reflection it is on the competence of the entire opposition that the government is left to consult indigenous people about the opposition's amendments, but that is what happened. That is what the history books will show. The bottom line is that the government wants legislation through the parliament. We always knew that the legislation would be opposed by the coalition. Not only have those opposite put forward amendments in the House of Representatives; they have further amendments to put forward in the Senate and they have a threat of a Senate inquiry. Their position of opposition has been consistent over many months. It has been led by the Leader of the Opposition, and supported by the honourable member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) and many others. It has been a consistent position of opposition. The reason we reject the amendments is that we do not think they will improve the legislation. They are overwhelmingly rejected by indigenous people. I want to pay tribute to all my colleagues on this side of the House who have participated in this debate. We stand to be counted, as the deputy chairperson of ATSIC asked us to be, in support of what is one of the most important pieces of social justice legislation ever to pass through this parliament.

NA Motion (by Mr Tickner) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Goss Labor Government",74
239,Mr ALDRED,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to speak on an extraordinary scandal involving the Goss Labor government in Queensland and its administration, including the CJC. It came to national prominence in the Senate on 31 August 1994 following the tabling of the unanimous all-party report by the Senate Select Committee on Public Interest Whistleblowing which called on the Goss government to establish an independent review into unresolved whistleblower cases. The case I am referring to is known as the Kevin Lindeberg case. It centres around the shredding of public records commonly known as the Heiner inquiry documents and tapes by order of the Goss cabinet on 5 March 1990 in order to reduce the risk of legal action. The Brisbane Courier-Mail on 3 September this year called it the great shredding affair. I took the trouble to obtain Mr Lindeberg's submissions to the Senate whistleblowing committee and also followed very closely the events on the floor of the Queensland's parliament some weeks ago when this affair flared up. The facts show that the cabinet deliberately misled the state archivist by letter dated 23 February 1990 in order to obtain her approval to destroy evidence required for litigation and then it wilfully ordered the destruction on 5 March 1990 in order to escape court action. The facts show that the Crown had been served with due and proper notification of a commencement of court proceedings by a firm of solicitors on 15 February 1990. The facts show that Queensland minister Anne Warner even admitted publicly on 8 September 1994 that she had possession of the solicitor's letter on 19 February 1990. She clearly knew what was going on. In other words, the Crown knew about the foreshadowed litigation involving the Crown itself and then secretly and wilfully set about attempting to obstruct justice by deliberately misleading the state archivist and others. I have in my possession the letter to the state archivist which clearly and falsely informs the archivist that the public reportand I stress 'public records'-'is no longer required or pertinent to the public records'. This was stated at the very time the government knew of the anticipated court proceedings. By law it is an offence to mislead a public official, which is what the Goss cabinet did. We even have a senior public servant with knowledge of the anticipated litigation secretly and actively destroying the evidence. That same public servant even helped prepare the cabinet's submissions on each occasion, and he would not act alone. Anyone who has the slightest knowledge of criminal law knows that the course of justice can be perverted without judicial proceedings being under way just so long as the conspirators have foreknowledge of it and seek by deception to obstruct it. Not only did the shredding obstruct justice, it utterly stopped it and was ordered by the Goss cabinet, the respondent in the proposed action. Mr Truss-Shame.",75
240,Mr ALDRED,ADJOURNMENT,"It is, too. The facts show that the Goss government has actually confirmed possession of the solicitor's letter and stated publicly that it ordered the destruction 'in order to reduce the risk of legal action'. Moreover, what makes this story so remarkable is that the Queensland Criminal Justice Commission can allegedly find no official misconduct, which raises questions of the gravest nature over its so-called independence. I seek leave to table a letter of 23 February 1990 from the Goss cabinet to the Queensland state archivist. It has already been tabled in the Queensland parliament.",76
241,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Is leave granted? Leave not granted.,76
242,Mr ALDRED,ADJOURNMENT,This Queensland watergate-and it is obvious that the government is fairly nervous about it-demands a most thorough investigation by whatever independent appropriate means are available and the sooner the better. Liberal Party,76
243,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"It is often said that to ensure thriving democracy we need a strong opposition. These are very difficult times for the opposition and they are very difficult times for the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer). We have seen in today's Australian Newspoll that the fortunes of the Leader of the Opposition and the opposition have plummeted. We see the two-party preferred vote: ALP 50 per cent, Liberal-National parties 38 per cent. The satisfaction rating of the Leader of the Opposition: 23 per cent satisfied, 58 per cent dissatisfied. For preferred Prime Minister: Keating 52 per cent, Downer 25 per cent. But you really must admire the persistence and the tenacity of the Leader of the Opposition. He will go anywhere, see anyone, say anything to anyone to try to get support. This is best reflected by the September edition of that august journal Talk to the animals. Some members opposite may not be aware of this journal, but they can purchase it for $3.95 or if in New Zealand they can purchase it for $5.95 including GST-but that is a separate issue. In the September issue of Talk to the animals the cover story is on the Leader of the Opposition: 'Alexander Downer on why dogs are good for you'. The heading to the story reads 'Doggone-if it isn't the Downers!' In this September edition of Talk to the animals you can read all about it: 'You can meet federal opposition leader Alexander Downer and his companionable canine Charlie'. It is often said by serious pet owners that like the master the dog and like the dog the master. In other words, the pet takes on the attributes of the master and the master takes on the attributes of the pet. In the course of this cover story, there is an interesting quote from a family member about canine Charlie, and it sums up the way that members on this side currently view the Leader of the Opposition. It reads: We love him a lot. We play games with him-we run and chase him, and when he's in the mood he bounces all over the place. He's lots of fun. He certainly is lots of fun. He is an absolute figure of fun. But there is a serious point here. I am sure that the Leader of the Opposition would not have entered into this interview without wanting to a send a very serious message to the community, in particular to his colleagues. We know, because of the nickname of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello) given to him by the former member for Kooyong and made public by the Premier of Victoria, that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has a serious interest in these matters. Maybe it was on his advice that the leader did the interview. But we know fromMr Swan-Deputy Dog.",76
244,Mr FILING,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The honourable member for Lilley, the other half of the glimmer twins, made an unparliamentary comment in reference to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I ask him to withdraw it. He knows it is very smart to sit there and do that, but it was certainly an unparliamentary expression. In fact, if we take into account how closely these two work together, one could suspect that the speech that the member for Perth is now making is calculated to give rise liamentary comment.",77
245,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Mr Jenkins)The honourable member has gone far enough.,77
246,Mr FILING,ADJOURNMENT,"He is not even in his seat, Mr Deputy Speaker. Mr Swan-I withdraw.",77
247,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Whilst he is not in his seat, if he has indicated that he withdrawn, I will take that withdrawal.",77
248,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"I am confident that the message that the Leader of the Opposition is sending is a serious message to his deputy-to take on all the attributes that, we know, are appropriate to canines, including that of loyalty, the lack of which was the charge that the former member for Kooyong and the Premier of Victoria made of him. I am sure that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition will read this edition of Talk to the animals assiduously and take on that note of loyalty from his leader. Australian Labor Party: Western Australia",77
249,Mr CAMERON,ADJOURNMENT,"Stirling) (6.12 p.m.)Last night during the adjournment debate I was commenting on the moral bankruptcy and politically corrupt activities of certain members of the Australian Labor Party. It is not surprising that my speech was constantly interrupted by members opposite because they are ashamed that very senior members of their party were involved in criminal activity. They interrupted me because the truth hurts, and they hate hearing the truth. They are ashamed that during the 1980s their leaders were misappropriating funds which they were not entitled to. While the likes of Richard Court, Bill Hassell and Barry MACKinnon were calling for a royal commission, those members opposite, in particular the present Minister for Human Services and Health, the honourable member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence), ignored those calls. History records that a royal commission was called and today two former Labor members of parliament, two members who held the two most senior positions in government, are in gaol. Members opposite spent last night squealing, but they did that only to prevent to the unpar- the truth being told. I notice the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) said that he had a thick file which asserts that a senior liberal is corrupt. I challenge him to come forward with his information. If he will not, then he should not make spurious allegations to try to deflect the fact that the Labor Party has just had a shameful decade of corruption, mismanagehas ment and dubious dealings. As I said last night, the likes of John Curtin would be turning in their graves to think that the party to which they contributed so much had turned into an organisation for moral and political bankruptcy and corruption. I would like to continue with the speech that was interrupted last night. Last night I quoted the judge, Nigel Clarke, and I will do so again. He said: The rank and file who devote themselves selflessly will be discouraged if the guardians of the monies raised plunder them ... public officers o- all in and out of government, need to have It brought home to them that utmost good faith and honesty is required of them. It is a damning attack on the Labor Partyand rightly so-and on the way the Labor Party raised and spent campaign funds. I hope the Labor Party takes note of Judge Clarke's comments. I mentioned Senator Beahan last night, but he is no orphan when it comes to praising Labor's criminals. A few months ago we had the Leader of the Opposition in Western Australia declare his undying loyalty and respect for Brian Burke, and last week we had the federal Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, Senator Cook, declare his respect  prominent Labor politicians have expressed their respect and admiration for two criminals-two people who sought the trust of members of the ALP, business people and the Western Australian people in general, and then spurned those people whose trust they sought by breaking the lawMr Robert Brown- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I draw your attention to the fact that, while some legal proceedings have been resolved, other legal proceedings in connection with some of those matters are still to proceed, which makes them sub judice. I suggest that the honourable member be best advised not to pursue the matter. Could I prevail upon you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to rule him out of order, as he quite clearly is.",77
250,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,I caution the honourable member for Stirling to not discuss any sub judice matters.,78
251,Mr CAMERON,ADJOURNMENT,"I am quite aware of the perjury charges that are outstanding. I have to ask what one must do to build respect in the eyes of Labor colleagues-rob a bank, rip off the taxpayers? What a shame that being honest is not a prerequisite to winning over respect in the ALP. We, as members of parliament, are meant to be setting an example as law makersMr Robert Brown- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I think some of the accusations made by the honourable member would not have been made in more dispaskind. sionate times. General accusations were made against the Labor Party and members of the Labor Party. As a member of the Labor Party, I am grievously offended by those accusations. I want those remarks to be withdrawn.",78
252,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,The honourable member for Stirling might assist the debate by withdrawing those remarks. He must be very careful in making accusations against a group of people.,78
253,Mr CAMERON,ADJOURNMENT,"I withdraw. As representatives, we must ensure that we uphold and promote the values and aspirations of the people we were elected to represent. It is regretted that such basic tenets have been ignored by the Labor Party in pursuit of personal and political gain. I know that when the final chapter of WA Inc. is written-I am sure that it will be a long time before that occurs, even if the honourable member for FremantIe regains her memory-members opposite will look back on those years and hang their heads in shame. Not only were they colleagues of people who were morally corrupt and even criminals in a couple of cases",78
254,Mr HOLDING,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The sub judice rule is perfectly clear. There are other charges being laid, of which the honourable member would be well aware, and those charges have to be dealt with by a jury in the criminal process. These sorts of comments clearly infringe the basic principle of the sub judice rule. The honourable gentleman is not merely out of order; I believe he understands the nature of the sub judice rule",78
255,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,I understand the point of order. The honourable member will be very careful when referring to any legal action before the courts.,78
256,Mr CAMERON,ADJOURNMENT,"With the squeals of guilt opposite, I rest my case. Watson, Ms J.: Death",79
257,Mr GIBSON,ADJOURNMENT,"I have the sad duty to report to the House the death of Ms Jacinta Watson of Coopers Plains in my electorate. Jacinta was killed on Saturday, 10 September because of an accident that occurred at the Greenbank army range during her participation in an army reserve training camp held that weekend. Jacinta had been in the army reserve for a couple of years and was participating in some practice Greenbank army range. Jacinta's death is an enormous tragedy and has, of course, had a profound impact on her husband and her family. Our hearts go out to Andrew, Jacinta's husband of 21 months; her parents, Stan and Gina Otuszewski of Coopers Plains in my electorate; and her sisters, Marissa and Chantal. This death is an enormous tragedy. It was an accident-an accident that we hope will never be repeated. I express my sincere personal sympathies, and I am sure the sympathies of all members of this House, to Jacinta's husband, family, many friends and work colleagues, and her army reserve friends who were all devastated by this tragedy. I understand that the army has established a board of inquiry which will investigate the circumstances of this accident and report to the Department of Defence, and most likely to the minister, on the cause of this accident. It is my sincere hope and wish that, if there were situations that led to this accident that could have been prevented, we will ensure that in future all procedures will be corrected so that such an accident should not occur again. It is important we ensure that when our young people participate in the army reserve, which is something we encourage and want so many of our young people to do so they can participate in the training towards the defence of this country, they can be protected from accidents of this nature. It is important that the parents of those people who are participating in this training can be assured that the Department of Defence and the army will take all such steps as they can to avoid any repeat incidents. The reason I am particularly concerned about making this speech is that it is the second accident in the past 18 months resulting in the death of someone on a training weekend. It is something I hope we can avoid happening in the future. Jacinta was a wonderful person. She was a vibrant, attractive and energetic young woman who tackled every challenge that was placed before her. She was much loved by all of her family, by her friends, by her work colleagues in the Queensland Department of Employment, Education and Training and by everyfiring at the one who ever met her. It was my sad duty to attend her funeral at St David's Anglican Church at Chelmer last Wednesday and to share in the grief of all of her family and friends who were gathered there. The commitment I wish to make to her family, to her parents and to her husband is that to the utmost of my ability I will try to ensure that the full circumstances of this accident are investigated and that wherever possible we take steps to make sure that no similar accident should ever occur again. Australian Labor Party: Western Australia",79
258,Mr FILING,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise again to address the House on the very contentious subject of the corruption that was endemic in the Western Australian Labor Party, in particular during those terrible periods of Western Australia Inc. under the Burke, Dowding and latterly Lawrence governments. I said that the breadth and depth of that corruption was endemic within the state Labor Party of Western Australia. I told the  recent trial in Perth the now President of the Senate, Senator Beahan, who happened to be the state director or the secretary of the ALP in Western Australia, admitted using election funds to pay gambling debts. As we know, that was the subject of a question in the House today. Mr Robert Brown- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It is important that during the adjournment debate circumstances of this kind are not misrepresented. The member has made the claim that they were election funds. The point that has been made in defence in relation to those casesMr Hawker- Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ",79
259,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Mr Jenkins)Order! The honourable member will resume his seat. Mr Robert Brown-They were not election funds but in fact funds that had been made available to those people essentially in a personal capacity.,80
260,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member will not go to debate the question. There were rulings by the Speaker last night on this very point. I caution the honourable member for Moore not to disguise in any way any reflections on a member of another place.,80
261,Mr FILING,ADJOURNMENT,"I am not reflecting at all on the senator concerned. I must add that the sub judice rule does not cover this either as this is not a matter which relates to the further  Last night the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) said that the PICL project was a potentially good one for the state of Western Australia. It was a great shame it never went ahead. It was a project that cost the long suffering taxpayers of Western Australia $450 million-for what? What did they get? They got blue sky, absolutely nothing. The whole thing was a ruse designed to extract taxpayers' money and funnel it back through those business operators who are in cahoots with the state Labor government and WA Inc. The fact remains that the smell of corruption continues to waft from that particular carcass. It wafts around the Western Australian Labor Party. It is this odour through which the then Premier, now the honourable member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence), managed to float through during those periods and say she never inhaled. Mr Knott- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. There has been a reflection and a specific reference to, a member of this House which I believe is unparliamentary. I ask you to bring the member to order.",80
262,Mr FILING,ADJOURNMENT,I actually made no reflection on her. I said that she had said that she did not inhale. If the honourable member had listened carefully to what I had said he would understand that in actual fact I was defending her. Mr Knott-I am waiting on a ruling.,80
263,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,The honourable member for Moore will continue.,80
264,Mr FILING,ADJOURNMENT,"While the member for Fremantle was the Premier of Western Australia, a constituent of mine advised her office of an illegal price fixing scheme for motor vehicles. That continued for almost four months after her office had been notified of the scheme. No steps were taken to identify or stop it even though her office was in possession of the facts. The car manufacturer-whom I will not name-was convicted of running such a scheme. It ran for 12 months from 1989-90 and profited that firm to the tune of $1.7 million in extra revenue. In early 1990, a Toyota employee contacted the then WA Premier to inform her of the price fixing scam. The then Premier apparently did nothing and the scheme continued for a further four months.",80
265,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! The honourable member for Moore is skirting close to making inferences. You must be very careful. Mr Knott-Say it outside, brother. Have the guts to say it outside.",80
266,Mr FILING,ADJOURNMENT,"What I am saying is quite clear. My constituent went to the Premier's office and made the complaint but apparently nothing was done. I do not see how that could be a reflection. Instead, the little man in this piece, the person who went to make the complaint, was left to battle the car-making giants single-handedly through the Trade Practices Commission. He lost his job and for many months he supported his family on about $50 per week until he finally had his day in court. My time has been constricted by consistent on, interjections and points of order, but I will say that in the case of the Aboriginal Housing Development Association and Palencia Pty Ltd, an organisation that was established during the time the member for Fremantle was the minister for Aboriginal affairs in the Western Australian government, it received a total of-(Time expired) House adjourned at 6.27 p.m. The following notices were given: Mr Brown to move That this House: (I) expresses its deep concern about the proposal by the NRMA motorist organisation in New South Wales to seek the public listing and float of that body because: (a) it will convert a service driven mutual organisation into a profit driven private organisation with serious disadvantages for its 1.8 million members; (b) the present benefits to members of a subsidised road service and untaxed rebates on their insurance premiums will be replaced by a road service geared to profit and by dividends on shares which will be taxed; (c) the alleged financial gain to members in the form of cash or shares will be offset within a few years by the loss of the subsidised road service and the loss of rebates on insurance premiums; (d) members will become liable for capital gains tax on part of the share issue as well as any further appreciated value of the shares if they choose to sell them in future; (e) thousands of pensioners will become subject to the assets test on the level of their pensions for the first time; (f) the change will remove the control of the NRMA from its 1.8 million members and facilitate the transfer of ownership and control to large institutional investors including foreign investors; (g) the NRMA is using millions of dollars which belong to its members to promote the 'yes' case of this proposal by misrepresenting the alleged benefits to them; (h) the NRMA has failed to present a balanced case, including a 'no' case, which would enable members to assess more objectively the alleged merits of the proposal despite the NRMA claim that it welcomes wide public debate on the issue; and (i) this proposal simply represents an attempt by the ruling clique of the NRMA to entrench and consolidate its control of the organisation and to exclude people like the MAG group from becoming directors of the organisation; (2) therefore calls on the Government to provide no assistance to the NRMA to facilitate the destruction of this mutual organisation; (3) welcomes the intervention of the Trade PracNOTICES tices Commission which has identified the misleading nature of the NRMA's promotional advertising and directed it to correct it; (4) calls on the Australian Securities Commission to investigate the operation of the NRMA in regard to this issue and especially the possible misuse of proxy vote arrangements at the 1993 Annual General Meeting; and (5) calls on the NRMA to suspend this attempt to, float the organisation until elections are held for a new Board under the provisions of the pre-1993 Articles of Association.  (1) That the following amendment to standing order 26 (Committee of Privileges) be adopted for the remainder of this session: Omit ""to inquire into and report upon complaints of breach of privilege which may be referred to it"" and substitute ""to inquire into and report upon matters of contempt or breach of privilege which may be referred to it"". (2) That the following matter be referred to the Committee of Privileges: The question of the level of protection or privilege which should apply to communications between Members of Parliament and Ministers, including communications by letter, facsimile or other electronic or automated means. Mr Walker to move That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Refurbishment of Australia House, London. Mr Baldwin to present a bill for an act to amend the Migration Act 1958, and for related purposes.

Mr Lee-The Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (a) The answer to this part of the question is contained in the response to Question No. 671. (b) The Australian Customs Service spent $1,573,108.33 on furniture and major office equipment in 1992-93. These items are detailed in the attachment provided to the honourable member. A copy of the attachment may be obtained from the table office. The attached listing totals $1,366,662.97 as a minimum reporting level of $100 was used. Gillespie Children (Question No. 1169) Mr Slipper asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 30 May 1994: (1) Further to the advice given in part (3) of answer to question No. 902 (Hansard, 10 May 1994, page 600), would he outline the nature of the reasonable basis under existing Malaysian law for the making of an extradition request to Malaysia with respect to Prince Raja Kamarul Bahrin Shah. (2) Were there reasonable grounds and prospects of success under existing Malaysian law for Commonwealth funds to be used to seek the return of the children of Mrs Jacqueline Gillespie and Prince Raja Kamarul Bahrin Shah to Australia.",83
268,Mr LAVARCH,QLD SA WA TAS NT ACT,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The basis in Malaysian law for consideration of an extradition request by Australia was as follows. Malaysia recently adopted a new Extradition Act (Extradition Act 1992, No. 479 of 1992). Under section 3 of that Act it was open to Malaysian authorities to consider favourably an extradition request made by Australia. Moreover, Malaysian authorities did in fact treat the extradition request by Australia as received by them and given consideration under the Act. Extradition requests are frequently made where there is a discretion in the Requested State whether or not to grant extradition. For example, Australia's recent extradition treaties provide a discretion respect to the surrender of nationals of the Requestmeals ed State. Nonetheless, requests are frequently made by and to Australia for the surrender of nationals, and such requests are frequently granted. In the case of Prince Raja Kamarul Bahrin Shah, Malaysia has discretion whether or not to grant extradition both because there was no treaty obligation to extradite and because the Extradition Act of Malaysia expressly preserved a discretion in the case of nationals. However countries frequently exercise a discretion to extradite even when no obligation exists to do so. Malaysia had previously granted extradition requests made by Australia. (2) I note that this part of the question is directed to assistance in relation to the children who were not, of course, the subject of the extradition request. I am advised that, under the Overseas Custody (Child Removal) Scheme, financial assistance may be provided in hardship cases to assist a parent to institute legal proceedings overseas for recovery of his or her children removed from Australia, or detained overseas, by the other parent. An applicant has to show there is a reasonable chance of securing the return of the child or children to Australia. If an applicant is unable to afford the cost of an opinion from an overseas practitioner on the likely prospects of success of proceedings in a court, assistance may be granted to enable the applicant to obtain such opinion. I am further advised that as a special measure on an act of grace basis, approval was given to Mrs the Gillespie's solicitors for limited funding to allow an opinion to be obtained, whilst material on hardship could be considered. Particulars of the payment made were given in my answer to Question No. 902, and there was a reasonable basis, in pursuance of the Scheme, for the payment to be made. No other funds were made available by the Commonwealth to seek the return of the children. Australian Government Credit Card (Question No. 1324) Mr Somlyay asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 30 June 1994: (I) What are the names of all (a) ministers, (b) parliamentary secretaries, (c) parliamentary office holders, (d) staff of ministers, (e) staff of parliamentary secretaries and (f) staff of parliamentary office holders who have been issued with an Australian Government Credit Card since 1987. (2) What is the total expenditure through the card by each card holder. (3) Was any expenditure incurred by each card holder for accommodation and meals in Australia. (4) Was the card holder receiving travel allowwith ance when the expenditure on accommodation or was incurred; if so, (a) on what dates, (b) on what dates were the cost of the credit card transactions reimbursed and (c) how many reimbursements are outstanding.",84
269,Mr WALKER,QLD SA WA TAS NT ACT,"The answer to the honourable Member's question is as follows: (1) (a) to (c). Details of the names of Ministers, Parliamentary Secretaries and Parliamentary Officeholders who have been issued with an Australian Government Credit Card are not held by the Department of Administrative Services. (d) to (t). The following staff of the Prime Minister's and the Leader of the Opposition's Offices have been issued with an Australian Government Credit Card by the Department of Administrative Services since 1987 (total expenditure through each card is shown): Name T Shaw J Hamon L Cullen P Wells V Richardson G Maguire M Peters J Harvey B Quaedackers C Robertson F MCKenna N Moharich S Cusack P Seaton MKeft A La Barbera J Fryer D MCLachlan C Bandy (2) See (1) above (3) Yes. (4) No. (Question No. 1346) Mr Lieberman asked the Minister for Human Services and Health, upon notice, on 23 August 1994: (1) Does drug abuse cost the nation $14 billion each year. (2) Has the Government reduced funding for Life Education from $359 869 to $110 000 in 1994-95; if so, (a) why, (b) how will Life Education continue to maintain research, program development and management support vital to the welfare of the children which Life Education Centres were established to help and (c) what alternative programs are proposed.",85
270,Dr LAWRENCE,QLD SA WA TAS NT ACT,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) A study by Collins and Lapsley, commissioned by the Department of Human Services and Health, estimated the economic costs of drug abuse in Australia to amount to more than $14 billion a year, based on 1988 data. This estimate adjusted for June 1994 prices is more than $17.9 billion. (2) Funding for the Life Education Centre (LEC) National Secretariat was reduced from $359 869 in 1992-93 to $200 000 in 1993-94 and $113 868 in 1994-95. Expenditure $ (a) In August last year, the then Minister for 295,208 Health, Senator the Hon Graham Richardson, 16,292 advised the LEC that funding for the National 19,721 Secretariat would be reduced to bring the level of 49,832 funding into line with that received by other bodies 41,208 receiving satellite (Level I) funding under the Department's Community Organisations Support 65,094 Program (within which organisations are classified 421 in terms of their consultation, information and 0 dissemination function, and the breadth of their 11,226 representation of constituents), at that time a 32,095 maximum of $110 000. 38,584 The Minister also noted that the LEC had access 159 to a significant level of alternative funding from 13,943 sources such as royalties/affiliation fees, attendance 0 fees and other fund raising. 277,319 31 However, in order that the LEC could adequately prepare for the reduction in funding of the National 2,228 Secretariat, funding for 1993-94 was set at $200 18,549 000 to allow a 'buffer' period. The amount payable 14,644 for Level 1 organisations in 1994-95 has been set at $113 868. (b) Life Education is expected to allocate some of its revenue towards maintaining research, program development and management support. Drug Abuse In addition, the Secretariat is eligible to apply for funding for specific education projects under the National Drug Strategy Education Grants program. This program is directed towards innovative, oneoff pilot projects which will assist to minimise the harm caused by the use of licit and illicit substances and which have the potential for national application. (c) National Drug Strategy moneys support a wide range of endeavours which are aimed at educating school children about substance abuse; Life Education Centres provide one approach. Department of Employment, Education and Training: Electronic Information (Question No. 1362) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 23 August 1994: (1) What services does the Minister's Department, or government enterprises for which the Minister has portfolio responsibility, provide, or will it provide, using public access points for the distribution of electronic information in regional, district or suburban centres around Australia. (2) How will each service referred to in part (1) be accommodated and operated. (3) What consideration has been given to using Australia's extensive network of municipal libraries to house the services and foster public access. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) My Department is trialling an - Automated Job Selection' computer system that provides self service access to the Commonwealth Employment Service job vacancy information. Job seekers search for job vacancies using electronic touch screens. The touch screens are being installed, on trial, in 13 Commonwealth Employment Service Offices and one Department of Social Security Office. Subject to the trial results Automated Job Selection will be installed in the majority of CES Offices around Australia. (2) Automated Job Selection touch screen terminals will be installed in the Department's existing Commonwealth Employment Service network of offices. The system will replace the existing card based vacancy distribution and display system. The electronic touch screens will operate as part of the CES information technology infrastructure. (3) Extending the use of touch screens beyond the Commonwealth Employment Service Network is being considered. Issues related to this extension will be explored further following the results of the current trial. The extent to which Australia's extensive network of municipal libraries can be used to house the service and foster public access will be examined as part of that process. Department of Human Services and Health: Electronic Information (Question No. 1371) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Human Services and Health, upon notice, on 23 August 1994: (1) What services does the Minister's Department, or government enterprises for which the Minister has portfolio responsibility, provide, or will it provide, using public access points for the distribution of electronic information in regional, district or suburban centres around Australia. (2) How will each service referred to in part (I) be accommodated and operated. (3) What consideration has been given to using Australia's extensive network of municipal libraries to house the services and foster public access.",85
271,Dr LAWRENCE,QLD SA WA TAS NT ACT,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1)-(3) The Department currently provides a wide range of public health information in electronic form on HealthROM-a CD-ROM subscription service available to libraries in Australia and also accessible to individual health professionals and the general public. HealthROM is a full-text database which contains: 300 full-text documents (books and journals) on health from the Department, the National Health and Medical Research Council and the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (containing several thousand figures, tables and photographs); a directory of all Australian health-related legislation-many Commonwealth Acts in full text; and 80,000 citations from four databases provided by the National Library of Australia, the Australian Sports Commission and the Alcohol and other Drugs Council of Australia. The Department also distributes on floppy disk: the Health Education and Promotion System (HEAPS)-a quarterly subscriber database of health promotion materials) accessed mainly by libraries and community health centres; HealthWIZ-a subscription-based statistics database for community health centres and health planners; and a number of one-off databases and electronic publications (such as the Food Codes and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Schedules) produced by program areas for a specific clientele as a free service or on a cost recovery basis. The Department also provides public dial-up access to an electronic version of the Communicable Diseases Intelligence (a fortnightly publication on communicable diseases) and an International Travel Health information service. The Department is currently examining options for making departmental information available on Public Access Networks such as the AARNet. Pensioners: Un realised Capital Gains (Question No. 1423)",86
