1,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I wish to ask the Prime Minister,' without notice, whether his attention has been drawn to the fact that the Western Australian Government proposes to charter and run steamers from"" Fremantle to ports along the north-west coast, because the private steamship com- . panies have charged such excessive freights and fares as to seriously retard the development of the north-west portion of the State ? In view of the great benefits which such State enterprise would confer on the entire Commonwealth, will he consider the advisability of' subsidizing the State steamers, as the Government now subsidizes private companies which maintain connexions between Sydney and the South Sea Islands? If he is unable to grant a direct subsidy, will he take advantage of the recent request for fresh terms made by the present carriersof mails for the north-west coast, to terminate their contracts, and transfer the same to the ships about to be chartered by the State Government?",14
2,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,It is through the hon- orable member that I became aware of this project. The Government could not enter into a second mail contract while the first is in existence; but we shall be happy to co-operate with the undertaking in any way we can. BRITISH SHIPPING RING.,14
3,Mr ATKINSON,Unknown,"I wish to know from the Prime Minister whether he has read the report in yesterday's Age, of an interview with Mr B. H . Morgan, the representative of the British Manufacturers' Association, and the apparently well-' founded statements of that gentleman with respect - to the existence of a shipping ring in Great Britain, which charges excessive freights on the goods of British manufacturers shipped to Australia, and by that, and other means, is acting prejudicially to .the trade between the Motherland and the Commonwealth ? If so, can he say whether the G'overnment intends taking any steps towards terminating such an unsatisfactory condition of affairs? If it is the intention of the Government so to move, will he indicate the nature of the steps which are likely to be taken?",14
4,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I read the very important interview referred to, and, appreciating the gravity of Mr Morgan's statements, called the attention of the Minister of Trade and Customs to it. I asked him what steps were being taken in connection with similar statements made to the Navigation Commission, and dealt with in its report. He informed me that he has the matter under consideration, and is obtaining the opinion of the law officers of the Government as to the possibility of adapting to Australian needs the Elkins Rebate Act of the United States of America.",15
5,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"In view of the statement in this morning's Ace, that the Orient Steamship Company is a member of the British shipping ring, will the Prime Minister at once abrogate the postal contract, uncier which it is subsidized by the Commonwealth, unless he receives a guaran-' tee that it will withdraw from the ring which is now attempting to destroy British trade with Australia?",15
6,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,I am not aware of the truth of. the statement to which the honourable member refers; but our new contract with the company provides for such a contingency. PREMIERS' CONFERENCE.,15
7,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"Is it true, as stated in the press, that the Prime Minister proposes to meet the representatives of the States now assembled in Conference, to discuss Commonwealth matters with tliem? Does he not think that such matters should be decided by the representatives of the Commonwealth rather than by members of State Cabinets?",15
8,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"On l y the representatives of the Commonwealth can determine Commonwealth matters, in regard to which the Premiers of the States will not be consulted by us, nor should we. permit anything in the nature of an interference on their part with Commonwealth affairs. But the financial scheme to be laid oil the table this afternoon is of joint interest, and the Government will be very glad to give the Conference such information as may be necessary to enable its members to understand our proposals. That is de-ma tided by considerations, not only of courtesy, but also of right. NA MATTER.",15
9,Mr LIDDELL,PROHIBITION OF POSTAL,"I received today a  of Hamburg, in which he saysEncouraged by above and many another grand successes of my British clients, which they obtained through the medium of my appointed Chief Lottery Agency, I beg leave to invite you to try your lilbk in the world-wide renowned Hamburg State Lottery as well, with a trifling stake, and with the prospect to gain a fortune. There is also enclosed an envelope, on which his address is printed, and a form of application for tickets. On inquiring at the Department, I found that the prohibition of this correspondence is under consideration; but I ask the Postmaster General if he will not take immediate steps to prevent it being forwarded ?",15
10,Mr MAUGER,PROHIBITION OF POSTAL,"The conveyance of circulars relating to a number of foreign lotteries has been prohibited, and, when evidence satisfactory to the Crown Law authorities has been obtained in regard to them, the correspondence relating to Others will be similarly treated.",15
11,Mr LIDDELL,PROHIBITION OF POSTAL,Is ' not the evidence in this case sufficient?,15
12,Mr MAUGER,PROHIBITION OF POSTAL,I shall be glad if the honourable member will let me have the papers to which he refers. NA RAILWA Y SURVEY.,15
13,Mr MAHON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The Minister representing the Minister of Home Affairs has given the House information about the progress of the survey of the railway from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta which is rather incomplete. Has he anything to add ? Mir. HUME COOK - There is not much to-add to what I said a few days ago. Negotiations with the Governments of Western Australia and South Australia were opened directly the Act was passed, and subsequently .£2,060 was credited to each State, so that ""the survey might be put in hand. I understand that the delay in making a start is largely due to the fact that camels, belonging to the Western Australian Government, required for the work, cannot be brought from the northern part of the State to the scene of operations as soon as was at first anticipated; but I believe that I shall be safe in saying that the work will be begun at the end of this month, or not later than the beginning of next. CANCELLE D MAI L CONTRACT .",15
14,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Is it a fact, as reported in the newspapers some time ago, that the Government is suing the firm of Messrs.

15,Mr JOHNSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister, without notice,- whether was aware when he "" was supplied with 50,000 copies of the first issue of the Lone Hand,"" to be sent at the expense of the Commonwealth Government to "" every newspaper in the United Kingdom, and every leading newspaper in the United States ""-to quote his own words",16
16,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,No ; I beg pardon.,16
17,Mr JOHNSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Was the Prime MinAlfred ister aware that there was published in same issue a defamatory article on the city of Sydney, entitled "" Sydney, the Cinderthat ella of Cities "" ? On reflection, perhaps had better make a few extracts article to make the purpose of my question clear; and it might, therefore, be fairer for me to give notice of the question for tomorrow.",16
18,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Perhaps I may exresponsible, plain at once that we sent no copies of the Lone Hand to Great Britain or the United States-no t one single copy. What I said was that the proprietors of the magazine, as part of their effort to advertise their venture, sent out 50,000 copies of first issue, for which we had no responor sibility. The honourable member put the question as -.though the Government sent them. All that we sent were the copies of a particular article, separate from the rest of the publication.",16
19,Mr JOHNSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,I give notice of the question for tomorrow. Later,16
20,Mr JOHNSON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I wish to ask the Prime Minister, without notice, another question arising out of the statement he made a few moments ago in reference Company ? to the Lone HandI wish to ask him whether the following is a correct report his reply to the question of the honourable member for Wentworth, on Friday lastThe question is a proper one, and I am glad that it has been asked, because yesterday omitted to mention that one of the chief advancated, tages of the transaction was that the Governservices ment was supplied with 50,000 copies of the first issue of the Lone H a n i , and these were sent toevery newspaper in the United Kingdom and to every leading newspaper in the United States of America I may add that I quoted those very words in"" my first question.",16
21,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"The word "" supplied "" in the passage quoted by the honourable member is incorrect. I do not remember using that word. If I did, I must have added other words whichmade it plain that the sending of copies of the Lone Hand to Great Britain and the United States was he the act of the proprietors of the magazine. NORTHERN TERRITORY.  Prime Minister, without notice, whether, for the ipurpose of bringing under the notice of the general public the great possibilities of the Northern Territory, he will undertake to purchase, on behalf of the Government, a number of copies' of Mr. Searcy's recently published work the on the Northern Territory; and whether he will have them distributed for the purpose I have named-that is to say, to make I widely known the great potentialities of the from the Northern Territory?",16
22,Mr DEAKIN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"When the Northern Territory becomes a Possession of the Commonwealth, for which this Parliament is I have no doubt that it will be a desirable thing to take steps to advertise its resources. B.ut I may remind the honourable member that the book to which he has referred is a very large, expensive, and well-illustrated publication, and that it the scarcely affords the. kind of advertisement information that would be useful to put into the hands of those whom we desire to make their homes in the Northern Territory. ATTORNEY-GENERAL;",16
23,Mr THOMAS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister, without notice, whether there is any truth in the report that the Attorney-General is about to go to England to conduct, personally, the case on behalf of the Commonwealth Government, by means of which it is sought to obtain which £250,000 from Messrs. James Laing and",16

25,Mr HUGHES,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I desire to ask the Minister of Trade and Customs, without notice, whether his attention has been - drawn to the presence ofthree bags of wheat in the Queen's Hall ; and whether he can supply the House with any information as to whether it is the intention - of the Government-as I am credibly informed is the case-to give the States Premiers an opportunity of distinguishing themselves in reference to the exhibits? Will the honourable gentleman kindly inform the House on what day, and at what particular time, the Premiers of New South Wales, Victoria, and the other States will - have an opportunity of carrying these bags - up and down Queen's Hall ? . Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN - The three sacks referred to have been placed, in the Queen's Hall,in order that honourable members may be able to see for themselves what they look like when filled with wheat. The weights are marked upon the sacks. They have been placed there at the request of an honourable member who wished to see them. I understand that there is now a further request that the honourable member for Echuca shall be photdgraphed alongside one of the sacks, and that I shall be photographed alongside my own sack.",17

27,Mr SPEAKER,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"I think I ought to' say that personal remarks as to members of this House, in reference to their personal appearance, and so forth, are very undesirable.

28,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUST A,"Certainly , if there is any offence.  Minister of Trade and Customs, without - notice, whether he considers it a fair thing, in regard to a matter of this kind, to infer that one who opposes his autocratic action is imbued with inhuman propensities and desires ?",17

Will he submit such statements to the' Inspector-General of the Commonwealth Military Forces for his criticism and report and suggestion, and afterwards make such report and criticism available to members of the House? 3.

Has the Commonwealth granted any concessions to the Eastern Extension Cable Company other than those previously granted by the States, and has the Commonlowwealth Government made any agreement with the Eastern Extension Cable Company of a difcember ferent nature to the . agreements previously existing between the - said company , and the spective States. If so, what are the points difference ? 3. What is the alleged infringement of the contract or agreement giving rise to the legal action by the Eastern Extension Cable Company against the Commonwealth Government as foreas shadowed in the Melbourne daily press of the 29th and 30th ultimo? 4Is the Government prepared to take anv action towards securing a Government-owned cable across the Atlantic, between Canada the Britisli Isles (thus completing an all-red cable route from Australia), with a view to so force of police. reducing the cost of communication that freer intercourse may foster our commerce, our knowledge of each other, and probably immigration, to our mutual advantage?",18

Can he inform the House - as to what steps are being taken by the British Government carry into effect the Joint Convention regarding the New Hebrides, and when the Joint Court to be established? 2. Is he aware that it is reported that while the British Judge is not even appointed yet, French Judge is already in the Group familiarizthat ing himself with the matters to be brought fore the Joint Court; and, further, that it reported in accordance with the foregoing, that the French Judge is to act on the Bench as an advocate of French interests, whereas the British Judge is to act as a Judge in the ordinary sense of the term ? 3. Is he aware that the British settlers allege French citizens are being appointed to all local offices under the control of the Joint Convention, and that in consequence they are tp hold an indignation meeting in the Group in the Goverriearly part of this'month? Government Mr DEAKIN - The answers to the honourable member's questions are as fol1. The Convention was proclaimed on ist Delast, and excepting that part relating to the Joint Court, came into force on that date. reUnder the authority of the Convention, joint reof gulations have been issued, establishing Vila as the sole port of entry for the Group, and prohibiting the importation of trade spirits to the Group or the manufacture of spirits therein. The Government have received no information to whether any other action has been taken to carry out the objects of the Convention, but gather from press notices that in addition to Mr Merton King, who is acting in place of Captain Rason as Deputy Resident British Comand missioner, the ^British Government have appointed Captain Harrowel to take charge of a It was at first intended to appoint the Joint Court about 30th September next, by which date it was expected that the necessary buildings would have been erected, but a despatch just received states that owing to delays, the buildings may not be ready by that No time' has been indicated when it is Consequently, this Government are unable to answer the second part of this query. 2. About the beginning of March last, the heard that the French Judge had been appointed, and on the 4th of that month sent the following telegram to the Secretary of a gross reveState for the Colonies :"" Ministers are privately informed that French member of Joint Court, New Hebrides, has been chosen, and is now in Group making thorough study of local conditions. Obviously this will give him great advantage, unless British representative is appointed at once, and has equal opportunities."" On the 16th a reply was received that the appointment of the British Judge would be made as soon as possible, and a despatch of the iSth confirming that statement added that when the appointment was made His Majesty's Governwould "" carefully consider the suggestion of your Ministers that he should familiarize himself with the local circumstances of the New to Hebrides before the Joint Court' enters upon its functions."" The Government would hesitate is to give credence' to any report that a Judge appointed by the Government of the French Republic would be likely to act in any other the than a judicial manner, though it is obvious a Judge well acquainted with local condibetions will be able to much more readily comis prehend the nature of the problems that will come before the Court for settlement, and to better appreciate the probable effect of any decisions that may be given. 3. The Government have no information on these points other than that appearing in the. press report of the 30th April. MILITARY STAFF CLERKS.",18

38,Mr EWING,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"In reply to the honourable member's question, I have to state thatThe paragraph of Military Order No. 41, quoted, refers to an allotment and not to the appointment of military staff clerks.

Sir WILLIAM LYNE ' (Hume-Trea - ' surer) [3.24] - Before we proceed to discuss this request, I desire to say that I shall deal shortly after the adjournment for dinner with the question of whether or not we should transmit to the Senate a message covering some of its requests with which we have dealt. I do not wish the matter to be discussed at the present stage. Coming now to the item immediately under consideration, honourable members will reThe collect that on Friday the Committee discussed the question of whether or not we should deal with the whole of the requests relating to it in the one motion, or whether we should take them seriatim. There seemed to be a disposition to urge that we should take them separately, and I then said that I should propose today to deal separately with each paragraph. I therefore move That the requested amendments leaving out the words "" Locks, including,"" and inserting "" (A) "" before the word "" knobs,"" ancl "" window "" after the word "" escutcheons,"" be made. .

Mr DUGALD THOMSON (North Sydney) [3.26] - The Senate's proposal really is that locks should at present be free, but that on a date to be fixed by pros I . clamation, to issue on the passing of a 46. joint address by both Houses stating that the manufacture is sufficiently established 1908, in the Commonwealth, they shall be dutiable at 20 per cent, under the general Tariff, and at 15 per cent, in the case of imports from the United Kingdom,.",19
41,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,I am proposing a page modification of the Senate's requests.,19
42,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"That is not so. The Minister is really proposing (Genethat the duties which the Senate requested free. should be imposed on the issue of a proand clamation at some future time shall at once come into operation. The Senate's reconnexion quest is that, at present, locks shall free.",19
43,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Uncie r certain concase ditions. Mr DUGA LD THOMSON - Under any conditions. I bring under your notice, Mr Chairman, the fact that the Minister's proposal really is to provide for the imthe mediate imposition of duties of 20 and 3 per cent., whereas the Senate's request that, at present, locks shall be free. I suggest that the Minister, if he wishes these duties to come into force at once should move the addition of words after the word "" free.""",20
44,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Hume-Trea - dition surer) [3.30] - I .gathered from the exopinion, pressions of opinion by honourable members on Friday last that a large section of Commibtee desire that we should first test the question as to whether the duties 20 and 15 per cent, should be at once imlocal posed. I have, in putting my motion, divided the request into three in order meet that desire. If the proposal in graph B is carried, it will not be necessary to carry the part of the request referring the issue of a proclamation. carried, the Committee will consider wheCouncil, ther or not it should be carried in consembly, junction with that part of the request. do not think there is anything unusual the course I am taking, ancl it seems to me to be in accord. with the wishes expressed by honourable members.",20
45,Mr WILKS,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,Dalley) [3.32] - The have Treasurer has said that he desires to see the Tariff dealt with in a thorough manamendments ner. Apparently all the honourable gentleare man cares about is to secure his pound flesh in the shape of a duty.,20
46,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,That is very unnexion fair.,20
47,Mr WILKS,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"That is how I interpret the course pursued by the honourable gentlewhich man in dealing with this request. honourable gentleman says that if he can secure the imposition of these duties of and 20 per cent, at once, he will be satistleman ,fied to have the condition proposed by the Senate deleted. I think that the real bate in this case should take place on proposal of the Senate for the imposition of duties by proclamation after the of the joint address on the motion of Ministers in both Houses. I remind able members that this is not the only quest of the kind submitted by the Senate. They have made - similar requests in with timber ancl lubricants, and! be in other items. Are we to understand! that the Treasurer proposes that in this we should force the imposition of high duties without the condition which the Senate think should be attached to their imposition ? I agree with the honourable member for North Sydney that so far as Senate.is concerned the proposed duties 5 of 20 and 15 per cent, on locks are. only is conditional upon something to follow, and* that the suggestion of the Senate is that; for the present, locks should be free. The Treasurer proposes that the Committeeshould adopt the duties without any condition. I 'should prefer to discuss the conproposed by the Senate as, in my it represents another inroad on the taxing power of this House, and in the volves a very much more important consideration than any raised by the proposed 1 of duties. I shall give honourable members a illustration of the dangerinvolved in the condition included in this request. The to Victorian Legislature passed an Act. proparaviding fortheestablishment of Wages Boards, but the Act was subsequently to amended to provide 'that no Wages Board If it is not could be appointed until the Legislative as well as the Legislative As-agreed to .the personnel, of the I .Board. In that wav the power of the in Assembly was restricted. It seems to me 1 - that if we agree to the condition included in this request, we shall be making a somewhat similar concession to the Senate. I said that the Senate suggest a similar condition in connection with requests for of other items, and if they able to impose such a condition in reof spect of one item there is no reason why they should not seek to impose it in conwith all. If the Treasurer will say that he does not propose to agree to the condition in respect of any of the. items to it is attached, he will greatly simThe p l if y matters, as we need then only be concerned as to the rates of duty suggested. 15 If , on the other hand, the honourable genproposes to accept the condition in respect of any of the items to which it is deattached, I think he will adopt a dangerthe ous course, - which should be resisted strongly in the interests of the power of the passing House of Representatives.",20
48,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"East Sydney) [3.38] - As honour the honourable member for North Sydney re has said, this request by the Senate is really a request that locks should be admitted free of duty. There is a postscript Customs added that in a certain future event proclamation might be issued fixing duties of 20 and 15 per cent. It to me that the proposal that locks should surer. be made free should be first put to the Committee. Speaking to the main question, I should like to ask whether there is any intelligence at all to be displayed in Australia. connection with the compilation of a Tariff? The Tariff of 1902 made locks free. The discover the fact? protectionist section of the Tariff Commission, after taking evidence all over tralia, recommended, I suppose in the terests of Australian industries, that they should be free. The Tariff introduced the Government, with the help of the light thrown upon this question by the labours of the Tariff Commission, provided for revenue Tariff on locks, 5 per cent, under the general Tariff, and free on imports from the United Kingdom. This House agreed to that proposal, and now we have the Senate proposing that locks should be free. So that we have the first Federal Parliacently ment, the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission, the Federal Governlocks. ment of 1907, the Federal House of Representatives, and the Senate recommending that these articles should be admitted of duty; ithe Senate only proposing after a certain time a proclamation might petition from abroad. be issued taxing locks., and now the vernment ask us to impose duties of 20 and 15 per cent, on these arthe ticles without a word of explanation. Locks are used in every Australian dustrv. and it is most extraordinary that Government should not know whether not these articles are being manufactured here. The Tariff has been constructed, both occasions', in the belief that locks not made in the Commonwealth to any extralia. tent ; and it is evident that the Senate took the same view, seeing that it. is provided that the duty shall not come into operation for some time to come. Now, however, Treasurer, without saying whether the duties of 20 per cent, and 15 per cent, are really required for protectionist poses, launches this proposal upon the me. Committee. Who desires a revenue duty on such a widely-used and useful article?  Tasmania.",20
49,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"I - was not aware of fact; and I am sorry that the honourable member for Bass is not present.

I think it is a very mild request on the part of the Committee seems for further information from the Trea",21
50,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,Hume-Trea surer) [3.42] - On Friday last I informed the Committee that locks are being made in,21
51,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,When did the Treasurer,21

72,Mr BRUC ESMITH,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Parkes) [3.50]. - It is difficult for honourable members who were not here on Friday to know' exactly what is proposed. I understand that this Chamber, when the Tariff was previously before it , passed a 5 per cent, duty upon locks. The Senate decided that locks should be free at present, but that 20 per cent, might be imposed in the future by a joint proclamation following upon an address by the two Houses. I take it that the Senate had no evidence before it of what was being done in the way of manufacturing locks in the Commonwealth, but anticipated that at some time in the future evidence might be placed before Parliament of the initiation of the industry, at which time a protection of 20 per cent, should be imposed. We are in the same position in this Chamber. The Minister says he has given us information, but it is of the most vague and flimsy character. He tells us that he has only just discovered that four men are engaged! the in Tasmania in making locks, and believes that a contract has been entered into for ;t thousand locks. He was corrected by one locks are of. his colleagues, who said the quantity'was 3,000. We"" have a mere statement that that contract has been entered into. Those people had every opportunity of going before the Tariff Commission, but I understand that no evidence was given to that body on the subject. We now have a mere ex farte statement that four men are engaged in Tasmania, and we are asked on that ground to reject the condition which the Senate has suggested.'",22
73,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"I did not say that only four individuals were employed. said there were four makers, and that men are employed. Mr BKU CE SMITH - The Minister might have ascertained the names of the amend the Tariff. manufacturers and given the Committee a little more information as to the extent to which the industry has been developed. The Senate's proposal is - very sensible. I practically says, "" We do not approve of a 5 per cent, duty at present, because we do not believe that locks are being made the Commonwealth. We propose locks,' being a necessity in the building trade, should be free; but, if at some future time it is made clear to the two Houses that the industry has been started, it should be open to Parliament to impose a duty 20 per cent."" It would be equally for both Houses to do that by-and-by, I do not think we ought to do it until the Minister has given us clearer finite evidence of' the existence of manufacturers. Honourable members imagine that the condition attached by the Senate to the proposed duty is now the Committee; but I understand that the Minister wants us to vote outright for duty of 20 per cent, without any condition attached.",23
74,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"I was asked to do that on Friday. . Mr Bruce SMITH - I had not the advantage of being here on Friday, and therefore I did not know it. The honorprove able member for Dalley has taken objection to the condition on the ground that it gives the Senate a power over Money Bills which it did not previously possess.",23
75,Mr WILKS,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,A power of initiation.,23
76,Mr BRUCE SMITH,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"It gives the Senate no power of initiation, because motion for an address has first to be introimpose duced into this House by a Minister. In out. the ordinary way a Customs matter would be introduced into this Chamber by the Minister of Trade and Customs, and would go on to the Senate for confirmation. As House could not impose a tax without the consent of the Senate, subject to its .of suggestion, the suggested proclamation would give that Chamber no greater power than it has at present. It simply means that it will be within the power of Minister to introduce a 20 per cent, duty on locks without bringing down a Customs Tariff Bill , or, in fact, a fiscal Bill kind. All that will be required will be resolution of the two Houses giving effect I to the condition which the Senate has atother tached to the duty requested.",23

78,Mr BRUCE SMITH,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"The Minister is quite right. The introduction of the proclamation will obviate the necessity of int troducing a fiscal Bill , which would perhaps give opportunities for the adding of further items to the Tariff. If such a Bill in were brought in we should be opening up that the whole question again. If the Treasurer regards the condition suggested by the Senate as so desirable, I do not see why he should not move to adopt the request giving him power in the future to ask Parliaof ment to issue the proclamation so soon as easy he is able to give definite information as to and the existence of the industry.",23

81,Mr BRUCE SMITH,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"If the Minister a sees that tliose objections are not forthcoming now, he will know that the Committee is in the mood to have the' Senate's proposal put before it. I suggest to the Minister, in order to remove any misunderstanding, that he should out the Senate's proposal before the Committee, and give us an opportunity of saying whether or not we apof it. If we adopt it we shall make locks free at present, and leave it open for a duty of20 per cent, to be imposed in the future when both Houses pass the address.",23
82,Mr BATCHELOR,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Boothby) [3.56] I did not have the advantage of hearing the Treasurer's speech just now, but I underthe stand that the Government now - propose to duties of 20 and 15 per cent, straight If so, I shall support them. I shall not support the conditional suggestion of the Senate, for reasons which I gave last week. The Treasurer stated that four or five firms this were engaged in lock making in Tasmania. - His statement was rather indefinite, but'the power honourable' member for Parkes suggested that only four or five persons were employed in the industry. It is not a question of whether only a few persons are engaged in the it now. The question is whether the business is of such a character that it is likelv to develop into something substantial if we of any give it protection. That to me is the ruling a question in nearly all these matters. Is the business worth giving protection to? If only four or five persons are engaged in making locks in Tasmania under free trade conditions, that is no argument that we cannot have a considerable industry under a protection of 20 and 15 per cent. The fact that locks are made in the Commonwealth at all under free-trade conditions gives some hope that it is an industry worth developing. There is no particular difficulty in lock making. It is merely a question of the output-whe ther it is worthwhile going in for. There are a great many men who do casual work, such as bicycle repairing, lock repairing, saw sharpening, die making, and similar work. The lock business would fit in very well with their usual occupation. If is worth our while to impose the duty suggested.",23
83,Mr GLYNN,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Angas) [4.0] - The most convenient way for the Minister to have moved in this matter would be to propose first that locks be free. Owing to the way in which the question has been put we may never get an opportunity to vote for or against, say,. a 5 per cent, duty on its merits. I , for instance, would prefer that locks should be made free, ancl f ing that, if the duty is only to come into operation on a joint resolution of both Houses it ought to be the lowest duty, say the one which we previously fixed-5 per cent. If I were to move that the figures "" 20 "" be excised with a view to the substitution of the figure "" 5 , "" I might prevent myself from voting afterwards that locks be made free. So I think that the safe old rule which we follow .when we are not considering requests from the Senate-that is to put the lower duty or no .duty first-is the one by which the Minister should have been guided. I hope still that he will give an opportunity to the Committee to express its opinion on the matter by voting in what I believe to be the orthodox way.",24
84,Sir JOHN FORREST,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,The honourable member can submit a proposal.,24
85,Mr GLYNN,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"No . If paragraph B is put I cannot move that locks be made free without precluding honourable who may wish to vote on the whole of the request from exercising their option. Some of them may not wish to vote for a duty of 5 per cent., and others may wish to vote for free locks. I think it must be clear to honourable members that the best course has not been pursued to enable them to express their alternative choice. gards the' principle of postponing the imposition of the duty I do not say .that it cannot be done- I believe that it can be done-bu t it is a very bad principle to adopt. It . is a very dangerous thing for a branch of the Parliament to enter into a sort of moral obligation with certain persons that if they start anindustrv they will be given a duty.",24
86,Mr KNOX,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,It is binding a future Parliament.,24
87,Mr GLYNN,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"It is absolutely' fettering the judgment of future Parliaments. Although that Parliament would be omnipotent, still it might be thrown in its face, as it has been in connection with the sugar industry in Queensland, ifit should, attempt to modify or excise the duty, that the manufacturers started the industry under a sort of moral obligation that it would be protected, and it would be very difficult to resist that logic.",24
88,Mr JOHNSON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Lang) [4.3] - When the Treasurer is asked for information on various items he always regulates his voice to a carefully modulated minor key. He utters. his replies in such a pianissimo a i l - tone that it is almost impossible for honourable members on this side to gather clearly their purport. But I understand from his explanation that he asserts that in Tasmania there are three or four manufacturers who are making these locks. He might have told us their names, where their works are situated, the number of hands whom they employ, the wages which they pay, and various other particulars. Businesses which have been established for any length of time should be easily able :o furnish the honourable gentleman with that statistical information, and he in his turn could afford some enlightenment to the Committee.

It may be that he has been misinformed. The information which he may have received may not be reliable.

If we are asked to agree to an increase of the duties, the provision for the issue of a proclamation, which is suggested by the Senate, though I regard 'it as to an encroachment on the powers of this is, to some extent, a safeguard to against the imposition of high rates. I am not prepared to vote for the request.  that the Government would be wise if they dropped this '""' flapdoodle "" about the duties coming into operation on a date to be fixed by proclamation on the authority of a joint address from both Houses, and proposed straight away a duty of 20 per cent.

I have been furnished with a memorandum to the effect that the Vice-President of the Executive Council in the Senate promised that if possible a proposal should be made in this Chamber to make the item read according to the modification which I have proposed.  a proposal which largely affects those areas of country where timber is scarce, and the I do not see why we should impose duties of 17 \ per cent, and 12^ per cent, on fencing material, wedgers ? in view of the fact that thousands of of country in Australia cannot be fenced without iron or steel standards-. It appears to me that an attempt is being made to sneak in a high duty on the fencing terial that is an absolute necessity in some parts of Australia. Certainly, reasons ought to be given by the Treasurer as to why we should depart from our original intention of making the item 5 per cent, underthe general Tariff and free in reTreasurer gard to the United Kingdom.",28

153,Mr SINCLAIR,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Since the Treasurer lo my proposal, I shall not press",29
154,Mr BRUCE SMITH,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Parkes) [4.54]. - I take it that the object of this requested amendment is to place all iron ariB steel somematerial used for fencing upon a footing different from that of the material coming under item 170, which provides for a duty of 30 per cent, in respect of the general Tariff. Unless all iron and steel material for fencing is specially included in this item, there is a danger qf' its being dutiable at 30 per cent, under item 170, ""Manufactures of Metals'."" That as being so, the Senate has very properly rean quested the insertion of the word "" wedgers."" The question is why should the word reduced duty requested by the Senate be limited to patent wedgers? Why should it not be applied to all wedgers used for fencing? I shall propose, later on, a modification providing for the omission of the word "" patent."" Mr Reid .(East Sydney) [4.56] - I would point out that if steel fencing is a thing apart from standards and pillars, the effect of the amended proposal now made by the Treasurer is to bring steel fencing, which, under this request, would be dutiable at 17! per cent.,' under another item in respect of which a duty of 30 per cent, is imposed. The Senate draws a distinction between standards and pillars and steel fencing.",29
155,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,Stee l fencing is a separate thing.,30
156,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Then I would point out that by the suggested modification, inserting the word "" for "" after the word "" pillars,"" steel fencing w i ll be excluded from this requested amendment.",30
157,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Stee l standards pillars may, or may not, be brought in with steel fencing.",30
158,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"The item, as it was origiported ? nally passed by this House, covered steel fencing of all lengths, making it able at 5 per cent, under the general Tariff, and free in the case of imports from the United Kingdom. The Senate consequence, has made a request still including in item steel fencing of all lengths, but posing that it shall be dutiable at 17J cent, under the general Tariff and at 12J per cent, in respect of imports from United Kingdom. The effect modification now proposed by the Treathe surer, however, will be to omit steel - ing from this item and to make it dutiable at 30 per cent. Surely the Treasurer does not desire that iron and steel. standards shall be dutiable at 17J per cent, and steel fencing shall be dutiable at 30 cent. ?",30
159,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,Why not?,30
160,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,That would be a most traordinary proposal.,30
161,Sir JOHN FORREST,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,What is meant by steel fencing?,30
162,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,A great steel fencing is imported without the standards.,30
163,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"If we had been told that this re-arrangement was designed to make steel fencing dutiable at 30 per cent, I do not think that we should have expressed agreement with it .",30
164,Sir JOHN FORREST,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"I think that it will be sufficient to modify the request by inserting the word "" Iron "" before the word "" Standards,"" and to make no other alteration in the wording. .

The difficulty is that the word "" standard "" in the cludes wooden as well as iron and steel of the standards, and I do not wish to withdraw protection, which should be afforded to fencwooden standards made here.

175,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,Hume-Trea surer) [5.10] - I ask the Committee not to agree to the right honourable gentleman's amendment. This steel fencing is manufactured here and is provided for elsewhere. To admit it free would be to place local manufacturers of steel fencing at a great disadvantage and to placethe labour employed in the manufacture of such fencing locally at a much greater disadvantage.,31
176,Sir JOHN FORREST,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,The member introduced the proposal himself.,31
177,Mr SALMON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,The honourable gentleman made a mistake in doing so.,31

179,Mr KELLY,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,Then why Minister alter it?,31

187,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Then those who use it should pay duty on it. I ask the Committee, not to agree to the amendment proposed by the right honourable member for East Sydney.",31
188,Sir JOHN FORREST,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"I rise to a point of order. I submit that it is not competent for the Committee to leave out the words "" steel fencing of all lengths,"" seeing that they have not been amended in any way by the Senate. They were in the item as it was sent from this House to the Senate, and the item has been returned by the Senate with these words still in it.",31
189,The CHAIRMAN,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"I point out to the honourable member that. the Senate's requested amendment is to leave out the words "" steel fencing of all lengths and pillars,"" ancl to insert "" and pillars, steel fencing of all lengths."" The Senate's requested honourable amendment transposes the words referred to, and it is quite competent for the Treasurer to move any modification affecting the words dealt with in the Senate's requested amendment.",31
190,Sir JOHN FORREST,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"My point is that did not. the the Senate has sent these words back exactlv as they were passed by this Committee previously. We passed the words "" steel fencing of all lengths "" as One portion of the item, and the words "" and pillars "" as another. As the item is sent back to us by the. Senate, we have still the words and w pillars,"" then a comma, and then the words "" steel fencing of all lengths'."" These latter words have nothing to do with the word "" pillars."" My contention is that it is not competent for this Committee to deal with any part of an item which the Senate has not suggested should be amended.",31
191,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"North Sydney) [5.1.5] - Honourable members are under a misapprehension, due to the fact that the Minister has given a wrong explanation of this matter. These words ""steel fencing of all lengths"" were originally intended to be merely a qualification of the word ""standards."" Elsewhere we have an example of the kind in the use of the words "" Steel, roughed shaped for chaffcutter and other knives."" It was never contemplated that steel fencing of all lengths should be admitted free. I do not think that we have ever placed ornamental fencing'on the free list. What we did place on the free list were pillars and standards. If the Minister will refer to the officers of the Department, he will find that duty has been charged on such fencing. Honourable senators in anotiier place made a mistake in trying to amend the wording of the item as it passed this House, and observing their error subsequently desired that a correction should be made here.",31
192,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"The Senate's requested amendment leaves the wording of the item as awkward as it was before. They had only to say "" standards and pillars for steel fencing of all lengths.""",32
193,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"That was discovered before' the Bill left the Senate, and our attention is called to it. The Min ister is now trying to amend the wording of the item to give effect to what was originally intended, only he did not properly explain the matter, and honourable members have been given the impression that we have beenadmitting ornamental fencing free, though we have never done so.",32
194,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,That is the true explanation of the matter.,32
195,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"East Sydney) [5.18] After the explanation given by the honourable member for NorthSydney, I am quite satisfied. I understand now that steel fencing was never intended to be included in this item. I was afraid that something was about to be dropped which was previously included in the item, but as that is not so, I ask leave to withdraw my amendment. Amendment of modification (Mr Reid'S), by leave, withdrawn.""",32
196,Mr KELLY,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Wentworth) [5.19]-- I understood that there was some proposal to leave out the word, "" patent."" Sir WILLIAM' LYNE - I said that I ferred to retain that word.",32
197,Mr KELLY,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,Thes e wedgers are required for fencing that is not ornamental fencing. These are cheap fences; and the question before us is a most important one.,32
198,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,This is the most mixed-up item I have ever seen !,32
199,Mr KELLY,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"I should prefer honourable members with more knowledge than myself of the necessities of the outside settlers to deal with this item; but I know enough to realise that these articles are practically the raw material of ' some of the hard-pressed pioneers, who certainly deserve as much consideration at the hands of this National Committee as has been) extended to' others. We have made a number of raw materials free because they affect the daily avocation of voters in the great cities; and I think that those out - back, who cannot easily organize themselves politically, are worthy of as mucb encouragement as those in the great centres of - population.",32
200,Mr SALMON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,Will the honourable member withdraw his opposition if it is shown that outback settlers do not use these articles ?,32
201,Mr KELLY,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"If it is shown that outback settlers do not use these patent wedgers, I shall not resist the duty; but 1 believe that these articles are used in outlying districts. I hope that honourable members who are. intimately acquainted with the circumstances and the"" struggles of our settlers will see that justice is done.  Treasurer has told us that this duty affects only ornamental fencing used by well-to-do persons'. I do not' think .that the Minister would deliberately make a statement with the intention of deceiving the Committee; but ] can assure honourable members that there - are hundreds of tons of this material used every year to enclose holdings in places where there is no timber, or where the white ant scourge is very severe.",32
202,Mr WATKINS,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Stee l fencing?  A section of the Tariff Commission put these articles on the free list, whereas the B section, singularly enough, recommended a duty of 15 per cent. In a district 1 recently opened up in South Australia, I venture to say that tons of these materials are being used,"" owing to the difficulty in obtaining wood fencing. The steel fencing is lighter to cart, lasts much longer, and, pre- on the whole, comes cheaper than, wood, and it is used in country of the very poorest class.

I suppose, however, that, because I am a free-trader, the honourable member will take no notice of my protest; but I urge honourable members to be very careful before they inflict a great injury on a large number of settlers, who occupy the very poorest class of country. Even on the South Australian railways the Government have been forced, in the absence of wood material, to use this very class of fencing, and my vote will not, therefore, be given for a duty.",33

Not only on the South Australian railclanger ways, but all over the country immense quantities are in use for ordinary fencing, simply owing to the fact that, in localities, no suitable timber can be found. In sandy country, with poor soil stunted trees, and where, perhaps, the white ants prevail, as in the north, fencingis an absolute necessity. the case in the Northern Territory, and in the northern part of Queensland.",33

215,Mr HEDGES,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Fremantle) [ 5 . 3 3 ] - I hope the Committee will not agree to the proposed increased duty, which appears to be most monstrous in view of the fact that this fencing is largely used in many parts of Australia where wood is scarce or non-existent, or where, if wood can be used, it is liable to be swept away by fire at anv time. I was recently talking to a man who, within the last few months,, in the north-west of Western Australia, has three times had his wooden fencing eaten away by white ants, which not only destroy the posts, bur, by reason of some acid which they deposit, destroy the wire. This, of course, would not happen if steel standards and droppers are used. I can assure honourable memto bers that, years ago, hundreds of miles of steel fencing were used, and similar is being used today in South Australia, without the aid of one piece of It is also used where there is of the rabbit-proof fencing being destroyed by fire.

Could you, sir, not accept this modification of the request, that the duties on steel wheel's of over 30 inches diameter should be 5 per ^cent. and free, but that the .duties on steelrimmed wheels of over 15 or 18 inches diameter should be 5 per .cent, and free?

That seems to me to be a modification of the request. It agrees with the Senate as regards one line of wheels, and makes a modification as regards the other line.",34
225,Mr WATKINS,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Newcastle) [5.51] - I take it that the object is to separate the trucks two classes of wheels-the one which is wheels, used for locomotive purposes and is not val. made here from the other which is made.

227,Mr WATKINS,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"It appears that what is accepted by the Railways Commissioners duty. of the different States is not a steel wheel but a wrought-iron wheel with a steel rim.

Surely it would be open to the Committee to accept an teration of the diameter as to one kind but not as to the other kind? The effect the request is to open up again the question one piece with the tread and all. of the diameter of steel wheels and steelwheel rimmed wheels. I quite follow your rulquired ing, sir, as to the other words of the I think that when you gave your ruling steel wheels from Krupp's. just now you had not before you the inmade formation which you now have, otherwise 1 feel sure that you would not have ruled as you did. I quite admit that there can be no alteration which does not turn on question of the diameter. Only that question is raised,: but it is raised as to kinds of wheels. Surely it is open fb us to them. to, if we like, modify the request of the Senate, which incidentally modifies original proposition-to say that steelrimmed wheels shall be 18 inches diameter as we decided before, but that as regards wheels. steel wheels we accept the suggestion of the Senate to fix the diameter",35
232,Mr HEDGES,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Fremantle) [5.55] - I hope that the Committee will see its clear to make something like the alteradesires tion'suggested by the Treasurer. I recogthe nise that local manufacturers can cast steel wheels here in one piece, even up to a larger diameter than 30 inches. two They are made and used. I can say that they are good wheels, because I use them. but I want the tyres of railway wheels which comare not rolled or made in Australia and the centres which aire made out of one piece of wrought steel admitted at a reasonable",35

I am willing to agree to the rethat as regards cast steel wheels for diftimber tramways or trolleys and that sort' of work the diameter should be increased from 18 to 30 inches. But as regards what II call first-class railway wheels, as they are made today Mr MA""THE\VS - That is, 42 inches diameter. Mr HEDGES . ^ No . The honourable member wants to tax the wheels for the the railways of Queensland, South Australia, and Western Australia-eve n the tyres for repairing the wheels on the rolling-stock --at the rate of 35 or 40 per cent., which Surely the States should be allowed to repair their railwaywaggons at a reasonable cost!

237,Mr WATKINS,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Yes , it would; because our parts of the wheel are steel.",35
238,Mr HEDGES,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,The item refers to steel wheels and to all steel parts for such,35
239,Mr WATKINS,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"The word "" steel "" will at 30 inches. have to come out.",35
240,Mr HEDGES,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"We do not want that, way word' to be taken out. What the Treasurer to do is merelv to aiter the order of words of the item. I should like to know, sir, whether it will be in order to peralter the position of the words, but not the words themselves. We certainly do not want to take any step which would upset .the railway business of Australia, and allow Only the wheels for. use on the broadgauge railways of Victoria to come in at a low duty, while the wheels for use on narrow-gauge lines come in at a high duty. That would be grossly unfair. Why should a man who happens to use a wheel with a diameter of half-an-inch less than that of the wheel used by another man be taxed at a higher rate? All the produce that is carried on the railways has to go to the same market, no matter what kind of wheel is used. I - contend that we should not differentiate between wheels in that respect. I am quite willing to protect the local manufacturers in casting steel wheels of 30 inches diameter in the tread j but the wheels to which I have referred are not cast. I hope that the Treasurer will try to put this matter right.",35
241,Mr WATKINS,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Newcastle) [6.2] - I rise to suggest howj in my opinion, the difficulty might be got over. If the Committee were to disagree with the request to increase the diameter to 30 inches, and to allow the item to stand .as it was passed here, the Treasurer could then move this modification(A) Steel wheels, n.e.i., over .30 meter in the tread, for trucks .and waggons, and all parts for such wheels, ad val. (General Tariff), 5 per cent.; (United Kingdom), free. That would protect all steel cast wheels which are made here- (B) Steel-rimmed wheels of over 18 inches diameter rn\the tread, for trucks, and waggons, and all parts for such wheels, ad val. (General Tariff), 5 per cent.; (United Kingdom), free. I do not know of any rule under which we could not send back a modification of that kind to the Senate for its consideration. If the Treasurer were to agree to that suggestion, it would overcome the difficulty. The request of the Senate allows wheels for the two large States with wide-gauge lines to come in free, but it is absolutely unfair to the States which have narrow-gauge lines. Cast wheels are made here. The wheels that are used on the railways mav have cast steel centres. In New South Wales they are simply wrought steel, welded into practically one solid mass in a die by means of very heavy and expensive machinery, 'and will not be made here for goodness knows how many years.",36
242,Mr MATHEWS,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,They have been made here.,36
243,Mr WATKINS,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"No . The local manufacturers have only made cast iron wheels. As regards anything which they can make, I am quite willing to agree to a duty of 30 per cent., but I am not prepared to impose a duty of 40 per cent, on an article which I know will not be. made here for perhaps fifty years.",36
244,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Hume-Trea surer) [6.4] - I move That the requested amendment be not made, but that the following modification be added to the item :And on and after 6th May, igoSItem 222.

245,The CHAIRMAN,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"I wish to point out to the Committee that if I had entertained ihe proposal of the Treasurer in the form in which he originally desired to submit it, I should have rendered it possible for honourable members to go back upon any particular item. To illustrate my meaning, I would refer honourable members to inches diarequest No. 77 of the Senate which relates to item 165, and which appears on page 23 of the Schedule. At the end of paragraph A of that item the Senate has requested that certain_ words shall be added. If I were to allow honourable members to go back upon the earlier portion of that item I should open up ever so many different subjects for discussion. Then when the Schedule was returned to the other branch of the Legislature, the Senate would be afforded an opportunity to go back upon other items, and thus it would become impossible to reach finality. But as the proposal of the Treasurer has now been submitted, the position is entirely different, and as it relates practically to one request I intend to accept it. Motion agreed to. Requested amendment not made, but modification made. Item 226. Wire, n.e.i., ad val. (General Tariff) 10 per cent.; and on and after 16th November, 1907, free; (United Kingdom), free.

246,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"trea surer) [6. n ] - I move That the requested amendment be made. When we come to deal with the duty to be imposed upon this item, I wish to make i apply from a certain date, because it was so intended at the time it was levied, and it is necessary to adopt that course to demnify the Customs Department",36
247,Mr HEDGES,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Fremantle) [6.12] - I holes hope that the Committee will not agree to to the lineal inch."" the proposal of the Treasurer. This item required. relates to wire gauze such as is used in all battery screening. As honourable members' are doubtless aware, this screening only lasts a very few hours. Its average life is less than a week. Many of the Kalgoorlie mines expend over ,£300 per annum upon this screening. I desire to secure only a very slight alteration in the request. I wish, to substitute the figures "" 10 "" for the figures "" 2 0 . "" The item will then provide for woven wire measuring over ten holes to the lineal inch.",37
248,Mr TUDOR,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"-If we do that we might as well wipe out the request altogether. - Mr HEDGES - Surely the mining in this dustry is deserving of some consideration. Simply because a few individuals are gaged in the manufacture of bird cages and rat-traps we ought not to interfere to the square inch. with a big industry like that of mining. we agree to the Treasurer's proposal, the material used upon all the Western Ausing. tralian mines will be subjected to a verythat heavy duty under another item.",37
249,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,The honourable member wishes to secure a lower duty.,37
250,Mr HEDGES,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"No . I desire that the rate levied under this item shall apply to the screening-used in all mining batteries, and I want "" ten holes to the lineal inch substituted for "" twenty holes to the lineal inch."" The request is only a reasonable one. In this connection we must recollect that there are many working miners in the Commonwealth who rim their own batteries. These individuals are often located mote places, where it is almost impossible for them to procure this woven wire from Melbourne or Sydney - The cost of carriage upon it from Fremantle to Geraidton' and to place's in the interior, very severe tax.",37
251,Mr BAMFORD,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,They will have to .that tax no matter where the material comes from.,37
252,Mr HEDGES,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,But they would have to pay a heavier freight from Sydney Fremantle than they would from London to Fremantle. .,37
253,Mr MATHEWS,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,That is on account of the Shipping Trust.,37
254,Mr HEDGES,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Unfortunately, - anyt thing that will benefit the mining industry is regarded by Victorian representatives as - being opposed to the interests of the Cominmonwealth. I want them to listen to the voice . of reason and to substitute ' ten 1 to the lineal inch,"" for "" twenty holes That is all that is",37
255,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"It is a lot, too. . M i . HEDGES - It is not very much. . I have received about (wenty telegrams upon this subject. Directly this request was agreed'to by the Senate, the Chamber of Mines of Western Australia wired to me protesting against it .",37
256,Mr TUDOR,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"That body declared that twenty holes to the lineal inch would satisfy it, and that proposal was carried .in the Senate.",37
257,Mr HEDGE S,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Differen t classes of ore require different meshes of screening.

I venture to say that to mines within the "" golden mile,"" in Kalgoorlie, the operation of the new duties levied under this Tariff will make a difin reference of nearly ^roo,ooo a year.",37

259,Mr HEDGES,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"We are now pay asked to penalize .'one of the best industries in the Commonwealth. The miners in ' Western Australia are paid the highest wages in Australia.

260,Mr MATHEWS,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,That is not in accordance with my information.,38
261,Mr HEDGES,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"What I have stated is a fact, notwithstanding ' that the men are now getting their water free, whereas they used to have to pay heavily for it - Why should honourable members desire to injure the mining industry by taxing the screening that the stuff from the battery has to go through ? What I want is that gauze with a mesh ioo holes to the square inch should be allowed to come in duty free. The Government support the free admission of a material with a mesh running "" twenty holes to the lineal inch."" What is meant by that? There is not such a thing as a lineal inch of hole per square inch. appeal to honourable members to help me in this respect, and I move That'the requested amendment be modified by leaving out the figures "" 20"" with a view to insert in lieu thereof the figures "" 10."" ' Mr TUDOR (Yarra) [6.25] - When this matter was last under discussion the honourable member for Fremantle received a telegram from Western Australia stating that some of the gauze used in connection 1 with the batteries there, had a mesh up to 900 holes to the square inch. The proposal with regard to admitting duty free gauze with a mesh twenty holes to the lineal inch was agreed to as a. compromise. In my opinion if we were to agree to the honourable member's amendment the result ' would simply be the free admission of all kinds of fly wire gauze which is dutiable nowI trust that the proposal of the Senate will be accepted.

Public Debts of Australia, as at 30th 1907. I regretthat it was not possible to table these papers earlier in the day. I have been wrestling with the Printing Office all day long, but the papers have only just arrived. I do not think that honourable members will desire to read them, inasmuch as printed copies will be distributed during the evening. I also lay upon the table a"" large quantity of figures of great importance which I have had prepared in relation tb our financial proposals. I wish to say that a few days ago the Prime Minister and myself attended at the Premiers' Conference, when the Prime Minister urged upon the representatives of the States the necessity for the Commonwealth Parliament dealing with the question of old-age pensions at an early date. He explained the position taken up by the Government in that regard, and as far as I could judge, the - Premiers were not adverse from any proposal which we are likely to make. The matter will be one for future discussion, but I thought it advisable to inform I the House of the action taken by the Prime Minister on that occasion in relation to what I am sure is considered by all honourable members to be a matter of very great importance - I need only add that we hope that even before any final financial arrangement is come to between the Commonwealth and the States it will be possible for us to deal-in fact,;, there is a great probability of that being done--wit h the important question which I have mentioned. I conclude by movingThat the papers be printed.",38
263,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,East Sydney) [6.31] - I desire to say,38
264,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"I did not understand that a debate would take place at this stage. If there is to be a debate, it will disarrange other business. . Mr Reid - There will be no long debate, but I have a word or two to say, especially in regard to the old-age pensions proposal; though I desire to see the papers which the Treasurer has laid upon the table' Sitting susfended from 6.32 to 7.45 f.m. PAPERS. Mr Reid - I certainly do not wish to - initiate a debate upon the paper just laid on the table, containing the financial proposals to be submitted by the Federal to Ministry to the Conference of State Premiers; but I desire to take-advantage June, of this opportunity to make one or two observations. The first is that I very deeply regret that the Federal Government were not prepared with their scheme when the States Premiers assembled in this metropolis. The delay that has occurred has completely shipwrecked any prospect of useme fulness on the part of the assemblage of Premiers, and it shows - very bad management, considering that the date of the Conference had been fixed some time before.

265,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Altere d always in the direction of giving more instead of less time. Considering that the question has been threshed out for a good many years by various Governments, and various Conferences, I deeply regret that the grievances of the States' in connection with the Commonwealth have been greatly aggravated by this want of promptitude on the part of the Federal Government.",39
266,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,And the right orable member is trying to make them more aggravated.,39
267,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"I think that I am making no observations save those which any busiference. ness man might make. When two bodies meet, is it not disgraceful that one of them should be unprepared to consider one of the' matters proposed to be dealt with that meeting? Is it not disgraceful the Premiers should have sat in Conference for a week without having put before any information in the nature of a proposal from the Federal Government ?",39
268,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,We did not ask them to meet.,39
269,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,Surely that is not the attibrought tude which should be taken up in connection with this matter.,39
270,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,The right honorStates able member was the instigator,39
271,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Migh t I have an opporthem tunity, Mr Speaker, tb say a word or two? I do not mind interruptions on trivial sions, but I want to make my remarks brief as possible.",39
272,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,And I want to the right honourable member on the right line as he goes along.,39
273,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,I may be entirely wrong.,39
274,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,The right honourable member is.,39
275,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"But I suggest that the orable member is the worse possible judge of such matters. I regret that the Feeffort of this sort deral Governmentwere not prepared when the Conference met with the distinct set commenced. of proposals which they are now submitting, after it has been sitting for a full and when the Premier of Queensland is compelled to leave Australia. I wish to express my regret that this paper tains no reference to the question of age pensions. I had hoped, from an servation made, before dinner, by'the surer, that some endeavour would be at once to arrive at a friendly arrangement with the Governments of the different States which would enable a Federal system of old-age pensions to be brought into force without delay.",39
276,Mr FISHER,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,I understand that that is one of the postponed items to be dealt with by the Premiers' Conference. .,39
277,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"I am merely referring to this paper which I had the advantage of reading during the adjournment for dinner, and which is supposed to contain the financial proposals of the' Federal Government. I have taken it as such, but, unhonfortunately, I find in it no reference to any arrangement in respect df o'ld-age pensions, such as might be made with the States Premiers during the present ConI f the Governments of the different States would consent to. a national system being at once introduced, the d if - ficulty in connection with the Braddon secat tion would be immediately removed. If that each State would, by Act of ParliamentI admit that an Act would be necessarythem authorize the Federal Government to deduct from the Customs and Excise revenue returnable to it an. amount covering its liability in respect of a Federal scheme of old-age pensions, such a system could be into force without our waiting for the expiration of the Braddon section. In 1965, the then Federal Government met the Premiers in Conference at Hobart, and made a very strong effort to induce to fal l in with such a proposal. The representatives of three of the States occawere agreeable, but the representatives of as the . remaining three were not. The three States which at that time were not prekeep pared to agree to such a proposal were suffering veTv severely, I admit, from ""a financial strain, which in the case of two of them-Queenslan d and South Australia - ha s since been relieved. The revenue of those two States is far more buoyant than honit then was. I do not for one moment say that the Government may not be making an ",39
278,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,We have already,39
279,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"All that I say is that this week, paper contains no reference to it, although it is supposed to embody the proposals to also be submitted to the Conference by the conFederal Government. I refer to it because oldI should be delighted to hear that some obarrangement of the kind I have mentioned Treahad been made. I hope that the Governmade ment will do as the Commonwealth Government in 1905 did-that they will use their utmost endeavours to arrive at some friendly arrangement, such as I have indicated, with the Premiers of the States. Had there been in this paper any reference to the matter, it would perhaps have been unnecessary for me to refer to it. I intend to allude to only one other matter, because I do not wish at present to canvass this scheme. Having regard to the short time that I have had to study it, I should not presume for one moment to criticise it in any shape or form. It is one that we shall have to most carefully consider. I approach the matter with which this paper deals with the most earnest desire to bring about a friendly settlement of all these ficult and important questions. I am sure that none of us wish to make such a. settlement in any way dimcult. That being so, I repeat that I do not want to criticise, or even to attempt to criticise, this scheme, until I have an opportunity to consider it at length. I notice, by the way, that the honourable member for Kooyong is not treated very well in connection with it.",39
280,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Now then, now then !",40
281,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"The honourable member claims great latitude in addressing the House, and surely I may be allowed to express myself without this incessant chatter on his part. He is like an old poll parrot on a perch.",40
282,Mr THOMAS,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,The right honourable member for East Sydney at one time used to appreciate interjections.,40
283,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Her e we have the inevitable ""chipper in."" J have a vivid recollection of a notice of motion by the honourable member for Kooyong which appeared on the business-paper, and which, in the most elaborate way, unfolded a scheme for a Council of Finance.' What the honourable member for. Kooyong then set forth in a distinct notice of motion is included in the Government proposals embodied in this paper.",40
284,Mr CROUCH,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,And it is acknowledged on page 4 of the paper. Mr Reid' - It is mentioned as something referred to by the honourable member for Kooyong-as if it were some chance interjection in. the course of debate such as the honourable member for Barrier delights to make.,40
285,Mr THOMAS,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,Does the right honourable member think that that scheme was worthy of greater notice?,40
286,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"I think that it was a scheme worthy of the most profound observation. After sitting on that egg for three years over £12,000,000. the Treasurer has incubated a scheme somewhat resembling that proposed by the honourable member for Kooyong. The point that I wish to make, however, is a serious one. The pith of the Government's scheme involves figures relating to the three-fourths of Customs and Excise revenue returnable to the States under the Braddon section. The Government propose that in respect of that three-fourths a fixed sum of £6,000,000 shall be annually returned to the States. That total at once attracted my attention, because it seemed to me that it had no proper basis. I hope that hondif- orable members will remember that I am not by one word canvassing the scheme; that I am simply looking at the figures on which it is based. In his Budget speech, delivered on the 8th August last, the Treasurer estimated that the total amount to be paid to the States under the Braddon scheme-in respect of thethreefourths of Customs and Excise revenue returnable to them-this year would be not £6,000,000, but £l,m,2oS.",40
287,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,Does the right honourable member suppose that that rate will be maintained ?,40
288,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,I am dealing only with the figures.,40
289,Mr HUTCHISON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"The average amount returned so far to the States has been more than £6,000,000 per annum.",40
290,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"I do not wish to enter into speculations; I am dealing only with the actual figures. Honourable members must not forget that we are now in the eleventh month of the financial year 1907-8, so that . it is therefore' for financial purposes practically at an end. ""To show how this proposal to return, to the States a fixed sum of £6,000,000 will affect the different States, I would point out that under it New South Wales will be credited with £833,000 less than her proportion of the three-fourths. . for the present year.",40
291,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,Yes ; but that is not the average; be fair.,40
292,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,I am not stating that it is the average; I am stating thefiguresfor the year. - Sir WILLIAM LYNE - For a boom year.,40
293,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"I shall mention presently that the Customs revenue for this year will be at least £600,000 or £700,000 in excess of the Treasurer's estimate in August last.",40
294,Mr WH IRVINE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,The returns for last quarter show an annual revenue of,40
295,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,It will be something enorcnous; but I wish to keep on the .safe side. The figures I have mentioned do not cover the great increase in the revenue which has occurred since the Treasurer delivered his Budget speech.,41
296,Mr SAMPSON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,Stil l the Treasurer's estimate in respect of the amount returnable to the States was in regard to only one year.,41
297,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,But the proposals - outlined in this paper are to be the basis of a permanent scheme.,41
298,Mr SAMPSON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,We cannot take as a basis the figures for one year.,41
299,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"I do not wish to be drawn into a discussion of the scheme, because it would be unfair to those who have not ;i copy of the paper before them to do so. I am merely giving the facts and am not canvassing the scheme. The honourable member may be able to show that the suggested arrangement is perfectly fair ; I do not ask the Committee to condemn it before they have - a full statement in regard to it - Victoria, under this scheme, would receive £ 3 6 0 , 0 0 0 less than the amount which the Treasurer estimated in his Budget speech, would be returned to her this year. The amount which would be returnable to each State if this arrangement were agreed to is Set out in this paper, and I am putting against it the estimate made by the Treasurer in his They are the Treasurer's figures in both cases. On the £ 6 , 0 0 0 , 0 00 basis, New South Wales would get £ 2 , 2 2 3 , 6 2 4 , . whereas her estimated three-fourths this year, according to the Treasurer's Budget Statement,, is £3)056,889; or £ 8 3 3 , 2 6 5 more; Victoria 'would get £ 1 , 7 9 4 , 3 1 2 , while her estimated £ 2 , 1 5 2 , 1 8 8 or £ 3 5 7 . 8 7 6 more.

Western Australia would get on t.he £ 6 . 0 0 0 , 0 00 basis about half of the three-fourths which the Treasurer estimated in his last Budget will be returned to her during the present year.",41
300,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,A special arrangeamendment ment is to be made for Western Australia.,41
301,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Tasmani a would receive £ 2 6 2 , 3 9 8 on the £ 6 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 basis, while her estimated three-fourths is £ 2 5 0 , 1 4 4 , so that she alone, of all the States, would be better off.",41
302,Mr SAMPSON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,The proposed payments which the right honourable gentleman is reading are on a population basis.,41
303,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,The right honourable gentleman is making a wrong comparison.,41
304,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,I am using the paper which the Treasurer has laid on the table; I do not know if he has another scheme up his sleeve.,41
305,Mr SAMPSON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,It is the statement markedb which gives the same basis of distribution as was adopted in the Budget Estimate.,41
306,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"In either case, the States are worse off. New South Wales would be £ 2 8 , 9 8 5 more to the bad. The Budget estimate of the three-fourths returnable to the States for the current financial year was £ 7 , 7 7 7 , 2 0 8 ; but I shall be well within the mark if I say that theactual three-fourths returnable will be at least £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 more. The three-fourths returnable during the current year will be at least £ 8 , 2 7 7 , 0 0 0, or more than £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 more than the total payment under this scheme.",41
307,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"The right honourable gentleman is dealing with the returns for one year only, which is not fair. Budget speech. Mr Reid - On e might think that we must speak only subject to the approval of Ministers. I do not wish to criticise the details of the scheme now, because time is heeded to consider it ; but I do not think that £ 6 , 0 0 0 , 0 00 is a right average payment to propose. It seems to me to give a bad starting point. three-fourths is Question resolved in the affirmative. : CUSTOMS TARIFFBILL . In CommiUee (Consideration of Senate's requests resumed, vide page 10808):",41
308,Mr TUDOR,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"I wish to know if the amendment of the honourable member for Fremantle, to strike out "" 20,"" with a view to insert "" 10 "" is in order? The Committee made all wire gauze and all wire cloth dutiable, and the Senate's request that wire gauze containing more than twenty holes to the lineal inch may be admitted free, which is probablv equivalent to an ex- , emption of half the importation. The of the honourable member is not a modification of the request, but an extension of the proposal, ancl if it were carried, a still greater proportion of the importation would be free.",41
309,The CHAIRMAN,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,I appreciate the force of the honourable member's remarks; but it is impossible for me to go into mathematical calculations as to the exact effect of the proposal.,42
310,Mr TUDOR,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Yarra) [8.12] - If the Committee had made wire gauze dutiable - at 20 per cent., and the Senate had requested a reduction of the rate to . 15 per cent., the honourable member for Fremantle, according to your ruling, Mr Chairman, could move to make the duty 5 per cent. When the matter was being discussed originally, he and others received telegrams from the West, asking that certain kinds of wire gauze should be admitted free, as ' a tool of trade used in the mining industry, and I believe that a Customs.by-law was published, exempting from .duty gauze having more than twenty holes to the lineal inch. I am willing that this arrangement should be sanctioned by the Committee as a fair compromise; I have a sample of woven wire made in Melbourne in which there are twenty holes to the lineal inch, and I am informed that finer woven, wire is made here. But if the amendment is to be carried, we might as well allow all .woven wire to come in free. The woven wire used for flydoors has twelve holes to the lineal inch; but when the telegrams to which I have referred were received, it was stated that some of the battery screens used in Western Australia had 900 holes to the square inch, or 30 to the lineal inch. These will now come in free.",42
311,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"East Sydney) [8.15] - I think that in this case honourable members might, as they have done in so many others, relax the severity of their fiscal views in favour of what is undoubtedly in many parts of Australia a struggling industry. Some of the mines of Australia have been sources Of dazzling wealth to their fortunate owners. ' One would scarcely mind how much taxation were imposed in ' the case of such mines, because of the enormous wealth derived from them. But we are here dealing with a matter which affects mining throughout the CommonAvealth, and we should remember that the great bulk of the mining propositions of Austra, lia at present, and, indeed, in former times,, have represented very arduous - struggling in order to keep the mines going and pay wages-to the miners. The honourable member for Fremantle has said, and I am sure that his statement will command approval from members in every, part of the chamber, that one good thing to be said about the mining industry is that it employs the men of Australia at men's wages. There are many mines in Australia from which the shareholders are obtaining no dividends, and which are kept working Only by a very hard struggle. The indusr try that would be injuriously affected by the proposal of the honourable member for Fremantle is not a very important one, such as are many of the great iron industries, and the Committee might very well consider whether, in the circumstances, we should not make a concession in favour of the mining industry in this case. I am told that the particular appliance to which the honourable member for Fremantle has referred is one that is required in struggling mines, l n the circumstances, the Committee might very well agree to meet the honourable member's views when we can do so without injuring to any great extent anv manufacturing industry.",42
312,Mr COON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Batman) [8.18] - The appliance to which the honourable member for Fremantle has referred is what is known in the mining industry as a grate. These grates are being made in Bendigo to-dav, and are being exported to Western Australia and to South Africa.",42
313,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,Then the industry must be in a healthy condition.,42
314,Mr COON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"The honourable member for Fremantle told the Committee that oneof the Western Australian mines uses these grates to the value Of £ 3 0 0 in one year. If the statement be correct, the grates used must be of very inferior quality. If it requires an expenditure of J-6 per week to repair the grates used in connection with a crushing machine in Western Australia, that should account for a large amount of the gold that is lost in mining in that State. When the grate is taken off the grate-box to be repaired, some of the gold'gets away.",42
315,Mr HEDGES,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,It gets away without going through the screen.,42
316,Mr COON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Ever v time the screens are removed from the front of the box, some of the coarser stone nets out, and with it some of the gold. It is strange that the honourable member for Fremantle should put in this plea to enable the Western Australian mines to procure-fine woven screens. In Bendigo today mines can be worked profitably with a yield of 4 dwts. per ton. o In Western Australia, where we are given to .understand the mine-Owners require to use line netting screens, a yield of 7'dwts. per ton is necessary if a mine is to pay.",42
317,Mr MAHON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,It depends on the mine.,43
318,Mr COON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"The honourable member for Fremantle has said that it depends upon the use of fine wire screens. If in one part of Australia, by using locally-manufactured grating, we can make a mine pay with a yield of 4 dwts. to the ton, and it takes a yield of 7 dwts. to the ton to make mining profitable in Western Australia, where is the force of the honourable member's plea for the free admission of very fine wire netting screens ? Let me inform honourable members that these grates are not woven at all. They are perforated steel plates. The honourable member for Fremantle cannot tell me that a piece of wire netting stretched' in front of a crushing machine s working five head of stampers will serve the purpose of a grate. It is a perforated steel plate that is required, and that is the appliance ' which the honourable member thinks should be admitted free of duty.",43
319,Mr HEDGES,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,Perforate d steel plates may lx; the only grates the honourable member has seen.,43
320,Mr COON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,The honourable member will not assert for a moment that a woven wire-netting screen could be placed in front of a stamper box.,43
321,Mr HEDGES,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Yes , absolutely.",43
322,Mr COON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Then I venture to say that the honourable member is absolutely wrong, because such an appliance would not stand two minutes. An honourable member does not require to have a personal knowledge of mining operations to know that if a piece of fine woven wire netting such as that exhibited by the honourable member for Yarra today were placed in. front of the stampers of a crushing machine working on hard rock it would not stand half a minute. These screens are made of perforated steel plates, and honourable members will not assist the mining industry in any way by carrying the proposal submitted by the honourable member for Fremantle.",43
323,Mr ARCHER,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,Does the honourable member mean to say that woven wire-netting screens are not used?,43
324,Mr COON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"I mean to say that woven wire netting, 'such as that exhibited by the honourable member for Yarra, is not used as a screen, and that what is used is a steel plate finely perforated.",43
325,Mr ARCHER,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,Wove n nets are also used. [385],43
326,Mr HEDGES,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"I know what I am talking about, and the honourable member is welcome to put any* duty he pleases on the grates he refers to if he admits the wire netting screensto which I refer free of duty.",43
327,Mr COON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"I speak from practical experience, and I venture to say that the statement made by the honourable member t n at £>3°° year is expended in the repair a of grates at one mine in Western Australia is one reason why a yield of 7 dwts. is necessary to make mining pay in that State; If the mining companies to which the honourable member has referred would use the locally-made grates they would find that they would last very much longer, and would be very much less expensive. The honourable member's proposal would not assist the mining industry, but might be the means of throwing a number of men out of employment. As we are making these appliances here at the present time, I trust that the Committee will accept the amendment requested by the Senate.",43
328,Mr HEDGES,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Fremantle) [8.21] - I really cannot allow the statements' of the honourable member for Batman to pass unchallenged. If the honourable member is satisfied that perforated steel plates will do I have no objection to the imposition of a duty upon them. What I ask is that screens of woven wire of ten holes to the lineal inch or 100 holes to the square inch should be treated ih a manner' different to what the Senate suggests. The screens to which I refer last from four days to twoweeks, according to the class of ore treated.. the average duration being one week. .",43
329,Mr THOMAS BROWN,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,The character of the ore determines the life of the screen.,43
330,Mr HEDGES,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Exactly . What is suggested here is wovenwire measuring twentv holes to the lineal inch.. That is in accord with an opinion given certainly by the Chamber of Mines at Kalgoorlie, but it was found that extending over a bigger area than the Kalgoorlie field smaller batteries were used. The honourable member for Coolgardie will bear me out in the statement that hundreds of such small batteries are at work in Western Australia.",43
331,Mr MAHON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Hear , hear.",43
332,Mr HEDGES,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Me n working in small parties and using batteries of from 3 to 5 heads of stampers find a screen of a larger mesh absolutely necessary. They do not use a perforated steel plate. I doubt whether a steel plate could be perforated with 400 holes to the square inch, because there would only be a strand of a. very fine steel left between the holes. What we require is a woven wire screen with a, mesh of ioo holes to the square inch. When the honourable member for Batman says that it take's 7 dwtsj to the ton to pay in Western Australia, whilst 4 dwts. to the ton pays at Bendigo, I can tell him that we do not expect 3 or 4 dwts. to the ton to. pay in Kalgoorlie, in view of the expense of working mines in that district.",43
333,Mr MAHON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,Fiv e dwts. to the ton pays at Southern Cross.,44
334,Mr HEDGES,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"That yield will not pay if we tax such things as battery screens. The whole future of mining in Western Australia depends upon the assistance given the industry tp make it possible to work low-grade ores profitably. That cannot be done if every requisite of mining is taxed. When the honourable member for Batman says that it ought not to cost so much for screening as I have stated, let me give the Committee the following informationThe value of wire screens used in twelve months at Lake View, ^400; Great Boulder, ^300; South Kalgoorlie, ^240. Mines prefer British make owing to superior material and longer experience of manufacture. Only quality used. That is the information supplied to me, and I believe it to be correct. I should like to see 'every industry established ih Australia, but I do not wish to see one im dustry established at the expense of another'. I fail to understand why we should penalize an industry employing 120,000 meii, not Women or children, for the benefit of a few wire workers employed 1,000 miles away from the place at which the miners use these screens.",44
335,Mr TUDOR,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,What is to prevent the establishment of a wire factory where the screens are used?,44
336,Mr HEDGES,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"There is nothing to prevent - the establishment of awatch f ac-. tory there but the expense. I dare say that we could make watches there, but it would be hard to. say what they would cost. I implore the Committee to have a little mercy and to assist the mining industry.",44
337,Mr TUDOR,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"And wipe out the workers. - Mr HEDGES - The wire workers of Victoria, are doubtless able to do many things; but they-aire hotable' to'supply the big mining industry of Australia with the appliances referred to in this item. I hope the Committee will accept my amendment.",44
338,Mr MAHON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Coolgardie) [8.28] - I hope the Committee will accept the amendment moved by .the honourable member for Fremantle, who, as a representative of Western Australia, unquestionably does know what he is talking about when dealing with this subject. The honourable member fpr - Batman may have a close acquaintance with city industries, but he can know very little about gold mining or the conditions necessary to carry it on profitably. The honourable member talks about wire workers in Vhtoria being thrown out of employment, but if by piling up duties on mining appliances we render the working of low-grade mines unprofitable, shall we not bring about the displacement of all the men now employed in such mines? Should we not look at that side of the question, when solicitude is expressed for small city industries employing women and children 1> We are dealing here with an industry in which only 'men are employed and are paid the highest wages ruling in the world for the same class of work. ' To render the working of low-grade mines unprofitable best would lead to the disemployment of far more workers than would be affected by ad-, mitting,. free of duty, the appliance to which the honourable member for Fremantle has referred. It would throw out of employment the best class of workers; men who are paid good wages and spend them freely. We have imposed very heavy, duties ! on most mining requisites. The Tariff of 1903 differentiated severely between mining as compared with agri'-' culture, though no reason was ever given why that should be so. When the honourable member for Adelaide was. Minister of Trade and Customs, I asked him, personally, why the mining industry should be selected for special taxation, but he failed, to give a satisfactory . answer. The Committee should consider the mining industry, not only in Western Australia, but all over the Commonwealth, because it cannot bear too many burdens.

Amendment negatived.",46
349,Mr WILKS,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Dalley) [8.55]. motion now before the Chair is rather unusual, but it may be convenient for the Ministry of the day to deal with the Tariff in this piecemeal manner. If it was a question ot amendments of a Bill, I should think that your ruling, Mr Speaker, would be that we could not possibly take. that course, but I presume that the Government get out of the difficulty technically by calling these "" suggested . amendments. could not conceive of amendments on any other Bill being dealt with piecemeal. I rise, if not to obtain a ruling from you, at any rate to put before you the view that if we were' dealing with ordinary amendments of a Bill , we should not attempt to send them to the Senate in second the this fashion. If we did,' we should be surrendering our power as a deliberative body and as a part of the legislative machine. The Only plea behind which the Ministry... 27 can shelter themselves is that these are really not amendments, but suggestions. Stifl they come, perilously near to being amendments. About a week ago, when the ComAYES. mittee dealt with such. important items as "" Manufactures of Metal, n.e.i.,"" and "" wire netting,"" in a way which, according to my lights, was not proper, I understood that the Treasurer was such an earnest protectionist, and such a believer in the industries concerned, that he intended to recommit - those items. He has, however, made no mention of them in this motion. I lay the greatest stress upon the first of them, as being of the greatest importance to Australia, and I cannot understand a proNOES. tectionist Ministry not struggling once more to have it recommitted. I know, from the fate of the amendment just moved by the honourable member for Illawarra, that"" if I moved for a recommittal at this stage against the wishes of the Government I should not be successful. At the time when the item "" Manufactures of Metal, n.e.i."" was dealt with, the honourable member lor Laanecoorie, one of the strongest supporters of the Government, stated that he would move later for its recommittal - So far there has been no potion to that effect. PAIRS. I am not usually a supporter - of the Government, and do not intend to move it , but if it is moved I shall support it. I cannot understand the action of the Government in regard to it'. Another feature of the. proposal to deal with the schedule piecemeal is that we have had no statement from the Treasurer vet as to whether any of the amendments dealt with so far interThe lock with any other items which have yet to be considered. One of the reasons why it was decided not to deal with the schedule piecemeal when it was first before us was that there were many items related to One another in different parts of the schedule, and that, therefore, it would be unfair to the Senate to send the Tariff up in portions. The Treasurer has made no statement that the items with which we have already dealt I are' not interwoven with others that have yet to be considered. I cannot say personally whether items which have yet to come do or do not conflict with items that we have passed, but one case-that of ornamental stained glass work-occur s to me. We have already passed items taxing the articles used in that work, but we have yet to deal with the item covering the finished product.' I wish to emphasize and put on record the point that, in sending the Tariff up in this piecemeal fashion, it must be understood that what we have been dealing with are only suggestions, and not amendments. I trust that the Treasurer and the Government will not lose sight of the true position and powers of this Chamber.",46
350,Mr SALMON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Laanecoorie) [ 9 . 0 ] wish to say a few words in regard to an item of which I and a. number of other honourable members desire a recommittal. .1 felt very strongly that a mistake had been made by the Committee when a certain proposal was carried, and I announced my intention to move for its ""recommittal as soon as an opportunity was afforded. had not the slightest idea- I do not think that any honourable member had-that the schedule was to be treated in this fashion. I feel that I , in common with those who then agreed with me, am taken at a disadvantage, because I had hoped that a certain section of the schedule would have been completely dealt with and that we should then have had an opportunity to ask the Committee to reconsider a vote which, we believe it had given without full andproper consideration. Since the Government has decided to take this course I have endeavoured to ascertain what the position would be should I propose a recommittal of the item. I regret to find that owing to the fact that insufficient notice of this motion has been given it would be. impossible to induce the House to agree to its recommittal. Had the course been adopted which I , in common with other honourable members believed would be taken-that is to say, had we completed the schedule before the opportunity of dealing with the item had been taken away from us- I think that perhaps we might have had a chance of reversing the vote. I believe that there is no opportunity of doing that. these circumstances I amreluctantly compelled to retire from the position that I took up, but I do so with a good deal of disappointment and a. certain amount of dissatisfaction ",47
351,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Parramatta) [9.2] - The honourable member for Laane-coorie is not the only one who is disappointed at the turn which events have precedent laid down. taken.

Had it been known beforehand that the Government intended to take this course-on e to - which under ordinary circumstances and with proper notice, I should have offered no objection - ther e would have been sufficient honourable members present to carry a recommittal of the fodder duties.",47
352,Mr SPEAKER,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"I ask the honourable member not to canvas the vote of the House on that question. - I Mr. JOSEPH COOK - I think, sir, that I have a right to mention that incidentally in connection with the complaint I am lodging against the Government, that they did not intimate earlier to the House and to the country ..the course which they proposed to take. The honourable member for Laanecoorie, fortunately, is here, but I other honourable members-knowin g nothing of the course proposed to be taken to-dayare absent on imperative duties, who otherwise would unquestionably have been here.

(East Sydney) [9.8] - I do not regard the question of the /ate of duty as being of any importance compared with, thismethod of unsettling the Tariff instead of settling it. The great desire with most of us has been to get a Tariff which would contain no combustible element of that kind. To begin with, there has been incessant lobbying over such items. I consider that the whole proceeding is a wrong one. If honourable members want to give any encouragement to this industry, now is the time to do so. They should not leave it to the. chance of this mysterious sort of procedure. This request, if adopted, would place the matter entirely in the hands of the Government, because no private member could move for a joint address. If honourable members want to impose duties on lubricating mineral oils, _I ask them to impose them straight out, and not in this mysterious sort of way.",47
355,Mr BRUCE SMITH,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"The honourable member is not objecting on the constituquired tional ground, but is simply urging that it is undesirable to leave the matter open.",48
356,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"I include all the objecploitation. tions with those which I am expressing, but I am putting the - constitutional point aside for the moment, because I have other reasons that seem to be of clearer appliwe, cation. This sort of power should be used --ery rarely indeed, and certainly not connection with matters of this kind. I - not know much about lubricating mineral oils, but it seems, to me that we might settle the problem right away, without sorting to such procedure. - Mr CARR (Macquarie) [9.10] - Whe ther the principle of a deferred . duty should be accepted or not is really immalic, terial ; the main issue is whetTi'fer duty should be imposed. We all know that oils-mor e than any other commodity, suppose-ar e controlled by some of the richest corporations of the world. Tbey are a household necessity, in addition being widely used in trade and commerce. 'In view of that fact, it behoves Australia to see that its own oil resources are effectuI ally tapped, and that the industry is made self - supporting. The reason why so much capital is invested in the oil dustrv is - mainly because expensive machinery and processes are required to. in the production of refined oils of any sort. Nature ""has provided Aus- . tralia with ample resources in the way of oil. Ira New South Wales we have great possibilities-possibilitie s which promise, not only a local supply of oils, But also a large surplus for export. I am in a position to say that there is no necessity to adopt a condition attachedto this request if the Committee is averse to it, because a company has already spent nearly £1,000,000 in tapping our vast resources in the Blue Mountains.",48
357,Mr CROUCH,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,Is that the Commonwealth Oil Corporation?,48
358,Mr CARR,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Yes , though I did not desire to mention its name particularly. It does not matter what the name is; the fact remains that Australia's resources are being tapped by a company which is now practically in a position to supply all its needs in regard to lubricating oils. There may be a shortage for a few months, but the plant is installed, and it is only a matter . of getting all the machinery that is on the . spot into working order, when the company will be able to supply more oil than is rein the Commonwealth. The exclusive control of the well supplies of oils ""renders us more or less liable to imposition and exI do not want to detail the practices of the larger companies of the world; but,' in view of the fact that questionable practices are employed, and that as a community, will be virtually at the mercy of the large corporations outside' in Australia if we do not take some effective do measures, it behoves us to. at least see that our sources of supply shall be absolutely within reach"" of our administrative reinstitutions. We have that opportunity now. In addition to that, the company I have referred to has already displayed a magnanimous attitude, not only towards the pubbut also towards its employees. It has a invested nearly £1,000,000 in the endea vour to tap our resources. It is guided by I men who, I am pleased to say. are dominated largely by altruistic as well as com- mercial motives. To begin with, they have to shown such a generous disposition towards their own workers that if there were more . companies similarly guided there would be, think, almost a cessation of the unrest ' ' that exists the wide world over against the capitalistic forces which control such iminmense resources as are controlled in New South Wales by the corporation I allude",48

360,Mr CARR,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"It has been necessary to lay the full facts of the case before honourable members. Those facts have been furnished, not by one party, but by all - parties, and, seeing that such procedure has been, not only tolerated, but deliberately allowed by the officers of this Houso, no one company is a jot more to blame than another for adopting those tactics. fact the concern which did not seek to put before honourable members its own view of the question would be placed at a considerable disadvantage.

I do not stand here as an advocate of the capitalistic conother Chamber. trol of any natural opportunities. I believe that such opportunities should be controlled by the Government.

363,Mr CROUCH,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,Fro m where does the ported oil chiefly come?,49
364,Mr CARR,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"From various quarters. It is a notorious fact that those who control its output do so in the most ruthless manner, so far as - the consumers are concerned. They are out merely to make a profit. They are not prompted by any considerations of good-will towards their fellows, or by any such sentiments as have been evidenced by the authorities which control the corporation within our own borIn ders. But, quite apart from that, I hold that it is much better for us to retain control of this industry, seeing that we have sufficient shale deposits in the Blue Mountains fo supply us'with oil for an indefinite period. We shall not be true to this country if we do not encourage this particular 'industry. I urge the Committee quesin the interests of the Commonwealth, to the congrant the protection that is asked.",49

Why not do the same 4d. thing here?

Moreover, I do not believe in handing over to the Senate power to tell us that until an address has been agreed to by both Houses, we cannot consider the desirableness or otherwise of imposing an increased duty upon this item. If we adopt the course proposed in the case of lubricants, locks, and timber, why not adopt it in regard to all the requests preferred by the Senate? I am satisfied that if we confer this power upon that Chamber, it will be cited in the near future as a precedent. I would rather see a duty of 46. per gallon imposed upon mineral oils than see the Tariff re-opened at a very early date",49
368,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,I think that this Tariff will have to be re-opened very soon. Some protectionists votes which have been cast here will have to be tested.,50

If a. powerful corporation like this can carry on in this tvrannical manner at the outset, what chance will its employees have when it is firmlv established in Australia?- In New South Wales we have tried to prevent the corporation from obtaining a private township, and have been unable to do so: what chance shall we have of controlling it when its power has increased?

But on the other hand, there is every inducement at this juncture for the corporation to take steps to conciliate the men, so as to secure a favourable vote in this Parliament. 1 Only last Thursday I had the story of the dispute between the corporation and its employees related to me; but between Thursday and the present time we find that the dispute has been settled, although it. has been going on for months, and the men have been treated in the most shameful manner.

The remaining 90 per opcent, is sold in tins, and employment is thus given to tinsmiths, as well ns to carnot penters and men engaged in making cases in our timber yards. The Standard Oil Company was the first to introduce in Australia the conditional rebate system, which is on similar lines to the method which led to its-being fined something like £5,000,000 by the Supreme Court of the United States of America- a method adopted to crush out opposition. When this Tariff was introduced the Trust had in Australia sufficient kerosene to supply the needs of Victoria, at all events, for twelve months : - nevertheless, it immediately raised the price of its oil. Honourable members will recollect that it was not until it was threatened with legal proceedings that it made a refund of the money it had unjustly collected in that way. It has been stated that itobtained control of some oil fields in Burmah which would have yielded millions of gallons, but that instead of using the wells it blew the bottoms out of them by means of dynamite, so that they could not be worked at any time in opposition to it. We are informed that an effort has been made to prevent as far as possible the entry of the Standard Oil Company's kerosene into Japan and China. I ' have also been informed-althoug h it is a mere hearsay statement-that the Viceroy of India has seen fit to interfere to avoid the possibility of oil wells in India being treated by the company as were those in Burmah, to which I have referred. This is what John D. Archbold, Vice-President of the Standard Oil Company, said in the Philadelphia Evening PostShould foreign competition at any future period confront the company with the alternative of selling its products at a loss in certain markets, the former horn of the dilemma might be decided upon if the crisis was regarded as a temporary one; the company being further compelled to give some consideration to its extensive property investments abroad, and to the thousands of its employees relying upon it for permanent occupation. It may be emphatically reiterated that it has been no part of the policy of this company to benefit the foreign consumer at the expense of the American consumer; but it has-been and must be its policy to maintain its foreign commerce, if possible, even should future sacrifices become 'necessary for so doing. policy would surely be bf eventual detriment to the - home consumer, to the home producer, and to the nation itself as well as to the company. As long as I am privileged to be a member of this House my vote will always be cast to prevent the Standard Oil Trust controlling the oil trade in Australia. I repeat to-night; what I told the agent of the company ; that the boast that it was rich enoughto buy the Australian Parliament was an [ 3 8 6 J -2 idle one. I say that it is neither rich nor strong enough to do so.

If honourable but members, blinded by passion, choose to handicap the engineering industry of Austhat is a matter between them and",55
421,Mr HUTCHISON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,Where is the handicap if 'the commodity is got at the same,55
422,Mr KELLY,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Do our local manufacturers seek to impose these restrictions in order that they may become - altruists, and sell more cheaply than they are forced to '",55
423,Mr HUTCHISON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,But - local competition to .always makes the goods cheaper in the end.,55
424,Mr KELLY,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"I confess I am somewhat - sceptical on that point, because I do not we believe that manufacturers, any more than importers, are philanthropists. I ask the an Treasurer to accept the proposal of the of honourable member for Parkes, and to then permit us to divide on the question of t.he fair duty. But, in any case, let us consider the interests, of Australia, and not the demerits pf any particular company or companies.",55
425,Mr CROUCH,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Corio) [10.13] - I as the sume that until there was a proclamation, squabble issued there would be no duty.",55
426,Mr BRUCE SMITH,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,The i e would be the Minister duty passed by this House.,55
427,Mr CROUCH,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"I am assuming that if accept the suggested amendment of the Senate, our previous proposal of 3 j d . and the rate 3d. will no longer operate.",55
428,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"That is not its inherent so; this is JJ, not J.",55
429,Mr CROUCH,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Quite so, but I think that this is intended as a substitution.",56
430,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"No , as an adcharge dition.",56
431,Mr CROUCH,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Then the meaning is - that the duty shall be 3^d. and 3d. until the proclamation,. and .that, following proclamation, the duty shall be increased oy f d . If that be so, it seems to me ive are putting a lot of machinery into tion for very small results. I desire duty unless it be necessary for the proare told by the tection of the industry; anc. the fact the Government are ready to accept the gested request seems to indicate that they do not think the duty necessary at the present time. We have to make our choice of the lesser of two evils. The Governand ment admit that no immediate evil is likely to result to the industry, seeing that they do not propose to issue the proclamation just now. But it would be a great evil every, user of machinery--ever y blacksmith in every country town-is penalized. were informed by the honourable member for Macquarie that there is a guarantee of no increase in prices. I do not know an item on which there has been so much lobbying as there has been on the item fore us. Honourable members have, been sent for, and documents have been supproclamation plied, expressing the hope that we shall vote in a .certain direction.",56
432,Mr CARR,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,That is no offence.,56
433,Mr CROUCH,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Quite so, if they were accurate. But I - find that the docudone ments supplied . to us in reference to this item have to do with paraffine wax. When the item of paraffine wax before the Committee, there was a great readiness displayed to show that there would be no increase in price, and that would be able to purchase .it in any part of Australia. One unfortunate firm in Launceston, who received a guarantee this effect, find, however, according to letter which appeared in the newspapers today, that they cannot buy paraffine anywhere in the Commonwealth. I merely mention this fact to show that such guarantees are worthless. The able member for Macquarie almost worked that subject. us to tears by his description of this altruistic combination filled with the noblest sentiments. The honourable member for Cook has informed us that this combination has leased an enormous area of land, and that, while the members of the combination cannot, undei the work the truck system, they are forcing their employees to live on the land which has been acquired, and for which they rent. I was surprised to hear the honourable member for Hindmarsh say that the question before us has nothing to do with the rates of wages. The great arguthe ment for protection is that internal competition willprevent unduly increased that prices, and that increased wages are paid moto the workmen. In this case, there is no only one Australian competitor, and we honourable member that for Cook that men without clothing or sugfood have urged that a duty is necessary in order to better their condition. However, seeing that the duty will prejudicially affect a large number of people, that those who are endeavouring to exploit this industry are, at any rate, not Australians, and that their employees are hardly used, while there is a monopoly of land if and no real guarantee against an increase in prices,. I hope bhat users will not be. We penalized by any increase in the duty.",56
434,Mr THOMAS BROWN,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Calare) [10.20] - We should bear in mind that two of principles are involved in this item. One is the amount of duty that we should place beupon the article, and the other is whether we should legislate upon Tariff matters by or directly as a House. With the honourable member for Parkes, I think the Committee will be wise to decide first whether the House is to determine the imposition of duties, or whether it should be by proclamation, and afterwards determine the amount of duty to be imposedI t would be unfair to those vitally conwas cerned to allow the statements of the honourable member for Hindmarsh regarding the action of the miners to pass unchalit lenged. He appeared to indicate that the intensity and bitterness of the strike was largely due to the miners, and not to the to mine-owners. The reason which he urged a was that the miners refused arbitration. I of believe the honourable member for Cook wax correctly put the position when he stated that the men have had a real grievance.",56
435,The CHAIRMAN,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,Order . 1 must honorask the honourable member not to pursue,56
436,Mr THOMAS BROWN,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"What I have said will be sumcient to convey to the Committee what' I wish to indicate. I refuse to believe that,those men have not had a grievance. It is extraordinary that when an item of this kind comes up for conlaw, sideration we should find a company that have been fighting their working men to the bitter end prepared to capitulate and offer .the men something like rea.sonable terms. The company are in the position as this particular company ? that they must either capitulate or import contract labour to carry on. They tried to carry on under the conditions which existed and have practically failed. 1 that the honourable member for Macquarie bers have advocated? is correct in his presentment of this phase - uf the question, and that the change in attitude of the company is due, not to terior considerations of duties, but to fact that the management has passed into' the hands of a gentleman who has some common-sense, and recognises that the workalso - ing men, as well as thoso inteiested only in the raising. ot dividends, should have - consideration. Those who advocate the imposition of this tax in order to find work for the men, to create an industry in tralia, and particularly to establish a rival to the great American corporation, seem overlook the fact that that American Frankenstein's monster, which they fear much, was created under the very condimany tions under which they now ask this Chamthought ber to build up the Australian, company, l t was under the special privileges of American Tariff protection that the Standard Oil Company was created."" It is largely owing to those privileges that it able to wield its great power and to come within its own territory a great chine of oppression. How dp honourable members propose to prevent the repetition of that kind of .thing in Australia, and - avoid, creating a young Frankenstein's monstei ot our own ? The honourable .memplanation have beeii made. ber for Cook informed the Committee that he had been led'to give a number of tectionist votes on the assumption that wages would be regulated by legislation. Unlike that honourable member, I prefer see the regulating machinery in active operation before giving Tariff concessions. When I see it established, I shall be pared to judge proposals for protective duties on their merits. I see no reason to go back upon my free-trade principles, but I am prepared when the question arises - assist to formulate regulating machinery that cliaracter, because I recognise that present party conditions free-trade is back number so far as the Commonwealth is concerned, and may continue so for good many years to come. alternative is to' try to legislate in - direction indicated by the honourable ber for Cook. But do not other honourable members recognise that there are other parI ties, in the shape of the large number of users of this material, to be considered ' as well Have not those persons some claim also upon our consideration, or are they to be sacrificed at the shrine of the one particular interest hope whose cause a number of honourable memThat seems to be . the attitude of some honourable members the who can see only the one interest in this ul- ' connection, and do not appear to realise the that there are other interests involved. My vote will be cast in the direction of giving fair consideration to the company, while looking after the other ""interests that are so vitally concerned. I .do not propose to commit myself to the principle of legislating on Tariff matters by proclamation instead of on the. ordinary lines that have Ausso far been adopted by this Chamber ",56
437,Mr CARR,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Macquarie) [10.27] - A to good dealhas been made of the condition suggested by another place; but we have so not considered that aspect in' regard to other industries to which we have fit to give protection. If we had stipulated .that no industry, should be protected until it had reached a certain stage, - we should have had an interminable Tariff discussion, and therefore it' seems to be is wise to eliminate that deferred condition. beI hope that that will be done, and the. maduty, if possible, passed as requested. I am sorry that matters that do not directly bear upon the duty have been introduced. to I specially avoided bringing them in, but one or two remarks that require a little exThere has been talk of a strike, and of men being prohungry and unclothed. When Mr Sutherland, the consulting engineer and general manager of the company, came out, he to said at once: ""There must be no trouble with the men."" He holds that if there is trouble, a comptroller, being the more prehighly educated man, and better able to understand conditions, should .be responsible for settling it, and that there should be no trouble at all. He believes that if to managersunderstood their business as of they ought to understand it, there under would be no industrial"" disputes in thea world today; He makes it his boast that he has had no industrial disputes. That a is .the policy which he has pursued all The only along. Ten years ago, when in Cobar, he the settled a trouble in the same magnanimemmous way. The question of the township is beyond the pale of Federal legislation. still think that the proposals' which the. company have in view, and which I have seen, place the in entirely in the hands the Government for regulation. propose to charge no ground rent, to build decent houses for the employees, and charge the nominal rent of 10 per cent, on the' cost, and to supply them with libraries, schools, and churches. In fact, they are morrow, following the ideals laid down by such philanthropic firms as Cadbury-Brothers and Lever Brothers in the Old Country. If we had more firms of that disposition there would be a good deal less trouble between the masses and the employers. Notwithstanding all that, I-' adhere to my former statement: that natural opportunities should be controlled by the people, but that, if that can not be secured, the next best thing is to see them in the hands of companies like the one I have referred to.",57
438,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"East Sydney) [10.31] Since names have been introduced, I wish to say that the general manager of. this company impressed me very favourably as a man who was anxious to do what was fair by the men. I rather deprecate the introduction of these matters in connection with the Tariff ",58

440,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"The absurdity of the whole business is that this suggestion for a joint address, and the issue of a ' pioclamation, is over a question of f d . per gallon.
