1,The SPEAKER,Unknown,Mr Harry Jenkins) took the chair at 2 pm and read prayers. NA Mr Bill Brown AO,17
2,Mr RUDD,CONDOLENCES,"On indulgence, I would like to make a few remarks about the passing of Bill Brown. I think everyone was saddened recently by the passing of Bill Brown, the former test captain of the Australian cricket team, a member of Sir Donald Bradman's 1948 Invincibles, and Australia's last surviving pre-war test cricketer. At the age of 95 he was Australia's oldest surviving test cricketer and was, based on our records, the only native-born Queenslander to captain the Australian team. He was an outstanding opening batsman, averaging 46.8 runs playing for Australia and 56.3 runs playing for Queensland, and made a major contribution to the building up of the strength of the game in my home state. He served in the RAAF in the Pacific during the Second World War, briefly resuming his career afterwards and then retiring from test cricket in 1948. Bill Brown left a lasting impression on all those who encountered him. Around Australia today people have been sharing warm, personal stories about Bill Brown-the time he visited their school to teach aspiring cricketers how to hold a bat, the time they met him at his sports store in Brisbane or the time they saw him at a local community event or game. Steve Waugh said today: Bill was the man who my generation really looked up to. For us he was the embodiment of everything about the baggy green cap. Bill was also a man of some mischief and humour. Robert Craddock tells a great story in today's Courier-Mail, reflecting on Bill's genuine larrikin sense of humour. The story goes along the following lines. Apparently when he was flying with the Royal Australian Air Force in Papua New Guinea an American hostess one day told him she was concerned about the recklessness of Australian pilots. Bill was the pilot at the time. He assured her that he was mature and trustworthy, as were all Australian pilots. But when she returned to the cockpit she discovered that there was nobody in the cockpit flying the plane. She descended to the rear of the aircraft, screaming. Bill had decided to hide in a cupboard just to give her a thrill. An interesting way to give people a thrill! Bill was awarded the Order of Australia in 2000 for services to cricket as a player, selector, coach and administrator and for his involvement with the cricket charity Lords Taverners, which is a fantastic charity that raises money for disadvantaged young people. I had the great privilege to meet Bill a number of times at games at the Gabba. He was always a bit like Barnabas, the â€˜son of encouragement'-always with something positive to say to young players and to people he generally met about what good things they were doing and how they could do better. We of course extend our sympathy to his wife, Barbara; to his sons, Steve, Geoff and Peter; and to his 10 grandchildren and five great-grandchildren. Bill Brown's life innings of 95 is a significant innings by any person's standard, but it has been a huge innings for Australia.",17
3,Dr NELSON,CONDOLENCES,"On indulgence, I too would like to speak about Bill Brown. Bill great was the only remaining link to Australia's pre World War II test era. As the Prime Minister said, Bill died at the age of 95, which was an extraordinary innings. He was regarded as a great character, a great Australian and one of the nation's great cricketers. He was our oldest living test cricketer and the third oldest in the world. His death will leave, I think, only four surviving members of the 1948 Invincibles squad-Arthur Morris, Sam Loxton, Neil Harvey and Ron Hamence. Bill's health in recent years steadily declined and he died peacefully-as I suppose we all would like to eventually-at an RSL home in Brisbane's northern suburbs on Sunday. Bill Brown was one of those who have really shaped our nation and the way we see ourselves. He was not only a proud Queenslander but also a great cricketer, a great man and a great Australian, and I strongly support the remarks of the Prime Minister. NA Housing",17
4,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to comments from the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs in relation to the NATSEM housing affordability statistics that were released today, where she said the best way to help poor young homebuyers is: ... a tax privileged way ... with our first home saver accounts. Can the Prime Minister now explain why a person earning $200,000 a year is entitled to a government co-contribution of $1,500 but an apprentice earning $12,000 a year, saving for her first home, is entitled to a government co-contribution of only half that, at $750?",18
5,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I find it remarkable that the opposition asks questions about housing, given that for 12 years there was, firstly, no minister for housing, secondly, no department of housing and, thirdly, no housing policy on the part of those opposite. When it comes to practical measures to assist those who are seeking to buy their first home, the first obstacle they are up against is high interest rates. The party of new-found compassion, those opposite, seem to overlook the fact that interest rates rose 10 times in a row in their period of office. The reason interest rates rose 10 times in a row and have risen twice since then is, in large measure, that the previous government allowed the inflation genie out of the bottle. When we took over office, inflation was running at a 16-year high and we had interest rates that were the second highest in the developed world.",18
6,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance. The question to the Prime Minister and his social justice truck is: why does a person on $200,000 get twice that of a person on $12,000?",18
7,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat.,18
8,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"To further my answer to the question, if you look at the measures, therefore, which deal effectively with the housing challenge facing working families, No. 1 is dealing with the inflation challenge. Let us actually look at the logic here. If you allow inflation to become uncontrolled in the economy, if you allow inflationary pressures to rise without acting on them, what happens is that upwards pressure occurs on interest rates, and then interest rates go up and then you squeeze people out of the housing market. There were 10 interest rate rises in a row-the world's second highest interest rates, when we assumed office, as far as the developed economies are concerned-and then on top of that inflation was running at 16-yearMs Ley- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The Prime Minister needs to answer a simple question: why does a person on $200,000 receive",18
9,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Farrer will resume her seat.,18
10,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The core of the challenge for working families and those struggling with interest rate pressures now is a result of this: a previous government which did not contain inflation and which put upward pressure on interest rates, and this, as a consequence, flowing through to cost-of-living pressures for working families. This is why inflation remains the core article of our response to the economic challenges which face Australia today. Inflation and interest rates affect working families. On the substance of housing policy, in response to",18
11,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,19
12,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If those opposite think that housing policy can be addressed in the absence of inflation and interest rates, I find that a remarkable departure from core economic logic. Why those opposite seem to respond so audibly and with great agitation to the logic I was pointing out before is that they were responsible for inflation getting out of control, beyond the three per cent margin, and they were responsible, as a consequence, for upward pressure on interest rates. Therefore, they are responsible for the extraordinary mortgage rate pressures which are currently being experienced by working families. Prior to the election, we undertook to implement three core sets of housing policies. One is the first home saver accounts. The second relates to what we do for affordable rental accommodation. The third relates to",19
13,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance. If the Prime Minister cannot answer the question, can he just say so.",19
14,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It is not a point of order.,19
15,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"These policies-a total funding commitment of about half a billion dollars and in to to about $1.6 billionrepresent one key fact: $1.6 billion more than those opposite provided for public investment in the housing challenges of working families. The housing policy they took to the last election adds up to this figure: one big, fat zero. On the pre-election commitmentMr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance. It relates to the last section of the question. Can the Prime Minister explain why a person earning $200,000 per annum is entitled to a government co-contribution",19
16,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member will resume his seat. Member for Fisher, is this on a further point of order or the same point of order?",19
17,Mr SLIPPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, a further point of order. Under standing order 86, when a point of order is taken the Speaker has an obligation to give a ruling.",19
18,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Fisher will resume his seat. The member for North Sydney in selectively repeating part of the question did not mention the first part, which was in relation to a NATSEM report. The Prime Minister is in order.",19
19,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On the whole question of housing affordability, which the NATSEM report goes to, you have to deal with the inflation-interest rates challenge and you have to deal with the other housing policy settings. We have put forward one such policy. On the question of the pre-election commitment which we made on the first home saver accounts, we stand by everything we put to the Australian people, including the eligibility criteria that we outlined there. We believe this is a good piece of public policy, and the reason is that it is the first time it has been embraced in this country. For 12 years, those opposite sat silently, idly by while so many working families, so many Australians, dealing with the mortgage challenge they faced as a consequence of successive interest rate rises were simply left to languish. The response by those opposite, the party of newfound compassion, was in these words: â€˜Working families have never been better off.' Let me conclude by saying this: our pre-election commitments on housing, which are $1.6 billion more than those opposite-the new-found party of compassion-will actually be honoured. We do not divide them into core promises and non-core promises. One of those commitments was the first home saver accounts. The criteria for the first home saver accounts were articulated clearly before the election. We have a mandate to implement them in the manner in which they were put to the people, and implementing them we are. HMAS Sydney",19
20,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel. Would the minister update the House on arrangements being made to commemorate the loss of the HMAS Sydney?,20
21,Mr SNOWDON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Banks for his question. The national interest in and response to the discovery of the final resting place of the HMAS Sydney and her crew of 645 have been overwhelming. This discovery and the tragic loss of life need to be marked in a manner befitting the significance and importance to this nation. The Navy is planning a commemorative ceremony in the near future, possibly in the next two weeks. The ceremony, while low-key, will include the laying of a suitably worded plaque and a wreath over the Sydney site. We are also planning a national memorial service to be held in Sydney on 24 April, the day before ANZAC Day. This will provide an opportunity for families and other members of the public to commemorate the tragic loss of Sydney and its crew. We will be releasing further details about a venue and timing shortly. In addition, a national commemoration will be held on 19 November, on the 67th anniversary of the loss of Sydney. Options being considered include a memorial service at the HMAS Sydney memorial site at Geraldton and a commemorative onboard service on the current HMAS Sydney over the wreck of the Sydney. Of course, family members will be invited. Simultaneously on 19 November, we are planning a memorial service at the Australian War Memorial here in Canberra. We are liaising with the German government regarding appropriate recognition of the loss of their sailors at the HSK Kormoran site. As I announced yesterday, Defence is setting up a 1800 number for families to call to make sure that they are being kept informed. The number will be released as soon as the hotline is operational. In addition, the Department of Defence is developing a website to keep the public up to date about developments. We are also looking at other ways, including fact sheets, to provide appropriate information to family and friends. The SV Geosounder will be returning to Geraldton late this week and is scheduled to arrive on the evening of Thursday, 20 March. The SV Geosounder is expected to return to Sydney's site to carry out video and photographic examination of the wreckage from this Sunday. Similar examination of the Kormoran site will also be carried out once protocols to dive over the wreck have been established between the Australian and German governments. Specialist add-on remote operating vehicle camera and video equipment is being airfreighted in from Norway. This will provide enhanced capability for taking high-definition photographs. Specialist lighting equipment that can be attached to the ROVs is already on standby on the SV Geosounder. Five specialist ROV operators are currently being mobilised from within Australia and will join the Geosounder once she has returned to port. The remotely operated vehicles will not interfere with the vessels in way or retrieve any objects or artefacts from the seabed. Once we have gathered the data, the Chief of the Defence Force will convene a commission of inquiry to determine what facts can be established about the loss of the Sydney.",20
22,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Mr Speaker, on indulgence, I would like to commend and support the government on the way in which it is handling this matter and ask that the opposition be briefed and have the opportunity to participate in the development of the arrangements. I think the government is handling this particular matter sensitively and appropriately. Taxation",21
23,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister stand by his commitment that, under a Labor government, the average rate of taxation as a share of GDP will not be increased above the level projected for the next three years in the 2007 Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Outlook?",21
24,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Consistent with what I have said in answer to earlier questions, we stand by all of our pre-election commitments. Economy",21
25,Ms NEAL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister update the House on the state of the global economy and the government's response?,21
26,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Members will be aware that US monetary authorities have recently been acting in relation to the challenges which now present themselves on global and US financial markets. This presents real challenges for US monetary authorities and for monetary authorities around the world as financial institutions are encountering various ranges of liquidity shortfalls. In the last any week, the US Federal Reserve has taken a series of important actions to reassure financial markets. First, over the weekend the Fed approved a $30 billion loan to assist JP Morgan to help finance the acquisition of Bear Stearns; second, it has expanded its role as an emergency lender to include investment banks as well as commercial banks; and, third, it has cut the discount rate-the rate at which banks borrow money from the Fedto 3.25 per cent from 3.5 per cent. In the six months since September last year, the Federal Reserve's key interest rate has been reduced from 5.25 per cent to three per cent, and today the Federal Open Market Committee will meet in Washington to consider further monetary policy adjustments. The Australian government welcome the Fed's efforts to stabilise markets and, through our own monetary authorities and other authorities, we are closely monitoring the situation as it unfolds. Australia must, as a consequence of developments in the global economy, continue to pursue a prudent economic strategy in the face of these challenges abroad but also in the face of the domestic economic challenges we face at home. That includes, of course, the inflation challenge. The Reserve Bank has repeatedly warned that Australia faces inflationary challenges. Inflation is elevated because Australia's productive capacity has not kept pace with growing demand. The lessons for all of us on these questions are very clear. First, it is impossible for any responsible government dealing with responsible economic management to ignore the inflation challenge. You need to deal with the inflation challenge. Second, it is impossible for any responsible government dealing with the challenges which now present themselves across the economy to continue to support policies of profligate spending, contributing to unsustainable growth in demand. Third, it is not responsible, particularly given the last 20 sets of warnings which emerged from the Reserve Bank, not to invest on the supply side of the economy in skills and infrastructure. These are the lessons which we take to heart, and they underpin the approach we take in the overall management of the economy. On the question of dealing with the inflation challenge that we are presented with, it is important that the House be seized of the fact that, when this government took over, inflation was running at a 16-year high. As a consequence of that, and the inattention to it by those who preceded us, we have the second highest interest rates in the advanced world. So the challenge that we face in framing the upcoming budget is to make sure that we are attending to these emerging pressures across the global economy-which are real, significant and substantial and should not occasion laughter on the part of those opposite-and that we are dealing simultaneously with the challenges of domestic inflation. High inflation, if left unaddressed, is an enemy of working families because of the roll-through effect of interest rates on disposable family income, not the least of which is people's ability to pay their mortgages. That is why, in our overall approach to the economy, acting on inflation remains key. That is why, from January this year, within six weeks of taking office, we embraced a five-point strategy for dealing with the threat of inflation, hinging on, firstly, what we do by way of producing a responsible budget which maintains a responsible surplus, given the circumstances that we now face; secondly, dealing with the challenge of boosting private savings; thirdly, dealing with the challenge of skills; fourthly, infrastructure; and, fifthly, enhancing productivity and dealing with the challenges of workforce participation. What now unfolds in the global economy is of real moment to the nation and every working family in the nation. I would strongly recommend to all members of the House, including those who regard this as a matter of rolling humour and interjection, that these are serious matters, requiring the serious attention of Australia's monetary policy authorities and other economic authorities as we seek to ensure that this economy has a robust future. That means being attentive to the inflation challenge. That means pursuing a policy of prudent economic management. That means ensuring that we do not sustain the profligate levels of spending inherited from those who preceded us. Housing Affordability",21
27,Mr DUTTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. I refer the minister to the comments made by his adviser Dr Nicholas Gruen that â€˜those who have taken out mortgages in the past four or five years would be the hardest hit by the efforts by both the Reserve Bank and the government to control inflation'. Does the minister for finance agree with his adviser's comments and does he really understand the impact of the government's decisions on struggling families with mortgages?,22
28,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Dr Nicholas Gruen is not my adviser, as was stated in the question from the member for Dickson. That is yet another thing that is wrong in a question from the opposition. We had it from the member for Wentworth all last weekfactually incorrect statements in questions. Dr Gruen is not my adviser. I have indicated in a speech that I will be seeking to get assistance from him on the matter of deregulationMr Hockey-He's a consultant, not an adviser.",22
29,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Exactly. And your point is?,23
30,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,23
31,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The question has been asked.,23
32,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I hope you can do better than this in the last five or six questions in question time, folks. Dr Gruen is not my adviser. As a person who is a respected columnist in a number of journals, he is entitled to express views on other matters as he sees fit, as indeed any other consultant who works for government, be they from KPMG or Deloitte or whoever, is entitled to express views or to work for clients as they see fit. Housing Affordability",23
33,Mr CLARE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister inform the House of recent trends in housing affordability? What is the government doing to address the challenge of homelessness?,23
34,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. We have just come from about an hour and a half debate in the federal parliamentary Labor Party on what various members of the party have found in their local communities on the homelessness front. They have been out visiting shelters for the homeless. Also, what is now an emerging development is the fact that homeless shelters are having to cope with people who are falling out of the housing market because they cannot afford to pay their mortgages. This was a most serious debate and discussion that we had. Those who have traditionally provided shelter services are now having to deal with a whole group of families who, for the first time, are having to rely upon various charities across the country to provide them with transitional accommodation and in some cases crisis accommodation because affordability has become such a real problem. Some of the statistics referred to in the report by AMP and NATSEM released today are worth recording for the House. I note that these were not referred to in the earlier question to me. The report describes the 1995-96 to 2005-06 period as a decade of dwindling hope. What are the actual figures when it comes to housing affordability? This is a figure which I think should sear itself into people's attention. In 1995-96, according to this report, purchasing a typical home cost less than five times annual income. In 200506 that ratio had blown out to 7Â½ times annual income. Therein lies the core definition of the housing affordability problem. Whatever increases occurred in the disposable income of households in that period of time have not kept pace with the extraordinary explosion in overall housing costs. That is the absolute core of the housing affordability problem. In response to an earlier question I ran through our responses on housing affordability generally: firstly, a half billion dollar program, the first home saver account; and, secondly, a half billion dollar program to provide affordable rental accommodation which is designed to bring into stock 100,000 additional units of affordable rental accommodation for the nation over time. Thirdly, we want to deal with the real challenge which local authorities and state governments have brought to our attention nationwide, and to that of the development industry, which is: how do you bring down the level of infrastructure charging on new housing developments? That is why we have also put forward our proposal for a half billion dollar fund to deal with housing affordability, with the object of bringing down local infrastructure charging, with the participation of local authorities, by as much as 20 per cent. This is one part of the problem. The other is when it flips over into actual homelessness. Here the data becomes so compelling. In the presentations I received from so many of my backbenchers today-and 38 of them spoke in the debate in the parliamentary party-they reported that in the various centres that they visited right across the nation, from electorates spanning Fremantle to Launceston, the constant reply was that there is such a huge and growing turn-away rate for homeless shelters across the country. There are turn-away rates of 40 per cent, 50 per cent or 100 per cent, depending on where you are. This means that we have a problem in the physical availability of crisis accommodation stock in the country. This is a big problem. The attendant problem is that, with people who are using homeless shelters, the recurrence of the problem-that is, people who use a homeless shelter but, through the inadequate provision of associated health facilities, dental facilities, mental health ties, become return visitors to homeless shelters-is huge. This problem has not received sufficient ventilation in the national debate. It must do so. It is a crying shame for Australia that, according to the census data, we have 100,000 people classified as homeless. It is a crying shame for Australia that, according to the data, we have some 10,000 people who are sleeping rough each night. The reports from individual caucus members about individual stories of distress, discomfort and plain financial disaster are disturbing deeply. That is why the first white paper commissioned by this government is on homelessness. We as a nation have to get this right not just in boosting the physical supply of stock for homeless across the country but also by dealing with it in a way where we actually bring down the number of people who use these services on a repeat basis. It is a core hallmark of whether we are a decent society or not. It therefore commands our attention. These days it doubly commands our attention because of the data contained in the report released today by NATSEM and the AMP, which points to this ballooning housing affordability problem for working families everywhere, placing all of them at risk of one day having to contemplate the possibility of needing emergency accommodation themselves. That is why this government is determined to act in this area. It is of fundamental relevance to all working families. Economy",23
35,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. I refer to the Treasurer's media statement of 5 March, which referred to the household final consumption expenditure chain price index. Would the Treasurer explain to the House why this index is widely considered a broader measure of inflation than the headline CPI? Will the Treasurer confirm that the facilinational accounts showed the index of household final consumption expenditure increased by 0.4 per cent in the quarter, the second lowest quarterly rise in 2Â½ years? Given that the national accounts showed this measure of consumer price inflation moderating, does he now regret egging the Reserve Bank on to hike interest rates with his intemperate remark, â€˜The inflation genie is out of the bottle'?",24
36,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question. No, I do not regret it for one moment. It is not more reliable than the CPI. It is not more reliable than the Reserve Bank's underlying rate of inflation. It is not as reliable as the Reserve Bank's underlying rate of inflation. That is the situation in economics. Mr Hockey-Why?",24
37,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Because that is the view of the Treasury and that is the view,24
38,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,24
39,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"So we are going to question the honesty and integrity of the Treasury again, are we? Are you going to put your foot in your mouth again? The truth is that anyone who understands the consumer price index in this country, anyone who understands inflation, knows it is the consumer price index and the Reserve Bank measures of underlying inflationMr Hockey-Why?",25
40,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,They are the ones that are showing that inflation is at a 16-year high. Mr Costello interjecting,25
41,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The sound effects man up the back is going to put his hand 16-year high! The member for Wentworth came into the House last night and gave a speech on inflation. Do you know what he had to say here last night? Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, a point of order on relevance: the question was, â€˜Would the Treasurer explain to the House why this index is considered a broader and more reliable measure of inflation than the CPI?'",25
42,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! There is no need to repeat the question. The member for North Sydney will resume his seat. The Treasurer will continue. Mr Hockey-Why, Treasurer?",25
43,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Because it is not a more reliable measure. Here we have another fiction from the member for Wentworth. He came into this House last night and gave a speech on inflation. Do you know what he had to say? Listen to this. He said in the fight against inflation it was â€˜mission accomplished'. Can you believe this guy? What planet is the member for Wentworth living on? He does not sit around the same kitchen table as the average Australian. They know inflation is high. Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the Treasurer was asked why this index is considered a broader and more reliable measure of inflation than the CPI.",25
44,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for North Sydney will resume his seat. Mr Albanese-On the point of order, Mr Speaker: once again I draw your attention to a frivolous point of order from the member for North Sydney. This is a question about inflation and the Treasurer is answering a question about inflation, even if this bloke thinks it does not",25
45,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the House will resume his seat. Mrs Mirabella-Get someone who can up again! A be a Treasurer, not a wimp!",25
46,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Indi! I call the Treasurer.,25
47,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Wentworth was in the House. It was about 5.30 last night. He gave a long speech about the Australian economy. In it he declared the battle against inflation was â€˜mission accomplished'. All that was missing was the banner, the jumpsuit and the aircraft carrier. Ms Julie Bishop- Mr Speaker, a point of order on relevance: he was not asked about alternative views.",25
48,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Treasurer will return to the question.,25
49,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would be absolutely delighted, Mr Speaker. What is this all about? This is about covering up the legacy of those opposite-the highest underlying inflation in 16 years. The member for Wentworth will say anything and do anything in his quest to get rid of the Leader of the Opposition, to get a cheap headline, to tell a lie about a particular figure, to distort and attack the head of the Treasury. He will do anything. Last night in the House he declared that the battle against inflation was â€˜mission accomplished'. Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I ask him to withdraw the comment about the lie.",25
50,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Treasurer will withdraw.,26
51,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I withdraw, Mr Speaker. Those opposite do not want to front up to their legacy, a legacy of incompetence, which produced the highest underlying inflation in 16 years-recognised by the IMF, the Treasury and the Reserve Bank-and they cannot live with their dreadful legacy. Economy",26
52,Mr RAGUSE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is also to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer further outline the need for disciplined fiscal policy in the current inflationary environment?,26
53,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question. This government is committed to delivering strong surpluses, getting government spending back under control and targeting investment to increase the productive capacity of our economy, because that is what is required in the fight against inflation-a fight the opposition do not recognise. They argue that inflation in this economy commenced on Monday morning, 26 November last year. The truth is that it did not. It has been on the march for a couple of years. That is what the Reserve Bank says, that is what the Treasury says, and they certainly cannot live with it. Part of the reason is that spending got out of control. Spending increases under this government have been at the highest level in any four-year period in the last 15 years. That is the legacy of the member for Higgins, who complained to Mr Howard's biographers that he could not control the previous Prime Minister. The result of that has been eight interest rate rises in the last three years. That is their legacy. We are determined to put in place our five-point plan to tackle inflation and to look after Australian families who need some relief. NA",26
54,The SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery today Judy Maddigan, the former Speaker of the Legislative Assembly in Victoria, who is accompanied by Liz Beattie, the member for Yuroke, and Khalil Eideh, the member for Western Metropolitan Province. In addition, we have in the gallery Steve Dubois, a former member of this House. I warmly welcome them all. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Fuel Prices",26
55,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is also to the Treasurer. Is the Treasurer aware that, between the election and last Saturday, the average price of petrol has increased by 4c a litre in Sydney, 4.8c a litre in Melbourne, 4.9c a litre in Brisbane and 7.1c a litre in Adelaide? Will the Treasurer advise the House what flow-on impact this petrol increase, along with the new tax on diesel for trucks, will have on grocery prices?",26
56,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question because we do take cost of living pressures very seriously on this side of the House, unlike those opposite who did not take them seriously for 11 years, which is why we have a petrol commissioner in place in the ACCC. It feeds into inflation; there is no doubt about that. That is why we on this side of the House will take every possible action that we can take to put downward pressure on prices and make sure that markets are competitive. Mr Dutton- Mr Speaker, on a point of order which goes to relevance: how can the Treasurer suggest to the Australian people that the petrol commissioner has already started work when he hasn't?",26
57,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The member for Dickson will resume his seat, and the Leader of the House will resume his seat. A point of order is not an invitation to come to the dispatch box to debate the point. The member for Dickson knows that full well and should not adopt that as a habit. ",26
58,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Aston will leave the chamber for one hour. The member for Aston then left the chamber. Economy  is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. Will the minister outline the growth in government spending over recent years? What efforts have been made to cut government spending in previous years, and what steps is the government taking to cut spending now? What is the government's response to proposals for new spending?",27
59,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Inflation is at the highest level that Australia has experienced in 16 years and it is being fuelled by government spending, which is running at a 4Â½ per cent increase in real terms in the current financial year. Treasury analysis published last week gave us some indication as to why this is the case. It showed that over the past four budgets the former Liberal government virtually had no savings initiatives at all. Only about five per cent of the total new initiatives in the budget over the past four years constituted savings. In other words, in the budgets for 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007, roughly 95 per cent was new spending and five per cent was savings. The Treasury document shows, when you get to the 2007 budget, that the savings bar on the graph is so tiny you can barely see it. That is one of the key reasons why we have an inflation problem in this country, and that is one of the problems that this government is committed to tackling. Unfortunately, not much has changed on the other side. They do not believe that this is a problem. They do not believe there is an inflation problem. The member for Wentworth has said it is all a fairytale. The Leader of the National Party thinks the solution to the problem is to increase spending. And they are still advocating further increases in government spending. Recently we got a very interesting proposal for a new piece of very substantial government spending from the member for Mayo, the last of the Bourbons, in an article in the Adelaide Advertiser headed â€˜Build us a beacon', in which he put forward his view about what the government should be spending its money on. He called on the government to build: ... the most innovative, unique, attractive art museum in the southern hemispherein Adelaide, with: ... a 1000-seat concert halldesigned by Frank Gehry or Norman Foster; a building that would: ... excite the world in the way presidential monuments like the Pompidou Centre or the Quai Branly museum do in France. And, of course, he suggested that it should be built in the hills, to keep the riffraff out, as well! The member for Mayo did raise some concerns about the cost, and I quote: Mr Downer interjecting Mr Garrett interjecting",27
60,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The House will come to order. The minister for finance has the call.,27
61,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Mayo did express some concern about the cost. He said: OK, it would cost hundreds of millions of dollars ... maybe $300 million. That's a lot. And I'm not a big government advocate by any means. ... The State and Federal governments could both contribute and the cost would be spread over several years. It must have been a very, very long lunch. And this is not the only profligate lunch that has been occurring recently. I understand that a number of members of the opposition were spotted having lunch at Timmy's today while the Leader of the Opposition was actually giving his speech.

72,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I have been critical of the Leader of the National Party for his attitude to government spending in recent times, but I would have to say this in his defence: at least his monument, the Fishing Hall of Fame, was only going to cost the taxpayer $3 million. The member for Mayo's monument, the one that he is proposing, is $300 million. His answer and the Liberal Party's answer to all of those Australians who are out there suffering higher prices in groceries, higher rents or higher mortgage payments and who are worried about inflation is, â€˜Let them eat cake.' That is the position that the Liberal Party and the member for Mayo put in this bizarre spending proposal. That is not the position of the government. We accept there is a serious challenge here for the Australian government to get inflation back into the Reserve Bank target band. We accept that there is a serious challenge for this government to get government spending down to a reasonable level, not at a 4Â½ per cent real terms increase per annum. And most particularly, we accept that it is critical that government spending is directed to investments that will build the economic capacity of this nation for the long term, for our children-the infrastructure and skills that will generate high levels of productivity, economic growth and well-being for future Australians. Tree of Knowledge",28
73,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question follows on from the answer just given by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, but the question is addressed to the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government. I refer the minister to the government's decision to spend $2.5 million on the unions' so-called â€˜Tree of Knowledge' and the conservation of a dead tree situated in Barcaldine. Does the minister regard spending millions of dollars on a dead tree as an appropriate use of government funding?",28

77,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"in Barcaldine in Queensland because indeed it was the former Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Ian Campbell-rest his soul-who listed the Tree of Knowledge on the National Heritage List on 26 January 2006. I can understand that they did not check with former Senator Campbell before they asked the question, but maybe they should have checked with the member for Flinders, because this is what the member for Flinders, who knows his history, had to say on 28 January 2006: Heritage and Environment parliamentary secretary Greg Hunt said the 150-year-old tree, 1000km north-west of Brisbane, had played a major role in Australia's political and regional toryâ€˜a major role'! But there is more.

84,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister will get back to the question.,29
85,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We think that is fine. There is more. This is what Senator Campbell had to say about the killing of the tree. On 21 May 2006, with appropriate respect for an iconic heritage listed site, he said: We condemn the action and we will work closely with the Queensland Government to make sure this sitewait for it is properly protected and the history properly commemorated. hisI understand why we, on this side of the House, have 117 years of proud history and know what we stand for. Those on the other side of the House do not even know the name of their amalgamated party. The National Party is full of deadwood. The Liberal Party is all over the shop. We understand why they object to the commemoration of this historic site. But this historic site is important not just for the local community as an important tourist attraction but also to all those who want to understand the important history of this nation. That is why Labor has committed funding to support the ongoing protection and establishment of a memorial at the site, the interpretation of the Australian Tree of Knowledge story within the Australian Workers Heritage Centre, and the creation of a theme pathway to enable visitors to walk to the memorial and to facilitate access to the museum and town. We stand by this project and our history. You stand for nothing.",29
86,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I hope in future that the minister will direct his remarks through the chair and not to the chair, as he did in his conclusion. Workplace Relations",30
87,Mr SULLIVAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Will the minister update the House on the disposal of Work Choices paraphernalia? What does the future hold for the 97,898 mousepads created for the Work Choices promotion?",30
88,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think it is interesting that this question should come in a context where members opposite are trying to feign some interest in the effectiveness of government spending, because when they were in government apparently it was entirely appropriate, as far as they were concerned, to waste $121 million on Work Choices propaganda-money ripped out of the purses and wallets of hard working Australian taxpayers in a desperate attempt to try and pay for their re-election campaign. It is true that we do have left 97,898 mousepads. We do have that many left. We have put out a call to the Australian people about the best way of using these surplus Work Choices mousepads like the one I am holding up here. We have received some very interesting suggestions. One member of the public has suggested that they would be good under-floor insulation for public buildings. You lay them face up, pour concrete over the top of them and then you walk on them. That is one suggestion we have had, and I think it is a pretty good one. Another is that they could be cut up to make feet for chairs and stoppers for cabinets because of the spongy nature of the material. A third suggestion is that you could use the back, decorate it and then use it as a placematalso a very good suggestion. We have had mothers suggesting that they could take a cookie cutter, cut out a shape and spray paint it to make a good decoration for a child's bedroom. We have had schools and craft groups approach us for using mouse mats for a comparable purpose. For all those Australians who detested Work Choices, who wanted to see it gone, who believed it was an offence to Australian values and that the Liberal Party's extremism should not be allowed to stand, there is the suggestion that we stamp â€˜cancelled' over them, and they could be a good piece of memorabilia. The suggestions from the public do not end there. We have had suggestions for mudflaps, stubby holders or putting mousepads together so that you could have enough to make a yoga mat.",30

93,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am at least assured that, if I happen to accidentally break this one, there are plenty more where it came from.",30
94,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Prime Minister will get back to the question.,30
95,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Then of course there is the suggestion that they be used as the bottom for green shopping bags, something the minister for the environment would approve of, giving you a nice firm surface at the bottom of your green shopping bag. We have had the suggestion that they could be used for notice boards, shin pads for soccer, innercounselling sole pads for shoes, doormats or, my personal favourite, floor liners for portaloos-a good use of Work Choices surplus mousepads. I am reassured, having sought advice, that, under the provisions of the Financial Management Act, an official or a minister can make a gift of this property on the basis that it was acquired as a gift. Well, it was not really a gift, was it, when Australian taxpayers paid for it. But we are in a circumstance where we can provide mousepads to those who ask for them. On that basis we will be providing 5,000 mousepads to the Mental Health Activity and Learning Centre, who are planning to cut them up because of the colours and use them in a large mural. We will also be forwarding a large number of mousepads to two schools who have requested a bulk number, no doubt to use in art and craft classes. We are continuing to collect expressions of interest from members of the public. We have a lot of mousepads to get rid of, so we are going to need a few more good suggestions-so please send them in. We are also asking for suggestions about what to do with the 77,000 pens and the 100,000 plastic folders we have left over from the excess of the extremists in workplace relations who sit opposite. Bonnie Babes Foundation",31
96,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the answer given by the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government in relation to the Prime Minister's decision to provide $2Â½ million for the preservation of the dead union tree at Barcaldine and, on the other hand, the decision by the Prime Minister not to provide $800,000 to the Bonnie Babes Foundation, which is based in Melbourne and provides and support to 12,000 Australian women who have suffered miscarriages and stillborn babies. I ask the Prime Minister: is he aware that one in four pregnant Australian women will lose her baby to miscarriage? Is he aware that one in 200 will suffer a stillbirth? And, further to his answer when I asked him about this earlier, is he aware that Lifeline refers callers who have suffered a miscarriage or stillbirth to this service? Will he now agree to meet these women and provide them with the $800,000 that they desperately need to support Australian women in distress?",31
97,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When it comes to the needs of women in these terrible circumstances and their families, suffering miscarriage, suffering from still births, of course every level of humane service should be provided. These are very difficult and awful times for families to go through. There are a range of services out there in the community that provide services to women and to families, one of which is Bonnie Babes-I will come back to that in a minute-another of which is Stillbirth and Neonatal Death Support Australia, SANDS. Then there is SIDS and Kids and the Stillbirth Foundation. When it comes to the application which was made to the previous government for funding by the organisation Stillbirth and Neonatal Death Support Australia, SANDS, no support was forthcoming from the previous government. That is just a fact.",31
98,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,31
99,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The question has been asked.,31
100,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Secondly, on the question of the Bonnie Babes Foundation, let the record again speak for itself: this organisation, which I am absolutely confident does great work, was not funded by the previous government in previous budgets. The previous government made a pre-election commitment on it but there was no flow of funding to the organisation by the previous government during its period in office. Therefore, the challenge that we are presented with is: how do we effectively ensure that women who need these critical services are provided with proper counselling and support across the range of agencies that exist? The responsible course of action, both in these areas and also when it comes to postnatal depression, is to ensure that we have a proper examination right across the sector. The minister has already announced a way to do that. And, in the context of that examination, the minister will be actively consulting with Bonnie Babes and with the other organisationsSANDS, SIDS and Kids and the Stillbirth Foundation-to make sure that we get the best set of services possible for women who are dealing with these extraordinary challenges. We are talking about an amount of money that has been put forward by Bonnie Babes, and there are requests by others as well. I find it remarkable that those opposite, when it comes to the overall balance in the allocation of government funding, could have happily spent $120-plus million on taxpayer funded advertising on Work Choices. When it comes to that $121 million my strong suggestion to those opposite is that it would have been much better spent right across public health, right across dental stead of abolishing the Commonwealth Dental Health Scheme, why did you not dedicate those funds to the proper delivery of dental services, to the whole raft of perinatal and postnatal services, to the health sector in general? Instead, the former government invested $121 million in an area of spending which could only be described as political propaganda. In addressing these areas of need, community organisations, non-government organisations and organisations that deliver important services, such as Bonnie Babes, are to be commended. The minister will be consulting with these organisations during the course of her review. We will make sure that the proper delivery of funding to support these critical services for women experiencing these distressing circumstances is met into the future. Problem Gambling",32
101,Mr CHAMPION,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. Will the minister update the House on the government's efforts to address problem gambling and any other approaches to this issue?",32
102,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Wakefield for his question. He, like so many others in this House, really understands that problem gambling wrecks so many lives. People who are addicted to gambling know, unfortunately, that it is a very dangerous and damaging drug. It wrecks families and it wrecks workplaces. So many people in Australia are suffering from it. It is hard to believe that, on a per capita basis, Australia has roughly five times as many gaming machines as the United States. We certainly know that there are no easy solutions. There is a mountain of challenges that we have to address when confronting this health. In- difficult area. Just today, the Prime Minister met with Tim Costello to discuss some of the ways in which this very difficult issue should be tackled. Key to tackling this problem has to be working with a very wide range of stakeholders. I will be convening a meeting of the Ministerial Council on Gambling. Those opposite might be aware that the council was originally established in 1999. It is made up of state and territory gambling ministers and is chaired by the Commonwealth. When this council was originally established, the then Prime Minister said that the council would â€˜focus on stopping further expansion of gambling in Australia'. It is amazing then that the council has not met since 2006. I say to those opposite: how on earth can a council stop the expansion of gambling if it does not meet? Unfortunately, it is the case that the Howard government's inaction on gambling did not stop there. In fact, its record reads like an expose of how little the previous government cared about this very, very serious social and economic menace. Let us go through some of the things that the Howard government said it would do. It said that it would establish a national advisory body and it then disbanded it in 2003. In addition, a ministerial working group to consider access to cash in gaming venues was dissolved in 2006. It is hardly surprising that the state governments in South Australia and Victoria gave up waiting on the Howard government to do anything and had to act on their own accord to limit access to cash machines in gambling venues. You would think that the previous government worked overtime not to do anything about problem gambling. However, it does seem that there was quite a spurt of activity back in 2003. Back then, the Howard government did think about running a national campaign on problem gambling. Just one example of its thinking was the $1.1 million it spent on getting an agency to develop storyboards for another creative content campaign. An amount of $1.1 million was spent on these creative storyboards. I am sure that the Minister for Health and Ageing is very interested in what the previous government spent $1.1 million on. This is what it actually spent the money on. The Minister for Health and Ageing rightly says, â€˜And then what happened?' Absolutely nothing. The former government wasted $1.1 million on these pictures and presentations about possible ideas for an advertising campaign to help encourage people to stop gambling, and nothing came of it-a waste of $1.1 million with zero to show for it. It just goes to show that this previous government did absolutely nothing to deal with what is a very, very serious social and economic menace in this country-and we intend to do something about it. Beijing AustChina Technology",32
103,Mr ROBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. I refer the minister to the tabled pecuniary interest register. I refer the minister to his five trips: to China on 16 October 2005, to China on 3 July 2006, to Beijing and Hong Kong on 21 September 2006, to Hong Kong on 19 April 2007 and to Hong Kong and Beijing on 10 July 2007-all of which were paid for by the Chinese company Beijing AustChina Technology. I ask the minister: what was the purpose of these five trips to China covering 31 days over this 21month period? Has the minister had any contact with Beijing AustChina Technology since becoming Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry?",33
104,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As the member opposite knows full well, the reason he has those dates and the reason he has that information is that it was all declared in due time in the appropriate course on the public register. As the former minister also would be fully aware, it being my first term in parliament, there would be no public money available if I were to do any overseas travel relative to my portfolio. To have private sponsorship was the only way that that was able to be done. Opposition member interjecting",33
105,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I noticed the interjection from the member of the Nationals just then as I was saying that. The member of the Nationals would remember seeing me at the Boao conference, which he attended with me. We were both there at the Boao conference on Hainan Island in China. Of course, the Leader of the Nationals was at that conference with me, paid for by the Australian taxpayer. But I was there at the same conference, attending the same meetings, listening to the same speeches from the world leaders who were present. I do not begrudge that the taxpayer paid that, but obviously, as a shadow minister, the only opportunity in my first term to be able to attend those meetings",34
106,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,34
107,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question asked about the meetings. I am letting you know. Why don't you just ask Warren? Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The point of order relates to relevance. This is a very serious question about five paid trips, the association between the minister and the Beijing AustChina Technology company, which is based in China, and his relationship with them now",34
108,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for North Sydney will resume his seat.,34
109,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Nationals would also know a fair bit about that company, given that they have sat on the main table at National Party fundraisers next to him. Also, when the trips were detailed then, I noticed that the trip to Manila was not referred to. I think that is just as important to mention on the public record. When I travelled through Manila, that was disclosed as well. The reason for that, of course, was that that was the opportunity to meet with the 55 remaining members of the stateless Vietnamese who had been waiting for a durable solution for some 20 years at that point. Other meetings that took place during that time included meeting Henry Tang, of Hong Kong, and the Hong Kong office of Fragomen, the largest immigration business in the world. Obviously I had some significant interest in trying to get to the bottom of some very significant rorts in immigration that were coming out of China at that time with respect to the 457 visa. The list of meetings goes on from that, but, as I say, this is all available and on the public record. That is why you are able to ask the question. That is why it was disclosed according to the rules of the parliament each step of the way. Heatwave",34
110,Ms RISHWORTH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is also to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. Will the minister update the House on the effects of the latest heatwave in South Australia and south-eastern Victoria?",34
111,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Kingston for her question. I note that we have now had more than 200 questions in this House, and we are yet to get a single question from that side of the House, including from the Nationals, about anything to do with agriculture-more than 200 questions, and not one about anything to do with agriculture. It is not as if there are not significant issues out there-for example, the issue that I was just asked about by the member for Kingston. Look at the impact of climate change. I know there is a consensus that has emerged over the last 10 years for those opposite, and it is essentially this: climate change has definitely been happening for the last three months. That is about the level of consensus on climate change. You talk to anyone in South Australia at the moment working the land. They are living climate change. The heatwave that has just been endured has been described and reported today by one scientist as a one-in-3,000-year event. Mr Haase-It's called weather, not climate change.",34
112,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Kalgoorlie says, â€˜Ah, it's just the weather.' Member for Kalgoorlie, come in spinner, because the scientists around the world have acknowledged what I thought the members opposite had at least understood for the last three months. I had the opportunity to talk to Wayne Cornish, the President of the South Australian Farmers Federation, shortly before question time. He took me through some of the devastation which is being felt through this heatwave. Let us make no mistake: we have just had in South Australia 15 consecutive days at more than 35-degree heat. Wayne Cornish took me through the impact on various industries. There has been significant sunburn on salad vegetables, lettuces and leeks. Because of the nature of that produce, the turnover tends to be quick enough that they will not be as hard hit as others. From the apple and pear growers, for the crops that were still available in that part of horticulture, the image was given of granny smith apples that should at this stage be completely green but, after the last fortnight, are completely brown on one side. But no area has been harder hit than viticulture. The member for Kingston is very much aware of the impact on viticulture in her seat. The wine grape growers who had not yet found space to get to the crushing plants have either seen the crops wither on the vine or are now facing critical sugar levels which they are having to continue to monitor. Virtually every industry in agriculture is affected. Because the areas affected have already been declared for exceptional circumstances payments, farmers in the worse affected regions are eligible for EC support. They should contact the National Drought Hotline on 132316, and the South Australian Rural Financial Counselling Service is also available. I met with senior officials from my department today to work out how we can do more to work through not just adaptation but better preparation. We know that on climate change there has been much discussionMr Hunt interjecting",35
113,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I acknowledge the member for Flinders-there has been much discussion as though climate change is only about water. It is not just that. An important part of it is an increase in the severity and frequency of major weather events. That is what is happening right now in South Australia. It is tremendously important that both sides of the House live up to the rhetoric that we heard at the National Press Club today and acknowledge that climate change is real and that we as a parliament and we as a government have an obligation to help people working the land to prepare for the future. Prime Minister: Visit to Sudan,35
114,Mr ROBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his answers to questions yesterday regarding his travel to Sudan, China, the USA and the UK in 2006, fully funded by Beijing AustChina Technology. I ask the Prime Minister: will he release all emails, correspondence, cables or other memorandums from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade that relate to this trip?",35
115,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On this visit: as I said yesterday, it was to deal with the matters that the honourable member raised. First of all, in the case of Sudan, it was about the crisis in western Darfur. The itinerary I had for that visit has the following: arriving Khartoum 5.35 in the morning; head off to the United Nations mission; then off to the United States embassy; call on the Charge d'Affaires, Cameron Hume; depart the United States embassy for the National Assembly; call on key National Assembly figures, including the Speaker; then head off to the World Food Program compound; then head off to an informal dinner with representatives of the Australian Defence Force and the Australian Federal Police. There are about 20 of them on deployment there, in an important continuing peacekeeping operation. That was the first day. The following day, I have here: meeting with World Vision project officer. Then I had dinner with the then visiting Irish Ambassador, Richard O'Brien, who had recently been appointed here in Canberra. Then there was a visitand I do not have the page for that-to western Darfur itself. The host organisation was World Vision. In fact I mentioned it briefly in my discussion with Tim Costello today. This is completely normal and, as I said before, if the then government seriously have reservations about the sponsorship from this company, why does the now opposition contain within its ranks the National Party, who received $100,000 worth of funding? Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The Prime Minister was asked to release all Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade correspondence relating to this trip where he was accompanied by a member of the department. It was specifically about that.",35
116,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member has repeated the question.,36
117,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the now opposition and then government have reservations about sponsorship from this particular company, why is it that the now opposition and then government, including the National Party within that government, were perfectly happy to receive $100,000 worth of political donations? Mr Andrews- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order going to relevance. He was asked about documentation. He has not spoken about that documentation at all. Will he release it or not?",36

121,Ms SAFFIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Would the minister please inform the House what action is being taken to tackle binge drinking by young people, and how can local communities get involved?",36
122,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As members of this House and many members of the public who have been contacting us about the announcement made by the Prime Minister last week would be aware, the Rudd Labor government have committed $53 million to tackle teenage binge drinking. We have in this House previously outlined three components of that initiative, including further details that were provided last week when the Prime Minister, the Minister for Youth and Sport and I met with the heads of several of Australia's major sporting codes. What I would like to address today, going to the question the member for Page asked-and I know that many of my colleagues on this side of the House have a particular interest in this-is this: what are the ways that local communities can get involved and be part of the solution to this nificant problem? We have allocated $7 million of the $14Â½ million that we are investing in community level initiatives to support a range of local solutions to these problems. I would like to invite and encourage all members to start talking within their local communities-whether it is to P&C committees, whether it is to the local police, whether it to clubs, schools or maybe even local councils or to others who have ideas-about ways that local community solutions and projects could be supported in order to tackle this problem and get a good strong message through to young people that this is something that is harming their health, harming the community, causing a lot of grief and suffering and if permanent damage to their health is done it will not be able to be undone in the future. It is interesting. We were very pleased that, when we announced the policy, the Leader of the Opposition supported it. The Leader of the Opposition was very clear in saying that he thought we were living in a society where we have to do everything we can to educate young people, to educate our children, about the dangers of binge drinking. But this morning, two weeks later, I noticed that the Leader of the Opposition no longer believes that young people binge drinking is an issue. He was on the radio this morning saying that he is concerned that there is a risk that we are in some way assigning blame to young people in relation to their binge drinking. This is not an issue just about blame-although I do accept that, if anyone was going to recognise blame, it would be those on that side of the House, who constantly want to blame others for their inactivity. This is not about blame, but it is about responsibility. It is about explaining to young people that they need to take responsibility for their actions, that they do have consequences. It is about making it clear to sig- them that we are here to help but that they too need to make good choices in their lives. We need to be working with local communities and those who can take leadership roles-whether it is sportspeople, whether it is the local principal, whether it is the local school captain or even some of the local clubs and public sector-and want to be inis volved in providing decent solutions to these problems. We have put money on the table so that local communities can actually apply for some funding to support their initiatives. I am not sure why the Leader of the Opposition would have changed his tune in two weeks and decided that this is a bad idea, just when I would have thought everybody in this parliament would have been pleased to know that as local members they can start talking in their communities. There will be an application process for local initiatives. If the member for Indi has a good idea for Wangaratta, the member for Corio has a good idea for Geelong, the member for Page has a good idea for Grafton or the member for Newcastle has a good solution for her community, those ideas will be considered, and funding can be applied for to provide good, strong initiatives in our communities and set an example for young people. This is a community-wide problem. We do not pretend that the government has all of the answers, but I feel pretty confident that, out there in all of our communities, there are people who do have some of the solutions. We want to be able to provide a mechanism for them to apply for funding so that they can use their initiative to make sure that they have an impact for young people. Mr Billson- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I encourage the minister to refer accurately to the Leader of the Opposition's comments about it being a problem for everyone, not just young people.",36
123,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That is not a point of order. The member will resume his seat.,38
124,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Actually, I was sure that the member for Dunkley was going to say that he would welcome this sort of funding in his electorate. I am sure in Frankston there would be a lot of community groups that would be worried about this issue. There is a busy pubs-and-clubs scene down there, and I am sure that he, along with other members of the backbench, will be applying for this funding. But, unfortunately, you will need to encourage the Leader of the Opposition to back these initiatives. It is important for take action, and we hope the whole House will be behind this initiative. Workplace Relations",38
125,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion. Is the minister aware that members of the shop employees union in South Australia are complaining that, in a new collective agreement between the shop employees union and Coles Myer, terms and conditions such as penalty rates and rostered days off were negotiated away by the union secretary against the express wishes of union members? Will the minister undertake to ensure that the Workplace Ombudsman investigates these complaints, given that the union secretary who negotiated the agreement was Don Farrell, the Labor senator elect for South Australia?",38
126,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Deputy Leader of the Opposition appears to be referring to a collective agreement made under Work Choices. And, yes, I agree that Work Choices is a dreadful set of laws that have hurt the Australian community. You are absolutely right. The laws that you brought to the Australian community",38
127,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order in terms of relevance. This is against the wishes of the union members in a union collective agreement.",38
128,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat.,38
129,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am endeavouring to explain to the Leader of the Opposition the way in which the Work Choices laws that he supports operate. Let me explain to him the way those laws operate. An employer can make a greenfields collective agreement and just impose it on people unilaterally. That us to can happen under the laws that he supports. An employer can present an employee with a take-it-or-leave-it AWA which strips away basic award conditions for no compensation or no proper compensation. They are the laws that he supports. People can make collective agreements under Work Choices and, because the benchmark for those collective agreements is the so-called flawed fairness test, which the member for North Sydney spent $121 million of taxpayers' money advertisingMs Julie Bishop interjecting",38
130,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They do not like to hear about Work Choices, do they? Ms Julie Bishop- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance. The question was whether she is going to refer Don Farrell, the Labor senator elect for South Australia, to the Workplace Ombudsman for negotiating an agreement against the wishes",38
131,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member will resume her seat.,38
132,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will continue explaining the nature of flawed agreement making under Work Choices. For a collective agreement under Work Choices, the benchmark is the so-called â€˜protected' award conditions, which means that things can be lost without any proper compensation. I say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that, if she is aware of anyone who has a complaint about a collective agreement-making process, they should refer that matter to the Workplace Ombudsman. But I also say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that what they will find when they go to the Workplace Ombudsman is that the Workplace Ombudsman will say to them, â€˜All I can do is apply the laws'-and the laws allow working families to be ripped off. The Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for North Sydney, the member for Warringah et cetera-the list goes on and on-sat around a cabinet table and imposed these laws on the Australian community knowing that they could rip people off. Ms Julie Bishop- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance. I asked a specific question. I asked whether the minister would refer a complaint by union members against the union secretary Don Farrell-the Labor senator elect for South Australia-to the Workplace Ombudsman. Will she refer that complaint?",38
133,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Prime Minister is responding to the question in totality.,39
134,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me just say again that the Work Choices laws that were supported by the Liberal Party-the party of Work Choices-allowed people to be ripped off. In respect of the matters that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has raised in her question, can I just say that the opposition have not got one fact right today. I am not accepting that the so-called facts in her tion are anywhere near accurate, because everything they have said today has been wrong. But I would say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and to people in the Australian community generally that, if they do have a complaint about a collective agreement-making process, they should raise that matter with the Workplace Ombudsman. If the Workplace Ombudsman says to them, â€˜I'm really sorry, but you can be ripped off because of Work Choices,' they should ring the Leader of the Opposition or the Deputy Leader of the Opposition about it. Cost of Living",39
135,Ms COLLINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Assistant Treasurer. Will the minister update the House on government initiatives in relation to the cost of groceries for working families, and will the minister outline to the House the community response to date to the ACCC's grocery price inquiry?",39
136,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The cost of groceries and the cost of petrol both play a very significant role in the family budgets of Australians. Ensuring transparency and competition in these two important sectors have been important priorities for this government. That is why the government have introduced enhanced investigatory powers for the ACCC when it comes to petrol, and that is why we are putting in place Australia's first ever petrol commissioner, who I am pleased to inform the House will commence on 31 March, now that the consultation process with the states prescribed by the law is complete. On the issue of groceries, the House is well aware that the government has instituted an inquiry into grocery prices by the ACCC under part VIIA of the Trade Practices Act, an inquiry that will examine every part of the supply chain from the farm gate to the checkout counter. There has been a very sigquesnificant community response to the government's grocery price inquiry. This underlines the importance of this inquiry to the general community. One hundred and thirty-eight submissions were received by the ACCC on the closing date. They are from a wide range of groups, from groups as diverse as the Australian Chamber of Fruit and Vegetable Industries; the Consumer Action Law Centre; the Australian National Retailers Association, who represent big retailers; the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union; the Cancer Council of New South Wales; Metcash; and the Australian Beef Association. Of course it would be inappropriate for me to comment on any particular submissionsthat would pre-empt the results of the inquiry-but they do cover a wide range of topics and are very substantial, each one of them. The inquiry has also been welcomed by a wide range of groups, ranging from Choice to the National Farmers Federation, which shows there are concerns about the operation of the grocery sector from both ends of the supply chain, from the farm sector to the community sector and consumers. In addition, the ACCC has also required information from principal parties in the industry, using its formal evidence-gathering powers under section 95ZK of the Trade Practices Act. It is important to note that these are powers the ACCC did not have until this inquiry was called. The inquiry was called in order to give the ACCC these powers to seek all relevant documents and all relevant information and evidence which go to the supply chain in the grocery industry. Using this information will allow the commission to commence its public hearing processes, where witnesses will be called upon to give more detailed answers. The Chairman of the ACCC will be outlining in coming days the exact location of the hearings. But, as I have reported to the House previously, there will be a hearing in every state and territory, and they metropolitan and rural areas. The people who will be called upon to give evidence will include senior executives from every significant participant in the grocery industry supply chain. The inquiry will enable the ACCC on 31 July this year to provide the government with advice on all aspects of the grocery market and policy recommendations where appropriate. This will be the most rigorous analysis of the Australian grocery industry which has been undertaken in recent years, certainly in the last decade. This is an inquiry which will put on the table the concerns of Australian working families and seniors. This is an inquiry which will get to the bottom of what is concerning Australian consumers. It takes more than a pathetic speech at the National Press Cluba speech devoid of substance, devoid of content, with a meaningless five-point plan-to represent the needs of Australian working families and seniors; it takes a government concerned about the needs of consumers, a government prepared to act, a government in the mould of the Rudd government.

146,Mr SWAN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"The world has witnessed substantial financial market turbulence since it began in August last year, making its presence felt across markets, across nations and across continents. It is of course most evident in the United States, but it affects all of us to a greater or lesser degree, including the hard working families of Australia. As global financial market turbulence has become more prolonged, Australians have become more concerned about the dimensions and possible consequences of this uncertainty. Later this week the House will rise, and when we next meet it will be to consider the first budget of the Rudd government. Accordingly I seek the indulgence of this House at this time to review the character, magnitude and status of recent global financial turbulence. I will inform the House how the Commonwealth government and the relevant regulatory authorities and agencies within my portfolio are assessing the risks and monitoring these developments. And I will offer this assessment in the wider context of where the Australian economy has come from, where it is now and where we hope to go. When these developments began to unfold eight months ago, the central concern was around the size of the write-downs that major global banks would have to accept from the rapidly rising default rates in US subprime mortgages. Within a very short time, however, it became an issue of uncertainty about the credit risks embedded in packages of mortgages bundled together by financial institutions and sold into global financial markets. Sources of funding dried up and the market in subprime mortgages virtually closed. Shortly thereafter the entire residential mortgage backed securities market ceased to function with the depth and liquidity that had made these securities among the most widely held financial assets over the last decade. With financial institutions here and elsewhere unable to raise as much funds through securitisation, and with uncertainty as to the extent of exposures to losses on these assets, they began to hold on to the cash they had. Banks here and elsewhere became more reluctant to lend to each other, except in the very short term. Central banks in all major advanced economies, including our own, responded by offering to lend cash to banks on a much larger scale than usual, accepting as security a wider range of financial assets. Towards the end of last year it appeared the crisis was beginning to ease as the US Federal Reserve responded by cutting the cash rate and supporting the liquidity of financial institutions. However, as financial institutions sought to finalise positions prior to Christmas, spreads began to widen once more. As we entered the new year, renewed concerns in financial markets were coupled with increasingly convincing signs that economic activity in the US was sharply slowing. Equity prices across the world declined, as did the US dollar, and banks once again became reluctant to part with cash. The US Federal Reserve responded with a large cut in the cash rate in January and more recently has taken action to provide further liquidity to the market. The prolonged uncertainty took its toll as exposed financial institutions, those with illiquid assets and short-term liabilities, under increasing pressure. In Australia we experienced a fresh episode of funding dislocation this year, which we have seen in a wider premium of wholesale market rates over the cash rate. In the US market, concern moved on from household mortgages to the risks of dealing with investment banks which might have difficulty accessing liquidity. Just this week the US's fifth largest investment bank was absorbed into a larger competitor after it encountered mounting liquidity problems. I do not want to downplay the severity of the global financial developments. Nor do I wish to say that they have no impact on us. On the contrary, there is no doubt Australia's financial system has been affected by the global financial circumstances. The residential mortgage backed securities market is no longer functioning in an effective way. This is true more generally for most asset backed paper markets, here and elsewhere. Where Australian financial institutions had been very successful in bundling streams of mortgage income to sell as securities offshore, they now have been obliged to seek other sources of funding. In recent weeks there has been renewed stress in global short-term bank funding markets. This is in addition to the continued difficulties in term and securitisation markets, which have functioned under considerable strains for some months. Funding costs have continued to increase. Though markedly narrower than it was a week ago, the spread between the Australian 90-day bank bill rate and the cash rate is still came around 60 basis points-somewhat wider than the usual spread. Australian banks have continued to issue in offshore markets, though at higher spreads than were previously the case. This has led to higher costs of borrowing for businesses and higher mortgage rates for households. The Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority is closely monitoring the impact of developments in our banking sector. Its focus is on ensuring that all institutions have adequate plans in place if the market turbulence continues. Despite increased issuance in domestic and international bond markets in the early months of this year by major Australian banks, further instances of market turbulence cannot be ruled out. Problem loans are still very low by historical and international standards, however, and Australia's corporate debt-to-equity ratio remains at historically low levels. The turmoil in global financial markets has not unduly restricted the total supply of finance to our economy, with strong growth in bank lending more than offsetting the reductions in corporate bond issuance, and in lending to households by mortgage originators. As the House will be well aware, the Commonwealth government and its regulatory agencies are charged by this parliament with the responsibility to protect the stability of the financial system on which this economy depends. My department, the agencies within my portfolio and the government have been following the global market developments with an eagle eye. We are in close and continuous contact with financial markets here and offshore. I have been in almost daily discussion on this topic: with our central bank, with the regulatory authorities and with the leadership of the financial community. I have consulted with my counterparts in Europe and North America. Only last Thursday the secretary of my department met with his colleagues in the Australian Council of Financial Regulators to discuss all of these developments. While we are alert to the impacts on our economy, I would point out to the House that the circumstances of our financial institutions are different from those in the United States. While the 12 consecutive rate rises since 2002 have undoubtedly taken a toll on household budgets, we are not experiencing the same levels of mortgage defaults that are now occurring in the United States. While it is important that we recognise the severity, duration and possible consequences of the global financial turbulence, we should also recognise that Australia's circumstances are more favourable than those elsewhere. We are not in the least bit complacent about the circumstances of the Australian economy, but we do recognise that we have strengths on which we need to build. The very clear differences between Australia's circumstances and those of some other economies bring me to my second theme. This is the issue of what economic policy strategy is appropriate in Australia's current circumstances. One of those circumstances is the financial turbulence which I have already described. But that is by no means the only circumstance which I am taking into account in shaping policy in the run-up to the budget over the next couple of months. I want to now offer the House my assessment of some other important aspects of our economy. Our economy's strength in recent times has been supported by large rises in the prices of our commodity exports. Australian output growth through the last year was just under four per cent. But while we have high prices for our commodities, over the last few years our export performance still has been weak. It is a surprising but undeniable fact that Australian exports have been growing only slowly over most of this decade, at least in terms of volumes. Our export volumes have grown at an average annual rate of just 1.9 per cent in the seven years since 2000, compared to an average annual rate of 6.9 per cent over the preceding seven years. This slowdown in export volumes growth has occurred despite strong world growth over this period and against a backdrop of a once-in-a-generation terms of trade boom. It is clear this performance is more a reflection of supply side constraints, rather than a lack of demand for our exports. The slowdown in export growth also goes hand in hand with the slowdown in productivity growth. Driven by strong global demand for our metals, minerals and energy exports, our terms of trade have risen to 50-year highs. While the resource-rich states of Western Australia and Queensland have experienced the largest direct benefits from the terms of trade, the impact has been felt across the whole of our economy. The rising terms of trade have provided a significant external stimulus to the economy-adding something like 1Â½ percentage points each year to the growth of Australia's gross domestic income over the last four years. Demand created by this strong growth in income has outpaced increases in the economy's supply capacity. This has contributed to inflationary pressures. While there is considerable uncertainty around the medium-term outlook for nonrural commodity prices, recently settled contracts and market expectations for iron ore and coal suggest further support for the terms ria. of trade in the period ahead. While further gains in our terms of trade could be expected to continue to support domestic activity, they also present further challenges for an economy already pushing up against its capacity. It is sometimes said, including in this place, that an upswing in mining output from Western Australia and Queensland must be at the expense of Victoria and New South Wales. This was quite evident in conversation with my state colleagues last week. However, they do not necessarily see it that way. While Queensland and Western Australia are expecting remarkable increases in the production and transport of iron ore and coal in particular, New South Wales and Victoria are not despondent about the outlook. Some talk loosely about a two-track economy, but New South Wales's final demand increased by over 4.5 per cent last year, and overseas exports from New South Wales increased by over four per cent. Exports increased more in New South Wales over that same period than in Victoria or Queensland or Western Australia and, of course, were well above the national average. Over the same period Victorian final demand increased over five per cent. Unemployment in New South Wales is 4.2 per cent and in Victoria 4.1 per cent, in both cases the lowest outcomes in 30 years of data. These are not numbers which suggest considerable gloom in either state. With the right policies, growth in the resource-rich states of Western Australia and Queensland does not have to be incompatible with growth in New South Wales and VictoA good deal of the increased income from mining will be distributed locally as higher employment and, consequently, higher local spending. But some of it will be distributed through the rest of the country as higher government revenue or as returns to shareholders. It is our task to think through all of these challenges, as we are doing in the run-up to the budget, and get the balance of policy right. Given the challenges we confront, the Rudd government has twin objectives in economic policy, which it is pursuing with equal vigour. One is primarily about the next year or two, and the other is primarily about the next decade. It would be quite wrong to suggest to the House that our first May budget will accomplish both objectives immediately. On the contrary, we are now planning the architecture of at least three budgets, each closely related to its predecessor and each taking us a bit further down the road towards our twin objectives. The first objective is of course the moderation of inflation from the rate of four per cent or so, which the Reserve Bank expects to see in the year to March, to within the target band. And we will be doing what we can through budget policy and through other measures to make the Reserve Bank's job less difficult. That is why we have a five-point plan to fight inflation which includes a surplus target of at least 1.5 per cent of GDP in 2008-09. The second objective is to modernise our economy. This includes the removal of constraints in our physical infrastructure of roads, bridges, ports, water and energy. It includes a big improvement in Australian education, from preschool to our centres of higher education, to compete with the best in the world. It includes more and better training in skills to improve the quality and size of our workforce. And it also includes taxation and childcare reforms to lift labour force participation to reward hard working families for all of their efforts. These are big jobs, but we are clear about what we want to do and we will deliver on all of our election commitments to Australians. We have already laid foundations with the establishment of Infrastructure Australia, the provision of an additional 450,000 highquality training places, the decision to better resource technical training in schools and the plans we have in hand with our counterparts in COAG, of which I will have more to say on another occasion. The government seeks an effective balgradual ance between our two objectives. We cannot rebuild the nation's economic infrastructure in one budget. Building worldclass education systems, modernising our infrastructure and tackling skills shortages will take some time. And our new policies will need to be carefully implemented so that we do not further complicate demand pressures in the economy. But we also recognise that tackling inflation in the longer run is largely an issue of the capacity and the flexibility of the Australian economy. The underlying trend increase in inflation has been apparent now for some time and it represents a failure of past government to foresee and to prepare for the inevitable consequences of the long expansion that we have enjoyed. To control inflation we need a more responsive and flexible economy, and we will not get it without addressing our infrastructure constraints now and into the future, without world-class education at every level, without upgrading the skills and the quality of our workforce. So in that sense our two objectives are mutually reinforcing. Once a lower rate of inflation is achieved we will have more room to remedy the structural shortcomings which have contributed to its acceleration over recent years. The deteriorating global outlook does present a significant risk to the Australian economy. Businesses and households are already feeling the effects of higher interest rates which, in part, reflect global financial turmoil. The outlook for the global economy and uncertainty in global financial markets is beyond our control, but we are vigilant. And we remain confident that Australia's financial institutions and our regulatory agencies are coping reasonably well with a global challenge of considerable severity. Developments in global financial markets, combined with significant inflationary pressures in the domestic economy, reinforce our determination to build long-term productivity and growth in our economy. We are putting all of our efforts into modernising our economy so it is strong enough and flexible enough to meet future challenges-to create the right environment for business to flourish and to deliver for the working families of our nation.",41
147,Mr BYRNE,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,I move: That so much of the standing orders be pended as would prevent the member for Wentworth speaking for a period not exceeding 17Â½ minutes. Question agreed to.,46
148,Mr TURNBULL,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"I welcome the statement by the Treasurer on the crisis in international credit kets. The Treasurer has summarised the history of the development of the crisis, and I will not go over the same ground again other than to make some observations about the different nature of this credit crisis relative to previous episodes consequent upon periods of imprudent lending. Over the last 20 years, we have seen the development of enormous markets for securitising debt of all kinds. Residential mortgages are very much the focus of attention at the moment, but the securitisation markets cover all debt classes. This has enabled a substantial increase in competition in all debt markets, and Australian home buyers have especially benefited from this. Since the early 1990s, the range of lenders has continued to expand as balance sheets could be effectively outsourced to the public markets via securitisation. What we have seen, as the Treasurer observed, is a global shutdown of those securitisation markets. Since the beginning of this year, for example, and according to Assistant Governor of the Reserve Bank Guy Debelle, speaking on 5 March, there has only been one successful securitisation of Australian residential mortgage backed securities. This credit crunch has seen some second-tier mortgage lenders pulling out of the business, including Macquarie Bank, and others dramatically curtailing their lending. The consequence is that, whereas six months ago the top five banks had around two-thirds of the Australian mortgage market, perhaps a little less, now they are believed to have over 90 per cent of that market. The major banks have continued lending but in doing so have susbeen obliged, as the Treasurer noted, to access the wholesale debt markets directly. The availability of credit does not yet appear to be unduly constrained in Australia but, as the assistant governor observed recently, the major banks have been picking up the slack from the closed public markets. Corporates marthat financed themselves directly from the public markets are now borrowing from the banks directly-a process of reintermediation-and that is coming with an increased cost of credit. A number of banks' CEOs have talked about credit rationing. What that means, of course, is that credit terms will be tighter and the cost of credit will be higher. This is one of the factors that feeds into the considerations by the Reserve Bank on interest rate adjustments in particular and inflation in general. The closure of these securitisation markets has been particularly unfair to the Australian market. Our residential mortgage market is of a considerably higher credit quality than that in the United States. In that sense, in Australia we are all being tarred with the same brush. Residential mortgage backed securities are out of fashion, to say the least, and there does not seem to be a lot of discrimination in the markets at the moment; there has been such a collapse in confidence. It is worth noting that the Reserve Bank's Financial Stability Review of March 2007 said: The closest equivalent to sub-prime loans in Australia are non-conforming housing loans, which are provided by a few specialist nondeposit taking lenders and account for an estimated 1 per cent of all outstanding mortgages, well below the 15 per cent sub-prime share United States. The reality is that the American residential mortgage market is very different from ours. It has a very large, relative to Australia, of subprime loans. If they can be described as imprudent lending-and I think few people would disagree with that characterisation with the benefit of hindsight-then we can say that Australia's credit culture has been a more responsible and conservative one. I was speaking only today with Paul Fegan, who is the Chief Executive of the St George Bank, our fifth biggest bank, and he noted that out of 500,000 Australian mortgages St George has issued it has got foreclosure proceedings in respect of 74. Each one of those would be a matter of great disappointment-tragedy, perhaps-to the particular borrowers, but it gives you an idea of the strength of our overall residential mortgage book. Nonetheless, the securitisation markets are as shut for Australian mortgages as they are in the United States. It is important also to remember that residential mortgages in the United States are, for all practical purposes, nonrecourse to the borrower. A homebuyer can literally give the keys back to the bank without further recourse to him for the balance of the loan. The former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said yesterday in an article in the Financial Times that the credit crisis â€˜is likely to be judged as the most wrenching since the end of the Second World War'. If that is so-and let us hope it is not-it will be because of the way in which the contagion from this imprudent lending on residential mortgages, subprime mortgages, infected the whole system. This can be compared with an earlier credit crisis in the United States, in the late 1980s, when a large number of what we would call building societies, I suppose-Savings and Loans-collapsed again because of poor lending practices. In in the that episode, the impaired assets-the dud loans-of the S&Ls remained on their balance sheets for the most part. The United States government was able to take over the share S&Ls via an entity called the Resolution Trust Corporation, so a conventional process of workout was undertaken-assets were sold, losses were realised and the market was able to function. In this case, the economic interest-the ownership, if you like-in the subprime mortgages had been so widely sliced and diced in different forms of securitisation that the impacts of the dramatic fall in value of those assets are widespread and very difficult to predict and identify. The difficulty in identifying where the losses lie, on a mark to market basis, has dramatically undermined confidence in financial institutions. Once confidence dries up, so does credit. Confidence is critical. So we have seen central banks around the world pumping unprecedented levels of liquidity into the financial system. As the Treasurer said, we cannot be complacent here in Australia, notwithstanding our stronger financial system and our stronger credit culture. It is vital that our regulators are more attentive than ever to the health of our financial system. That is why I welcomed the statement by the Treasurer yesterday in a response to a question of mine that the Labor Party's proposal to cut $130 million of funding from ASIC will be rescinded, at least for the next two years. The Treasurer has taken the opportunity to recapitulate his economic policy. I will seek briefly in response to that to identify where I differ from him. Firstly, I recognise-as do we all-the importance of ensuring that inflation remains within moderate levels, by which I mean between two and three per cent on average over the cycle. That is the inflation target objective. It is in the latest objecof tives of monetary policy that have been agreed to by the current Treasurer and the Reserve Bank, and the target has been set out in that form since 1996, when it was put in place by Mr Costello. Despite the very considerable positive shock to our economy from the improvement in our terms of trade we have, over recent years-and in particular over the 47 quarters of the Howard government-been able to contain inflation within the target band. That is so whether you are measuring inflation as the headline CPI or as the RBA's preferred measure of underlying inflation, the trimmed mean. It is salutary to recall why we have been able to do this and it is important to be proud of that achievement and not to deny it. It was only last week that the Reserve Bank Governor, Glenn Stevens, answered the question: how have we been able to do this? He said: Having said all that, it is important to keep some perspective about the situation in which we find ourselves. We have been living through one of the largest transformations in the structure of the global economy, as far as Australia is concerned, for a century. The rise in the terms of trade over the past five years is the biggest such event since the Korean War boom in the early 1950s ... In essence, we are seeing a very large change in relative prices in the world economy, and a relative price change that is more important to Australia, in particular, than to almost any other country. These sorts of events will always produce stresses and strains, including significant divergences in performance across industries and regions (though these are often exaggerated in popular discussion). Because the event is, overall, very expansionary, it was always likely to be associated with some risk of higher inflation. In other words, the Reserve Bank Governor is speaking with the moderation, the objectivity and the perspective that has been so lacking in the rhetoric of the Treasurer. Therein lies my disagreement with the Treasurer. He has spoken about our economy not only in a way that is misleading in terms our economic history but in a manner that is calculated to undermine confidence. Treasurers and central bank governors have one big thing in common: they should speak about the economy in a way that creates confidence and ensures that people have faith in our markets and in investing. Let me go on with Governor Glenn Stevens. He continued: But given the magnitude of the shock, when all is said and done, the economy has coped pretty well so far. Yes, inflation has risen. This is a problem, and requires a suitable response from monetary policy. But compare the outcomes on this occasion with those in the commodity price booms of the early 1950s or the mid 1970s. In the early 1950s, CPI inflation reached 25 per cent, then fell back to zero within a few years, associated with quite a pronounced recession. In the mid 1970s, inflation reached about 18 per cent, and took a very long time to come down to acceptable levels. This time, we are grappling with a peak CPI inflation rate that looks like it will be around 4 per cent in CPI terms, and trying to assess how soon it can reasonably return to 2 -3 per cent. This is a far cry from the problems of yesteryear. How different is that language? Scrupulously accurate, endorsed as comprehensively correct yesterday by the Treasurer-and yet it is night and day; that language is at complete odds with the exaggerated rhetoric of the Treasurer. The governor is seeking to inspire confidence by being accurate and measured in what he says; the Treasurer, to make a political point, is undermining confidence. The governor goes on: The reason we are doing better this time around is not hard to fathom, either. Well, it is pretty hard for the Treasurer to fathom-but, anyway, it is not hard for the governor or for anyone on this side to fathom. As work in the Treasury has argued persuasively, a flexible exchange rate, a reformed and flexible industrial environment, better private-sector management and much stronger fiscal and monetary policy frameworks have made a lot of difference. The fruits of those decades of effort of reform are an economy that, for all its strains, is doing well under the circumstances. I could not describe the economy better myself. The Governor of the Reserve Bank has spoken accurately and comprehensively about inflation and in moderate language which inspires confidence. Why is confidence so important? As Alan Greenspan said on 12 February 1998 in his congressional testimony: The state of confidence so necessary to the functioning of any economy has been torn asunder. He was speaking about the circumstances of the time. Vicious cycles of ever rising ... fears have become contagious. â€¦ â€¦ Once the web of confidence, which supports the financial system, is breached, it is difficult to restore quickly. Indeed, as Martin Feldstein, the President of the National Bureau of Economic Research in the United States said only last month: â€˜Confidence is everything.' And that is why, historically, prime ministers, treasurers and central bank governors have consistently used moderate language when speaking about the economy-for confidence can turn quickly; it can â€˜turn on a dime', as the Americans say, and as recent consumer and business confidence surveys show. We have now seen three surveys of confidence, with business confidence falling dramatically in the National Australia Bank's survey for January 2008 and record falls in consumer sentiment in the Westpac-Melbourne Institute survey showing confidence at its lowest level since 1993. So, in 106 days under the Rudd government, business and consumer confidence have tumbled. That is a fact. The Treasurer no doubt would say: â€˜It's not my fault. Look at all the turmoil around the world.' Well, there is plenty of turmoil around the world. But there is something that was not there before November last yearand there was plenty of turmoil at the end of last year, and not just in electoral politics in Australia; this crisis really got underway in August of last year. The big difference is that we now have a Treasurer who speaks about the economy in a way that is calculated to undermine confidence. He is not prepared to acknowledge that our economy is one that has been described by the Economist as the â€˜wonder down under'. Our economy is one that has unemployment at a 35-year low and a participation rate at a record high. Our economy enjoyed average growth over the 11Â½ years of the previous government-so reviled by the Treasurer-of 3.6 per cent a year, higher â€¦ than most other developed economies, including the United States and Europe. Our economy was 50 per cent larger in real terms when the coalition left government compared to when it came into government. Real wages grew 21Â½ per cent over those 11Â½ years, where they had fallen 1.8 per cent under the Hawke and Keating governments. This is a government that has no net debt and has run consistent strong surpluses. The government was praised in September last year by the IMF for its â€˜exemplary macroeconomic management'. That is the track record. I do not expect the Treasurer to become a spokesman for the previous government. I do not expect him to sing our praises. But what he does not seem to understand-and it is not that he does not know enough about the economy; I think it is that he does not have a feeling for it-is that confidence underpins everything. And when you trash your own economic history, when you say, â€˜The inflation genie is out of the bottle,' that is inevitalence. bly interpreted as, â€˜Inflation is out of control.' That is interpreted as meaning that the Reserve Bank is not doing its job and that the government was not doing its job-that the system is not working. And yet, manifestly, the system is working. We want our financial system to work. We want the securitisation markets to reopen. We want Australian homebuyers to have access to more lenders to get the benefits of competition. And central to all of that is confidence, and confidence is evaporating. (Time expired) NA Economy",46
149,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The Speaker has received a letter from the honourable member for Cowper proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The failure of the Government to adequately address the impact of rising costs on struggling families. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",50
150,Mr HARTSUYKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This is a very important matter that we are discussing today. The cost of living has been affecting families right around the country. During the entire election campaign in 2007, we heard the now Prime Minister and the now Treasurer wandering the countryside talking endlessly about the cost of living and the cost of petrol. But once the election was over there was an eerie silence. They went back into their shells. They pulled down the hatches. There was an eerie siWe went from a moral crusade about the cost of petrol and the cost of groceries to one of virtual inaction. I say â€˜virtual'-I will pay them a small, ever so small, degree of credit-inaction. And what did they do? They announced an inquiry-just for something different! It was really unexpected, I thought, that they would announce an inquiry! And then they appointed a bureaucrat. So, true to form, true to type, they announced an inquiry and they appointed a bureaucrat. The real problem is that the cost of living is vitally important to Australian families. They feel they need more than just another inquiry; they feel they need more than just another bureaucrat, because the cost of living affects every family. It affects every single parent and it affects every pensioner and self-funded retiree. Every time they visit the shops, every time they fill their plastic shopping bag with goodies, they know that the cost of living is going up, and they judge their pension, their allowance or their wage against what they can buy for the money that they have. We are not talking about luxuries; we are talking about the necessities. We are talking about putting food on the table and putting petrol in the car. We are talking about a car that has to get people to work or kids school. We are talking about the cost of keeping a roof over people's heads. These are questions that people are really concerned about. They are far too concerned about these questions for the government to just appoint a bureaucrat. They are far too concerned about them for the government to just start another inquiry. Mr Ciobo-The buck stops with the Prime Minister.",50
151,Mr HARTSUYKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That is right. Where does the buck stop? The buck stops with the people to the right of Madam Deputy Speaker. They made the promises during the election campaign, and we on this side of the House are going to be keeping them accountable during this term of the parliament for the promises they made. For those people who are living on limited incomes it is not necessarily an option to increase their income. Many of them are ill. Many of them are on a very low incomeperhaps they are pensioners-and they just have to do what they can to manage their resources and their budgets to meet the dayto-day costs of living. They depend on the government to manage the economy well. They depend on those opposite. They depend on the Assistant Treasurer. Mr Keenan-They will be sadly disappointed.",51
152,Mr HARTSUYKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"They will be sadly disappointed, because the government pulled down the hatches on the cost of living and then started talking up interest rates. How is the Treasurer of this parliament, who is wandering the countryside talking up interest rates, going to take the pressure off struggling families? How is he going to help them in any way whatsoever? We believe that families should have the lowest possible interest rates. We do not believe it is the role of the Treasurer to wander the countryside talkto ing up interest rates and causing Australian families to pay higher mortgage repayments than they should need to pay. The families that I have talked to have an ominous feeling about the future. We have seen business confidence collapse. We have seen consumer confidence collapse. A large part of that collapse has to be due to the lack of confidence in our Treasurer and the way in which he wanders the countryside talking up interest rates. We see that consumers are now facing a world oil price of $110 a barrel. People know that oil at $110 a barrel is going to translate and is translating into a higher cost at the bowser. It is going to mean that they have to think about taking that extra trip. It means that they are going to have to think about whether they can take the kids to soccer on a Saturday morning. They are looking to the government for a solution. They are looking to the Prime Minister and to the Treasurer, who are wandering the countryside, claiming they have the solutions for the problems facing the people of AustraliaMr Ciobo-He promised prices would go down.",51
153,Mr HARTSUYKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"He promised prices would go down. That is right, member for Moncrieff: he promised that he would put downward pressure on prices. But what do people feel? They feel they have been the victim of a cruel hoax. A cruel hoax has been played on the Australian people. As I go around the country and talk to people, they tell me that they can feel the higher petrol prices and that they feel deserted. They were expecting action and, instead, they got a bureaucrat and an inquiry. It is interesting to look at some of the quotes from the media about this issue. One Labor media statement on 10 June said that their sole purpose was to ensure â€˜that Australian families are not paying one cent more to fill up their car than they should'. As with much that comes out of the Labor Party, we were left wondering what was meant by â€˜pay no more than they should'. There is no detail about what people should pay or how the petrol commissioner would decide what they should pay or how he might enforce what they should pay. The clear implication is that, as soon as elected, the members opposite deserted the battlements on this fight and merely appointed this petrol commissioner. We now have a petrol commissioner: Pat Walker, the former Western Australian Commissioner for Consumer Protection and Prices. I wish him well, I really do. The motorists throughout regional, rural and metropolitan Australia also wish the petrol commissioner well. They hope that he will be able to do what the Prime Minister and Treasurer imply-wave a magic wand and somehow give relief to these rising fuel prices. Unfortunately, I have to say to motorists, â€˜Don't hold your breath.' At the time of his appointment, Mr Walker said: I don't underestimate the degree of difficulty in this assignment but I believe I can make a differI ence ... It's not an easy task. This guy is sounding a lot less like the highoctane superman promised by the Prime Minister. It was interesting to note the testimony given to the ACCC inquiry into fuel prices by an organisation called Informed Sources. They said that they had made an analysis of the average price in Perth before and after the introduction of FuelWatch. FuelWatch was a scheme introduced by Patrick Walker. At the time of the introduction of FuelWatch, Informed Sources said that this analysis indicated that the introduction of FuelWatch increased the price of petrol in Western Australia by an average of 1c to 1.5c a litre. How is that going to affect consumers and motorists in Western Australia? We have also heard a lot about the issue of climate change. We have heard members opposite being very vocal about climate change. It is an important issue, but there are some cost of living ramifications for families. There are some very big ramifications from it. There is a potential increase in the cost of electricity. There is a potential increase in many of the products that families buy. There is also a potential increase in the cost of petrol. It was interesting to see a report, which states: The federal government has refused to rule out the possibility that its proposed emissions trading scheme will force up prices. Mr Ciobo-More price rises.",51
154,Mr HARTSUYKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"More price rises courtesy of the members opposite. The report goes on to say: Asked today whether the scheme would force up petrol prices, Senator Wong today refused to rule it out. She refused to rule out higher petrol prices. The report continues: The Australian people recognise the scheme would not be painless, she said. find that those remarks offer very little solace and very little comfort to Australian families trying to put fuel in their car and trying to go about their business. I also came across a document from Caltex which looks at the carbon trading regime and what impact that might have on the price of fuel for motorists. Here are some of the examples that were given in the document: at a carbon price of $10 a tonne, the increase in the cost of fuel would be some 2.4c a litre for unleaded petrol; at $20 a tonne, 4.8c; at $30 a tonne, 7.2c; and at $50 a tonne, 12c a litre. I think it is imperative that the members opposite come clean with struggling families and give them some indication of the carbon regime they plan to introduce and what it will do to the budgets of families. Then of course there are groceries. We are all aware of the magical wand that is going to be waved by the grocery inquiry. But it is interesting to look at the action of the government in relation to grocery prices. What was the thing they did most recently to reduce grocery prices? Mr Ciobo-Put up the fuel tax!",52
155,Mr HARTSUYKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"They put up the fuel tax on trucks and they increased the cost of truck registration. As far as we on this side of the chamber can see, that is going to have an upward impact on the price of groceries; it is not going to have a downward impact. But with their perverse economics the members opposite seem to have a different slant on things. If this government are keen to put downward pressure on grocery prices, why not at least keep the cost of fuel excise for trucks the same? Instigating an inquiry is no substitute for putting up fuel pricesMr Ciobo-More taxes!",53
156,Mr HARTSUYKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"or registration taxes, indeed. It is more money in government coffers and more money out of the pockets of the consumers feeding into inflation. Wasn't it the Treasurer that said inflation is our No. 1 priority-amongst a number of No. 1 priorities, I would admit? And what do they do? We hear the rhetoric. We see what they are doing. They are pushing up the cost of motoring; they are pushing up the cost of the inputs to the grocery industry. This increase in fuel prices is not only going to have an impact on road transport. Increased fuel prices are having an effect right across the production chain, as it were, and that is flowing through as rising grocery prices to consumers. So really it is up to the government to take the lead by not increasing fuel prices. I call on the Assistant Treasurer to reverse this ridiculous decision. You cannot stand at the dispatch box and say that you are serious about pushing down the price of groceries to consumers and then push up the cost of the inputs. It is just not credible. The people of Australia will not believe you; certainly no-one on this side of the House is going to believe you. You are an absolute disgrace to the people of Australia-that you should push up those taxes and that you should push up the cost of groceriesbecause people are struggling out there. We only recently had the issue of carers, a very deserving group in our society looking after their loved ones. What do the government members do? They propose to cut the carer bonus. How are they helping a struggling household by cutting the carer bonus? How is cutting payments to seniors going to take pressure off struggling families? There is an incredible hypocrisy with those opposite. They talk the talk but they do not walk the walk. They feign concern for families, and all they can come up with is a petrol commissioner and another inquiry. That is all they can do. The people of Australia are looking for real leadership and real policies in this area-not hot air, not rhetoric and not excuses. We have had the Treasurer, as I said, talking up interest rates. We have the Assistant Treasurer pushing up the price of excise on fuel for trucks. Their rhetoric is not being matched by action and the Australian people are demanding more. Mr Ciobo-They know the truth.",53
157,Mr HARTSUYKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"They very much know the truth. They are very quickly seeing through the rhetoric of Rudd. They are really calling on him to do a Rudd-flip with a pike and to reduce the fuel excise. This is a very important issue indeed. It is one that the people of Australia are very concerned about. It is one that is very much front-of-mind and it is one that the people will be keeping the Australian government to account on over the months to come. We will certainly be reminding them of that fact. We believe that no appointment of a petrol commissioner or inquiry is going to take the place of good policy and real action. We will be expecting real action out of this government, and I know that the people of Australia will be speaking up very loudly on this subject in the weeks and months to come.",53
158,Mr BOWEN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Prospect-Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs, and Assistant Treasurer) (4.34 pm)-One of the great mysteries of the 42nd Parliament is why, oh why, is the member for Cowper on the opposition front bench. We are no closer to an elucidation on that particular point after that contribution. But we have to give credit where it is due. This MPI does get an award. It gets an award for chutzpah; it gets an award for hide and hypocrisy. For a member of the previous government to have the hide to propose a matter of public importance criticising this government for not adequately addressing the impact of rising costs on struggling families is simply breathtaking. He was a member of the government whose official policy was to shoulder shrug-to shrug their shoulders and say, â€˜Australian working families have never been better off, therefore there is nothing we can or should do about rising prices.' The official policy of the Howard government was to shrug their shoulders. That was the best they could do over 11 years. At the crux of this MPI is inflation. Inflation is the enemy of families struggling to make ends meet. That is why we have signalled that we will be taking a very tough approach to the upcoming budget. That is why we have signalled that we will be taking some tough spending decisions which escaped the previous government, because we are dealing with the highest underlying inflation in 16 years. It is the highest inflation rate in 16 years which has been causing the Reserve Bank to increase interest rates. Inflation affects working families in two ways: it increases their costs directly and it increases their costs indirectly through interest rate increases.",54
159,Mr HUNT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Does the $84 billion of state debt contribute to inflation and interest rates?",54
160,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! That is not a point of order.,54
161,Mr BOWEN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Just today the minutes released by the Reserve Bank show that inflation is what has been concerning them, if anybody needed that clarified. If the member for Wentworth needed an explanation, if he needed a little bit more evidence, the Reserve Bank minutes released a few hours ago show that. But of course these are members of a government that said inflation was right where we wanted it. What an insult to working families, to seniors and to other Australians to say inflation is right where we want it when the Reserve Bank just today released its minutes showing that the CPI was expected to top four per cent. Inflation is right where we want it! And they have not learned their lesson. Yesterday the alternative Treasurer in this chamber, standing at that dispatch box, said when it comes to inflation under the Howard government: â€˜Mission accomplished.' What an insult to the intelligence of Australians and an insult to the intelligence of families who are struggling with rising costs, which this opposition is apparently so concerned about. But within inflation there is further cause for concern when the price of goods that are unavoidable purchases, such as groceries and petrol, goes up more than the average inflation rate-which is what happened for more than 11 years. Australia's food price inflation at 43 per cent has been amongst the highest in the world. Those opposite let that happen. When it comes to inflation, and to petrol prices in particular, we are hearing a lot from the opposition; we just heard a lot about petrol prices from the member for Cowper. But it is a concern that dawned on the previous government on 25 November. As the sun set on the Howard government, it suddenly had this concern with petrol prices in this country. Suddenly it was concerned about the impact of petrol prices on struggling families and seniors. Up until then, it was okay. Up until then, the ACCC had enough powers. Up until then, there was nothing further that the Howard government could have done! On 28 May, the former Deputy Prime Minister said: ... the ACCC already has significant powers of monitoring and being able to take action. On 7 June, the former Treasurer said: The ACCC has extensive powers. It can demand people give evidence, it can demand documents, upon a search warrant it can go into anybody's premises and seize books. The ACCC has those powers now, but it did not have them under the Howard government until formal monitoring powers were granted to the ACCC. If the ACCC has any concerns at all at any point in the supply chain, has those powers. But they were not powers that it had under the previous government in relation to petrol generally. We heard again just then the member for Cowper claiming that the Labor Party, when in opposition, said, â€˜We have a magic solution; we are going to drive down prices.' We know what those opposite are trying to do. They are trying to pin us for their bad policy and for their mistake, when they said in 2004, â€˜We will keep interest rates at record lows.' They misled the Australian people, because that was a promise they could not keep-and they paid the price for it on 24 November. But the facts do not bear out their little equation. They do not bear out their story. Let us have a look at what the Labor Party said in the election campaign; let us have a look at what the now Prime Minister said. On 8 August 2007, on ABC Radio AM, he was asked by Chris Uhlmann about Labor's policy: Could you guarantee to lower the cost of any grocery item on any supermarket shelf in Australia by a dollar? KEVIN RUDD: I couldn't guarantee that for the reason being that what I have said is that we need to have a robust competition policy watchdog on the beat. We are about introducing more competition and more transparency to put downward pressure on prices. What did the now Treasurer say on 15 July, when being interviewed by Laurie Oakes? The transcript reads: OAKES: Can you guarantee if Labor wins the election grocery prices will fall? SWAN: No, but what I can certainly guarantee is we will make consumer information widely available so people can scrutinise the prices in an accessible way. The transcript continues: OAKES: Can you guarantee if you win governit now ment petrol prices will fall? SWAN: No, I can't guarantee that, but I can guarantee that we will do the maximum amount possible to make sure that people aren't being ripped off. As though that evidence was not clear enough, our old friend the member for Higgins, the then Treasurer, raced down to a hold a press conference to draw attention to Wayne Swan's comments earlier that morning-to point out that the then shadow Treasurer had said that there was no formal guarantee that, under a Labor government, we could reduce petrol or grocery prices. But the then shadow Treasurer had added that what we would do was take every step possible to introduce more competition and more transparency into the market, which those opposite had failed to do for 11 years. We now constantly get this cheap grab for a headline from the opposition, but it is not borne out by the facts. But the confusion continues. It goes to where those opposite stand now. It goes to where they stand on petrol prices. It goes to where they stand on grocery prices. It goes to where they stand on being honest with people. Just after the election, our old friend Leader of the National Party made comments to the Courier-Mail and said that he had a plan to reduce petrol prices. After 11 years, he suddenly had a plan to reduce petrol prices. What was it? It was to take the GST off petrol. It just dawned on him on 25 November. He said: â€˜I've got a good idea. It just escaped me for the last 11 years. We'll take the GST off petrol. That's what will do it.' But then the shadow Treasurer, when asked recently whether he supported that policy, said, â€˜No, I think that would be a very bad idea.' So we do not know where they stand on anything. They stand for nothing. They cannot develop or agree on a policy on petrol or grocery prices-in contrast to the government, which has a plan in place which says: â€˜There are no magic solutions here, no easy answers. There are a lot of impacts on the rising cost of living, but we will do whatever we can and we will put these concerns at the forefront of government thinking.' But the confusion goes on. Last weekend we had the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Stirling complaining that the petrol commissioner had not yet officially started at work. There were two points of confusion. Firstly, they do not understand how the law works and what the Trade Practices Act says about appointments to the ACCC-that, when the Commonwealth recommends an appointment to the ACCC, there is a statutory period of consultation with the states and that a majority of states must agree. That has now happened. A majority of the states have agreed to the appointment of Patrick Walker and, subject to the agreement of His Excellency the Governor General, Mr Walker will start on 31 March. But the second point of confusion is this: they claim that the petrol commissioner will not make a difference. They say that they do not support the petrol commissioner-but the they are very disappointed that he has not started work yet. They are very disappointed that an officer that they do not believe in has not yet started work. This is their cheap attempt at a headline. This their cheap grab for a headline, because they do not know where they stand. They have criticised the decision to appoint a petrol commissioner. They do not support a petrol commissioner. They did not appoint one for 11 years. I agree with them: the petrol commissioner is starting a little bit late-about 11 years too late, because those opposite never got around to appointing one. Those opposite do not believe in competition. They do not believe in transparency. They do not believe in the regulator having the power to ensure that consumers are not being ripped off. They sat by and watched for 11 years while Australian consumers did not have a petrol commissioner looking out for their interests. That is what they did. They did not give the ACCC extra powers; they claimed it had enough. They have the hide, the hypocrisy and the chutzpah to come into this chamber and lecture us about the cost of living on ordinary, everyday Australians. Shame on you. Shame on you for taking the Australian people as mugs. Shame on you for pretending that you could get away with that. The DEPUTY SPEAKER Order! The Assistant Treasurer will direct his remarks through the chair.",54
162,Mr BOWEN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I do not intend to criticise you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I do not think there should be shame on you. There should be shame on other members of the opposition because they have zero credibility. As far as our actions since the election they have been at the heart of our election commitment to put the views and interests of Australian consumers at the forefront of our policy. What is their alternative? The Leader of the Opposition is fond of saying that he leads the alternative government of Australia. What is their alternative? What is their alternative to the petrol commissioner? To do nothing. What is their alternative to the increased investigatory powers for the ACCC? To do nothing. What is their alternative to the other steps we have taken to introduce more transparency in the banking industry, to allow people to change their banks more regularly with fewer penalties and to encourage and to allow bank switching? Nothing. What is their alternative to criminalising tels? We do not know where they stand on that measure either. They promised to do it and then reneged on their commitment. The member for Higgins, the then Treasurer, let the Australian people down by going back on his word and failing to meet his commitment to do it. We are doing it. We released draft legislation within two months of taking office, something they could not do even though it was recommended by their inquiry in 2003. What is their alternative to the first home owners scheme? Nothing. What is their alternative to the teen dental scheme? Nothing. What is their alternative to the increase in the utilities bonus? What is their alternative to the National Rental Affordability Scheme? What is their alternative to the steps that the government has taken to improve housing affordability in this country? They sit there and they carp and they whinge and they complain that they no longer have the chance to do anything about it, when, for the last 11 years, they did nothing about it. This MPI is what you call a fill-in. The member for Cowper first proposed this MPI on 18 February, I think it was. It was a Mongo, day, of course, and it was a stunt. He got up and said: â€˜It's a Monday. I want to have an MPI on the cost of living.' It was a stunt because he knows that the standing orders do not allow MPIs on Mondays. I said to my office, â€˜We'd better get ready, because they're clearly going to do an MPI on the cost of living on the Tuesday.' But they did not get around to it. And they did not get around to it on the Wednesday, and they did not get around to it on the Thursday. Now, three weeks later, they have gotten around to it. That is how important it is. And why? Because usually the MPI is lodged by the Leader of the Opposition or the shadow Treasurer. That has been the pattern. Why isn't the shadow Treasurer doing it cartoday? Because he is embarrassed. He is too embarrassed to come in here and propose an MPI because he knows that we will point out his record over the last few weeks. There was his question to the Treasurer: â€˜Why aren't you chairing the ERC?' Well, he is chairing the ERC, actually. There was his question: â€˜Why did you reject the advice of the Treasury on the minimum wage?' Actually, we accepted the advice of the Treasury on the minimum wage. I am not in the habit of giving free political advice to the opposition, but I will make this exception: when you get a leak, verify it before you get up in the chamber and say it is a fact. Check your facts before you make allegations. That is where Malcolm has gone wrong. That is where the member for Wentworth has gone wrong. That is why his leadership campaign has received such a dent in the last few days-because in this House you have two commodities: your integrity and your credibility. You have nothing else. Now, I do not question the integrity of the member for Wentworth but, by God, I question his credibility. It has gone in the last couple of days. It has evaporated as he has made serious accusations against this government which have evaporated into thin air. What has been his response? It was to say: â€˜The Secretary to the Treasury is covering up for the government.' What an outrageous response. We all make mistakes from time to time. We all make errors. We are all human. When you make an error, fess up. Be man enough to get up and say: â€˜Well, I got that one wrong. The Secretary of the Treasury did not give that advice to the government. I accept I was wrong.' We all have to do that from time to time. It is not pleasant, but it what you do. You do not then blame the bureaucrat. You do not then blame a respected Secretary to the Treasury who was appointed by that government and kept by us because he is the best in the country at his job. You do not do that. That shows why the member for Wentworth is unfit to hold the office of Treasurer of this country, and it shows why we have got the B team doing an MPI on this day-because we are covering up for the incompetence of the shadow Treasurer of Australia, the member for Wentworth. Seriously, if you want to be taken seriously as the alternative government of this country, you have to do better than that. You cannot have 11 years of inaction and then come in today and say- (Time expired)",57
163,Mr MORRISON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Cook) (4.49 pm)This MPI addresses the government's failure to address the impact of rising costs on struggling families. This is an important matter to be discussing because it is the government which has raised the expectations on this matter. It is the government which, when in opposition, went out there and created a very real expectation on the part of the Australian people that it was going to do things about the cost of living, that it was going to do things about petrol prices, that it was going to do things about grocery prices, that these things were actually going to produce a result and that people would not have to face rising costs under a Labor government. In that same election campaign, the opposition, as it then was, made a range of claims about what the government at the time was saying about interest rates. You could argue that it was somewhat successful in prosecuting an argument that, if interest rates were to rise, the government should be accountable for those things and, as a result, the government should not be elected. If it is good for this government, it is good for us. The government has created the exis pectation out there in the Australian community that it can control the revolution of the planets, that it can go out there and it can control the universe. It can control petrol prices. It can control grocery prices. We will come to how it actually plans to do this, but this is the expectation that the Prime Minister in particular has created. He has created it knowingly, he has created it willingly, and he has created it enthusiastically. So it is a fair thing-a very fair thing-for the people of Australia to hold this government to account for that pledge. Government members can come in here and argue the toss on words, but one thing is very clear: as I walk the streets of my electorate, people tell me that the government-as it is now known-made a pledge to control petrol prices and grocery prices. The price of everything from WeetBix to Chupa Chups is going to be controlled by this government, so it is very important that we discuss this matter today. I also want to add that we are talking specifically about struggling families. The government likes to talk about working families, but a number of people have come to me, particularly from my own electorate, and said, â€˜Who are these working families?' Small businesses ask the question: â€˜Am I a working family?' Under the government's definition, they are not. They are not a working family. Small businesses are not working families. And what about single working people? What about pensioners? What about self-funded retirees? Do these not fit into the spectrum of people who are the target of this government's policies, or do they just have to wait their turn until the government is finished trashing our economy? Let us examine what the government actually has done and make a few comments. Firstly, the government makes a lot of noise about inflation. It says it has a five-point plan on inflation-a plan whose features, as the shadow Treasurer revealed yesterday in question time, failed to receive acknowledgement by the Governor of the Reserve Bank. There was no mention of at least three of the five points. My maths may not be the best in this place, but that leads me to believe that the Governor of the Reserve Bank gave the Treasurer two out of five for his inflation plan-which is a fail. What are those five points? Firstly, there is fiscal restraint. What I think the Treasurer fails to understand is that there were 10 consecutive surplus budgets under the previous government, and consistently in the last three at 1Â½ per cent of GDP plus. The Prime Minister comes in with the hairy-chested announcement that he is going to be able to bring in a budget surplus at 1Â½ per cent of GDP. That is like running a four-minute mile today and claiming that you have made some great athletic achievement. It is just nonsense. In addition to that, the fiscal restraint agenda which is outlined by the government opposite is silent on state debt-an $80 billion-plus debt binge on the part of the states. It is silent on tax reform at a state level. It prepared to bankroll the incompetence of state governments all around this country. Secondly, the government talks about private savings. I am staggered, because I like to follow what happens in politics, I like to follow what governments do, and if I remember correctly it was actually the government prior to the election of this government that introduced the single greatest reforms to superannuation in our historyunquestioned. That is what I call a private savings initiative. The government might like to take some notes about how to implement its five-point plan based on the success of the previous government in addressing these issues. Then there is the skills crisis-a skills crisis caused by having the lowest unemployment in over 30 years, now at four per cent. The government's answer is to close trade schools and drive up unemployment. That is how they are going to fix the skills crisis. They will just have more people out of work, increasing the pool of available workers to the marketplace. There were 418,800 apprentices being trained at the time of the last election. That compares to 154,800 when the previous government came to office. Then there are the bottlenecks that the government is going to clear. It is the responsibility of the states to develop infrastructure. This was discussed in the Infrastructure Australia Bill 2008. While I am sure there are many examples in other states, in my home state of New South Wales the state government has made an absolute mockery of state infrastructure planning. For years under Treasurer Egan, the government did nothing to actually reduce the state's debt. It is a worthy initiative, but if to reduce state debt you do nothing, you spend nothing on infrastructure and you effectively allow the house to fall into disrepair, you build up the desire for is a binge of state debt to address the imbalance of previous years' obfuscation of responsibility. Then the government talks about the participation rate. This is from a government who when in opposition opposed welfare to work reforms. This is from a government that seems to misunderstand that we have the highest level of workforce participation on record. This is a five-point plan with a fivestar blind spot. It says absolutely nothing about containing wage pressures. Something that the shadow Treasurer, remarking in an earlier debate today, made very clear was that different between the mid-1970s and today are the changes in particular in our labour market. We have a more flexible labour market. That is what enabled us to achieve a 21.5 per cent increase in real wages under a government that was prepared to do the right thing in our workplaces and create greater flexibility that enabled people to be employed in this country and enabled businesses to move forward. The government's plan says nothing about containing inflationary expectations. The shadow Treasurer has made the point extremely well that the Treasurer of this country stood in this place today and confirmed â€˜the genie in a bottle' comment. It is bad enough for the Treasurer to go recklessly bumbling around our financial markets, making reckless statements on the state of our economy and talking about genies coming out of bottles on the eve of Reserve Bank meetings where they set interest rates, but the Prime Minister also stood in this place today and confirmed the state of our economy in the way he did. Inflationary expectations-I have made the point on a number of occasions-in the December quarter were at 4.3 per cent. After the election of this government, inflationary expectations, while previously sitting on 3.8 per cent, have gone up to 4.3 per cent. I suspect that it will only get worse from there because, while this government continues to talk up inflationary expectations, we will continue to see inflation rise and we will continue to see a claim being made, as is currently being made in New South Wales by Unions New South Wales, for a 4.8 per cent increase in wages. What is that based on? Expectations of inflation. Who is setting those expectations of inflation? Those who sit opposite, who simply do not know how to run a strong economy. Since the election of the Rudd government, which has created the expectation out there that it will be able to do something about rising petrol prices, petrol prices in Sydney, as the Leader of the Nationals said today, have gone up by 4.8c, in Melbourne by 4.9c and in Adelaide by 7.1c. Grocery prices have also continued to rise. The government's response on all of these things, as it is to everything, is to establish a review and/or a committee. In fact, there have been 47 reviews established by this government since it took office in November. It has got a bit more work to do because it announced 55, so we can expect more reviews to come from this government. (Time expired)",58
164,Mr BRADBURY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Lindsay) (4.59 pm)The sheer hypocrisy of this particular matter is something that I find breathtaking. For those on the other side, it is a short walk from the government benches to the opposition benches, but what a profound change we have seen. Like being struck down by a blinding light on the old road to Damascus, those on the other side who were incapable of seeing the hurt and the pain that working families across this country were facing now bring forward a motion about attending to the needs of struggling families. Those who could not see it-nor could they act on or respond to the policy challenges that faced the former government-now come forward bleating in support of those that are feeling it tough in our local communities throughout this country. The pain that people are feeling is not to me; it is something that I had been campaigning about for a considerable amount of time. In campaigning through the last election I encountered scores of families and scores of individuals throughout the community that were feeling the pain of increased mortgage payments and the increased cost of living. Right throughout, the then government's position was that working families had never been better off. Never, ever forget it: working families had never been better off. But clearly upon the election of a Rudd Labor government things have turned around. That is not the case. Go and talk to families throughout this country and you will know that the pain they have been feeling has progressively been getting worse. It has been getting worse because of the high inflation legacy that the former government has left this country with. Listening to those on the other side, you would think that there were no problems. The member for Wentworth says there is no inflation problem; it is merely a fairytale. The member for Higgins told us he had inflation right where he wanted it. It is a shame for working families throughout this country that that was not in the Reserve Bank's target band; it was above it. That is why he and his colleagues left the working families of this nation with the highest inflation rate in 16 years. That is the Liberal legacy that they now seek to expunge from the record. We will not allow it. We will not allow people throughout this country to forget about the disdain with which those on the other side have treated those feeling pain as a result the rising cost of living that has progressively been getting worse, particularly over the last 11 years. Whenever there was a request for a policy response, a suggestion of how to respond to these challenges, those on the other side said, â€˜Working families have never been better off.' What you see in this new government is a government that cares about the needs of working families-â€˜struggling families', as those on the other side have put it in this motion. We care about the needs of those families, and that is why we have a platform and why we are implementing changes that will have a marked impact in lifting and improving the quality of life and the living standards of those families. Clearly the biggest impact on the household budget at the moment is from housing costs, whether you have a mortgage or whether you are paying a rent. Those who have mortgages have seen 12 consecutive increases in interest rates. Surely those on the other side are not going to try and sheet home blame to those of us within the government for those 12 increases in interest rates. They were the ones that went to the 2004 election saying, â€˜We will keep interest rates at record lows.' They were the ones that claimed responsibility for interest rates. Twelve interest rates rises in a row-that is how many increases we have seen. The pressure on working families in my electorate means that many families are now paying $750 a month more in mortgage repayments, and that is on an average mortgage. It is probably on a more modest level than in other parts of Sydney, but that is $750 a month that people have to find from somewhere else. At the same time, there are those on the other side: the architects of Work Choices. Never has there been a policy more focused towards striking at the very heart of the living standards of working families. We hear of the member for Cook talking about the need for wage restraint. It is really code for, â€˜We're still sticking with Work Choices.' Forget about the mantra of, â€˜We neither support it nor oppose it.' What does that mean? The member for Cook has just let the cat out of the bag. What it really means is: â€˜We got caught out. Sure, it wasn't a very popular policy, but that doesn't mean we can't adhere to it. It doesn't mean we can't stick with doesn't mean we can't breathe a little bit of life back into it when the opportunity next arises.' That is the position of those on the other side when it comes to Work Choices. How they can come into this place and purport to stand up for working families when they were the architects of, and the ones that implemented, those policies is beyond me. The high inflation legacy that we have been left with has meant that there has needed to be a very direct and a very immediate policy response. We do have a fivepoint plan. I hear a lot of talk from those on the other side about how ineffective that plan may prove to be, but I do not hear a lot about what their alternatives might be. They accuse those of us on this side of talking up inflation. I accuse those of you on that side of driving it up. You and your policies have driven up inflation. There is no greater attack upon the living standards of working people than to erode the value of the dollar in their pocket, and that is what inflation does. We have a five-point plan. It is about modernising our economy. To modernise the economy you have to show restraint when it comes to spending. We have seen a cavalcade of excesses demonstrated time after time in this parliament when we have gone through the spending priorities of the former government. We have seen cheese factories that did not produce cheese. We have seen $10 million rain makers, even though the authorities only suggested and recommended that $2 million would have been a stretch when it came to a funding proposal of that scope. We saw $121 million in expenditure on propaganda for Work Choices. We saw over an 11-year period $2 billion worth of government advertising. There is not a lot of discussion from those on the other side about spending restraint, because they did not show any. When they it. It were in government they could not help themselves. And the problem was that they got away with it for so long that they lost sight of what they were doing. They spent their way out of trouble in the 2001 election, so they came back for more in 2004. They just kept doing it. And the worse the position for them became in the polls, the more they spent. In doing so, they have left this country with a high inflation legacy. That is the Liberal legacy and it is the legacy that we now attack not just by showing expenditure restraint but also by investing in workforce participation, investing in skills and infrastructure and by boosting national savings. We talk about boosting national savings. I can only assume from the comments by the member for Cook that he would acknowledge that the introduction of superannuation was the biggest savings measure this country has ever seen. These are the sorts of things that need to occur to modernise the Australian economy to ensure that we are able to keep inflation within manageable limits, that does not strip away at the value of the dollars in the pockets of working people. Labor have brought forward many proposals, many of which we have begun to implement, such as the appointment of a petrol commissioner. This is a very serious initiative that will lead to much more transparency in the setting of petrol prices. Our inquiry, through the ACCC, into grocery prices; our tax cuts; the tax cuts which will deliver improvements in workforce participation; our childcare tax rebate; and our education tax refund are all policies designed to help those struggling families which the opposition has only just discovered. So I say to the opposition: get out of this place, go around this country and talk to those families. That is something you did not do much of when you were in government. I suggest you go and do it before you stand up purporting to represent them. They had had enough of you. That is why they turfed you out. It is why they are supporting our platform, which is a platform directed towards implementing initiatives which take pressure off families and which gives them some support, as they do the hard work of trying to raise families and build a better future for their children and their grandchildren.

165,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Before I call the next member, can I say that I did not interrupt the member for Lindsay, but I encourage him to address his remarks through the chair in future.",63
166,Ms LEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am pleased to talk on the MPI today about rising prices. I was pleased to hear the members for Prospect and Lindsay both mention a subject dear to my heart, which is housing affordability. The member for Lindsay has made remarks in this place about that topic, which is important to his constituents of Western Sydney. I want to provide those members and the House with some figures about the cost of developing land and putting a house on it in the growth areas of north-west and south-west Sydney. These figures were released with a big fanfare by the New South Wales government in 2001 but, unfortunately, not one single house has appeared and not one single lot has been developed. I will explain why. The costs for the developer are as follows: to purchase the lot, and 450 square metres is not very big, $50,000; a special infrastructure charge, payable to the New South Wales government, $23,000-a special charge because it is in the growth centre; a section 94 contribution to local council, $30,000; water, energy and gas costs, $20,000; and stamp duty, $2,500. Of course, there are costs that the developers have to pay for architects and their own work and GST of $10,000. But the total cost to a developer of developing one of these blocks of land is $302,000. The market will bear a cost of about $300,000. As a new homeowner, that is what I pay for my block of land. That is the market price. So the developer is not going to go ahead with it, and I am not going to purchase it. And that is why not a single block of land in these growth centres has been developed. This MPI is important. We talk about the government not adequately addressing the impact of the rising costs on struggling families. Inflation and the increases to mortgage rates are mentioned and of course they are significant. But these housing costs are much more significant. It has been recognised many times today and this week that housing affordability is a problem. If I front up as a new homeowner and get the keys to my new home, I am paying $90,000 to $100,000 in taxes to the state government. If my mortgage was $90,000 to $100,000 less, I would not be suffering from as much mortgage stress as we read about every day. When you look at these costs to deliver an available block to the homeowner, you can see where the problems are. If Labor wants to improve housing affordability, it should force its state Labor mates to drop these imposts on housing, because it is state governments that are actually imposing housing affordability taxes. We cannot even rezone â€˜rural' land to â€˜urban', because the command and control mentality of the state government-and I am talking about New South Wales-has put these developers on the drip feed. I believe the reason for that is that there is not the scope for the government owned utilities to develop the energy and water infrastructure on these blocks that is required. The areas are zoned, but they are still rural. Nothing is happening; meanwhile, homeowners are desperate. The government has announced a couple of measures in response to the housing affordability crisis. I do not want to pour cold water on all of them, but I wonder how well they will work. The Prime Minister was asked in question time today about the first home saver account. He could not explain to the Leader of the Opposition why a person earning $200,000 a year would receive $1,500 of taxpayers' money, but an apprentice earning $10,000 would only receive $750 of taxpayers' money. The Prime Minister could not answer that question. I asked the Minister for Housing that question a few weeks ago and she could not answer that question, either. So, in designing a first home saver account, can we please inject some equity. Can we ensure that we actually help the people whom we are designing a project for. Another interesting measure that the government has introduced is the Rental Affordability Scheme. This is about giving developers $6,000 in tax relief to build houses in certain regions. The bottom line is that the expectation of any investment scheme launched in a free market economy should be that it delivers a fair level of income and a fair level of return; otherwise, you will not get any investment into it. I am not confident that investors will in fact take up this initiative. I have seen no evidence or indication that they will. The Housing Affordability Fund, likewise, is a bucket of $500 million for state governments and local councils to dip into to fix up the inefficiencies that they should be fixing up.

167,Ms JACKSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I would have greater respect for the contributions from members opposite if there were some acceptance of their own role and responsibility in the issues facing struggling working families in Australia. It is ironic to me that an opposition whose leader said, but a few months ago, â€˜Working families have never been better off,' now have a new-found concern for struggling working families. It is ironic to me that the opposition, who until literally a few weeks ago, championed extreme industrial relations legislation that put the take-home pay of struggling families at risk, now claim to be concerned about those same struggling families. They are the same party who had over 11Â½ long years, more than a decade, to put in place programs, policies and plans to protect struggling families in Australia and they failed. Over a decade of economic growthwith budget surpluses that the opposition, when in government, used to crow aboutwhat did they do to protect struggling working families? What did they do, long term, to keep inflation under control and maintain downward pressure on interest rates? What did they do to deal with the infrastructure bottlenecks creating so much heat in our economy? What planning did they put in place to deal with the skills shortage, to ensure that we had appropriate skills training and development? What did they do to seriously monitor fuel prices or grocery prices? What did they do to tackle housing affordability-both home-ownership and rental costs? Not much, not much at all. The opposition were no nation builders. They had no plan for the future. And guess what: in November 2007, Australian families judged them lacking as well. The member for Lindsay called it what it is: hypocrisy. It is hypocrisy that the party who had over 11Â½ years in government and failed to protect struggling families now accuses the party that has been in government for 4Â½ months-just over a hundred days-of not doing enough to assist struggling families. The opposition are a joke. You were judged; you were found to have failed. I think it is only right and proper that you take some responsibility for that. One of the reasons why you were judged and found lacking was that you did not have a plan for the future-no plan that was sensitive to the pressures on working families. Labor did have a plan for the future and a series of election commitments which we are diligently putting into action. To assist some of the members opposite, I can advise you that the government has now produced a booklet on the actions we have taken in the first 100 days since coming to government. In case you have not seen it, I am prepared remind members opposite of some of those initiatives. We have begun the inquiry into grocery prices by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. We have announced the appointment of Pat Walker as petrol commissioner, to monitor the prices that oil companies charge and ensure that prices are not higher than they should be. We have provided references to the Productivity Commission to examine and inquire into paid maternity leave. We have introduced legislation to end AWAs and restore balance and fairness to Australian workplaces, protecting the take-home pay of struggling families. We have provided greater financial support to older Australians. This week we deliver the election commitment of the increase to the utilities allowance to over three million Australians-seniors, carers and people with disabilities-increasing that utilities allowance from $107 to $500 a year for age pensioners and people receiving other concessions. That is just some of what we have done. I have not even begun to talk about the steps in the area of housing affordability trying to assist people with the skyrocketing rent increases. We are taking action, not the least of which is introducing legislation to reform personal income tax to provide tax cuts to lowand middle-income earners. About the only thing I can agree with the opposition on in this debate is that the impact of rising costs on struggling families is a matter of public importance. It is a pity members opposite did not use the last decade to properly assist them and address those issues by putting in place plans that would assist ordinary struggling Australian families to make ends meet.

Ordered that the reports be made parliamentary papers.",65
170,Mr BUTLER,COMMITTEES,"by leave-Report 1 of 2008 is the 71st annual report of the Public Works Committee. Under the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the Public Works Committee is required to table a report of its activities within 15 sitting days after the year ending 31 December. This report covers the activities of the PWC of the 41st Parliament during 2007. The Public Works Committee of this parliament felt unable to comment in any substantial nature on the works of its predecessor, so this report fulfils its obligations under the act but does not offer any detailed commentary of the activity of that committee. Likewise, reports 2, 3 and 4 are reports of inquiries that were finalised by the PWC of the 41st Parliament. These reports relate to the referrals detailed in the motion just passed by the House. These referrals were originally made to the PWC of the 41st Parliament in the first half of 2007. The committee had finalised and adopted its report into each inquiry but had not tabled the reports due to the dissolution of the 41st Parliament. Proponent agencies for each work have assured the committee that there are no changes to the proposed works. Taking this into consideration, the PWC of the 42nd parliament did not wish to delay the progression of these works any further; so, rather than undertake the inquiries again or spend time writing its own report, it has adopted the reports as adopted by the PWC of the 41st Parliament. While these reports bear the name of the PWC of the 42nd Parliament, they are entirely the work of the PWC of the 41st Parliament. I would like to thank the PWC of the 41st Parliament for all of its work in relation to these inquiries. In particular, I would like to thank the former chair of the committee, the Hon Judy Moylan MP, for her work. I commend the reports to the House. NA CHARGE AMENDMENT BILL 2008 Cognate bill: NA (AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY) REPEAL BILL 2008 Second Reading Debate resumed from 13 March, on motion by Mr Albanese: That this bill be now read a second time.",66
171,Mr TRUSS,ROAD TRANSPORT CHARGES,"The Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill 2008 and the Road Transport Charges (Australian Capital Territory) Repeal Bill 2008 make adjustments to the cost recovery chargesetting mechanism that applies to the trucking industry. The two key elements of the charge structure that apply to Australia's road freight sector are registration fees and the diesel fuel excise system, known as the road user charge. The determination of the appropriate level of these charges occurs through the National Transport Commission, which makes recommendations to the Australian transport ministers at their meeting of the Australian Transport Council to recover road expenditure attributable to heavy vehicles. The principle behind the charge-setting arrangements that apply to the trucking industry is that it should pay its way. The trucking industry accepts this principle. Whilst this does mean that the industry pays higher charges than would otherwise have been the case, it recognises that as an industry it has an obligation to the community to pay its way. It is important for the community to know that, whilst there is substantial community expenditure on roads and other infrastructure, the road transport sector-those big trucks that run up and down the roads day and night-is making a substantial contribution to the cost of maintaining and building that road network. Specifically, the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill 2008 updates definitions contained in the Interstate Road Transport Act 1985 and grants the Australian Transport Council the power to determine the charges that will apply to Commonwealth registered heavy vehicles. The Road Transport Charges (Australian Capital Territory) Repeal Bill 2008 ends a system whereby the Australian Capital Territory sets the reference charge for other jurisdictions to follow, currently based on Commonwealth provided ACT law-the Road Transport Charges (Australian Capital Territory) Act 1993. Members may be aware that on 29 February 2008 Commonwealth, state and territory transport ministers at the Australian Transport Council agreed to a revised set of charges that will apply to Commonwealth registered heavy vehicles. These charges will be used as reference fees by the states and territories on their own heavy vehicles. Essentially, that is what these bills are about: the application of charges agreed to by the Australian Transport Council to heavy vehicles registered under the Commonwealth and the subsequent take-up of those charges to vehicles registered under the states and terriIn tories. We are talking, therefore, about what costs are imposed upon Australia's road freight industry. The opposition has concerns about the impact of these bills, and I will refer to some of those issues later. But we also have specific concerns about some of the content of the bills. The Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill 2008, for example, will require the Commonwealth to always impose the charges agreed to by the Australian Transport Council to trucks registered by the Commonwealth, known as the Federal Interstate Registration Scheme or FIRS. This provision may be found in proposed section 5(4) on page 9 of the bill. The relevant clause reads: Regulations made for the purposes of this section must implement the national charge imposed on the registration of heavy vehicles, and any adjustment process of that charge, that is agreed by the Australian Transport Council. This provision causes us some serious concern because, under it, the Commonwealth will lose its discretion to dissent from the ministerial council and will be unable to determine in its own right the charges that should apply to Commonwealth registered vehicles. Given that the charges agreed to by the Australian Transport Council are reference fees used by the states and territories, should the Commonwealth wish to apply competitive pressure on the charges imposed by the states and territories on their own heavy vehicles it will be unable to do so. It seems extraordinary that an Australian government would bind itself to decisions made by other governments without giving itself any discretion to be able to make a separate determination in the national interest. Moreover, decisions in the Australian Transport Council are not always by consensus. In the case of a disagreement between jurisdictions it is possible for a majority decision to occur. theory at least, it would be possible for the Commonwealth to be saddled with a decision which it did not support. I accept, when it comes to regulatory issues, that the states and the Commonwealth are essentially sovereign, but I am still uncomfortable with a legislative provision that removes the right of the Commonwealth to dissent from a charge regime agreed to amongst the states. In other words, the Commonwealth would be binding itself to a decision made by others. This is something that seems to have escaped the Rudd government. It is the job of the Commonwealth to provide national leadership and to ensure, where possible, that competitive pressure applies to state based charge-setting arrangements. What we are seeing is an abrogation of this role. The Labor-run federal government is letting its state Labor mates have free rein when setting the fees that will have to be carried by a crucial sector of the economy, Australia's road freight industry. I think this is another example of what is meant by â€˜ending the blame game'! The Commonwealth is walking away from any attempt to impose accountability upon the decisions of the states. This is highly regretthere table. The real impact of these bills will be felt in the associated regulations that are to be tabled in parliament after the passage of the bills. The regulation will schedule the details of the heavy vehicle registration charges. These charges will contain significant increases to be implemented over three years from 1 July 2008. The basis of these increases is the view of the Rudd government that the trucking sector is somehow not paying its way-which is by no means clear, with independent research commissioned by the trucking industry suggesting that the sector is already overcharged by around $100 million per year. Even if you accept the figures of the National Transport Commission, there is still only a relatively minor underrecovery of the costs that are imposed by the industry. There are arguments about whether the charges are being evenly collected across the industry and whether one sector is subsidising another. Those sorts of issues are the key elements of work done by the National Transport Commission. In spite of the case for these increases in charges being unclear, the Rudd government has decided to press ahead anyway. It will determine these charges by applying an annual road cost adjustment formula. This formula is largely based on expenditure costs associated with the impact of trucks on our road system. It will be a particularly expensive formula for Australia's road freight industry since, as is common knowledge, costs associated with road construction and maintenance-such as steel, concrete, asphalt, oil products et cetera-are skyrocketing. So the registration costs are going to go up at a higher rate than the CPI. What does this mean? It means that close to 70 per cent of Australia's truckies-and, in particular, all of those at the heavier end of the industry-are going to be paying more. This will mean that will be rising costs associated with road expenditure that are completely out of their control. The structure of the charges penalises productivity, since the costs agreed to by the Australian Transport Council fall heavily on the highly productive multicombination vehicles, such as B-doubles and B-triples. For example, the registration charges for Bdoubles will increase from $8,041 to $14,340, including a multicombination prime mover charge of $7,050. B-triple charges will skyrocket to $20,340, including the multicombination prime mover charge of $7,050. Smaller vehicles will not have increases and, in a small number of cases, will actually pay less. The reality is these are very substantial increases in charges on the most efficient sector of the industry. Indeed, previous meetings of ministers at the Australian Transport Council had agreed that there ought to be encouragement to move the sector towards the more productive units. There was a conscious decision made to cross-subsidise these larger units to encourage their take-up. I think that this was sound policy. These larger units have road-friendly suspensions. The evidence suggests that they are more friendly to roads and less likely to cause damage than the smaller units. The result of this fee structure will reduce the incentive for operators to use high-productivity vehicles. Operators will be inclined to stick with semitrailers instead. For a government that has got a long-proclaimed greenhouse agenda, it seems extraordinary that it has agreed to a charge arrangement that will actually encourage more greenhouse emitting vehicles on our roads. But there is more. As the second part of the fee structure imposed on heavy vehicles, the Australian Transport Council decided to increase the road user charge, or diesel excise, from 19.633c per litre to 21c per litre. This will be achieved by reducing the amount of rebate that on-road diesel users will receive in the trucking sector. Most importantly, this fuel excise increase will be indexed on the same formula that is used for the heavy vehicle registration charges. This regulation under the Fuel Tax Bill 2006 was tabled by Labor on the sly in the House on 13 March, before this legislation had even been brought into the parliament. It will take effect from 1 January 2009. We will be moving to disallow this instrument. This instrument brings back fuel excise indexation. It brings back something that has been written out of the Australian agenda for quite a few years now. The indexation of fuel excise, members will recall, was introduced by the Keating government and then abolished by the Howard government in early 2001. After a seven-year absence, it is back for trucks and pegged to a formula that will lock in a greater tax take than you would get under the CPI. Not only do we have indexation but it is indexed to a formula that will deliver very much higher tax rates than would occur under the CPI. This is a highly significant decision by the new Labor government. In one of its first acts in office, it has introduced a new tax-a tax that will increase at a rate greater than cost of living. Who will pay for it? Initially, the sector responsible for moving 75 per cent of Australia's domestic freight will pay. Those who drive the nation's 365,000 trucks, many of whom are struggling small business operators, will have to pay. So much for defending working families. Here is a group of very small businesses, most with high debt and many of them single unit operatorspeople who battle to win contracts and who keep their trucks on the road for long hours just to make a living. These are the people that are going to have pay a new indexed tax, introduced compliments of Labor. In the end, of course, all Australians will pay. The increased costs will be passed on to the consumer and there will be a rise in prices for everyone. From cornflakes to building materials, from medicine to school shoes-the everyday items that working families need-all of these prices will go up as a result of the new tax Labor is proposing to introduce today. For the Rudd government to increase taxes when so many Australians are hurting due to interest rate rises exposes the emptiness of his claim to be serious about fighting inflation. Many of the smaller operators will have particular difficulties in passing on these taxes, but the larger operators who move groceries and some of the big-volume items for regular customers will of course pass these increases straight on to the shopkeepers, the retailers, who will in turn put them straight onto the price of every item in every store. Remember the Prime Minister's promise in the election about putting downward pressure on grocery prices-he has done precisely the opposite. What is the good of an ACCC inquiry into grocery prices and pretending it is going to have some kind of downward impact, when on the other hand you are putting up taxes in a way that will guarantee that, no matter what the findings the of the inquiry might be, groceries will be dearer after the election of the Rudd Labor government than they were previously? This decision also clarifies another element of this so-called â€˜ending the blame game', which Labor ministers like to say. It means that, now that we have wall-to-wall Labor governments, no Labor transport minister will blame another for raising taxes; they are all in the deal together. The Labor transport ministers have been wanting to increase these taxes for years. The coalition government has blocked this revenue rise. Now it appears that there is no longer any protection for Australia's hard working truckies. We have wall-to-wall Labor transport ministers, so in reality the increases in taxes will come again and again. What about the struggling farmers and the cash-strapped mums and dads who will have to pay more as the increases flow through to them? It also flies in the face of the reassurances that were given by Labor frontbencher Martin Ferguson, who when he was the spokesman for transport told the trucking industry at the Australian Trucking Convention in Cairns in April last year â€˜squeezing profitability of the trucking industry is in no-one's best interests'. He pretended on that occasion to be a friend of the truckies. He pretended that Labor would stand up for the trucking industry. But now they are in government the story is different. Either the member for Batman was being indifferent to the truth or he got rolled. Regardless, the Rudd government has introduced a new tax that is inflationary and will make life harder for struggling families. Let us look now at the revenue implications of raising heavy vehicle registration charges and reintroducing fuel indexation via the road user charge. Labor state and territory government revenue will rise substantially as a result of increased fuel tax and registration charges, with the annual revenue stream to Labor governments growing by $168 million. Put another way, the fuel tax take to Labor states and territories will rise from $1.146 billion in 2007-08 to $1.226 billion in 2010-11-an increase of $80 million. The increase in heavy vehicle registration charges will push up the tax take for Labor state and territory governments from $638 million to $727 million in the same period-an increase of $88 million. In terms of the states, Labor-run New South Wales will see its registration tax rise from $150.3 million in 2007-08 to $166.8 million in 2009-10 and Victoria's registration revenue will rise 15 per cent, from $171.4 million to $197.9 million, in the same period. Given the poor track record of the Labor states in project management, there are no guarantees that we will actually see any improvement in transport infrastructure arising from these higher charges. One of the fundamental weaknesses of the road user charge scheme is that the money collected from the registration or the fuel excise is not hypothecated, so there is no guarantee that any of this money will actually be spent on roads. There is no guarantee that the states will go out and build extra roads to benefit the trucking industry. There is no guarantee that they will spend more money on maintaining the roads. It will simply go into their revenue and they will do with it as they wish. The minister has said that there will be a program of new road enforcement regulationsbuilding a couple of rest stops and a number of issues like that. Some of those issues may well be worthwhile, but there is no guarantee that the money raised from this indexed new tax will in fact ever be spent on roads. I think the people of Australia need to be aware when they are paying higher prices for groceries, equipment and transport that the money essentially being collected from them will not necessarily be spent on roads. Indeed, we have good reason to be concerned about where Labor is going in relation to road funding. I think the softening up process by the Rudd government to drastically reduce road funding around Australia has already begun. Labor used incomplete and old statistics in a crude attempt to downplay the coalition's funding commitments for land transport, which were at record highs some years before the last election. With less than two months to go before the May budget, it now appears that the Labor government will have the coalition's AusLink commitments of $31 billion between now and 2013. Labor could spend as much as $15 billion less than the coalition promised during that period. The Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government released a report by the Bureau of Transport and Regional Economics which suggested that, once adjusted for inflation, the coalition spent less annually on road funding than the previous Labor government. Unfortunately for those who expect some transparency and honesty from the government, there were at least three major flaws in that claim. Firstly, the report deals with spending until 2004. It was only in 2004 that the AusLink program was introduced. The big boost in expenditure, up to around $4 billion a year, occurred after the introduction of AusLink-and that occurred outside the time frame for the figures that the minister was quoting. Secondly, a big component of AusLink was the billions of dollars of new funding spent on rail-to get more freight off our roads so that they can last longer, freeing up money for new roads and a more efficient transport system. The minister conveniently forgot the expenditure on rail when criticising the coalition's performance as an infrastructure builder. Thirdly, and never let this be forgotten, the previous Labor government put its road funding on the bank card. It was part of the $96 billion worth of debt that the coalition government inherited on coming to office. So the coalition government not only had to build new roads but also had to pay for the ones that Labor had built in its earlier term. The reality is that we were left with the bill for the meagre road construction activity that Labor had undertaken during its previous term in office, so it is somewhat disingenuous for the minister to criticise the previous coalition government's record on road funding. But it is even more dishonest if in fact he intends to drastically slash over the next four years the amount of funding that the coalition committed to roads during the last election campaign. In its last budget the coalition detailed infrastructure spending of $22.3 billion between next year and 2013, and an extra $7.3 billion was announced before the election. And all those promises were independently costed by Treasury. We provided to Treasury an extensive policy document-something like 75 pages-and the policies were fully costed. The policy package detailed the projects across the length and breadth of Australia on which $31 billion would be spent. Labor's election promises, we are now told as a result of the press releases that were put out during this last week, amounted to only $15.5 billion-half of what the coalition had promised. This amount would actually take expenditure backwards from what had been achieved in the past. There will be projects right around Australia that will be at risk from Labor's razor gang. We have already heard about some of those projects. The $1.2 billion F3 to Branxton link road in New South Wales is not going to be built. There will be $500 million slashed from the Bruce Highway funding for work between Cooroy and Curra. What about Roads to Recovery and the $350 million funding that has been so essential for local governments to keep their roads up to date or the $300 million we had committed to spend on development roads around regional Australia? Labor has not committed to either of these essential elements of a road budget. One has to be deeply concerned about the future of our nation's road system under this government. Labor has never had much sympathy for the road transport industry. I can recall, as a minister attending meetings of state and territory transport ministers, state Labor ministers one after the other venting their spleen on the evils of having trucks running up and down their roads. Some of them are very much in a â€˜get square' mood at the present time and, sadly, they have a federal government that is only too willing to roll over and to impose these additional taxes on the industry. A couple of days ago there was a letter to the editor in one of my local newspapers that was signed by Peter Schuback, from the Australian Long Distance Owners and Driver Association. He comes from an area not far from my home town. He wrote: If the government was serious about tackling inflation then why has it approved the extra charges for the transport industry? Why has it allowed the near doubling of registration costs of some long distance trucks (up to about $14,400 a year for B-doubles)? Why has it allowed the horrific fines for truck drivers for minor breaches ($10,000 plus $1,000 for every 15 minutes over on your log book and six demerit points), especially when it has not provided the facilities so truck drivers can do the right thing and abide by the laws? Members of the public should be made very aware that their household costs are going to ble because of the government and National Transport Commission's actions. You have been warned. Well, the consumers of Australia have been warned. This is not a tax that is going to be innocently imposed upon a profitable trucking sector that can simply absorb it and not pass the costs on to consumers; this is a tax that will be felt by every shopper every day that they go to a supermarket. Every time a struggling family goes to buy the week's groceries, they will pay more as a result of this tax. And the minister admitted as much. He acknowledged that the effect of this would be of the order of $16 or $18 a year on the average grocery bill. But it will not only be groceries for which there will be higher costs; there will be higher costs for everything that we buy every day. There will be higher costs on the sorts of things that people, particularly those who live outside the capital cities, use in their daily lives. People who live outside the capital cities will pay a higher share of this cost because transport is more important to them. Everything has to travel a distance to get to many of the small country towns in your electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker Schultz, and in my own electorate. This will also affect a manufacturing industry in a regional area. Because of the way in which parts are moved to put together various items of manufactured goods these days, there will be multiple times when this particular increase will be paid on the construction or manufacture of an item in a factory. As parts are moved in and out and are moved on a truck from one place to another to be assembled, the truck will pay higher fuel costs and higher registration charges each time as a result of this legislation. This is not legislation that people can simply put aside and say has nothing to do with them. They will feel the effects of this dou- every day. When the government comes into this place or goes on television and talks about how it cares about the higher costs of groceries for struggling families, people should be reminded that part of the reason that groceries are more expensive is that this government has indexed the diesel fuel that the truck uses to travel around the roads. Of course, the fuel itself has to be transported to service stations around the country by diesel trucks-diesel trucks that will cost more to register and for which there will be a higher level of tax on the fuel that they use to complete their journeys. These bills support a new tax and an increase in registration charges, for which the case is not clear. The fees will discourage the use of efficient vehicle combinations and will increase truck traffic on our roads. The taxes and charges are inflationary and will make worse the financial struggle of not only the families of transport operators but all Australians. They include a new indexed fuel excise that will rise faster than the CPI. The taxes fly in the face of the Rudd government's statements about fighting inflation. The decision represents an abrogation of federal Labor's responsibility to ensure that the taxes imposed by their state Labor mates are competitive. It is for these reasons, and indeed many others, that the opposition will oppose these bills.",66
172,Mr HAYES,ROAD TRANSPORT CHARGES,"The extent of the carnage on our roads has been reduced over recent years; however, the tragedy continues to strike too many families. We see it on our television screens, unfortunately, on a daily basis, and it continues to inflict devastation not only on the families of the truck drivers or the road users involved but also on the wider community. This trauma is not isolated to the immediate victims of road trauma. The collateral damage affects many people, from the emergency services who lend assistance to the various voluntary organisations across the country to the people whom I represented for many years-the various members of the police service. I have to say, sadly, that the fight terms of road carnage as a result of heavy vehicles cannot be won but there are many things that we should look at in addressing those issues, and they particularly go to road safety. The National Road Safety Strategy has a target of reducing the annual number of road deaths per 100,000 head of population to below 5.6 by the end of 2010-that represents a 40 per cent reduction relative to the 1999 benchmark. This figure has become a formidable target with the aim of reducing the number of road fatalities. On 29 February this year, the transport ministers across the country unanimously endorsed this government's plan to put into effect a $70 million heavy vehicle safety and productivity plan. I have had the opportunity to have a brief discussion about this with one of the main characters in the industry, Lindsay Fox, and with a former colleague of mine Bill Kelty-but I will come back to that later. In terms of Lindsay Fox's involvement in the industryapart from his history in establishing heavy vehicle transport throughout the country and his commitment to the ongoing viability of this industry-I think his views are certainly very much respected, at least on this side of the chamber. The Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill 2008 enables the nationally agreed heavy vehicle registration charges to be applied to heavy vehicles registered under the Australian government's Federal Interstate Registration Scheme-or FIRS, as it is known. The new heavy vehicle charges are one component of this government's broader heavy vehicle productivity and safety agenda and will ensure that the Federal Interstate Registration Scheme charges are consistent with the state and territory registration charges as they apply from 1 July 2008. Heavy vehicles operate across our country in and transport from state to state almost 1.7 billion tonnes of freight, which represents 70 per cent of the total domestic tonnage carried by all transport modes. As many as 365,000 heavy vehicles operate in Australia. As you would no doubt appreciate, Mr Deputy Speaker Schultz, being on the Hume Highway, my electorate of Werriwa experiences a lot of the heavy vehicle transport that operates along the eastern seaboard. The Hume Highway between Sydney and Melbourne is one of our most active interstate corridors, and it carries 20 million tonnes of freight per year. In the lead-up to the last federal election, it was so critical that the then Rudd opposition outline a plan to widen the Hume Highway where significant bottlenecks were occurring. Within the bounds of Werriwa on the Hume Highway, we experience 6,000 heavy transport movements per day. In raw terms, this bill is about ensuring there is a proper charge applied against heavy transport movements that has regard to recovery against infrastructure with respect to roads. The basis of that, as was agreed by the transport ministers, was to ensure that a fair amount was paid in order to contribute to the preservation of roads and essential infrastructure to allow the passage of this transport. Therefore, the collection of the heavy vehicle charges has the support of state and territory governments, but more importantly the Commonwealth government. This is about ensuring that heavy vehicles pay their fair way in terms of the impact on our roads. Having just heard the contribution from the Leader of the Nationals, I should indicate that in 2007 the then Leader of the Nationals and transport minister-the member for Lyne, Mr Vaile-put reform of heavy vehicle charges on the agenda of the Council of Australian Governments. He said: The National Transport Commission will develop a new heavy vehicle charges determination to be implemented from 1 July 2008. The new determination will aim to recover the heavy vehicles' allocated infrastructure costs in total aim to remove cross-subsidisation across heavy vehicle classes. Currently the amount of money raised through the heavy vehicle charges does not recover the cost of providing the infrastructure for heavy vehicles. That is the position which underpins this bill and it was certainly the position at the heart of the statement made in 2007 by Mr Vaile. Recovery of road expenditure is achieved through a fixed registration charge collected by state and territory governments and a road users charge collected by the Australian government. The heavy vehicle charges have not changed since 2001, when it was determined that the charges would recover past expenditure from the heavy vehicle sector. This had the effect of lowering registration fees for some larger trucks, which consequently brought about a situation where they were effectively being cross-subsidised by the operators of smaller trucks. As I stated earlier, an overhaul of the heavy vehicle charges is urgently needed in order to construct and maintain the infrastructure needed for these heavy vehicles. In fact, the National Transport Commission estimates that underrecovery is currently in excess of $100 million per year. In 2007, the National Transport Commission was asked by the Australian transport ministers, who were directed by COAG as part of the overall transport reform package, to prepare a new heavy vehicle determination to deliver revised charges for introduction this year. This bill deals only with the registration charges. The road user charges are not dealt with in this bill; however the determination increases the road user charge from 19.633c per litre to 21c per litre, indexed annually. To provide industry the opportunity to adjust to the new road user charge, it was agreed in cooperation with the industry that its introduction would be deand will also layed until 1 January 2009. Under the proposal recommended by the National Transport Commission, there will be a new set of registration charges which will rebalance the contribution of different heavy vehicle classes. The new registration charges will in effect put a stop to smaller trucks paying as much as they do presentlyin effect subsidising the larger trucks-and the larger trucks, the B-doubles and road trains, will be required to pay their fair This will result in decreases in registration charges for about 25 per cent of the transport fleet, a small increase for about 69 per cent of the fleet, and a significant increase for the remaining six per cent of the fleet-that is, the heavy truck trailers and multicombination vehicles that are currently subsidised by smaller vehicles. To assist the industry to adjust, these increases will be phased in over three years and will better align charges to the impacts of heavy vehicles on our roads. To supplement the determination by the National Transport Commission, the government, after listening to the concerns of the industry, has developed a $70 million, heavy vehicle safety and productivity plan. (Quorum formed) I had the opportunity to talk to Lindsay Fox and Bill Kelty, together with the member for Maribyrnong, only a couple of weeks ago. It was very refreshing to hear what people who are absolutely committed to this industry have to say about its future and the degree of investment that needs to be made. One thing Mr Fox was talking about was the trial of technology, particularly the electronic monitoring of truck drivers' work hourseffectively, a black box within the transport industry. As he put it, there are certain charges involved not only with administering it but also with regulating it. He was talking not only of the working conditions of professional drivers but also of the responsibility we have to drivers, their families and, as a matter of fact, all other road users. That is why an organisation such as Linfox is so committed to looking at those aspects of technical development that could be deployed in this industry with a view to enhancing the safety of our heavy transport sector. Another thing that is being looked at is the construction of more heavy vehicle rest stops and decoupling areas along our highways share. and on the outskirts of our major cities. Again, that is something that is quite significant. A third thing is upgrades to linkages between our AusLink freight routes and the strengthening of some of our bridges to cope with the contemporary transport we use and its frequency. Safety in the heavy vehicles sector is paramount not only to those directly involved in the industry but to all road users. We have a dreadful situation where approximately 330 people are killed each year in crashes involving heavy vehicles, a one in five fatality ratio, with three times as many injured. That does not mean that it is just trucks that are at fault; it means ensuring that our roads are maintained so as to accommodate the use of those roads by the heavy transport sector. This is a significant cost to our community; it is a cost which it would be almost immoral to put a value on. There is certainly a fiscal cost to the community of around $2 billion per year. But the cost that road fatalities have on our community is something that we all have an obligation to try to do something about. That is what this bill does: it seeks to recover in the transport sector the moneys to reinvest in better roads and to reinvest in the infrastructure that is ever so necessary if we are to continue to utilise heavy vehicles as the prime transport mode for our domestic product. I commend the bill to the House.",73
173,Mr RAMSEY,ROAD TRANSPORT CHARGES,"I am proud to come to this House and come to Canberra to represent the electors of Grey. One of the things I need to do as I represent the electors of Grey is put forward their interests. Since I have come to Canberra-and I have only been coming here for a few weeks-I have felt as though my electors are under assault. We have had 115 days of this government, and the government's attacks on rural and regional Australia are setting a patto tern. We have had the termination of the Investing in Our Schools Program. We are in the middle of a $2 billion raid on the Communications Fund put aside for rural Australia. In my electorate, it seems as if we have just lost an Indigenous youth festival called Croc Fest. We have had cuts in Exceptional Circumstances funding. We have had the removal of $10 million of support for agricultural research-support put in place to help alleviate the loss of levies grower organisations have at the moment through the drought. So here we have a government proudly claiming to be delivering on its election agenda, but there is a whole stack of nasties out there as well, a whole heap of nasties that we did not know about before the election; in particular, the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill 2008. And there is more in the pipeline. We are already talking about what is going to happen to the Australian technical colleges and Regional Partnerships. Let us face it, the government even had a go at trying to cut the carers payment in the last week, but the public outcry was so great they could not proceed. But rural and regional Australia is an easy hit. They have a go at us and they can get away with that. The previous Prime Minister often said, â€˜We will not abandon rural Australia in its hour of need.' It seems to me that this government cannot get out fast enough. Labor does not understand or care about rural and regional Australia. We are now seeing the product of wall-to-wall Labor. The last time these proposals were put up by the NTC, the Australian Transport Commission rejected them. That was when the coalition still had a seat at the table. We are not seeing that sense of cooperation now-first meeting and the changes go straight through. My office has had numerous contacts on this issue. Figures bandied around suggest that it will add 13c a $100 grocery bill. Maybe that is the case when your freight is five per cent of the final cost. I might point out that fuel in the northern part of my electorate is over $2 per litre. That would suggest to meMr Katter-Why didn't you introduce ethanol?",75
174,Mr RAMSEY,ROAD TRANSPORT CHARGES,"I was not here then. That price would suggest to me that we have at least a 25 per cent freight component on fuel. It shows that, in the country, freight is a much bigger component, whether it be 10, 15 or 25 per cent. This impost delivers an 80 per cent increase on the registration of a Bdouble, rising from $8,041 to $14,340. The Australian Transport Commission adopted the higher road fuel user charge. We are going to see not only a rise in the fuel cost of around 1.4c per litre but also the return of indexation, something that we thought we had seen off. This indexation is not going to be linked to CPI, as all other indexations have been before. This indexation will be linked to the road-building indices, which are rising at a far greater rate than the CPI. Since much of the road-building material has to be brought in, the raise in freight rates will naturally raise the price of the roads. Truckers have no choice but to pass on this cost. One medium-sized operator in my electorate estimates that it will cost his business $160,000 to $200,000 a year. He will have no choice but to pass this on. Truck operators tell me that they expect their freight costs to rise by about six per cent. My electorate runs on freight. Broadacre agriculture involves big tonnages that must be moved to the port. We have the mining industry. We always pay freight two ways in the country. Six per cent will be added to the freight bill of fuel, fertiliser and industrial inputs. Six per cent will be added to the freight bill of groceries. Six per cent will be added to the freight bill of lettuces, toilets, toilet paper and shampoo. Residents of Grey will pay the freight both ways on everything that comes into and out of their electorate. Higher freight rates will mean higher prices. Higher prices will mean higher inflation. This government has done nothing, if it has not talked about inflation. How many times have I heard the word â€˜inflation' in this House in the last three weeks? Possibly about half as many times as I have heard the term â€˜working families'. The working families of the electorate of Grey will not appreciate the inflation caused by these higher rate charges. The increases that were rejected in 2006 as being an unfair slug on rural Australia were deemed unfair because at that time rural Australia was struggling in the grips of a drought. I ask the other side of this House what they think has changed since that time. I would say that nothing has changed. The drought is still there and rural Australia is still struggling. What are we going to do? We are going to hit them with a six per cent rise in freight prices. Australia is addicted to fuel tax. We pay fuel tax of around $14 billion a year, yet we are still spending less than half of that on roads in Australia, even allowing for large increases in road funding in the last four years. The road transport industry and the motorists of Australia are paying more than enough tax already to pay for all the repairs on the road. And there is no guarantee that these increases are going to be spent on the road network anyhow. It is within the government's power to spend it on whatever they wish. Australia consumes around 37,000 megalitres of fuel a year. I do not have the exact calculations on this, but if you assume that 80 per cent of that is for non-export activity that should lead to about another $5 billion worth of GST receipts, which will be going straight to the states. The states are able to spend more on the roads; they do not need this extra registration slug. Far from the transport industry not paying their way, at this stage they and the motorists of Australia are carrying the load. The Australian Trucking Association claims that the National Transport Commission's finding that heavy transport are not paying their way is flawed, that they meet more than their costs and that there is little transparency about this increase. In the light of that, it behoves the government to go back and look at those figures and check to see whether they are correct. Heavy imposts on large combination registration will push freight back onto smaller trucks. I have just been listening to the member for Werriwa talking about the issue of road safety in Australia. I could not agree with him more. Everybody is concerned about road safety. Every year that goes past we see more and more transport movements on the road, yet our road toll is falling. That is a great testament to the people who run the trucks, it is a great testament to the motorists and it is a great testament to the investment of all governments that have improved roads. No-one more than me would like to see the the road toll fall further. But we do have to have a sense of reality here. If we are going to push freight back onto smaller trucks-this is the old argument-why not push it around in wheelbarrows? Why not put the freight back onto 14-tonne trucks? That would mean we would only have small trucks on the road and, when you get hit, it will only be a 22tonne weakling that runs over the top of your car-and we are going to have five times as many of them. That just defies logic. You cannot have more trucks on the road and be safer. We need to push the loads onto the big trucks to keep the traffic density down. More trucks mean more danger, more greenhouse gases and more congestion, and ultimately it will do more damage to the roads. Much has been written and said over the years about Australia being cursed by the tyranny of distance. In this case we tax to our disadvantage. In an economy like Australia's, it is nonsensical to tax freight over and above what is necessary to achieve the road network that we need. It taxes productivity-the very thing that builds this nation. I think there was an estimate in 2002 that the road freight task for Australia will double by the year 2020. I point out that in 2008 we are about one-third of the way through, so the increases that you have seen in the last six years will keep happening. And the idea of pushing freight back onto smaller trucks, of using the motorists and the consumers of Australia as a cash cow not just to build highways but to keep putting money back into the rest of the economy, is flawed. We will pay the price for it in the long term. We need to freight more safely on roads; we do not need more trucks. I conclude my remarks by saying that I believe this bill is an unfair attack on rural Australia. The people in the cities may not understand the implications, but you pay freight on everything you consume and then you pay GST on top of the freight. That tax should be part of the accounting plan for the roads but it is not being counted at the moment. Somewhere around $5 billion of fuel tax delivered to the states not part of the equation. We need to draw attention back to it. We do not need this extra impost.",76
175,Mr CLARE,ROAD TRANSPORT CHARGES,"I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution to the debate on the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill 2008. Our freight travels the length and breadth of our vast country, from the mines in Western Australia to Port Botany in Sydney, from cattle stations in Far North Queensland to the homes of South Australia. The tyranny of distance is largely borne by our truck drivers. They rely on the road infrastructure that we provide. We need to give our freight movers roads of the highest quality; we need to give our truck drivers rest stops to combat driver fatigue; we need to make the presence of heavy vehicles on the roads safer for the sake of truck drivers and, importantly, for all road users. We need to improve the efficiency of our road network by upgrading our roads and strengthening our bridges. In laying out the obligations the government have to heavy vehicle users, we also recognise that contributions from the freight industry are an important part of the total road expenditure. Successive governments of both political persuasions and many in the trucking industry have supported the contribution towards the cost of road construction and the contribution towards fixing the damage that heavy vehicles do to our roads. Ultimately these contributions directly benefit the freight and road transport industry. This bill will overhaul the existing act and create charges which are more equitable for all truck drivers. An inquiry into road and rail infrastructure pricing by the Productivity Commission found that currently small trucks are paying too much while larger trucks are paying too little. On advice from COAG, chaired by John Howard, the National Transport Comis mission recommended that the former government introduce legislation to ensure full cost recovery of heavy vehicle usage and cross-subsidisation of large trucks by smaller vehicles. The Howard government at that time said that those changes were to be implemented on 1 July 2008. The new Rudd government, based on the same recommendations, aims to do the same. Significantly, the government's bill deals only with registration charges. The implementation of the road user charge will be delayed until 1 January 2009. I welcome the support of the industry for this change. Stuart St Clair, the Chief Executive of the Australian Trucking Association, had this to say: Minister Albanese has listened to the industry delivered a strong result for trucking operators and Australian families ... The bill introduced by the government will reduce registration fees for 25 per cent of the nation's 365,000 heavy vehicles, distributing the costs to larger vehicles. The greatest increase will be for six per cent of trucks, for the larger trucks such as B-doubles. To ensure minimal impact on the industry, these increases will be introduced over three years. The logic is that those that do the most damage and enjoy the greatest benefits from road upgrades will pay the highest cost. My experience over the last four years working on the Westlink M7 project in Western Sydney is testimony to the advantages that road freight gets from first-class infrastructure. The M7 is a new freight link through Western Sydney, a 40-kilometre road that connects the M5 to the M4 and on to the M2. It is a road that has made the work of moving freight in Sydney, and particularly in Western Sydney, so much more productive and so much more efficient. The evidence of this can be seen in the heavy vehicles that use the road. On most motorways in Sydney and across the country on most arterial roads you will find that the traffic mix on those major roads is around eight or nine per cent heavy vehicles and the rest smaller vehicles. The M7 has a very different traffic mix: it has in the order of 18 per cent heavy vehicles. Those trucks, those heavy vehicles, are taking advantage of the M7 because it cuts travel time, and time is money. A couple of years ago, the Victorian Transport Association released some information on the real impact of saving time for the freight industry. They gave me some information which indicated that, at that time, an hour saved on the road for a B-double equated to around $100 saved. That incorporated the cost of fuel, it incorporated the cost of labour and it incorporated the cost of maintenance. When and all of that was taken into account, a B-double saving an hour on the road saved about $100. Good infrastructure that cuts time and cuts costs makes business more efficient and more productive. Good infrastructure saves time and money. That is what the M7 does, and that is why I welcome the investment that we see in this bill in new and improved road infrastructure. We can also see these benefits in major upgrades to the Pacific Highway. Travel times have been cut significantly and the route has been opened up to B-doubles, with over 200 B-doubles utilising the road every day-heavy vehicles that are moving from the New England Highway over to the Pacific Highway to take advantage of the travel time savings, and cutting their costs and becoming more productive as a consequence. We can also see the benefits in Victoria, with the $331 million Deer Park bypass, a nine-kilometre four-lane freeway which will improve access to the Western Ring Road and Melbourne Ports, and reduce travel and operating costs for 7,000 heavy vehicle users. Also, we see the benefits on the Hume Highway, where the bypass around Albury-Wodonga has reduced operating costs for heavy vehicles, drastically cutting the driving time between Melbourne and Sydney. The benefits of these projects have a ripple effect. They increase efficiency and safety, and they increase productivity. When you increase productivity you go a long way towards lowering inflation. But the bill that we are discussing today is not just about boosting productivity or improving infrastructure; it is also about saving lives. This government, through this bill, will invest in driver safety. This government will invest $70 million into the trucking industry and road infrastructure to prevent the loss of hundreds of lives and the thousands of injuries that occur annually on our roads. The road toll can be reduced by using the measures that the minister for infrastructure and transport has outlined: the introduction of black box technology to make it difficult for drivers to drive for too long or at high speeds; upgrades to freight routes and the strengthening of bridges to enable them to safely carry larger, heavier loads; and the construction of more heavy vehicle rest stops and parking areas along highways to reduce driver fatigue. The Monash University Accident Research Centre estimates that road spending on such measures can reduce heavy vehicle related deaths by 38 per cent. That translates into 125 lives potentially saved each year. I commend the minister for working closely with the states and territories and the industry to develop a plan not only to create greater efficiency in the existing road network but also, very importantly, to potentially save lives. Again, I welcomed the comments in the Australian Financial Review this morning of Stuart St Clair, the Chief Executive of the Australian Trucking Association. He said: These are very significant changes to dustry, they should not be underestimated ... I also note that the former minister for transport in his contribution spent considerable energy defending the former government's investment in road infrastructure. However, his argument is not borne out by the Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Economics, which released a report only recently that showed that road funding during most of the Howard government era was about 11 per cent lower than during the years of the Hawke and Keating Labor governments. Federal road funding averaged $2.3 billion a year under the former Hawke and Keating Labor governments but fell to less than $2.05 billion a year under the coalition. There is a lot of work to do to realise the aim of the freight industry: to move more freight, to move it more safely and to move it at less cost. We are just beginning, but I welcome the government's commitment to this task and I welcome the minister's contribution to this task.",78
176,Ms MARINO,ROAD TRANSPORT CHARGES,"I rise to speak on the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill 2008, which will enable heavy vehicle registration charges to be applied to trucks registered under the Australian government's Federal Interstate Registration Scheme. The Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill 2008 also updates definitions contained in the Interstate Road Transport Act 1985 and establishes a new charge-setting mechanism based on a rate agreed by transport ministers meeting as the ATC. These updated charges were determined by Commonwealth, state and territory transport ministers at the Australian Transport Council meeting on 29 February 2008. The states and territories will impose the same charges for heavy vehicles that come under their registration systems. Separately, but as part of rationalising the charge-setting the in- mechanism, the Road Transport Charges (Australian Capital Territory) Repeal Bill 2008 repeals the current charge-setting mechanism based on Commonwealthprovided act law, the Road Transport Charges (Australian Capital Territory) Act 1993. The two elements of the charge structure upon the Australian trucking system are through registration fees and the diesel fuel excise system. The determination of the appropriate level of these charges occurs through the National Transport Commission, which makes recommendations to the ATC to recover road expenditure attributable to heavy vehicles. The trucking industry has long accepted the principle of paying its way, an approach endorsed by all levels of government. All money collected under the Federal Interstate Registration Scheme is paid to the states and territories. These bills make adjustments to the way heavy vehicle registration fees and the diesel fuel excise, known as the road user charge, are determined. The Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill 2008 grants the ATC the power to determine the charges that will apply to Commonwealthregistered heavy vehicles. The Road Transport Charges (Australian Capital Territory) Repeal Bill 2008 ends the system whereby the Australian Capital Territory set the refersemitrailers ence charge for other jurisdictions to follow. The Australian Trucking Association has objected to the proposed increases, and the Australian Long Distance Owners and Drivers Association has opposed both the higher registration and excise costs. However, my main concern is that the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill 2008 will require the Commonwealth to always impose the charges agreed to by the Australian Transport Council. The Commonwealth, therefore, will lose its discretion to dissent from the ministerial council and would be unable to determine in its own right the charges that should apply to Commonwealthregistered heavy vehicles. The Australian Transport Council charges are reference fees used by the states and territories. Should the Commonwealth wish to apply competitive pressure on the charges imposed by the states and territories on their own heavy vehicles, it would be unable to do so; therefore, the Commonwealth will have no capacity to scrutinise these charges. The regulation that stipulates the heavy vehicle registration charges will contain significant increases that will be implemented over three years from 1 July 2008. These increases will arise from the application of an annual road cost adjustment formula-a formula that will result in charges higher than the CPI. The increase in charges will fall heavily on the already highly productive multicombination vehicles such as B-doubles and Btriples. B-doubles and B-triples carry the more time-sensitive foodstuffs-such as fresh fruit, vegetables, milk and wine-and are highly effective in Western Australia, where great distances are travelled to regional and remote towns. The imposts, therefore, threaten to slow the road freight sector's improvement in productivity and in environmental performance by discouraging trucking operators from converting from to the multicombination vehicles, which will result in even more trucks on our roads. The second part of the charge structure to be imposed on heavy vehicles comes from the decision by the Australian Transport Council to increase the road users charge from 19.633c per litre to 21c per litre. This will take effect from 1 January 2009 and will be indexed annually to the same formula as that used for registration charges. The two measures will impose an increasing cost burden on Australia's struggling truck operators and their families. The measures will also push up prices for everyone. Since trucks carry over 70 per cent of Australia's domestic freight, the flow-on effect of increased prices will be passed on to all consumers-Australian working familiesover many, many goods. For those imposts to occur when so many are hurting due to higher interest rates exposes the Rudd government's claim to be serious about fighting inflation. It is also an indication of what ending the blame game between federal and state governments actually means-no state Labor transport minister will blame another for imposing higher cost on Australians. They will not have to. It will mean that the government, in one of its first acts in office, will be reintroducing fuel excise indexation by stealth. Registration costs will be substantially increased, and fuel tax on truck drivers will be increased from 19.6c a litre to 21c a litre. Obviously, any increase in the cost of transporting goods will place upward pressure on interest rates and also impact on the cost of goods to consumers. Any increase in the cost of transportation will hit regional Australia hard, particularly in Western Australia. Regional areas have a particularly heavy reliance on the trucking industry to deliver consumer goods where they do not have access to the rail network. I have great respect for those in the transport industry: they deliver 1.6 billion tonnes of domestic freight. An increase in transport costs will also make Australian exports less competitive and could cost jobs. One in four jobs in regional areas is dependent on exports, and most exports start their journey by road. The Rudd government has claimed that fighting inflation is its No. 1 priority. If these increased charges are adopted then it will prove these claims are nothing more than rhetoric. With fuel prices rising, almost on a daily basis, now is not the time to increase transport costs. The associated charge framework will result in higher costs on Australia's road freight sector. Once the measures are fully implemented, the revenue of states and territories will increase by a further $168 million. ... Far more significant is that there are no guarantees that the states and territories will actually spend this revenue windfall on roads. Although state Labor governments demand that heavy haulage transport pays its fair share of road use, I am very concerned that all the money received from these increased charges will be returned to the states and territories. Where is the accountability and transparency now that the state governments actually direct increased funding back into fixing roads and where will it be in the future? The vice-president of the Australian Long Distance Owners and Drivers Association recently pleaded in an email that, if the government allows the recommendations of the NTC to go ahead and increases charges for trucks, there will be many who will go broke in this process. The transport industry believes that it does pay its way and has put up with some of the worse road conditions. Many truckies are questioning where their contributions go to, because they cannot see the funds that they have been paying being ploughed back into the nation's roads by various state Labor governments. Farmers have also slammed federal Labor's decision to increase heavy vehicle charges as just another cost burden. Registration fees for 75 per cent of the nation's 365,000 heavy vehicles will now rise. I agree with the statement made by Leon Bradley, Chairman of the PGA Western Graingrowers, when he warned that the cost increases would erode the competitiveness of WA farmers in international markets and that consumers would pay for the extra tax, because any produce carried around the nation on the back of a truck would now be more expensive. The National Farmers Federation commented that the decision added to a growing list of escalating costs that have hit farmers. They said: by arbitrarily increasing the cost of transporting food to local stores, consumers must realise that, ultimately, this means higher prices at the checkout. Farmers-as price-takers in the supply chainsimply do not have the capacity to absorb these additional costs. The trucking industry consists of small companies and individuals operating on small margins. Those in the industry know that freight rates are highly competitive. We have some very committed, quality small, medium and large operators in the trucking industry in Australia. Any government decision that forces good operators off the road and out of business should be condemned. The road user charge increases to be delivered in January 2009 will only continue to add to the pressure on the economy and increase prices to the consumer. The government cannot fight inflation at this rate and with these types of decisions. The government also cannot claim it is putting downward pressure on grocery prices. Effectively, this will do the opposite. The government has already conceded increased freight costs would be passed on to consumers, but its assessment of the increase is a mere $17 per year. The trucking industry has said that Australian families may well have to find an extra $70 in their household budgets each year after the Rudd and Labor state governments increase registration and fuel charges through this mechanism. The Assistant Treasurer yesterday stated that food prices have actually increased 43.6 per cent since 1996. Additional road transport charges will only add to this increase. I have actually contacted road haulage companies and asked the simple question: who will pay? The simple answer is: the ultimate consumer. The new plan to maintain the nation's roads is to increase charges for 69 per the nation's 365,000 heavy vehicles by between one and 10 per cent. That is the additional cost to these particular operators. Six per cent of the fleet, the biggest vehicles on the road, will be hit with even higher increases, with the rise phased in over three years. Registration fees for some classes of licences will rise from about $8,000 or $9,000 a year to $20,000 a year, and of course those increases will have to be passed on to consumers. The state Labor government is happy to have this windfall and it says there will be more money for infrastructure spending-but, again, where is the accountability and where is the transparency? How can the trucking industry be assured that the funds generated by this will actually be spent on road infrastructure? Continued Australian government investment in strategically important freight corridors through the AusLink program has been and continues to be vital to the national economy, with official forecasts indicating that growth in the road freight task will continue to outstrip growth in the aggregate economic activity over the period to 2020. The provision of quality and well-targeted road infrastructure is the leading contributor to productivity growth in the trucking industry. Therefore, there is an urgent need for more spending on road infrastructure for important AusLink freight corridors in urban areas. I am also concerned that, with the establishment of the government's Infrastructure Australia, and the development of the national infrastructure priority list, there may be calls for funding to be diverted from important road projects to other infrastructure priorities. The Bunbury outer ring road was promised by Labor during the campaign, and I am hoping that that will be delivered as a matter of priority. It may also allow the government to delay the implementing of road projects for referral to the assessment proccent of esses of Infrastructure Australia. I am deeply concerned that federal Labor will drastically reduce road funding around Australia and therefore reduce road safety.",80
177,The B,ROAD TRANSPORT CHARGES,"doubles and B-triples, the bigger, longer, higher mass carriers, have proved to be the safer and more productive combination. The federal government needs to encourage the use of these combinations and deliver on road infrastructure to keep Australia moving and improving. As the CEO of the Australian Trucking Association, Stuart St Clair, said: Australia's new national transport policy will be a success if it focuses on boosting the trucking industry's productivity and not on slugging the industry with even higher charges ... I strongly oppose this bill on the basis that it will increase the cost of living and the cost of doing business and is actually an attack on rural and regional Australia.",83
178,Mr TURNOUR,ROAD TRANSPORT CHARGES,"Leichhardt) (6.49 pm)I rise to support the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill 2008 and related bill. The bills enable a nationally agreed new heavy vehicle registration charge to be applied to heavy vehicles registered under the Australian government's Federal Interstate Registration Scheme. These bills are the result of deliberations by COAG, the Council of Australian Governments, and were unanimously endorsed by all ministers at the Australian Transport Council meeting on 29 February 2008. The Rudd government take economic reform very seriously and the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill 2008 is a very important part of our ongoing plans to build a modern and prosperous Australia into the future. The Council of Australian Governments deliberated on this bill-and the issues facing the transport industry-and unanimously endorsed it. The bill forms part of a three-pronged strategy to improve fairness in the distribution of funding in relation to heavy vehicle use in our transport industry. Those three prongs are the heavy vehicle registration charge, a slight increase in the road user charge and a $70 million heavy vehicle safety and productivity package. So this bill forms part of an overall plan-and that is what we are about. We are about planning and building a stronger Australia and a stronger economy into the future. I come from the electorate of Leichhardt. I am a proud citizen of Cairns and have a rural and country background. This evening I have only heard members of the National Party banging on about their representation of rural and regional Australia. They are a dying breed in Queensland in terms of federal politics and the reality is that they are dying because they do not effectively represent rural and regional Australia. I am a proud member of the Australian Labor Party and I am working very hard to ensure that rural and regional Queensland are represented. We understand how important road transport is to Australia. It is particularly important to my local community of Cairns and my electorate of Leichhardt. Cairns, up there in tropical North Queensland, is a long way from Brisbane, from Sydney, from Melbourne and from other capital cities. We depend on the Bruce Highway. We depend on heavy vehicles to bring in the basics, whether it is food or basic materials such as nappies and medications. For the common things that everyday working families need we rely on the road transport system and the road transport network to deliver, and we understand how very important it is that we continue to build and support a strong economy and make sure the road transport network and heavy vehicles are actually operating effectively within this country. Not only does the system bring in goods, though; we also export a lot of goods. I have heard the National Party members today talk about representing rural Australia. I am proudly from a country background and I know that a lot of bananas and a lot of mangoes come out of North Queensland. Heavy vehicles take them out. The road transport system is a very important part of dealing with that and ensuring that we support those local industries and those local communities. The National Transport Commission estimated that, under the current system, there is an under-recovery of the cost of providing infrastructure to heavy vehicles in excess of $100 million per annum. So it was estimated not by the Labor Party, the National Party or the Liberal Party but by the National Transport Commission that, under the current system, we get an under-recovery of $100 million per annum. So there is need for reform, and we recognise that. The system unfairly places a heavier burden of cost recovery on small trucks at the expense of large vehicles. Effectively, small trucks are crosssubsidising the impact of large trucks on the road network. In April 2007, the Council of Australian Governments directed that, as part of an overall transport reform package, Australian transport ministers should require the National Transport Commission to prepare a new heavy vehicle determination. In its determination, the National Transport Commission recommended a new set of registration charges that rebalance the relative contributions of the different heavy vehicle classes. This is a fairer system of allocating the cost of heavy vehicle transport-and it is no wonder that we are getting a fairer system under a Rudd Labor government. Mr MCGauran-What, because you're giving us new taxes!",84
179,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ROAD TRANSPORT CHARGES,Order! The member will restrain himself.,85
180,Mr TURNOUR,ROAD TRANSPORT CHARGES,"Successive governments, at both Commonwealth and state and territory levels, have supported the principle of cost recovery from heavy vehicles. Successive governments, at both the Commonwealth and state and territory levels, have supported the principle of cost recovery from the heavy vehicle industry for road construction and maintenance costs incurred through the collection of heavy vehicle charges. So successive governments, including the previous Howard government, have supported this approach. In a speech given on 28 June 2007 entitled â€˜The coalition government's transport reform agenda', the member for Lyne, then federal transport minister and Leader of The Nationals, said: The National Transport Commission will develop a new heavy vehicle charges determination to be implemented from 1 July 2008. The new determination will aim to recover the heavy vehicles' allocated infrastructure costs in total and will also aim to remove crosssubsidisation across heavy vehicle classes. So the then minister under the Howard government was moving to implement these sorts of reforms. We have the current opposition, led by the Leader of the National Party today in terms of this bill, basically now opposing this. We have heard that since the election the opposition does not really know where it stands. It does not know where it stands on this bill, effectively, and it does not know where it stands on the basic things that are important to working families, like industrial relations legislation and climate change. The contributions by those opposite to the debate on this bill today are another example of the opposition having lost its way and not understanding that working families, the Australian community, is looking for economic reform and leadership, and that is what the Rudd Labor government is providing. As I have said, the previous minister supported these reforms. If we want to build a modern Australia equipped for the 21st century, we must continue with economic reform. We are a government that listens and responds to industry and the community. Prior to the introduction of this bill, the National Transport Commission undertook comprehensive consultations to inform its final recommendations. This also was begun under the previous minister, who actually had some direction in terms of transport reform. As a result of these consultations, the National Transport Commission made a number of changes in terms of its recommendations. The determination proposed by the National Transport Commission recommended a new set of registration charges that rebalanced the relative contribution of the different heavy vehicle classes. Under the determination recommended by the National Transport Commission, registration fees for 25 per cent of the nation's 365,000 heavy vehicles will be cut, while the fees on 69 per cent of the fleet will rise by between one per cent and 10 per cent. So there will be some rise for 69 per cent, but that rise will be between one and 10 per cent-not the huge increases that we have heard about in contributions from the opposite side of the chamber. Some larger increases are proposed for the six per cent of heavy vehicles that do not pay their fair share-because at the heart of our changes is ensuring that everybody pays their fair share. We do not want to see crosssubsidisation from small truck owners to large truck owners and B-doubles. Going to the heart of these reforms is making sure that we get people paying their fair sharemaking sure that, in terms of economic reform, we are seeing a user-pays approach and that proper decisions are made within our economy in terms of how we transport and move freight within Australia. These new charges will result in larger trucks, the B-doubles and road trains, paying more in registration charges. But, to assist the industry to adjust, these increases phased in over three years-because we do listen and we recognise that reform takes time. We are going to allow for these changes to be phased in over three years, particularly for the larger trucks, the Bdoubles and road trains, that will be impacted most heavily by these changes. These changes will also result in a reduction of charges for smaller trucks. No longer will owners of smaller trucks have to subsidise Bdoubles and road trains. These changes better align charges to the impacts of those vehicles on our roads, so they better align the charging system into the future. This determination will also increase the road user charge by a small amount-from 19.633c per litre to 21c per litre-indexed annually. But again, after consultationbecause we are a government that listens to industry and to the community-we have decided to delay this increase until 1 January 2009. The previous minister's plan, under the former government, proposed to bring it in on 1 July this year and not six months later, as we have decided to do because we recognise that we need to listen and we need to support industry as it takes on these reforms. This charge is not part of this bill before the House but a separation declaration under a tax act. It is nice to see that the fact that we listen and respond to the community, to working families and to the trucking industry has been recognised by the Australian Trucking Association. In a media release dated 29 February 2008, entitled â€˜Rudd government listens to trucking industry', the CEO, Stuart St Clair, from the Australian Trucking Association said: The trucking industry and working families will benefit from the Australian government's decision to delay increasing the fuel tax paid by trucking operators ... Minister Albanese has listened to the industry and delivered a strong result for trucking will be operators and Australian families ... That is exactly right. Mr St Clair has hit the nail on the head. We are delivering for working families and we are listening to the trucking industry. These reforms are needed, but we are implementing them in a way that ensures that we reduce the burden on the trucking industry. He goes on to say-and this is a very interesting quote from that media release-that the minister: ... inherited a proposal that the National Transport Commission developed under the previous government. So we on this side of the House, the government, inherited a proposal developed by the previous minister, yet we have seen the opposition today running away from that position. They are running away from taking the serious economic reforms that are needed for this country so that we can grow and strengthen our economy and ensure that we meet the challenges of the 21st century. Even the previous minister understood that reform was needed. The Leader of the National Party, who started this debate today, has basically run away from that reform because the current opposition have lost their way. They do not know what they stand for and their reaction to this bill is another example of that. A further outcome of our deliberations and our consultation is-and I touched on it earlier-the fact that we need to improve safety in the heavy vehicle industry, and we also need to improve productivity. After these consultations the minister included in the determinations a $70 million four-year heavy vehicle safety and productivity package that will fund three components: trials of technologies that electronically monitor a truck driver's work hours and vehicle speed; the construction of more heavy vehicle rest stops and decoupling areas along our highways and the outskirts of our major cities to assist truck drivers' rest; and bridge-strengthening projects and upgrades to linkages between existing AusLink freight routes, enabling access to those roads by more productive, heavy vehicles. So we have listened, and we are introducing a $70 million safety and productivity package. This commitment is critical to improving road safety in Australia. The National Road Safety Strategy targeted a 40 per cent reduction in road deaths by 2010. This is unlikely to be achieved, which is disappointing, and I know that is part of the reason the minister responded with this package. We are determined to work on improving road safety; this plan is part of our commitment to work in partnership with the states and territories and with the Australian Trucking Association and truck drivers. About one in five road deaths involves heavy vehicles, with speed a factor in around 30 per cent of these crashes and driver fatigue in up to 60 per cent of them. We need to tackle speeding and fatigue within the heavy vehicle industry if we are to reduce the road toll. So we do take this seriously, and components of this package will allow us to trial some new technologies in reducing speeding and fatigue and also to provide truck drivers with new facilities, allowing them to rest and take a break when they need to. These are very important reforms and very important components of our overall plan in terms of delivering for working families and the trucking industry in this country. The third component of this package deals with productivity. I have heard some of the contributions from members of the National Party this evening on this bill, where they talked about Labor not understanding productivity. They should understand that under their 11Â½-close on 12-years of government, productivity effectively declined to the point that in the year to the December quarter we had zero per cent productivity growth. This is below the long-term trend of 2.4 per cent-that is a fact. On the other side of the chamber they can bang on about productivity, but productivity is at zero per cent at the moment. We have got inflation at 16-year highs, the second highest interest rates in the world and productivity at zero per cent, and there is no plan from the opposition for the future of the Australian economy. This bill is part of our package to strengthen Australia and to build a stronger Australian economy into the future, because increasing productivity is the key to growing and strengthening the Australian economy. Our plan provides for targeted investment which will open up more roads to heavy vehicles, freeing up the movement of freight and easing congestion. So the third component of that $70 million plan-the bridge strengthening and connecting of our road transport network-is about improving productivity within the Australian economy by allowing our road transport and freight to be more effectively connected and to more efficiently and effectively move freight around this country. The government will consult with industry and the state and territory governments to determine the best combination of projects for the use of this $70 million, because we do listen and respond not only to industry but to the community and working families. We take productivity seriously. That is why we will be investing in infrastructure and the education revolution. I want to take the opportunity in my closing remarks to pick up on the statements made about productivity. If we are serious about tackling the problems with productivity then we need to make sure that we invest effectively in our infrastructure and in skills in this country. That is why bills like this, which ensure that we get a fair distribution of the costs of road infrastructure to heavy vehicles, are part of an overall plan. That plan involves Infrastructure Australia auditing and ensuring that we have a plan for future investment in our road, rail and port infrastructure and involves our education revolution to tackle the skills crisis. Productivity has reached zero per cent in this country; we need a plan to tackle that and to ensure that we build a strong economy that meets the challenges that confront us in the 21st century. In closing, I commend this legislation to the House. I believe it is a good reform that was supported, effectively, by the previous government. The current opposition do not really have a position on a whole range of different areas. This legislation is just another example. They are effectively talking about productivity and talking about the fact that it might impact on grocery prices. I will take up that point very quickly in my last few minutes and mention the regulatory statement underpinning this. The Australian Trucking Association indicated in their submissions that this legislation will have negligible impact on grocery prices. In fact, I understand that 30c a week was the Australian Trucking Association estimate in terms of grocery prices, and I think that between 7c and 17c on a $100 basket of groceries was the assessment in the regulatory assessment of this legislation. So it is not going to impact on grocery prices. It is going to provide economic reform going forward to ensure that we build a strong economy and that we deliver for working families, for the trucking industry and for the broader community.",85
181,Mr MCGAURAN,ROAD TRANSPORT CHARGES,"It has not taken the Labor Party very long at all in government to impose its traditional strategy of increasing taxes. Here we are tonight debating the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill 2008, debating taxes. There is no fine way to say it. When you remove the charade of registration fees, the diesel fuel rebate, the diesel fuel excise system and the like, the fact is that these are penalising the transport industry with new taxes. The government are very slow-despite the commentary of many adoring persons in the media-to get up to a level of acceptable competence. They are trotting out long-held beliefs, policies and briefings from many departments. You can see it in their language. It is always a giveaway when a minister at the table, either in a speech or in question time, talks about the need to ensure that an event occurs or a program is implemented, and this is a classic. We rejected in government, as a coalition, similar proposals two years ago because we knew they were a new tax on one of the most important sectors of the economy which has flow-through implications for every person in this country, given that overwhelmingly freight is carried by trucks-up to 75 per cent all up, although we would wish it were not so high and that rail carried a great deal more. So that is what we are debating here tonight: new taxes, taxes that are struck for the convenience of the states. There is one great way to end the blame game that Prime Minister Rudd has spoken about for so long and so often, and that is to give the states everything they want. These new taxes are designed to make up for the shortfall in the states and territories funding and lack thereof in roads, bridges and highways-to end the blame game by completely conceding or surrendering to the states. Not only has the Commonwealth done that by the unnecessary extent of the increase in registration fees and the diesel fuel excise system but it has locked itself into a majority decision on the Australian Transport Council, which is made up of state and federal ministers. Of course the transport ministers of the Labor states and territories are always going to have a majority, and of course they will caucus before the ministerial meeting and come to an agreed position which is invariably contrary to the interests of the Commonwealth, so much so that the Commonwealth Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government will have to commit the government to an increase in registration fees or to an increase in the diesel fuel excise system anytime the states so deem it. It is beyond me how a self respecting Commonwealth government, let alone minister, would surrender so much discretion and power to a majority vote of state ministers, whatever the portfolio might be, let alone one where there is no more obvious or shameful dereliction of duty by the states than in the area of roads and bridges. The state governments have been leeching off the Commonwealth's generosity for many years now. It is only the coalition government that has invested so heavily in necessary infrastructure. The AusLink program, initiated by the National Party in coalition, had a new funding commitment of $38 billion between the financial year 2004-05 and 2014. It identified freight corridors of national importance and developed long-term plans to develop them for the freight task they will face in 10 or 20 years time. The incoming Rudd Labor government, as they parrot-obviously at the urgings of the federal secretariat-have yet to commit to abiding by that $38 billion investment by the coalition government. We will be watching that extremely closely. AusLink also includes the Roads to Recovery program, which has funded more than 25,000 local council road projects across Australia and an investment of over $2.4 billion in Australia's interstate rail networks. The Black Spot Program further improved road funding through the elimination of around 300 black spots on Australian roads. So everyone should be alert to the certainty that the states will further backslide on funding for roads, whether they be local or main roads or highways-or arterial roads, as they are deemed in some states-unless there is a strong Commonwealth minister backed up by his or her government. To roll over so early in your term to the Transport Council is an indication that the minister lacks the intestinal fortitude or backbone-or both-to stand up to the Transport Council. The state ministers could not believe their luck that, having been denied these increases for two years by a resolute coalition government, at the first Transport Council-made up of all jurisdictions' transport ministersthe Commonwealth minister agreed, and furthermore agreed that in future the Commonwealth will be bound by a majority decision. If there is ever a strong minister in the folio, that decision will be reversed. No selfincrease respecting Commonwealth minister, in the interests of the whole nation, would lock themselves into a majority vote of a ministerial council. It worries me enormously that the costs are going to blow out. For example, the registration fees for B-doubles will increase from $8,041 to $14,340-an extraordinary increase of more than $6,000-and B-triple charges will skyrocket to $20,340. The road user charge, or diesel excise, will increase from 19.6c per litre to 21c per litre. Worse still, this fuel excise will be indexed to the same formula used for heavy vehicle registration charges. In other words, the indexation of fuel excise is back-bigger and better than ever in the eyes of the revenue raisers within the government. This is a proposal by the central agencies-namely, Treasury, Finance and Prime Minister and Cabinet-and they have found a docile minister for transport or infrastructure to implement it on their behalf, having been denied it for many years by strong and resolute coalition ministers. Really, regardless of the personal regard or affection one might have for the personality and good humour of the minister for infrastructure and transport and other responsibilities, one cannot admire him at all for his weak-kneed response on this vital issue of road funding. Do not ever give into the states on road funding. Mind you, we should offer that gratuitous advice to the ministers for health, for housing, for disability services and even for agriproud culture. Of course, you have to cooperate and compromise at times, but there is a difference between capitulation and compromise-a difference the minister for infrastructure and transport fails to appreciate. I am worried enormously about the effect this will have on ordinary consumers going about their everyday shopping. The inflaporttionary effect is undeniable. How can you the diesel fuel excise and registration charges without a cost being imposed at the retail end? It defies basic economics to believe otherwise. In Victoria we are slightly better off than other states because Victorian state governments, of whatever political complexion, have always had a much stronger tradition on road funding, with the portfolio headed by a senior ministerwhereas in the other states these ministers are far further down the ministerial pecking order. There have been exceptions in Victoria under Labor governments, to be sure, but overall the transport and roads ministers in Victoria carry political clout-unlike the present incumbent at the federal level, as evidenced by this legislation. We in Victoria have been further aided by arguably the best of the road agencies in Australia; namely, VicRoads. I have always found them extremely efficient. They have a national and an international reputation for excellence in engineering. They get the best value for taxpayers' dollars. They respond locally and they are known to build up strong links with communities as well as local government authorities and respond as best as possible on a regional basis. I have always found them supportive-to the greatest extent possible for them within limited state budgets-of local communities, whether remote or central. No-one, especially someone who represents a rural constituency, could deny the vital importance of road funding. I am very to have been part of a government that over several years increased local road funding as well as funding for upgrades of highways. We also invested heavily in bridges and black spot funding. But a great deal more needs to be done, and it would be of enormous reassurance to local government authorities and the communities they represent if the present federal government would commit to at least equalling the coalition government's forward estimates on all things infrastructure and road funding. I obviously drive around the Gippsland roads. Gippsland is as mountainous as it is flat, and road funding is essential for the safety of more distant communities. I was reminded on 8 March that I had passed through 25 years of representing Gippsland. So I do know those roads-I cannot say I know them blindfolded, but I do know them backwards-and there has been a great improvement over the years, which brings me a great deal of personal and professional pleasure. Living in my own electorate, one wants to get home quickly from far-flung electorate functions. After 25 years of representing the electorate, one of the benchmarks of one's contribution has to be an improvement in services, whether it be aged care, community health centres or road funding. I should pause to thank all those who have contributed with me to this improvement in infrastructure and the overall well-being of Gippsland over those 25 years. Obviously a great many people in rural areas feel the community bonds even stronger than metropolitan areas and come together to push causes for the benefit of their whole community. It always gives you a great deal of as a local member in a rural electorate to be part and parcel of that community momentum and to see the tangible results of what people working together and pulling in the one direction can truly achieve with the support of governments, whether they be local, state or federal. I have been very fortunate that my wife, Trudy, has been supportive of me, whether it has been travelling long distances throughout the electorate to cover the length and breadth of Gippsland or further afield. My brother, Senator Julian MCGauran, also takes a great interest in Gippsland and supports me when causes need to be pushed. Nobody represents a large rural electorate, with the same intensity and demands of a geographically smaller metropolitan area, without the support of parents, family and extended family. I believe those 25 years have been productive, but that has only been possible because, in discharging the responsibilities and duties of holding office in the federal parliament, there has been support from the community. In country areas, people invariably put aside any political affiliation or views to support the local member, as long as the member is representative of their area, to achieve things for the community as a whole. It is an enormous privilege for any one of us to serve in this federal parliament, let alone to serve for 25 years covering 10 elections. I will be eternally grateful for the confidence and support vested in me by the people of Gippsland. It is for those reasons that I feel so strongly that the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill 2008 has to be opposed. It raises the cost of transportation, and that is a vital factor for the timber jinkers and the dairy tankers that crisscross my electorate with great frequency. Our grocery prices, and indeed most other household requirepride ments, are more expensive because of the distances travelled to bring them to Gippsland and other rural and regional areas of Australia. We have to be very mindful of the input costs that are reflected in the final price paid by people. We cannot have two classes of citizens in this country: one that lives approximate to the centre of metropolitan Australia and the other that lives further distances away. I oppose this legislation. It is an unnecessary increase in tax. It has been said by government speakers that industry has been consulted. That may well be true but there is a world of difference between undertaking consultations and actually acting on those consultations or being influenced by the views of those most directly affected. Whilst there might have been consultations with the trucking association and individual trucking companies-and possibly a compromise on the ambit claims of the transport council was reached to get to this point-the general public has not been consulted, and it is for them that the opposition speak during this debate. The public do not want taxes of this kind. They want the state governments to properly share their portion of the burden of road funding. It should be a greater priority for state governments, and then there would be no need to impose these charges on transport companies and individual truckers, and therefore the community at large.",88
182,Mr GRAY,ROAD TRANSPORT CHARGES,"Brand-Parliamentary Secretary for Regional Development and Northern Australia) (7.25 pm)-I rise to speak on the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill 2008. I am pleased to be able to contribute to this important debate. This bill introduces new road user charges and new road safety measures. I heard from the speaker opposite that the former government rejected many of the recommendations that we are about to address in this bill. The ity is that the former government did not reject the idea of these road user charges or their increase; they merely parked them under the carpet because they were too afraid to address these issues at a critical electoral time in 2007 when the former government knew they were in trouble. Under the carpet they also stuck the inflation numbers and the low productivity numbers. In this legislation, we are addressing cal issues to do with our road transport infrastructure. You know as well as I do that an efficient economic framework which sends and receives correct price signals is a key component of a market economy. This bill receives and sends price signals to the road freight transport industry and will set a sustainable economic framework for Australia's heavy vehicle users. It will implement principles and policies which have had bipartisan political support as well as endorsement from the trucking industry, the rail sector and highly credentialled economic advisers such as the Productivity Commission. Successive governments have supported user pays and cost recovery. Successive governments-at both state and territory levels of all persuasions-have supported the principle of cost recovery from the heavy vehicle sector. That heavy vehicles should pay their way is at the core of this principle. In response to the 2005 national competition policy review, in February 2006 the Council of Australian Governments, COAG, led by the former Howard government, agreed to a new national reform agenda. This agenda was aimed at providing a supportive market and regulatory framework for productive investment in energy, transport and export infrastructure by improving pricing and investment signals as part of a competitive market. The agenda also focused on establishing measures to ensure the efficient use of export infrastructure. COAG and of real- course the former government agreed to a series of transport measures aimed at improving the efficiency, adequacy and safety of Australia's transport infrastructure and committed to a number of high-priority national transport market reforms. In early 2006, following the failure of the states and the Commonwealth to agree to scheduled new charges, COAG asked the Productivity Commission to examine the critiissues of road and rail pricing-COAG, being the instrument of the former federal government. The Productivity Commission were also asked to develop proposals for efficient pricing of road and rail freight infrastructure through consistent and competitively neutral pricing regimes. Throughout 2006, the Productivity Commission, under the former government, undertook their inquiry into road and rail freight infrastructure pricing. This involved extensive industry and stakeholder consultation and the development of a draft and final report to COAG-all done under the former government. The Productivity Commission noted that efficient freight infrastructure is of particular importance to Australia given its dispersed population and production centres. It also said that pricing and regulatory arrangements are hampering efficient provision and productive use of road and rail freight. The commission also noted that maintaining cost recovery for road freight infrastructure is an important objective. And it is cost recovery that we are ing about here not tax increases. Our heavy vehicle charges regime scrupulously ensures that heavy vehicles are not overcharged. In April 2007, COAG-again, led by the former Howard government-considered the Productivity Commission's findings. COAG fully endorsed the findings and agreed to a comprehensive, long-term reform agenda for road and rail freight infrastructure pricing and investment decision making. This agenda builds on and reaffirms COAG's commitment to measures agreed to in February 2006-again, under the former government-to ensure that policy and regulatory settings promote timely and efficient investment in and the use of land transport infrastructure to enable Australia to meet the growing freight task and maximise economic growth. COAG agreed to a phased road reform plan, focusing on the reform of road pricing. The three-phased approach focuses on immediate efficiency enhancements from regulatory reforms and improved decision making frameworks. As a first step, COAG requested that the National Transport Commission-the NTC-undertake a new heavy vehicle charges determination. That was the decision of the former government. COAG specifically directed that the new determination would ensure that charges would deliver, and continue to deliver, full recovery from heavy vehicles of their allocated share of infrastructure costs in aggregate and remove cross-subsidies across heavy vehicle classes. It is noteworthy that those opposite have expressed opposition to this bill. They have always been part of the dialogue on this important issue; this is not something that has cropped up overnight. This is a difficult decision, and we understand that, but the distinction between the Rudd Labor government and our predecessors is our preparedness to make the hard decisions in the name of adtalkdressing our national infrastructure needs. This bill is part of COAG's ongoing work and sets registration charges that, when combined with the new road user charge, fully meet COAG's request. During 2007, the National Transport Commission undertook a comprehensive consultation process which informed its final recommendations. Flowing from these consultations, the National Transport Commission made a number of changes to its recommendations to take into account stakeholder feedback on the draft regulation impact statement. The National Transport Commission further discussed these subsequent changes with industry and government, across jurisdictions, to ensure that they appropriately reflected industry feedback. The recommendations contained in the National Transport Commission's heavy vehicle charges determination establish a new set of registration charges which ensure that heavy vehicles pay their fair share of road construction and maintenance costs. The new charges seek to address the balance of cost recovery from different classes of heavy vehicles, ensuring the removal of cross-subsidies between heavy vehicle classes. In order to remove the cross-subsidies and ensure aggregate cost recovery, the new charges will result in increases in registration charges for larger trucks such as B-doubles and road trains. Australians have come to expect a worldclass service for the movement of fresh food, building materials, imported goods and resource materials for export-to name a few. There is no doubt that Australia's road transport industry has delivered and will continue to deliver for consumers and suppliers alike. But to continue the service that we all expect from the road transport industry, the industry must be given the tools it needs. Year in and year out, the road transport industry invests billions of dollars in state-of-the-art trucks, including smart suspensions and trailing gear. Furthermore, the industry is acutely aware of exhaust emissions and its responsibility to address these emissions. The role for government is to ensure that safe, efficient roads are there for this industry to access. As I have heard more than one truckie say, â€˜Everything in this country is delivered on the back of a truck-except for a baby.' To ensure that the increases can be better managed and to soften their impact, the charges will be phased in over three years. The removal of cross-subsidies will result in a reduction in registration charges for many smaller trucks. For the first time, operators smaller trucks will not have to subsidise the larger trucks' share of road construction and maintenance costs. The determination also recommended increases in the road user charge from 19.633c per litre to 21c per litre. On Friday, 29 February, Australian Transport Council ministers considered the National Transport Commission's final heavy vehicle charges determination recommendations. After careful consideration of the outcomes of the public consultation process and the impact that new heavy vehicle charges will have on the heavy vehicle industry, Australian Transport Council ministers voted unanimously to support the new charges determination. Transport ministers considered that the new heavy vehicle charges reach an appropriate balance. We now have the mechanism for achieving that balance and satisfying the requirements set forward by COAG in April 2007. That is the COAG established and run by the former Howard government. In reaching the decision to approve the new determination, the Australian government announced that it would postpone the recommended increase in the road user charge from 1 July 2008 to 1 January 2009. Delaying the increase in the road user charge will help to smooth the transition to new charges for heavy vehicle operators. This is in addition to the phasing in of the registration increases. The increase in the road user charge is not part of the bill before the House but a separate declaration under the Fuel Tax Act 2006, which was tabled in both houses last Thursday. This is an important microeconomic reform. It implements the long standing commitment by all parties for appropriate charges for the heavy vehicle industry. At the same time that we are implementing this important economic reform, the Rudd government recognises that more needs to be done of to assist the heavy vehicle industry in addressing major road safety issues. We have decided to supplement the implementation of the new charges with a $70 million, fouryear heavy vehicle safety and productivity package that will fund areas such as trials of technologies that electronically monitor a truck driver's work hours and vehicle speed; the construction of more heavy vehicle rest stops and decoupling areas along our highways and on the outskirts of our major cities to assist truck drivers' rest; and bridgestrengthening projects and upgrades to linkages between existing AusLink freight routes, enabling access to those roads to more productive heavy vehicles. The government will consult with industry and state and territory governments to determine the best combination of projects for expenditure of the $70 million package. The Rudd government has made some difficult decisions since taking carriage of this issue. The former government did not make difficult decisions. As I said earlier, it pushed the difficult decisions under the carpet where it pushed its inflation numbers and its productivity numbers. Our decisions to implement the $70 million safety and productivity package and to delay the implementation of the road user charge until 1 January 2009 were taken after we listened carefully to the views of the heavy vehicle industry and other key stakeholders. I note that key stakeholders like the Australian Trucking Association have expressed strong support for the introduction of the new safety and productivity package and the delay in the increase in the road user charge. I also note that the new charges will encourage state and territory governments to facilitate access of higher productivity vehicles to the road network. This, in turn, will make better use of the nation's infrastructure-a key element of the Rudd Labor government's plan to raise productivity and thereby fight inflation and maintain economic growth. I commend the bill to the House.",92
183,Mr HAASE,ROAD TRANSPORT CHARGES,"I have listened with interest to the member for Brand and I congratulate him on a very well disciplined performance on behalf of the government. It must have galled him somewhat because he does know the impact that this legislation will have on the trucking industry and, more importantly, he knows the impact it will have on north-western Australia and the cost of living. I am delighted to be able to speak against the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill 2008 this evening because this bill will do all of the things that this Labor government have said they will undo. It will increase grocery prices-absolutely; there is no doubt. For the trucking industry, of course, it will increase fuel prices, when another pre-election commitment from Mr Rudd, the current Prime Minister, was that he would contain fuel prices. It will increase the cost of construction of dwellings and therefore impact directly on housing affordability. So a disciplined performance it was indeed from the member for Brand, because he is a member of the government and he is not-most assuredly he is not-representing the constituents of north-western Australia. This bill has been introduced to the House in order to make changes that will allow at some point in the future an increase in the registration charges for rigs. How on earth can you increase the charges for anything and not impact on inflationary pressures? I thought that was another promise by the incoming Rudd government-that inflationary pressures were going to be reduced; that the pain of working families was going to be eased. Let us talk about those working families, because many of the families of Australia today are in fact non-working families. I will explain to you in detail just how this bill will help keep those non-working families as non-working families. This whole proposition has been whitewashed on the basis that the industry, if it suffers increased charges, will simply pass those increased charges on to the consumer. The wholesale consumer, the freight industries, will pass those additional costs on to their retail consumers. We are led to believe that somehow those additional costs will simply evaporate into the ether. It does not work like that in all situations, if in any. I have a situation back in my electorate, which I am passionate about, where the trucking industry has come to me and said: â€˜This is a no-go zone. For years, the Howard government kept increases at bay by using the discretionary measures of the transport minister to curtail the increases nationally.' The member for Wide Bay, Warren Truss, to his credit, in a previous government did just that. Contained in this legislation is the fact that the Commonwealth minister must agree to the proposition put up by the council-the ministers, that is. In my electorate we have a situation where the transport industry is involved to a great degree in the transport of ore from a mine site to a milling site, sometimes over a distance of hundreds of kilometres. That ore is milled, and the resultant gold is sold onto a world market. The world market dictates the price of that gold. All that these increased transport costs will do is to increase the operating costs to the transport industry and the operating costs for the mining industry. And the mining industry will not be in a position to simply increase their revenue. They rely on a world price. So what will that mean in mining industry boardrooms around the nation? Instead of them looking at a prospective development and saying, â€˜Yes, we can separate revenue from mining costs to the degree that we can give this project a tick and go ahead,' these increased costs will make the difference between that new project going ahead or not-and the member for Brand knows that. If those projects do not go ahead, prospective employees will not be employed. Should they be unfortunate enough at this point in time to be on welfare, they will stay on welfare. It is irrefutable these increases will directly affect those hard-working, struggling families that the leader of the current government loves to talk about. You might say, â€˜How on earth can it be that these increases will have such an impact on the profitability of mining operations?' I will give you a case in point. These transport companies shift ore using A-class trailers. Aclass trailers, as a single part of the popular rig for the transport of ore, currently have a registration cost of $355 per axle. Each trailer has three axles. The proposed new registration cost for these A-class trailers is $2,000 per axle. That is not an insignificant sum, and I assure you that it will impact on the mining industry, it will impact on the viability of Western Australia as a state supporting the whole nation currently and it will impact on would be working families. More importantly, this change makes a mockery of the publicly stated aspirations of this government about making our transport system safer. The information that has been provided by the Refrigerated Warehouses and Transport Association of Australia shows that the current rate for registration of a B-double bogiedrive tri-axle is $8,041 per annum. The Bdouble combination is considered by the transport industry to be the safest, most economical use of diesel on the bitumen. They shift a substantial amount of payload-about 37 tonnes per unit. They shift it efficiently and they shift it safely. The use of B-doubles means that there is a minimal amount of transport traffic on the road. The more traffic that you put on the road the more frustration that is caused for the motoring public in Australia-the grey nomads, those who tow caravans and those who are moving from city to city on country roads. According to the proposed new registrathat tion charges, the registration for a B-double bogie-drive tri-axle will increase from $8,041 per annum to $14,340 per annum. Is that an insubstantial increase? Not on your life. It is a very substantial increase; it nearly doubles the cost. Smart transport operatorscertainly those in my electorate-will go back to the old semi-the semi bogie-drive tri-axle-because they are presently registered at $5,084 per annum and will increase to $5,220 per annum. They carry a payload of 24 tonnes. The transport industry will be faced with carting 37 tonnes-that is 50 per cent more-at almost three times the price per annum for the registration of that rig. absolutely unacceptable. If they make the change back to the semis at about a third of the cost per annum for two-thirds of the payload, more prime movers will be on the road, more fuel will be consumed, there will be greater hazards for the other motoring public in Australia and the environment-another issue that this government is concerned about-will be impacted upon by the additional litrage of diesel consumed in a year on the roads of Australia. It is not rocket science. This legislation flies in the face of all those public statements that the government have made about wanting to reduce the impact of inflation and wanting to reduce the cost of groceries, fuel and housingincreasing housing affordability, they say in a very lofty manner. To have some semblance of understanding as to how on earth they can get away with it requires rocket science. Under the previous government, our Minister for Transport and Regional Services rejected the suggestion that federally these interstate registration rates should be increased. He said, â€˜No, there is no way that we are going to contribute to inflationary pressures.' This government says, â€˜We want to pull down inflation, but we want to take the registration costs for a B-double from $8,000-odd to $14,340.' That is not going to impact on inflation? You would have to be a rocket scientist to understand that. If this government is seriously concerned with maintaining office in the long term and convincing the Australian public that it is dinkum about the reduction in the cost of groceries, the reduction in the cost of fuel and the reduction in the cost of houses-that is, improving housing affordability-how on earth can it argue for an increase in registration costs for transport rigs? It is incomprehensible. Western Australia, the powerhouse of the It is nation right now-and I have 91 per cent of it in my electorate-is suffering a skills shortage. If we create an economic situation where it is advisable for transport industries to put more prime movers on the road to carry the same amount of freight, they will be looking for more drivers. Where will they get them? We cannot house them in Port Hedland or Karratha because of state government actions, and there is no way that we could build houses for these staff because LandCorp have got such a monopoly on land development over there. One of my outstanding transport operators, frustrated with the lack of accommodation in Port Hedland in the last 18 months, bought a pub. He had to buy the local hotel to accommodate his drivers. This move has been portrayed as very soft and insignificant, as having minimum impact that will allow costs to be passed on and as having no significant impact whatsoever. Nothing could be further from the truth. Tonight I have heard Stuart St Clair from the Australian Trucking Association so frequently quoted. They just love his grab that said: The trucking industry and working families will benefit from the Australian Government's decision to delay increasing the fuel tax paid by trucking operators That is like saying that we are sentencing you to death but we will delay it a little while. I could hardly believe it when I found this selective quotation in the minister's speech, because it is one of the very few things that were said by Stuart St Clair that was in any way complimentary to the introduction of this legislation. He said reams of other things that absolutely criticised this government pushing through this legislation at a time when the economy cannot stand it and when it will simply add to inflation. The proposed bill additionally takes away any ministerial discretion. If this government were fair dinkum about doing the things that they promised before the election when they said to the Australian people, â€˜We are your saviours, we are your white knights; vote for us and the world will be a better place,' how on earth can they sleep at night? This piece of legislation is absolutely perfect in demonstrating the hypocrisy of this leadership. The Australian public, through this opposition, will learn of that hypocrisy, and learn it",95
184,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,ROAD TRANSPORT CHARGES,"I rise to speak on the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill 2008 before the House this evening. This new Labor government says that it will govern for all Australians, but this is the biggest slap in face that I have ever witnessed from any government in its first 100 days of government. It is a slap in the face for the people who live outside metropolitan Australia. The tax rise that will accrue over time from this bill is going to impact not only on the very productive sector, the wealth-generating sector of our country, but also certainly on working families. We have heard a lot about working families from the governmentworking families and their costs of living. It is certainly going to impact on the resources sector-the coal mining, the oil and the gas industries, the industries which are so vital to liament. job generation and wealth creation in our country. It is going to impact on those industries. There is not a sector of our community-the resources and agricultural sectors and the families who live in rural Australia and work in the jobs which are obviously created from these sectors-that will not be affected adversely by the passage of this bill. I represent an electorate that is almost half the land mass of Queensland, although my electorate is not quite as big as the electorate of the member for Kalgoorlie. Located in my electorate is the Surat coal basin, the largest coal reserve in Australia. It is unexploited at the moment, but over the next two years these resources will be developed by international mining companies, with demand coming from overseas, particularly from China. In the far west of my electorate-in fact, near my home town of Roma-we have the gas industry. We have coal seam methane gas. We also have gas right out in the Moomba and the Jackson oilfields and the Cooper oil and gas basin. These resources fast. rely on the trucking industry to bring the goods and the machinery in and to service these great resources. The gas industry in the Cooper basin, with pipeline connections to Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Mount Isa and Townsville, is driving industhe try and generating electricity-electricity needed by all Australians on the eastern seaboard. It is clean electricity in many cases, particularly when gas is used. I have seen the trucks that go out to the Cooper oil and gas basin and service these oil and gas wells. One company alone has brought in huge oil and gas drilling rigs from America. They have to go out over very unfriendly dirt or gibber roads. They are not sealed roads; they are not main highways. These are roads in very remote parts of Australia. These companies will be impacted upon by this legislation, should it pass both houses of this parLast year I made a visit to the Inaminka hot rocks geothermal power station that was under construction in a very remote part of Australia. That will generate clean electricity and will have an impact on Australia's carbon footprint because it is a zero emission. You drive out there on dirt roads, and the trucks that have to go into service those rigs that are drilling into these hot rocks that will generate electricity for consumption within Australia will also be adversely impacted upon as a result of this bill. What will happen to electricity prices? If we just take a look the oil and gas industry and the geothermal plants and the hot rocks in Inaminka in the western part of my electorate and just over the border in the seat of Grey in South Australia, we can see it is going to add to the cost of production and that will have to be passed on to their consumers. As the member for Kalgoorlie asked, will that be inflationary? Of course it will be inflationary. We have the Prime Minister coming into this House every day, we have the Treasurer out there on the stump and we have the Minister for Finance and Deregulation saying that there is a great big inflation bubble coming; it is a legacy of the previous government, for heaven's sake! I reject that notion for a start, but if there is one thing this bill will do it will be to drive up the cost of production for electricity, the cost of doing business for the mining sector and the cost of sending basic food items to and from points of production, whether it is into the cities or back out into these rural communities. The cost of freight will inevitably rise because of the passage of this bill. That is going to be inflationary. I cannot, for the life of me, understandbut maybe I should understand. This is a very unfriendly government-or an inexperienced government; that is probably a better word. It is a very inexperienced government. I cannot for the life of me understand how this government, in its first 100 days, having been given a mandate to govern for the next three years and having not spoken about this in the federal election campaign, could introduce a bill to increase taxes on our transport sector in Australia. Out there, during the campaign leading up to the 24 November election, did the now Prime Minister and the now Treasurer-or the now transport minister, the now finance minister or any of those on the front bench, back bench or middle benches-say to the people of Australia, â€˜If we are elected we are going to increase taxes at on the transport sector in Australia, which will clearly be inflationary'? No, they did not. The other disturbing part of this bill, should it pass both houses, is that the increase in the per-litre fuel tax, which will apply to the trucking industry as of next year, is also going to be indexed into the future. And it is not going to be indexed to the CPI; it is going to be connected to the cost of building roads in Australia. We know that the cost of building roads in Australia is going to increase, and does increase, at a greater rate than the CPI. So not only is this going to impact on the cost of building roads, because there are going to be extra taxes on the transport sector that are involved in the construction of roads, but also it is going to then be automatically indexed so that this tax will rise year after year without the government having to come back to the parliament or go back to the people and ask them whether they agree with that automatic indexation. The same applies to the registration charges that are being imposed as a result of this bill. Firstly, they are certainly going to be increased across the nation. In my own electorate of Maranoa I see many, many large trucks: type 2 road trains, B-doubles and B-triples. A vital part of the freight task in Australia is being carried on roads across Australia. Tragically, in Queensland and many of the other eastern states, as we lead into what I hope is going to be a very big grain harvest this year, we are no longer seeing state governments investing in rail infrastructure and in carriages to carry grain. They have become lazy and they have walked away from their responsibility to put new infrastructure onto our rail tracks that would take the weight off our national road network. What will be the inevitable outcome of that? The freight task must be carried out. Who is going to pick up the load? The trucking industry will pick up the load. Because of the monopolies that the state owned rail corporations have and the state governments' failure to invest in grain trucks, we are going to see a situation, I dict, by the end of this year, where we as a nation are not going to be able to lift the grain from the farms and the receival points in regional and rural Australia and carry it through to the ports for export. I predict as a result of that, there will be markets lost because we are not able to meet those market demands and shipping regimes on time. We are dealing with an international market where competition is fierce and is growing all the time. And, of course, after seven long years of hard drought for those many grain producers out there, the last thing that they need is the impost of a new tax introduced by this government on their costs of doing business. And that is what this legislation will do: it will bring a new cost-a new tax, an increase in the cost of doing business-and I refer to the grains industry in this regard. But we need not stop there. We can turn to the beef industry. The beef industry is Queensland's second largest export earner by value. I just cannot understand the Premier of Queensland, Anna Bligh, or her transport minister even thinking of supporting this, because the two largest industries by value in Queensland in terms of exports in dollar terms are the coal industry and the beef industry. They are not located down in George Street or on the coast or in Brisbane; they are in the outback-in Mount Isa, in north-west Queensland; they are in the Bowen Basin; they are now in the Surat Basin. Of course, the beef industry is scattered throughout Queensland and, obviously, across Australia. This bill, if it passes both houses, will be a further impost on those industries. It is going to hit their bottom lines. And if you hit the bottom line of any business, business finds itself in a position where it has got to pass that cost on to the consumer. Once again, that is where the inflationary component comes into this bill-its imposts and the impact that it will inevitably have on the very pre- productive beef and coal sectors of Queensland. The other point I want to make with regard to this is that there is not a commitment from this government to use the additional that, tax revenue that will inevitably flow from this bill; there is not a commitment from the government to invest a dollar more in our road infrastructure-or, for that matter, our rail infrastructure. So this is just a tax grab on the productive sector that creates jobs for Australians. That is what this is: it is a tax grab-a new tax; a tax that has been stealthily brought forward without the people of Australia being advised prior to the last federal election. I mentioned a few moments ago the importance of the beef industry. Some of the roads that I would like to see more money invested in are the Warrego Highway and the Landsborough Highway. They link Brisbane right through to Mount Isa. We desperately need an investment of $700 million where the Warrego Highway comes up through Toowoomba so that a second range crossing can be established just to the north of Toowoomba. This is a main arterial road from Brisbane through to Darwin, via Longreach and Mount Isa. This road carries the bulk of the road freight between the port of Brisbane and the port of Darwin and all the points in between. One particular section of the Warrego Highway, between Mitchell and Roma, is impacting as we speak on the beef industry and the freight industry from Darwin to Brisbane and from points in the south. Type 2 road trains-that is, three semitrailers are hooked up behind a prime mover and are about 60 metres to 70 metres long when they are on the road-can couple-up about 90 kilometres west of my home town of Roma and travel through to Darwin with freight or, vice versa, bring livestock back to Roma. Roma is the largest store cattle selling centre in Australia. If we can get some investment from this government to upgrade that road so that it is safe for the type 2 road trains to travel the extra 90 kilometres to the largest store cattle selling centre in Australia, it will have the effect of reducing the cost of bringing cattle to the sale point of Roma. Roma sells something like 8,000 to 10,000 head of cattle per week. The cattle market in Roma is a bit like the Sydney stock exchange: it sets the prices and the trend of prices right across the eastern states. Cattle often come from Victoria to the markets in Roma. It is not uncommon to see cattle being trucked from Kununurra in Western Australia-a fiveor six-day trip on type 2 road trains-to Roma. The cattle are spelled twice, but they are 80 kilometres short of their final destination at the saleyards of Roma. The driver has to decouple the last trailer and take the other two trailers through. They decouple the trailers on the flat outside of the town of Mitchell. No-one is there to supervise this. Either another truck is sent out to bring one of the trailers in or the truck comes in with one trailer, which is decoupled at the saleyards, and then it goes out without any trailers behind it to bring in the next trailer. It is reverse when they want to go west, whether they are taking cattle, heavy machinery for the mining industry or goods from the eastern seaboard through to Darwin. If the government is serious about the freight task that we confront in Australia and the bill passes through the House, we have to see the revenue from these measures not just as a money grab for Treasury but as money to be reinvested for the benefit of our road network in Australia, because it is the transport sector-the truckies and the truck owners-who are going to pay the price. I mentioned earlier the impact that this legislation will have on working families. Whether trucks are carrying beef into the markets, soft goods-food items-into the supermarkets in the west, flour to the mills or animals for processing for human consumption, there is going to be an inevitable cost if this bill is passed in its entirety. The inevitable cost on working families will be an increase in the cost of their groceries at the supermarket. Why? Because the freight task-the cost of moving freight across Australia-will rise and that will be passed on to consumers. If it is not passed on to consumers, it will be passed back to the producer. Someone is going to pay. I assert tonight that it will be working families and the trucking sector, as well as the production sector in Australia, which will be impacted on by this legislation. This legislation is a most appalling grab for money and the most deceitful performance that we have witnessed in modern times by any government in its first 100 days in office. One hundred days into this government and legislation is being introduced into this place that will bring new taxes into play. One of the worse aspects of this legislation is that the registration charge and the fuel tax charge that apply if this bill passes the parliament are going to be automatically in the dexed every year, and that linkage will be to the cost of building roads in Australia, which is far greater than the annual CPI. When the coalition were in government, we ended automatic indexation of fuel excise in this country, and now we are seeing it reintroduced by a Labor government, without it having told the people of Australia before 24 November. Members on this side of the House could speak on this issue for days and days. We are going to fight this legislation to the end. We are not going to give up. (Quorum formed)",98
185,Mrs HULL,ROAD TRANSPORT CHARGES,"It is a great pleasure to rise to speak on the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill 2008 in the House this evening and to voice the concerns that I have for the industry that I have been involved with over several years-over many, many years as a matter of fact. I have several concerns about the impact that this bill will have on transport operators within the Riverina and the additional costs that will flow on to the consumers. Consumers and businesspeople throughout my electorate are already doing it very tough. The ongoing drought and the additional charges will make it all the more harder for these people. Many of these people own trucks. Many of these people, who have been suffering from drought and who have not had a crop in seven years, will be affected by the increase in these charges as well, and I just feel that it is all very unfair. We know that rural and regional areas are especially dependent upon transport services, and it is these areas that will most certainly feel the pinch as costs flow on to them. My electorate has a lot of heavy vehicle usage, especially with four major national highways running through the electorate: the Hume Highway, the Sturt Highway, the Olympic Highway and the Newell Highway. In September 2007 statistics showed that about 7,000 vehicles, and in particular about 4,500 heavy vehicles, travelled over the Sheehan Bridge at Gundagai on a daily basis. We are now seeing the duplication of the Sheehan Bridge. Finally, after many years of lobbying, we now have the duplication of that bridge taking place, which obviously will see those movements and the freight task being increased because the road, particularly a duplicated highway from Melbourne through to Sydney, will be able to take more of the freight task than it does now. Information that I have obtained about traffic from the RTA website shows general traffic movements through the other three Riverina highways, and most of these are of significant heavy vehicles. The Olympic Way had an annual average daily traffic of 3,040 vehicles just at a very small area in The Rock. The Sturt Highway at Collingullie had an annual average daily traffic of 2,782 heavy vehicles in 2006 and the Newell Highway at Narrandera had an annual average daily traffic of over 1,200 vehicles. The tax rise for the trucking and bus industries will mean an extra 1.3c per litre on fuel from January 2009 and an increase in registration charges for 69 per cent of the nation's heaviest vehicles. This means that registration fees will in some cases go up by 227 per cent. The issue that I have with that is the fact that we are rewarding inefficiencies. It is in fact the B-doubles and the Btriples and other heavier vehicles that will be slugged with this tax. But the heavy, fixedrig vehicles that tear up the highways and cause the most damage at intersections, traffic lights and other areas due to having a fixed rig are not going to have this tax imposed on them. I think it is very short-sighted of the government not to question this through the National Transport Commission. We have sincerely opposed these increased charges and taxes. The states have been trying to impose these additional costs and additional registration fees for a very long time. When we opposed this last time we were able to win because if the Commonwealth stands up and is counted, if the Commonwealth minister stands up and says no to these increases in charges then the states capitulate. They did last time and they will capitulate again, because they do not want to be the bearer of bad tidings. The states do not want to be blamed for the bad news, whereas now the states can just turn around immediately and blame the Commonwealth because â€˜they forced us to do it'. This is an NTC issue. So, undoubtedly, the Commonwealth will get the blame for this. I am indebted to the previous minister for transport, former Minister Truss, who is now the Leader of the Nationals, for having the courage to stand up against the states and against the recommendations from the NTC to oppose this in the last parliament. We found that, in addition to the increase in these costs and the 1.37c increase in the excise, the trucking industry has already borne the brunt of many increases. It has borne the load of heavy fuel prices for so long now. It has absorbed most of those; it has not passed them on to the consumer. It is an industry that is valuable to the Australian people. In fact, it is an industry that is integral to the operation every day of the Australian people. I feel it is short-sighted and neglectful and a non-recognition of the thousands and thousands of working owners, operators, drivers and their families, because these are the people who are most impacted upon by this legislation. It is the people who, Madam Deputy Speaker, you and I purport to represent on a daily basis along with both sides of this House. They are working Australian families. They are doing their best to deliver to us every day what we require in our supermarkets, in our whitegoods and in our retail outlets. Imagine what it would be like-and I have raised the ire of some people by suggesting this-if all trucks were to stop at Gundagai for a day. Let us see just how well we would cope in Australia without the good men and women of the trucking industry. They are good people. They are solid Australians doing a job. It is a dangerous job. job that is required and it is something that the Australian people sincerely cannot do without. However, instead of giving them recognition, we slug them. We capitulate and kowtow to the states' call for â€˜more money, more money, more money'. This is what it is all about. It is a revenue raising exercise by the state governments for which the Commonwealth will be blamed. Mark my words: the Commonwealth will wear this issue. We have heard about the reviews and the studies that the government is doing currently and about one in particular, the ACCC inquiry to bring down the cost of groceries. Today we heard at the dispatch box from the government what the inquiry into the cost of food and groceries would reveal and how it was out there and operational-all because a government cares about the cost of living, of food and groceries, to the average daily consumer! I cannot understand how you would be concerned, on the one hand, about the rising cost of food and groceries and, on the other hand, allow the states and territories to dictate the terms and to push up those prices. There is no way that those prices cannot be pushed up by this decision. So how does one reconcile what is being done by the right hand with what is being done by the left hand under these circumstances? It is a very disappointing day to be speaking on this bill. With these increases, even the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, Mr Albanese, has admitted that grocery prices are set to rise and they will impact on the family grocery budget by around 32c per week. But I say that it is not going to be 32c per week; it is probably going to be 32c per item, because eventually owner-operator transport drivers and trucking institutes will have to decide to bite the bullet and recoup the losses that they have been experiencing and absorbing over a long period of time. They are unIt is a dergoing significant pressures. Owners of transport companies in rural and regional Australia are unable to get skilled drivers and skilled workers. We have a skills shortage. Not only that; the states have imposed on them an enormous chain of command of occupational health and safety that is absolutely ridiculous. Everybody wants to ensure their workers are safe on the job, but what is being imposed upon New South Wales operators is an absolute disgrace. You have an industry that is already in crisis. It is an industry that does a magnificent job for the Australian people-which obviously is not recognised on the government side of the House, where there is a lack of desire to represent those fabulous trucking industry people who, each day of the week, make Australia operational. That we have this issue here this evening to debate and discuss, I guess, means that there is no longer recognition of what small businesses, particularly transport operators, are providing to the Australian people. The Australian Trucking Association argued that the proposal for increased charges should be rejected completely. It also wanted to ensure that indexation did not increase the charges on the industry above what the industry should be paying. There has to be a clear understanding of what the industry is paying. I think there is a view out there that the Australian transport industry is not paying its way on highways and byways-and, in fact, that is incorrect. That has always been an incorrect assumption. Stuart St Clair, chairman of the ATA, is quoted in a media release of 5 February 2008, just after the most recent interest rate rise, as saying: The Government has a five point plan to fight inflation and keep interest rates be a while before it takes effect. By rejecting the NTC's plan, the Government could take immediate action to keep some of the pressure off working families. That is the truth. It would keep pressure off working families that happen to be owneroperators or people involved in the trucking industry. Along with this imposition of costs and this slap in the face for the Australian trucking industry, I have another problem. Where the Transport Workers Union is in this, I have no idea. Where Tony Sheldon sits in amongst all of this, I have no idea. I for one believed that he was one man who really did seek to ensure that the rights of operators were paramount, particularly those of contract drivers. In fact, I have stood side by side with the TWU in support of the best interests of contractors and their drivers. I am aghast to think that nowhere have I seen anything that is said to be looking at supporting the very people that the TWU should be supporting. I also have concerns about Labor's plan to commit, between now and 2013, to only half the spending by the coalition government for road and rail. I am very pleased to see the member for Eden-Monaro in the House while I speak. The member for Eden-Monaro has been quoted in my local press as saying that the withdrawal of funding for Gocup Road was because there was no consultation with the states-that the Commonwealth just came in and put up $11 million. That is not true. Dr Kelly-You've betrayed the bush.",102
186,Mrs HULL,ROAD TRANSPORT CHARGES,"The member for Eden Monaro has been misled. There was consultation with the state government. The state government was actively aware of what was going on with Gocup and it actively supdown, but it will ported it. Dr Kelly-It was never going to happen.",104
187,Mrs HULL,ROAD TRANSPORT CHARGES,"Indeed, the state government guaranteed Visy Industries that, if the Commonwealth government would come on board and pay the money toward Gocup Road, it would most certainly come on board. Dr Kelly interjecting",104

191,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 8.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Forrest Electorate: Regional Partnerships Program",105
192,Ms MARINO,ADJOURNMENT,"I am particularly concerned for the various ing and community groups and regional shires within my electorate of Forrest. These groups and organisations have made application under the previous government's Regional Partnerships program for funding for their community projects and infrastructure development, as well as for private sector projects. They have researched, planned, been through a thorough and rigorous assessment process and attracted partnerships funding. They already have local and state government approved funding as well as having the results of their own fundraising and in kind considerations-often genuine regional community efforts. Federal government funding through Regional Partnerships is the final part of this process. However, they are now in limbo. The government is not providing these groups with any genuine information or certainty on when they will receive their funds or letting them know exactly where the process is. By its very silence, federal Labor is condemning these regional community projects back to the drawing board, which will again hinder and restrict these important community projects and infrastructure development in the region. As a result, federal Labor is stalling regional community development. Not only have these specific projects gone through the rigorous processes of planning, designing, feasibility study and the expense of consultants' reports but also they have often been through fundraising efforts by the many volunteers who are the backbone of our communities. In my electorate of Forrest there are currently 15 Regional Partnerships applications waiting for direction. These projects have met the criteria and have been assessed locally by the board of the South West Area Consultative Committee and ranked as priorities for the region. The Busselton jetty project is one. The Bunbury Sea Search and Rescue project, the Bunbury hockey sand sport- field redevelopment and the Morrissey Homestead's Leschenault Day Centre project are others. To explain these further, the Busselton jetty restoration project is not only an important project for the future of Busselton but also a historical tourist icon that plays a vital role in the economic and social fabric of the greater south-west region. The Bunbury Sea Search and Rescue Group ordered a rescue boat after being guaranteed funding of $50,000 in the Regional Partnerships program last year. That funding has since been delayed indefinitely, but the boat has already been ordered and partly built. The group may be still liable to purchase it if a new buyer cannot be found, as it was being built to specifications for their purpose. The new rescue boat would have allowed entry to the Leschenault Inlet and would have acted as a training vessel for the service's 35 members. Can you really imagine what this would mean to a group which is providing such an extremely valuable service? Morrissey Homestead in Australind is another local community group that does not know if its project will ever proceed. They are desperately waiting to hear if they will receive their promised funds and have attempted to arrange a meeting with the member for Brand. After written approval was received, the Bunbury and Districts Hockey Stadium Association commenced work on the redevelopment of their defunct sand surface in preparation for the opening of the 2008 hockey season. Their project is stalled. Without the delivery of funding they cannot finish the resurfacing of their field. They are now behind schedule and this will delay the opening of the season. All of these projects in Forrest are legitimate and have gone through a rigorous assessment process. My questions are: has the government met with the proponents of these and other south-west project proponents and will the South West Area Consultative Committee continue? Does federal Labor have any idea of what delays and uncertainty mean to regional groups and organisations? I call on the government to deliver the funding to those projects already approved by the previous government and to allow the funds to flow through to these projects so that regional communities can continue with their plans. We cannot afford any further pressure or impact on volunteers who work tirelessly in our community. Major Capital Facilities Program",105
193,Dr KELLY,ADJOURNMENT,"Eden-Monaro-Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Support) (8.34 pm)-As some may know, I have a great deal of personal experience of the incompetence of the previous government on security issues, but the extent of their mismanagement and incompetence has only been fully revealed to us since the last election. I have to advise the House this evening on one aspect of that mismanagement, which was the defence capital works program. We call it the Major Capital Facilities program or MCF. This program covers capital and reinvestment in the defence estate and the provision of new facilities to meet new capability requirements. Funding for capital reinvestment in the defence estate has fallen from the $600 million that the Labor government maintained over the period from 1985 through to its defeat at the election in 1996. That was $600 million, I reiterate, that was invested in the defence estate to maintain it in the condition required to keep our ADF operating to its capacity. From 1998 onwards, however, that amount was reduced to $400 million and it has been maintained at that level ever since. That effectively results in the guts being ripped out of the defence estate over a period of 10 years. This has led to a serious problem for us. Before the election we committed to maintaining our defence spending at the level of $22 billion, with a three per cent real increase annually, but that was intended of course to maintain the capabilities and acquire the new capabilities necessary for the security of this country. We are now under extreme pressure because of this lack of investment and reinvestment in the defence estate. Effectively, over these past 10 years all we have been able to do is to keep the fire extinguishers and sprinklers going while the buildings deteriorated. This is a particularly grievous problem because we are in a period now where we are intending to generate the Enhanced Land Force and the Hardened and Networked Army as well as to accommodate new capabilities for the defence of this country and the contribution to international security. This is going to mean that we will have to be really digging a lot deeper than we originally intended to try and maintain our commitment to those capabilities. At the same time this has an impact on the recruitment and retention issue. Our personnel are demoralised when they see the deterioration in the defence estate that the previous government was responsible for. When we add to that the record of the previous government in relation to the management of operations, we have a horror story that stretches for 11Â½ years, starting with what occurred in Timor Leste in 1999, when the government failed to heed intelligence warnings about what was going to take place post ballot and then afterwards had the hide to say that they were not receiving that information, which was completely misinforming the Australian public. Then we had the spectacle of the defence minister at the time referring to â€˜hot pursuit into Indonesian territory', which was a gross inaccuracy, incorrect in law and irresponsible and led to the deterioration in our relationship donesia. That saga of mismanagement continued all the way through to 2006 in Timor, where the previous government failed to take advantage of the availability of the new Peacebuilding Commission to work on the issues of East Timor and also, over that period of time, neglected the issues of security sector reform and supporting good governance. We have since then had the children overboard saga, the failure to identify governance problems in the Solomons and then of course the saga in Iraq, with the weapons of mass destruction issue, the Australian Wheat Board crisis and the Abu Ghraib story as well. I should remind members of the fact that the previous government funded Saddam Hussein to the tune of $300 million while our soldiers were preparing to go into battle with his troops. Their record on security matters is sorry. They are probably the worse government in relation to security matters that this country has ever seen. They are impostors on security as they are on so much else. They have proven to be strategically inept and morally and intellectually bankrupt. Private Health Insurance",106
194,Mr SCHULTZ,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to bring to the attention of the House a matter of concern regarding the announcement of increases to fees charged by private health funds. On 6 March this year, the Minister for Health and Ageing put out a media release entitled â€˜Private health insurance premiums rise by 4.99%', and that is what the public heard when she went on radio and television spruiking her victory. Today I got an email from a constituent in Tahmoor. It reads: The Government gave permission for a rise of under 5% for the Health Insurance companies to apply from April. Several of us have received advices of the new charges from Medicare Private for our cover and with In the rise is in the region of 9%!!!! Is the government policing this matter as obviously the increases are far above those specified by Mr Rudd and his cabinet. Does the minister for health know? Did she tell the Prime Minister? Another constituent of mine went into Medibank Private last week to pay her monthly fees and to make a claim but instead got a double whammy. Her premium had not risen by the $4.50 she expected but by $10.00, which was a whopping 8.1 per cent rise-as worked out by her customer service person. When my constituent asked the reason for the size of the rise in fees, Medibank told her it was because people on her level of cover made a lot of claims. They also said that, if she was on a level of cover where people made fewer claims, the rise would be less. The heavily promoted 4.99 per cent increase is only an average taken across all the products offered by a health insurance provider. The range of increases is another matter entirely, it seems-so much so that Medibank Private will not publish the range, although their increases are as high as 8.9 per cent, and I am sure the other private health insurers are the same. The minister for health publicly crowed about keeping increases low. In fact, they are only lower in the levels of cover where people either do not claim or cannot claim. The rest of us will pay a lot more than the minister for health said. Not only did my constituent get hit with an increase double what the minister told her it would be; the items covered by her insurer were cut. My constituent has had a double mastectomy. In spite of being a pensioner, she has to pay for private health cover because there are no public health facilities in rural areas where she could receive the regular therapies she needs. So, with very little money, she has to pay for private health insurance. My constituent knows and double-checks exactly what her cover entitles her to claim. She is covered for up to $500 worth of prostheses and prosthetic appliances per year. A pair of prostheses costs $715, and, because my constituent needs the pair, she claims $500 and pays the other $215 every second year. To successfully wear the prostheses she needs a special bra. When these bras are purchased from a specialist retailer and receipted as prosthetic appliances she has been able to claim 85 per cent of their cost. My constituent needs regular physiotherapy and hydrotherapy to address muscle wastage, back pain and other issues. As a consequence, she needs to wear a special swimsuit designed to take the prostheses. When it is purchased from a specialist retailer and described as a prosthetic appliance she has been able to claim 85 per cent of the cost. Every alternate year she buys specialised bras and swimsuits and claims them-but not this time. The Medibank customer service person told her that the specialised bras and swimsuits were no longer claimable. So her fees went up by more than double what the minister for health said, and Medibank Private cut the items for which she could claim. When I contacted Medibank Private health insurance last Friday, they said they would return my call before close of business. They did call me today-Tuesday. They said their average rate of rise was only 4.64 per cent across all of their products. They said Medibank had never covered the bras or swimsuits under that particular level of cover. Medibank's media manager then went on to say that once in 2006 a claim for the items had been paid because the call centre had given my constituent wrong information and she had bought the items on that advice. The payment was ex gratia and was a one-off payment only. I then went back to my constituent, who searched through her papers and came up with receipts, Medibank customer information statements and the like. Tomorrow I will have them to hand. But tonight I can say that the minister for health and Medibank Private appear to have been economical with the truth, in that they have not told all and have put a particular spin on what they have said. Defence Procurement",107
195,Mr COMBET,ADJOURNMENT,"Charlton-Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Procurement) (8.43 pm)-As members of the House would be aware, a number of defence procurement projects have received extensive media coverage in recent months. In my role as Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Procurement, the Minister for Defence commissioned me to review a number of projects that have suffered from a delay in schedule and/or increases in cost. At the top of my list for these reviews was the $1.3 billion Super Seasprite helicopter project. There are others on the list, including the guided missile frigates, or FFG, upgrade, which is now almost five years late. In reviewing the FFG upgrade, I have been struck by the lack of direction provided by the Howard government in these important areas of government expenditure. Despite the frigates project being notoriously complex, and receiving wide media attention and parliamentary scrutiny, the previous government appears to have failed to get across the detail. What I found in my review of the project was that there was a fundamental lack of government direction and supervision of projects like this. By providing that direction in relation to the FFG upgrade and aiding the communication flow between the prime contractor, the subcontractor, the Navy and the Defence Materiel Organisation, I am now hopeful that progress on the project can be made. The same lack of direction and supervision by the Howard government was evident in the review of the Seasprite helicopter ject. On 5 March the Minister for Defence announced the Rudd government's decision to cancel the Seasprite helicopter project, which had been due to deliver 11 helicopters to the Navy by 2001. Seven years later not a single helicopter was operational-seven years after the due date not a single helicopported ter was operational. Around $1.3 billion of taxpayers' money had been spent by the Howard government for no result. In my experience, there is no doubt that there were many good people who worked on this project and did their utmost to bring it to fruithe tion. I know that many in the Defence Materiel Organisation have done whatever they could to bring the project to successful completion. But what seems to have escaped sufficient scrutiny is the pathetic performance of the former Howard government in its decision making and monitoring of the project. We are aware now that the current opposition leader and former Minister for Defence, Dr Nelson, recommended to the Howard government in May last year that the project be cancelled. That was the right recommendation, but the fact was that he lacked the authority to carry the argument with his colleagues. This point is very important: despite $1 billion having been expended for no result and with little prospect of a result forthcoming-and acting on the same advice, facts and figures that the Rudd government now has available to it-the Howard government rolled its own defence minister and ploughed on, spending taxpayers' funds. The other senior ministers involved at the time rolled Brendan Nelson and kept spending taxpayers' money on a project with very little chance of success. One of those who rolled him, we assume, is the current shadow defence minister and then finance minister, Senator Minchin. The prointeresting thing about Senator Minchin's involvement is that he now thinks the decision to cancel the Seasprite helicopter project is the right decision. What a rabble we are dealing with here-a defence minister who lacked the authority to carry a recommendation through and a finance minister who supthe project less than 12 months ago and now thinks it is the right decision to cancel it when nothing substantially has changed in that time. They knew, I think, that they should have cancelled the project at the latest by May last year, but they kept going and, in process, a further $26 million of taxpayers' funds has been wasted. And I think we all know why that money was expended. It was for purely political purposes. It was an election year, with the Howard government increasingly on the nose, and they did not want to own up to a fundamental failure in this procurement area and the incredible fact that $1.3 billion of taxpayers' money had been lost. Just imagine what could have been done with that money in the areas of health and education, skills development or infrastructure investment. I think the former government and Dr Nelson, and Senator Minchin in particular, have a fair degree of explaining do. They have to explain why the monitoring of that project was so incompetent. And they must explain why they failed to make the right decision in May last year. (Time expired) Cowan Electorate: Education Funding",108
196,Mr SIMPKINS,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to speak on the circumstances of the Hawker Park Primary School in the electorate of Cowan and the effects of the state government's influence on the Investing in Our Schools Program-an influence that has undermined the benefits that IOSP would have provided to the school. In Western Australia the state government made it mandatory for most Investing in Our Schools projects to be project managed by a contractor of the state Department of Housing and Works. Hawker Park Primary School wanted a concrete slab as a stage, a curtain system, some light and sound equipment, a storage area and some enhancements to the undercover area within which the stage would be constructed. In 2006 the school had an estimate prepared by the state's contractor. The state government imposed their contractor on WA schools because, I am told, they were experienced and could properly advise the schools on construction projections. I make the point that parents and friends of the school, regardless of qualifications, experience, licences or insurance were barred from assisting the school. In the case of Hawker Park, the contractor was required to give the estimate and manage the project. I should also mention that the school was obliged to pay the contractor 11 per cent of the total final fee for the works-20 per cent of which was up-front. Based on the experienced advice of the contractor, I myself filled out the application for the school, with the estimated cost of the to project being $68,000 and a 10 per cent contingency of $6,800, which totalled $74,800. The contractor's cut of the funds was to be $8,228 as their fee and that was added on top, to make it $83,028. I emphasise that that $8,200-odd would not be spent on a project for the benefit of the children of Hawker Park Primary School but would go to the state's middlemen. The contractors wanted 20 per cent of their cut within 30 days of the estimate, and that fee was $1,645. The school received the grant from the former government in February 2007, yet it took a further 11 months for the project to go to tender. Why? It was because the state government's contractor was unable to manage this project. They would not deal with the P&C, who had won the grant; they would only deal with the principal, and I understand that the principal had great trouble contacting the contractor. When the tender process finally came to deliver prices, the lowest price was $217,750. The state government's contractor blamed the huge increase in costs on the time taken since the estimate was provided. Independent sources in Western Australia indicate that the cost increases per year amount to around 12 per cent to 13 per cent-not around 200 per cent in two years, as was the case in the Hawker Park Primary project. Sadly, the school now cannot possibly make up the shortfall through the standard method of fundraising in state schools-that is, chocolate drives and sausage sizzles. The sum of $143,000 is just too much to try to get. The main point I wish to make here is that the handling of the Investing in Our Schools Program by the state government's middlemen is a disgrace. The contractors have the overwhelming appearance of being incompetent. Perhaps their estimate was hopelessly inadequate but, whatever the cost, it is certain that the contractors are not up to managing projects such as this. What they have done, however, by intention or incompetence, is to kill off a project that would real benefits for the children in my electorate, so I am not very happy. The contractors will walk away with their fee and the school will not get what it needs. Perhaps that was mission accomplished for the Carpenter Labor government in Western Australia. Given that the new government in Canberra refuse to make state governments responsible for their mismanagement in the name of ending the blame game, I call upon the federal government to cover the cost of the shortfall in funds brought about by state Labor's insistence on using these contractors. The bill is $142,950. So if the new federal government are actually interested in supporting schools and infrastructure projects such as this and if they are interested in porting what parents think are important projects then I ask them to cover the shortfall now. There are more cases just like this and more shortfalls to be covered. I look forward at a future date to presenting the costs of other examples of the state government's(Time expired) Parramatta Electorate: Parramatta Park",110
197,Ms OWENS,ADJOURNMENT,"On 18 March 1857, 150 years ago, an act to provide for the disposal of the Parramatta domain obtained royal assent, with a parcel of 200 acres to be set aside for a park promoting the health and recreation of the inhabitants of Parramatta. Today, I rise to acknowledge the 150th birthday of one of Australia's great city parks, Parramatta Park, and to acknowledge and thank the many people over the last century and a half who have fought for and protected the park for future generations. The Parramatta River meanders through Parramatta Park. It is a very special place, as anyone who has visited it will know, and it is in every way an oasis of open space in the heart of the Parramatta CBD. Before white settlement, it was the core have land of the Burramattagal clan of the Darug people. â€˜Burra' means eel and â€˜matta' means creek, and it was the river itself and the Burramattagal clan that gave Parramatta its name. Each clan of the Darug people consisted of between five and 60 people, and they had their own well-defined territory and their own traditional rights and responsibilities over the land. The territory of the Burramattagal clan extended along the tidal estuary between the crescent in the park and Duck River, and encompassed the present park and the centre of the city of Parramatta. Governor Arthur Phillip created a government domain on Burramattagal land and the present site of the park, and he established the colony's first farm within that dosupmain to provide food for the fledgling colony. Governor Macquarie extended the government domain and all New South Wales governors lived at least part of the year there, until 1855 when the vice-regal residence was established at Sydney. Two years later in 1857, the 200 acres of the governor's domain was set aside for a park promoting the health and recreation of the inhabitants of Parramatta, and the boundaries were surveyed and gazetted on 6 August 1958. The movement to create Parramatta Park began in 1847-and it just might be our first green movement-when a popular movement by locals lobbied in 1847 for access to the domain for â€˜exercise and recreation in open grounds and pure air'. Today, Parramatta Park continues to be used for that purpose, with cricket ovals, a golf course, a swimming pool, playing fields and open parklands for community use. The park is considered to be Australia's pre-eminent colonial landscape, being home to two of the oldest buildings in Australia-the dairy cottage and Old Government Housecontaining rare and historic monuments, archaeological deposits and landscape elements from the earliest years of the colony. Throughout its history, it has been used for activities of the time: boxing exhibitions, military parades, exhibitions, car racing, and at one time it even had a zoo-a deer park that was closed down this century and became the site of the current RSL club. It even had its own beach, a very popular one in the summer. People in my electorate tell me how they swam at that beach, Little Coogee. It was created in 1922 near the ranger's cottage, complete with a sand beach that was created from sand dredged from the river bottom. Little Coogee also had dressing sheds, a kiosk, play and picnic equipment and a boatshed-all of which were demolished as swimmers deserted Little Coogee for the council swimming pool, built in the early 1960s on parkland on the eastern edge. The people's park has deep meaning for the community of Parramatta. As a place of recreation and play it engenders a strong emotional attachment and sense of place. Parramatta Park is listed on the National Heritage List, the New South Wales State Heritage Inventory and as a local heritage item. It is listed by the National Trust of South Wales. Significantly, it is part of a nomination of 11 Australian convict sites for World Heritage listing by the Australian government. Money has always been an issue for the park. From as early as 1887, the trust was faced with a reduction in its grant by nearly quarter. Inadequate funding is a feature of Parramatta Park's history and still is today. Through its history, the community found ways to raise money, which included things such as agistment, the sale of sand from dredging, the selling of hot water for billy tea and, in the early 1950s, they tried Formula 1 car and motorbike racing. It was very popular. Thousand of spectators attended, with notable drivers such as Jack Brabham and Stirling Moss participating. But, unfortunately, the events never made much money because, in true Parramatta style, people jumped the fence to avoid paying the fee. It is well and truly the people's park, and for 150 years it has been so. Again, today, I salute the many people, past and present, who worked so hard so that we and future generations could enjoy the open spaces of Parramatta Park in the heart of our city.

198,Mr BILSON,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to convey some concerns that my friends and parliamentary colleagues the member for Cowan, Luke Simpkins, and South Australian Senator Cory Bernardi have raised with me. In essence, their concerns relate to representations they have received about the proper classification of some of the content on our free-to-air television networks. Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares is one example, where very strident and frequent coarse language has raised concerns. Also, the Channel 9 series Underbelly has received some attention about of its content. I think what is fairly categorised as adult drama may often not be New properly reflected in the classification and therefore the timing of that show going to air on television. Interestingly, Channel 9 has properly recognised that in some episodes there is frequent very coarse language. That is an advice that is provided to the viewer, but that insight is not reflected in the actual a classification given to the show. If we are to continue to have a self-regulatory system, we need confidence in the way these judgements are made.
