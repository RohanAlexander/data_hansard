1,Mr ABBOTT,BILLS," I welcome the opportunity to speak on this climate change legislation. Let us be absolutely blunt about the bills now before the parliament. This is a bad tax based on a lie and it should be rejected by this parliament. The Prime Minister said yesterday that the question for members of this parliament was: 'Are you or are you not on the right side of history?' Let me say that this is arrogant presumption by a Prime Minister who is on the wrong side of truth. That is the Prime Minister's problem: she is on the wrong side of truth when it comes to this issue. Let us consider the record of this Prime Minister on this subject. This is a Prime Minister-and we know this happened because her predecessor has described this in public-who sabotaged her predecessor at least in part because of her predecessor's desire to bring in an emissions trading scheme. She brought down her predecessor on this issue, and I say to the Australian people: if Kevin Rudd could not trust this Prime Minister, why should the people of Australia trust her on this subject? Not only do we have a Prime Minister who brought down her predecessor in part on this subject, but we also have a Prime Minister who revealed her true position on this subject in a secret memo to the inner cabinet, where she said that direct action would in fact work, that it was capable of bringing our emissions down by five per cent and it was capable of doing that without a carbon price. That is the one spark of truth that we have seen from this Prime Minister on this topic. But having sabotaged her predecessor over an emissions trading scheme, having told the inner cabinet that direct action would work, she then said to the Australian people at the election campaign that what we really needed was a people's assembly to deal with this whole question of climate change. This citizens' assembly was not going to meet, listen to a few experts and then quickly decide what the policy was; this citizens' assembly was going to sit, it was going to deliberate, it was going to keep deliberating and it would not come to a conclusion that would be acted upon by government until there was 'a deep and lasting consensus'. So far we have had three positions from the Prime Minister: first, sabotaging her predecessor over an emissions trading scheme; second, telling the inner cabinet that direct action would work; and, third, a citizens' assembly that would not conclude until 'a deep and lasting consensus' was achieved. Talk about a real Julia and a false Julia; the fact is that when it comes to this subject there seems to be no real Julia because having had all of those different positions we come, finally, to her pre-election statement. I would say her fatal pre-election statement-that 'there would be no carbon tax under the government I lead'. This is the statement that haunts this debate. This is the statement that haunts this government. This is the statement that makes the whole debate we are having fundamentally illegitimate, because this is the very tax that this parliament should not be considering. Let me say this, Mr Speaker: it is one thing to change your mind as circumstances change, it is an entirely different thing to pervert the democratic process of this country by saying one thing before election to win votes and to do the exact opposite after the election to hold onto your job. That is precisely what this Prime Minister has done. What she has not done is the decent, honest thing, which would have been to take a change of position, had that genuinely taken place, to the people at an election. This is a Prime Minister who has from time to time compared this carbon tax to the great reforms of previous governments. She has even compared it to the great tax reform of the former government of the former Prime Minister Mr Howard. But the fundamental difference between the Prime Minister sitting opposite today and the Prime Minister who took the tax reform package through this parliament is that he took it to an election first. If the arguments for the carbon tax are as strong as this Prime Minister says they are, why hide from the people? Why not expose these arguments to the people? I say to this Prime Minister that if she really does want a deep and lasting consensus to be attained in this country, there is one way to do it, and only one way to do it: take it to the people and win an election on it. I say to this Prime Minister: at all, there should be no new tax collection without an election. That is what this Prime Minister should do. If this Prime Minister trusts in the democratic process, if this Prime Minister trusts her own judgment, trusts her own argument, that is what she should be doing-she should be taking this to the people. The whole point of this tax is to change the way every single Australian lives and works. That is another reason that this should be taken to the people. This is not just a minor bit of financial engineering. This is not just, if you believe the government, something to do with the revenue. This is a transformational change. This is something which is supposed to impact on our country not just today, not just next year, not just next decade, but forever. That is how important this is, if the government is to be believed, and this is why it should go to the people first. This tax is all about making the essentials of modern life more expensive. Modern life is utterly inconceivable without fuel and power-without fuel to move us around the country; without power to make our homes, our businesses and our factories work. So, if this tax comes in, as the government wants it to do, we will not be able to turn on our air conditioner or our heater without being impacted by this tax. We will not be able to get on a bus or a train or, ultimately, drive our cars without being impacted by this tax. That is how important, how significant, this tax is. This explains the obvious impact that this tax will have on every single Australian's cost of living. This explains the obvious impact that this tax will have on every single Australian's job. And this explains why it is so necessary for this tax to go to the people before the parliament tries to deal with it. If this parliament is to have any democratic credibility on an issue like this, there an appeal to the people before a decision by the parliament. The longer this debate lasts, the clearer it is that this tax is all economic pain for no environmental gain. On the government's own figures, under this tax there will be an immediate 10 per cent increase in electricity prices, a nine per cent increase in gas bills and a $4.3 billion hole in the budget. That nine per cent increase in gas prices and that 10 per cent increase in electricity prices is what we will get-well, we are not quite sure whether it is what we will get with a $23 a tonne carbon price or a $20 a tonne carbon price because they still have not given us the modelling on this. But once the price goes up to $29 a tonne-or to $131 a tonne, as it is forecast to do on the government's own figures-these prices for gas and electricity just go up and up and up. And that is the last thing that the people of Australia need, given that they have suffered from price rise after price rise in the 3½ years since this government came to office. Let us look at what the Australian Bureau of Statistics tells us. Let us look at the story of price rises under this government. There has been a 51 per cent average increase in power prices. There has been a 30 per cent average increase in gas prices. There has been a 46 per cent average increase in water prices. There has been a 24 per cent average increase in education costs. And there has been a 20 per cent average increase in health costs. All of these prices are going to go up and up and up under a carbon tax. As members opposite are only too well aware, since the carbon tax was first announced at the press conference in the prime ministerial courtyard, hijacked by Senator Bob Brown, and since carbon Sunday, I have been spending quite a bit of my time going around to the workplaces of Australia talking to the workers of this must be country-who, I regret to say, have increasingly been abandoned by members opposite. Just to give you a snapshot of some of the increases that will be faced by the employers of those workers that the Labor Party once represented: Austral Bricks-a $2 million a year additional cost; the Victorian hospital system-a $13½ million a year additional cost; Nolan's Transport in Gatton-a $300,000 a year additional cost. And it just goes on and on and on. This is at a time when Australian business, particularly Australian manufacturing business, is under great pressure. This is at a time when the world financial situation is experiencing unprecedented fragility. And what does this government do? They do not think: 'Now is not the time to add to the burdens on business. Now is not the time to add to the burdens on families. Now is not the time to add to sovereign risk issues associated with Australia.' They do not think any of that. No, they think: 'What we need now is just another big new tax.' On top of the mining tax and all the other taxes that they want to put on us, they want a carbon tax as well. We heard from the Prime Minister yesterday that the carbon tax is somehow going to create jobs. This is a government which sometimes talks about economic credibility. Show me a credible economist, Prime Minister, who thinks that higher prices create more jobs. Show me a credible economist who thinks that higher taxes create jobs. This is not just nonsense; this is nonsense on stilts by a government which has no real understanding of the economy of the real world in which most of us live. This government constantly tells us that the modelling shows most people will be better off. Well, there is modelling and there is modelling. This is a government which says that the modelling of Commonwealth Treasury-and, as I said, it still has not given us the correct modellingshows people would be better off. Well, that is not the only modelling. The Victorian government commissioned Deloitte Access Economics. Their modelling showed that there would be 23,000 fewer jobs across Victoria by 2015 as a result of the carbon tax-and members opposite should listen to this-with the Latrobe Valley, Geelong, Port Phillip, Monash, Boroondara and Whitehorse the worse hit areas. The Victorian government's modelling says that the Victorian economy will be $2.8 billion worse off in 2015 thanks to the government's carbon tax. The New South Wales Treasury modelling-and this was modelling originally undertaken for the New South Wales Labor government when Michael Costa was the Treasurer of New South Wales-predicts that 31,000 jobs will be lost in New South Wales by 2030 as a result of the carbon tax, with 18,500 in the Hunter Valley alone. I say to members opposite representing Hunter Valley electorates: stand up for jobs in your area; stand up for the jobs of your constituents; stop making excuses for a floundering Prime Minister; and stop putting the political interests of this Prime Minister ahead of the economic interests of your constituents. The New South Wales government predicts that state finances will be $1 billion worse off between now and 2014, withlisten to this, Mr SPEAKER - a reduction in gross state product of close to one per cent per year by 2020, and that electricity prices in New South Wales will rise by $498 next financial year as electricity generators pass on the cost of their carbon permits. The Western Australian Treasury modelling predicts that within three years Western Australian households will be paying more the than $2,120 per year for power compared with $1,515 per year now. Members opposite will say: 'They're just the coalition states. What can you expect from modelling commissioned by coalition governments?' Well, let us go to the Queensland modelling. The Bligh government commissioned a report from Deloitte Access Economics, and that modelled that Queensland's gross state product would be 2.76 per cent lower by 2020 and 4.11 per cent lower in 2050 with the carbon tax than it would be without one. That is a five per cent reduction in Queensland's gross state product under the carbon tax. Deloittes predicted a loss of 21,000 jobs in Queensland. And then there is the Queensland Treasury, which anticipates a net loss in the economic value of the state's generation companies of $640 million, all of which ultimately will be passed on to consumers. Nearly all the claims that this Prime Minister is making for her carbon tax are wrong. It is a bad tax based on a lie, and the argument that she is marshalling for this tax is one lie after another. She talks about jobs. A United Kingdom study released in March this year found that for every job created in the renewable energy sector 3.7 existing jobs were lost. A 2009 Spanish study found that for every green job created by subsidies and price supports for renewable power more than two jobs in other industries are lost. Her claims that no-one need worry about this tax because everyone is going to be compensated are wrong, even based on her own figures. Her own figures, in her own carbon Sunday documents, show that more than three million Australian households will be worse off. These are not just rich people. A teacher married to a shop assistant: worse off under the government's package even by the government's own figures. A policeman married to a part-time nurse: worse off, under the government's own figures, thanks to the carbon tax. A single-income family with a child, on the government's own modelling, starts to be worse off from below average weekly earnings. That is what this government is doing to the struggling families, the forgotten families, of Australia. The Prime Minister tells us that we have to introduce a carbon tax to keep up with policies in the rest of the world. Dead wrong. Since Copenhagen, if anything, the rest of the world has been moving against carbon taxes and emissions trading schemes, and in the period in which Australia intends to reduce its emissions by five per cent China is forecast to increase its emissions by 500 per cent and India its by 350 per cent. Let me now come to the heart of my objections to this government's carbon tax proposal: it will not even reduce emissions. Every member of this parliament should go to page 18 of the government's 'carbon Sunday' document, Strong growth, low green pollution: modelling a carbon price. I am looking at the government's own document. Our current emissions are 578 million tonnes. What we are supposed to be doing if we are to reduce our emissions by five per cent on 2000 figures is getting it down to 530 million tonnes. But the government's own figures do not say that we are reducing our emissions by five per cent; the government's own figures say that we are in fact increasing our own domestic emissions from 578 million tonnes to 621 million tonnes. Ms Julie Bishop: What's the point?",17
2,Mr ABBOTT,BILLS,"What is the point? What is the point of all the pain of this carbon tax if our emissions are actually going to increase? But it just gets worse. At a $29-atonne carbon tax, our emissions go up from 578 million tonnes now to 621 million in 2020. It gets worse. At a $131-a-tonne carbon tax in 2050, we do not get an 80 per cent reduction in emissions; we actually get a six per cent reduction in emissions. Our emissions in 2050, on the government's own figures, will have gone from 578 million tonnes to 545 million tonnes. So all of those bold claims in the Prime Minister's speech yesterday-all of that big chest-thumping talk of a massive reduction in emissions as a result of this tax-are utterly wrong and disproven on the basis of the government's own documents. We are not reducing our emissions; we are just engaging in a massive transfer of wealth from this country to carbon traders overseas. That is what is happening under this tax. It will be $3.5 billion in 2020 to purchase almost 100 million tonnes of carbon credits from abroad. It will be $57 billion-1½ per cent of gross domestic product-shovelled off abroad by 2050 to purchase some 400 million tonnes of carbon credits from abroad. The Prime Minister claims that we are all going to get richer and richer under this carbon tax. Again I say to members opposite: if you do not believe me, look at your own modelling document, which says that Australia's gross national income per person will be almost $5,000 less in 2050 with the carbon tax than would be the case without it. So what is the point of this carbon tax? We know part of the point: to satisfy the Greens, without whom this Prime Minister would not be in the Lodge and would not have been able to cobble together a majority after the election. But that is not the only point. Deep in the DNA of every Labor member opposite, I regret to say, is an instinct for higher taxes and greater regulation. And isn't that just what we are getting under this carbon tax proposal-more taxes, more bureaucrats, more regulation, more burdens on the life of the Australian people and more economic pain for no environmental gain whatsoever? As I have been saying right around the country ever since this was proposed, a much better way to reduce emissions, and the better way to reduce emissions is to work with the grain of the Australian people and further encourage the intelligent, sensible things that Australians and Australian enterprises are doing now to reduce emissions. Australian farmers are planting more trees, and they are doing it now without a carbon tax, because they know it is good for our environment and for their agricultural productivity. Australian farmers right now are moving from chemical to organic fertilisers. They are reducing emissions, and they are doing it not because of a carbon tax but because it makes economic and environmental sense. Australian businesses are taking sensible measures to reduce their fuel bills and power bills. Linfox has better trained its drivers and, as a result, its total emissions have reduced by 35 per cent since 2007. Visy are moving from high-emitting power from the Latrobe Valley to power that they are producing by burning the garbage that cannot be recycled. This is not just zeroemissions energy; this is negative-emissions energy, because that garbage would otherwise be emitting not just carbon dioxide but also methane in landfills. They are doing all of this without a carbon tax, and none of this would be easier-in fact, all of it would be harder-with the carbon tax that this government is proposing. Listening to the Prime Minister, you would think Australians have been complete environmental vandals until this government came along with its carbon tax. I can tell the Prime Minister that, because of the environmental decency and economic common sense of Australians and Australian businesses, our emissions intensity is 50 per cent down over the last decade and a half, and all of that happened without a carbon tax. All of that is going to be put at risk by the carbon tax which this Prime Minister there is now wants to put in place. True environmental progress will be harder with a carbon tax. True environmental progress will to be encouraged and facilitated by the direct action policies of this coalition. Let me say that, when it comes to our direct action policies, they are costed, capped and fully funded from savings in the budget. This carbon tax proposal from the government would be disastrous for our democracy. How can Australians continue to trust our democracy when the biggest and most complex policy change in recent history is being rammed through this parliament by the most incompetent government in recent history? It is the biggest and most complex change sponsored by the least competent government in recent times. Not only does this government not have a mandate to do what it is proposing; it has a mandate not to do what it is proposing. That is why this package of bills is so disastrous for our democracy. It is disastrous for our democracy, and it disastrous for the trust that should exist between members of parliament and their electorates. Why are the members for Throsby and Cunningham sponsoring such damage to BlueScope and to the coalminers of the Illawarra? Why is the member for Hunter and the other Hunter Valley members of the government doing such damage to the heavy industries and to the coal mines of the Hunter? How can the Climate Change minister talk to his constituents with a straight face, given what he is doing to them? How can the member for Capricornia want to close down so many mines in her electorate? How can the members for Corio and Corangamite be doing this to the cement industry and to the aluminium industry and to the motor industry of Geelong? What we have from this government is politically, economically and environmentally disastrous. But it is more than that; it is going to turn out to be the longest political suicide note in Australian history.",21
3,Mr DREYFUS,BILLS,"Isaacs-Cabinet Secretary and Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (09:31): It is with great pride that I rise today to speak on the government's Clean Energy Future plan. In my first speech to this House three years ago I spoke about my hopes for this country's future, and I spoke about my belief that we should live in this land in a way that will leave it improved on our passing and not depleted. I spoke about my belief that we have a duty to sustain our land for the sake of our children and our children's children. After decades of parliamentary debate about climate change, we have before this House a plan that has majority support within this parliament, a plan that will cut carbon pollution and drive investment in clean energy technologies and infrastructure, is like solar, gas and wind. It will help build the clean energy future that current and future generations deserve, and it will ensure Australia's continued prosperity while decoupling economic growth from emissions. Put simply, this plan will leave our country improved on our passing and will deliver a better environmental and economic future for our children's children. Central to the government's plan is a carbon price. While climate change science tells us we need to act, economic understanding tells us the most cost-effective ways of doing so-two fields that those opposite appear to have an inability or an unwillingness to grasp. Putting a price on carbon is the most environmentally effective and cheapest way to cut pollution. This is a fact that is well recognised by economists from Australia and around the world and respected institutions such as the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and Australia's Productivity Commission. Releasing carbon pollution is currently free in Australia, despite the catastrophic threat carbon pollution poses to our environment. To tackle climate change, therefore, we need to correct what is routinely called the 'greatest market failure the world has ever seen'. The government's carbon price mechanism sends a powerful price signal to the market that the emission of harmful carbon dioxide into the atmosphere can no longer occur without consequences. It gives effect to Australia's international obligations under the Climate Change Convention and the Kyoto protocol and ensures that Australia is on track to meet its long-term target of reducing net greenhouse gas emissions to 80 per cent of 2000 levels by 2050. And, as we know from the experience of other nations and regions, a constraint on carbon pollution will drive innovation across the economy. It will provide the incentive to find new energy and carbon efficient ways of doing business to invest in new low-carbon products and processes, and it will stimulate the scientific and engineering research that complements our transition to a low-carbon future. Starting at a fixed price in 2012-13 and then moving to an emissions trading scheme, the carbon price will generate incentives to reduce pollution and invest in clean energy, breaking the link between pollution and economic growth. This is what the eminent economist Sir Nicholas Stern calls the new industrial revolution. Under the mechanism, around 500 of the country's biggest polluters will be required to pay for each tonne of pollution they release into the atmosphere. This creates a powerful incentive for all businesses to cut their pollution by investing in clean technology or finding more efficient ways of operating. A price on carbon will also create economic incentives to reduce pollution in the cheapest possible ways, rather than relying on more costly approaches such as government regulation and direct subsidies. These incentives will flow through the economy. A carbon price will make lower polluting technologies, especially clean energy technologies, more competitive and will boost investment in those technologies in this way. Introducing a price on carbon will trigger the transformation of the economy towards a clean energy future. Carbon pricing and climate change policy have been widely debated in Australia for well over a decade, including through no less than 35 parliamentary committee inquiries. The first review of emissions trading by an Australian government was in 1999, some 12 years ago. There was extensive policy work undertaken by the former Howard government, most notably by Peter Shergold, which concluded that pricing carbon was the best approach. The member for Flinders should be ashamed of his current stance. He spoke in 2008-and I am pleased he is here to listen to what he then said about the Howard government's plans for a carbon price. He said: Perhaps the most important domestic policy in recent years has been the decision by the Howard government that Australia will implement a national carbon trading scheme. The task group on emissions trading established by the previous government concluded that Australia should not wait until a genuinely global agreement had been negotiated. It concluded that there would be benefits which outweigh the costs of early adoption by Australia of an appropriate emissions regime. The task group was also firmly of the view that the most efficient and effective way to manage risk would be through market mechanisms. The announcement in September last year by the previous government of a new national clean energy target was another important step towards a comprehensive national emissions trading scheme. Importantly, the coalition pledged to establish a climate change fund to reinvest a substantial proportion of emissions trading revenues in clean energy technology and support for households most affected by the impact of a price on carbon-in particular, low-income families and pensioners. He said, 'We hope that the new government will take up this proposal.' Of course, we have taken up those proposals. In addition, Professor Ross Garnaut has conducted two major reviews on Australia's best policy options for tackling climate change. The government's Clean Energy Future package was developed through a parliamentary committee process, the MultiParty Climate Change Committee, which met for nine months before completing its work in July this year. The federal coalition, the Greens party and the Independents were invited to participate in the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee. Only the coalition declined. Today, from the Leader of the Opposition, we have heard yet more of the misinformation, seemingly wilful ignorance and relentless negativity that, regrettably, we have come to expect from the opposition over the past several months. Moving to a clean energy future will provide new economic opportunities for Australia and its businesses and workers. Opportunities will open up in existing businesses. Jobs will be created in clean industries such as renewable energy generation, carbon farming and sustainable design, to name just a few. The government recognises that it is now time to act, to harness these opportunities. We recognise that if Australia fails to enact this vital reform the costs of tackling climate change will only become greater in the years ahead. Undertaking this reform will ensure Australian businesses remain globally competitive in the decades ahead. The Gillard government recognises that the transformation of the economy to a clean energy future presents opportunities for industry but also challenges. Dynamic and competitive industries are essential for Australia's economy and for jobs. We are a Labor government and our priority will always be jobs. That is why the Clean Energy Future plan includes measures to support industry and jobs. The Jobs and Competitiveness Program will support jobs in high-polluting industries that have competitors in countries where those industries are not yet subject to comparable carbon constraints. Over the first three years of the carbon price the government will devote $9.2 billion of the carbon price revenue to assistance for affected jobs in these industries. This assistance will be in the form of free carbon permits and will shield those business activities from the impact of a carbon price while maintaining incentives to invest in clean technologies, which will underpin their competitiveness as the world moves to price carbon pollution. The Jobs and Competitiveness Program is not the panacea for supporting manufacturing in Australia. Under a carbon price it is essential that the government assists manufacturing directly, in improving energy efficiency and supporting research and development in low-pollution technologies. The government is also helping households and businesses improve their energy efficiency. The government's Low Carbon Communities program will be expanded to provide funding to local councils and communities to improve energy efficiency in council and community-used buildings and to assist low-income households. Turning to the land, the government has excluded the agricultural and land sectors from the carbon price but these sectors will still have opportunities to secure economic rewards under the Carbon Farming Initiative. The farming, forestry and land sectors have as important a role to play in reducing carbon pollution as governments, households and other industries. The Carbon Farming Initiative rewards farmers and landholders who take steps to reduce carbon pollution above what commonly occurs. It works by creating credits for each tonne of carbon pollution which is stored or reduced on the land. The Carbon Farming Initiative legislation, passed in the parliament last month, will commence operation from December this year. It will create a new income stream for farmers and new jobs for rural and regional Australia and will provide strong incentives to identify and implement low-cost methods of pollution reduction. Credits generated under the Carbon Farming Initiative and recognised for Australia's international obligations under the Kyoto protocol on climate change will be able to be sold to companies with liabilities under the carbon pricing mechanism. This includes credits earned from activities such as reforestation, savannah fire management and reductions in pollution from livestock and fertiliser use. People on the land will have an opportunity to earn new streams of income and contribute to the national effort to tackle climate change. The government will initially be investing around $1 billion in land sector measures over the next four years to support the Carbon Farming Initiative to reduce emissions and to maximise the benefits of storing carbon in our landscape. It is resoundingly clear that if we do not reduce carbon pollution the world risks catastrophic consequences from climate change. The consensus among the scientific community is that our climate is changing and that human activity is causing it. In Australia and other polluting nations we must take action to cut carbon pollution if we are to prevent dangerous climate change. We know that fair and effective global action to achieve ambitious emissions reductions is in Australia's national interest. We need to demonstrate that we are willing and able to do our part. The Gillard government is committed to ambitious pollution reduction targets as our contribution to global action. The bills before this House will put in place policies capable of delivering these targets. There is an optimism about Australia's low-carbon future, and it is an optimism shared by many countries around the world, most notably the United Kingdom. That is why the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, David Cameron, wrote to congratulate our government for its announcement of the Clean Energy Future plan. The United Kingdom government understandsregrettably, our political opponents here in Australia appear not to-that the future of the 21st century lies in a low carbon economy. Unfortunately, amidst the optimism about Australia's low-carbon future, there skulks the Liberal-National coalition, wedded to old, dirty and inefficient technology, who have perfected the art of obstructionism and the drumbeat of no, no, no. The opposition have spent the previous year in hysterics over the carbon price mechanism. They have attacked the scientists and they have attacked the economists who are urging us to act. They pander to climate change deniers with an extraordinary level of wilful ignorance. As representatives of all Australians we will be judged by our actions. Climate change is a global problem; it is a generational problem. Our strength in the debate as it unfolds over the coming months-the strength of the Gillard government and those who stand with uswill ensure the future prosperity of Australia and ensure that Australia is able to take its place with the other countries in the world who are taking action on climate change. I would urge members of the opposition who believe in this cause, members of the opposition who have publicly supported policies to put a price tag on pollution, to be courageous. We know that almost half of those opposite us support pricing carbon, support an emissions trading scheme. That is the policy that their party took to the 2007 election. That is the policy that their party supported right up to the end of 2009. I say to all those opposite, including the member for Flinders, that now is the time to cross the floor and vote for the Gillard government's plan for a clean energy future. You will be remembered for your actions, as indeed Senators Boyce and Troth are remembered for their action in crossing the floor in the Senate in late",23
4,Mr Hunt,BILLS,Troeth.,27
5,Mr DREYFUS,BILLS,"Troeth, I am sorry.",27
6,Mr Hunt,BILLS,You made a point about remembrance!,27
7,Mr DREYFUS,BILLS,"Yes. From 1 July 2012, Australia will have a carbon price. I call upon all those opposite who wish to see the action we need on climate change to support these bills, as a majority of the members of the House of Representatives and a majority in the Australian Senate will be doing. (Time expired)",27
8,Mr HUNT,BILLS," Let me begin in Hastings, in my electorate of Flinders. Mick Carroll is the proprietor of Carroll's Injection Moulding. It is a firm which, when you include him and his wife, employs six people as of my last discussion with him. Carroll's Injection Moulding is a proud Australian firm-Mick and a number of members of the firm are part of the Mount Martha Fire Brigade-but it has to compete against international imports into Australia. What Mick has told me is a story that has been repeated around Australia. He said: 'I'm proud of the environmental savings we have made within our firms, but the increase in electricity and gas prices under the proposed carbon tax is likely to be the final straw will have to export much of my manufacturing offshore and some of these six workers will lose their jobs.' That is what Mick Carroll has said. That has been the story around Australia in so many places, from so many people, and what it means is that global emissions will not go down but that Australian jobs, investment in Australia and Australian emissions will be exported to China, India, Indonesia and other countries with different regimes. In many cases, the emissions for the projects in question will go up if they are occurring in a less developed environment. So let us begin with the heart of the matter, and that is that this scheme at this time in this form will not reduce Australia's emissions and it will not reduce global emissions, but it will hurt real people with real jobs and it will hurt every Australian who has to pay electricity bills, gas bills and grocery bills. But there is a choice. There is fundamentally a better way than a massive tax on electricity, gas and groceries, and it is an exemplar of the two philosophies in contest in this chamber. One is a philosophy of tax and punishment. The other one is a philosophy of incentive, hope and optimism. That is what we bring to this chamber, that is what we bring to the Australian peopleand, strangely enough, that is what the Prime Minister purported to bring to the last election when she ruled out a carbon tax. In speaking on the Clean Energy Bill 2011 and related bills, I want to proceed in four clear themes: firstly, democratic respect; secondly, the truth about international action and where Australia fits in that; thirdly, the flaws in the tax itself and, in particular, the inelasticity on a relative basis of electricity, the impact on families, the impact on the economy and the true cost in economic terms of what is being proposed here; and, fourthly, the fact that there is an alternative, and I a better way, which is effective, costed, capped and fully funded from offset savings. Let me turn first to the notion of democratic respect. The nature of democracy is that parties take to the people a platform on which they seek election. Their fundamental duty is to outline that platform, to seek a mandate and to implement that platform.",27
9,Mr Oakeshott,BILLS,Rubbish.,27
10,Mr HUNT,BILLS,"There will be moments when it may have to change, but not the fundamental nature",28
11,Mr Oakeshott,BILLS,Rubbish.,28
12,Mr HUNT,BILLS,"I have had enough of you, mate. I have had enough of you, with your performance, coming into this chamber and lecturing people on democracy, when you did not seek information about the mining tax, you did not seek information about water trading, you turned a blind eye to your constituents. So no more cant or hypocrisy. Your electors will no doubt make their own judgment in due course. The nature of democracy is this: we have a duty, we have a responsibility, we have a task, to set out what we seek, to ask for the people's mandate and to implement it. This Prime Minister, not just once or twice but on multiple occasions, made it clear, firstly, that there would be no carbon tax and, secondly, that there would be no pricing mechanism until there was 'a deep and lasting community consensus'. On the carbon tax, the Prime Minister said clearly and absolutely prior to the last election: There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead. We all know about 16 August. We all know about 20 August, the day before the election, when the Prime Minister said: I rule out a carbon tax. That was the Prime Minister's final pledge and pitch to the Australian people to seek a mandate not to do precisely what she is doing today. I seek leave to table the Prime Minister's 13 statements during the course of the election campaign. Leave not granted.",28
13,Mr HUNT,BILLS,"Leave is not granted to table the Prime Minister's 13 statements to the Australian people that she would not introduce any form of carbon pricing until there was a 'deep and lasting community consensus'. That was a statement of principle, that was a statement of belief and that was a statement of commitment. All of this was broken and none of it had to be. The reason it was broken was it was always intended to be broken. It was an act of deliberate deception from the outset. On the night of the election, the incoming member for Melbourne told the Australian people that he would support the ALP. That was before any deal, before any agreement. Every member of this House knows that the Greens were going to support the ALP. That was set out in public on election night. So the Prime Minister's claim that circumstances changed is false. Circumstances did not change. She was always going to have the agreement of the Greens. With that we saw that the democratic respect owed to the Australian people was fractured. The Prime Minister should take this to an election to seek a mandate for a tax, which she ruled out repeatedly prior to the last election. Let us turn to why it matters beyond sheer democratic principle, which itself should be enough to seek an election in order to enact these proposals if the Prime Minister has changed her mind. The international reality sets out the environment in which this policy will operate. It makes it all the more likely that this policy will fail. Let us look firstly at China. Contrary to what the Prime Minister would have us believe, China is going through the fastest growth in human emissions in history. We will see a 496 per cent increase in Chinese emissions between 1990 and 2020. We will see coal consumption grow from 1.4 billion tonnes to four billion tonnes between 2002 and 2015. We will see Chinese emissions grow from 5 billion tonnes to 12 billion tonnes, or seven billion tonnes of growth alone, which is approximately 100 times what this entire bill is seeking to achieve in reductions over the same period from 2005 to 2020 in Australia's net emissions. That is the reality and there will not be a carbon tax with an effective increase in electricity prices on a systemic basis across China. There is no chance of that. I believe all members of this House know that. Secondly, in India, similarly, there will be no systemic carbon tax. We will see a 350 per cent increase in Indian emissions between 1990 and 2020. In the United States a cap-and-trade system, which is their equivalent of a carbon tax, is absolutely dead and buried. The modelling upon which the Prime Minister relies includes an assumption that the United States will have a system which will be a full part of an international trading system by 2016. That is a completely false and unsustainable assumption and no member of the government has been able to point to any evidence in the United States from a legislator, from a member of the cabinet or from White House officials which justifies that assumption. It is an utterly unsustainable assumption. Europe does have an emissions trading scheme but it is a radically different system to what is proposed here. The European system, on a per capita basis, is just more than $1 per person per annum across the economy. The Australian system will be approximately $400 per person per annum. Just over $1 per person per annum in Europe and approximately $400 per person per annum in Australia is radically different. It the difference between a bowling ball and a feather. All of that affects how this tax will operate in Australia. It means that we will simply be sending our emissions, our investment and our jobs offshore. The flaws in the tax itself are these: firstly, it relies upon an assumption that somehow people will either change the demand for or supply of electricity. But electricity, on a demand basis, is inelasticnot absolutely but significantly. New South Wales IPART showed us a 50 per cent rise in the cost of electricity across multiple millions of people over five years-so a massive economic test case-saw a six per cent decrease in per capita consumption. We see it as an incredibly blunt and ineffective mechanism backed by economic history, backed by economic reality, backed by economic fact as found by New South Wales IPART under the previous Labor government in New South Wales. Secondly, there will be no significant change in supply under this proposal, as the government has recognised, because the only way they will try to change supply is by turning to the coalition's approach of direct incentives on a competitive basis to clean up power stations, although they would go further and close them, which we reject. They will adopt the coalition's own mechanism because their approach of trying to tax them will not be effective, because the power stations simply push through the prices. At the heart of their mechanism is an acknowledgement that neither supply nor demand will be changed, which is why they will have to go offshore to purchase their emissions. Their tax will see emissions in Australia increase by 43 million tonnes from 578 million tonnes to 621 million tonnes by 2020. How will they do this? They will go is offshore to buy almost 100 million tonnes of credits from China, from India, from Indonesia at a cost of $3½ billion by 2020. That is money that will go straight from Australia to countries overseas. There has been some debate about whether this will come from taxpayers. Of course it will come from taxpayers in the form of higher electricity, gas and groceries. It will then go to companies that purchase from overseas. It will be Australian taxpayers who will bear the costs of these purchases of foreign carbon credits. The Australian Crime Commission found this year that there was a $5 billion fraud in Norway, a mature country, under the very type of system that this government is proposing and that was in a radically smaller market than the one it is proposing here. So if you think pink batts and green loans were bad, you ain't seen nothing yet. That leads me to the true economic cost of what is proposed here. The true economic cost is very simple. The cost of domestic abatement under this system is more than $160 per tonne of abatement. How does that come about? It is because it is a $9 billion a year tax. We are reducing only 58 million tonnes in Australia-the rest comes from offshore. The effective cost of abatement in Australia is over $160 a tonne. If you take out the 20 million tonnes that they are proposing to save per year by cleaning up power stations using our direct action method of purchasing then you find that the actual cost per tonne of abatement from the tax alone in its economic form is more than $200 per tonne. That is why Nobel economic laureates from the last decade, such as Thomas Schelling, Vernon Smith and Finn Kydland, have declared that a carbon tax is the least effective way of reducing emissions on a cost-effective basis if you want to use an economic instrument. That is the heart of the matter. That we have proposed direct action in the form of a market based reverse tender to buy emissions at the lowest cost wherever they can be found. That is within the Australian context. Every dollar will be spent in Australia. It is costed and it is capped; therefore, that is the amount we will spendnot a dollar more than we have budgeted. This is the difference ultimately between a mentality of tax and spend and a mentality of incentives and creation. That is what we stand for and that is who we are.",28
14,Dr LEIGH,BILLS," Over the past few decades, as we in this place have debated solutions to climate change, climate science has become increasingly unequivocal: the world is warming and human beings are causing that warming. This parliament sits in a city that shares a close connection to the natural environment. The bush capital is particularly vulnerable to climate change. Unchecked climate change over the next five decades could subject Canberra to more high and extreme fire danger days, more frequent droughts, more scorching hot days when elderly people and young kids cannot go outside, and less water in our dams. We cannot blame climate change for any single extreme event but we know that more of them will impose a greater cost to households. Canberra's devastating bushfires in 2003 delivered a damage bill of a third of a billion dollars to what was then just a $16 billion economy. If you increase the probability of extreme fire danger days then you increase the expected cost of bushfires. One way of regarding climate change mitigation is as a form of insurance. I am not in the habit of regularly quoting Rupert Murdoch, but he says: Climate change poses clear, catastrophic threats. We may not agree on the extent, but we certainly is why can't afford the risk of inaction. If you accept that asbestos is very likely to cause malignant mesothelioma and that bad cholesterol is very likely to increase the risk of a heart attack then you should accept that our greenhouse gas emissions are very likely causing global warming. The coalition like to flirt with climate change deniers. Their Western Australian branch recently called for a royal commission into climate change science. But in their official policy the coalition have recently accepted the science and agreed to an emissions reduction of five per cent on 2000 levels by 2020, so the question we in this chamber have to think about is: what is the best way of getting to that bipartisan target? The choice is clear: direct action or a market based approach. The problem is that the coalition's policy is indirect and it will not take action in the most effective way. When you reject a market based mechanism and place your faith in command and control you lose a lot of flexibility. You can see this if you look, for example, at Australia's projections of renewable energy growth in the decade from 2000 till 2010. At the start of the decade experts projected that two-thirds of the renewables growth would come from bagasse and none from wind. By the end of the decade bagasse had contributed less than one-tenth of the renewables increase while wind had contributed nearly half. When you reject the market based mechanism you do not tap the ingenuity of the market. You lock yourself into an inflexible system. We should never forget that a price on carbon pollution is not just a disincentive to polluters but also an incentive to investors and entrepreneurs looking to invest in renewables. Joshua Gans, one of Australia's brightest economists, said about the two contrasting policies: The point is that this game could go on and on with very little impact and possibly negative impact on total emissions. And there is example after example of this. Think of the taxes required to employ all the inspectors and personnel to ensure that regulations are doing what you wanted without unintended consequences. Sure, it can be done but you will need a government that would make Lenin blush to make it happen. Contrast that with a carbon price-by tax or trade. That requires none of this because it hits directly on the problem: emissions create external costs so we need everyone to build that cost into their decision-making. The problem is, as rightwing economist Frederick Hayek pointed out, that no-one has the information required to plan out what individuals might do themselves. By placing the decisions of environmental management in the hands of the people, you can let things work themselves out in a way the heavy-handed Government involvement cannot. He went on to say: I can't parse the dual hypotheses that either the Coalition just deny economic evidence or that they actually want more emissions and handouts to business. Perhaps one of their number can enlighten us. Professor Gans is not alone in favour of an approach which prices carbon and allows business to innovate in their solution. A poll of members of the Economics Society of Australia, released at the July Australian Conference of Economists, found that 79 per cent agreed with carbon pricing and only 12 per cent supported direct regulation. This is not some complicated economic theory. It is based on lessons from first-year economics. The best way of addressing a negative externality is to put a price on it. And it is not unproven theory either. In 1989 when US President George HW Bush proposed the use of a market based mechanism to deal with acid rain, the electricity generators warned that costs would skyrocket. Today, that market based emissions trading program is universally regarded as a success. It achieved its emissions targets at around one-third of the projected costs. Why was it so successful? Researchers found that firms used a variety of approaches to reduce emissions. Some of them retrofitted emissions control equipment. A number switched to cleaner fuels. Others retired their dirtiest generators. Because each firm took the lowest cost approach to abatement, the social cost was minimised. Those opposite used to subscribe to such an approach. In 2007, their election manifesto said, 'A re-elected coalition government will establish the world's most comprehensive emissions trading scheme.' Whenever I speak at schools and universities, I meet young Australians who are optimistic about a clean energy future and want us to get on with pricing carbon. They get the science and they want us to act. Young people can and do make a positive contribution on environmental debates. Indeed, in 1990, one young person argued that a 'pollution tax is both desirable, and, some form, is inevitable'. That young person pointed out that the national interest must be favoured over sectional interests, saying 'even if some of the Liberals' constituents do respond negatively, a pollution tax does need to be introduced to properly serve the public interest'. Who was this young person? It was the member for Flinders, and his remarks were from his law honours thesis. I cite his work not as some cheap political trick in this place but rather as demonstration that there are still some opposite who deep down know that the advice of experts and economists is right, that acting on climate change using the most efficient means possible is the right thing to do. As recently as 28 April 2008, the member for Flinders told a Sydney audience: Perhaps the most important domestic policy was the decision of the Howard Government that Australia will implement a national carbon trading system. But the reluctance of conservatives to listen to the best advice is not new. We know that Senator Minchin, political godfather for many of those opposite, did not accept the scientific evidence on the need to act on smoking or on climate change, which he believes to be some 'vast left-wing conspiracy to de-industrialise the world'. Former Liberal Premier of New South Wales Nick Greiner lamented this approach, saying in 1990: Regrettably, too many people on the conservative side of politics still view environmental consciousness as some sort of leftwing conspiracy Amongst both the Liberal and National Parties there is still a cringe when the environment is mentioned, a subconscious aversion that arises, I believe, from a misconception that there is some fundamental philosophical inconsistency between in environmental consciousness and democratic capitalism. Sadly, more than 20 years on, those remarks have never been more relevant. Recent history, including the Liberal Party's leadership change in December 2009-which is a great example of the fact that tipping points really do matter on the issue of climate change-lays bare this reality. Pricing carbon is in the traditions of capitalism. Business recognises this and has been calling for certainty in this policy area. For example, the Energy Supply Association of Australia called for a well-designed emissions trading scheme back in February 2007. Nathan Fabian of the Investor Group on Climate Change has said: Delaying the introduction of a carbon price is a false economy. We know we must achieve lower domestic emissions, send clear investment signals and support a stronger international agreement. It's time to get on with the job. Like the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, the Clean Energy Future plan that we are debating today has a fixed-price period which, yes, operates like a tax, followed by a floating-price emissions trading scheme. For those who dislike fixed prices, also known as carbon taxes, I have good news for you. After 2015 there will be no carbon tax. Under a carbon price, our economy will continue to grow. More than 1.6 million jobs will be created, jobs in clean and renewable industries, jobs in industries that are yet to develop. The revolution is already taking place. In my own electorate we have students in industries taking advantage of this. Earlier this year I was with the Minister for Resources and Energy-who I am pleased to see in the chamber today-at the Australian National University for a launch of a major project to increase the efficiency of photovoltaic solar cells. The project secured investment from Trina, a Chinese company that is a world leader in global energy. Late last year, my friend Andrew Barr, a member of the ACT Legislative Assembly, and I opened the Sustainability Hub at the Canberra Institute of Technology. That facility allows Canberrans to get practical experience in the latest green building applications, materials and new products for residential and commercial sectors as well as in renewable technologies, like wind and solar. Canberra is already pioneering an electric car grid, with battery charge stations provided by Better Place-and acknowledge the work my friends Evan Thornley and Macgregor Duncan do at that company. The world is also harnessing these advantages and we cannot afford to be left behind. Reviews have been conducted for governments of both persuasions and they have been crystal clear on this fact. Those opposite often deride what is going on in China. China's wind energy industry is projected to top 150 gigawatts by 2020, and that is up from earlier projections of 30 gigawatts. China is introducing emissions trading schemes in some of its largest cities-including Beijing and Shanghai-and is reported to be planning a nationwide trading scheme to commence in 2015. That is right: a nominally communist economy is more committed to the market than the Liberal Party of Australia. In Canada, four provinces-British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebecare partners in the Western Climate initiative which aims to introduce emissions trading in phases. British Columbia's carbon price is already at $25. In the United States, a coalition of eastern states-with a combined population twice that of Australia'sparticipate in an emissions trading scheme covering the power sector. California will start a carbon trading scheme in 2012 and is working with the four Canadian provinces to progressively establish a regional trading market from 2012 onward. International linkage makes economic sense. Climate change is a global problem and we want to get the lowest cost abatement. Japan and South Korea are piloting voluntary emissions trading schemes. South Korea introduced economy-wide mandatory emissions trading legislation into its parliament in April 2011 to commence in 2015 and it is seeking to pass the legislation this year. All European I countries and Australia's top six trading partners-China, Japan, the United States, Republic of Korea, the United Kingdom and India-have implemented or are piloting emissions trading schemes, carbon taxes or coal taxes at the national, state or city level. The fact is the world is acting and Australia has a role to play in that action. In December 2009, Christina Ora, a young person from the Solomon Islands, stood up in front of the world and spoke these words: I am 17 years old. For my entire life, countries have been negotiating a climate agreement. My future is in front of me. In the year that I was born, amid an atmosphere of hope, the world formed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to solve the climate crisis. I am confident we can answer Ms Ora's challenge, that a global solution can be found, that collectively we can stabilise our emissions while allowing economies to grow and, importantly, allowing development that will see millions of people brought out of poverty. The Australian government has been debating acting on carbon pollution since Graham Richardson brought a submission to Bob Hawke's cabinet in 1989 to reduce Australia's greenhouse gas emissions. We have had 35 parliamentary reviews into climate change. I am a proud supporter of this economic reform. This is economic reform that sets our nation up for the challenges of the future. It is the stuff of which Labor governments are made. Labor governments brought down the tariff walls in Australia, Labor governments floated the dollar, Labor governments put in place Medicare and Labor governments implemented universal superannuation. For each of these reforms it has taken a Labor government to harness the prosperity of the future. None of these reforms were uncontroversial at the time of their enactment but all of them have paid dividends and increased our nation's prosperity. I am confident this reform will stand the test of time and secure our clean energy future in the low-pollution world of tomorrow. Mr IAN MACFARLANE (Groom) (10:16): I rise today to speak on the Clean Energy Bill 2011 and related legislation, the Gillard government's latest euphemism for its economy-destroying carbon tax. There is no more significant an issue confronting this parliament at the moment, but not for the reasons the government attempts to fob off on an electorate that is increasingly incredulous that its government is going out of its way to put economic restraints and growth shackles in place that will cost Australians jobs. This is a tax which will destroy Australia's competitive advantage. It will place layer upon layer of costs and red tape on some of our most important and productive industries, from those in the resources sector to those in the manufacturing sector, which are already doing it tough. This tax will drive up the cost of electricity to every home and business in Australia. Every home and business in Australia will pay more because of this tax. It is a tax that will create uncertainty for electricity generators because it will cause substantial devaluation of their assets. It is a tax based on a lie. I listened carefully to the previous speaker as he waxed lyrical about what people want from a carbon tax. He just forgot to mention that this government did not have the guts to actually say to the electorate in the lead-up to the last election, 'Oh yes, by the way, we will introduce a carbon tax because that is what you want.' In fact, they went out of their way to deny that they would introduce a carbon tax. Particularly the Prime Minister and the Treasurer explicitly ruled out a carbon tax, to the point where the Prime Minister of Australia said, in her own words, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' Fast forward to a year later and here we are debating the most job-destroying piece of legislation I have seen in my 13 years in politics and in probably my 56 years of life. I have never seen a government so desperate to stay in power, so desperate to hang on to the blue carpet and the letter that they are prepared to destroy Australia just to sit on that side of the chamber because that is what the Greens in the other chamber tell them to do. This is a disgrace which every Australian will pay for in jobs, income and standard of living. Are we so blind in Australia that we cannot see that for everywhere else in the world being competitive, being able to export your goods at a competitive price and being able to maintain your standard of living are the key issues? Virtually every other nation in the world would love to be in Australia's position and this government is doing everything it can to put Australia in their position, to drag us backwards, to cost us jobs, to introduce a scheme that is going to have a devastating effect on Australia's future. This policy has been built from the rubble of one of the most fundamental breaches of trust with the Australian people after the Prime Minister went back on her key words, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' How can she stand at the dispatch box and say this is good for Australia? If she were so sure of that, why did she not have the guts to say it before the people voted so that people at least had a chance to give her their view? Australians will pay with higher electricity bills because the Labor government either does not care about the living cost pressures or is in Green alliance that it has no option but to ignore the cost of living pressures that this tax will put on Australians. I do not buy that each and every member on the other side of this House can rest easily with this approach. I know the Labor Party, I know how tribal they are, but most of all what I know about this government is that they are desperate to stay on that side of the House and not face the people. So I say there are members on that side who need to muster up their courage when this comes to a vote and vote as their constituents want them to voteagainst this tax. I know what my constituents want. I meet with my constituents regularly, in formal meetings or with a quick chat on the street when I am off to get a cup of coffee, and I read their hundreds, if not thousands, of emails. I cannot believe that those on the other side can so brazenly turn their backs on their constituents, without even the smallest of whimpers or a twinge of unease. I cannot accept that members from regional areas in the Labor Party in particular are prepared to sell out their constituents so greatly, when we all know that it is regional Australia that will bear the brunt of this tax. Since the $23 a tonne carbon tax was announced and the details finally put on the table, after months of policy vacuum, there has been substantial debate about how the carbon tax will affect households and families. But an equally pressing issue is how it will impact on Australia's energy supply and energy security. The answer does not inspire any confidence at all. No matter what the Prime Minister or the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency say to coal companies, the objective of the Gillard government's carbon tax and carbon abatement policy is to reduce Australia's reliance on coal and cut jobs in Australia's so deep with its coal industry. This has implications in particular for Queensland workers and Queensland coal communities, which will suffer a significant downturn if the steaming coal industry is scaled back. Of course, that will have a knock-on effect to the cost and reliability of the electricity supply in Australia because, quite simply, electricity will become more expensive. The coalition believes there is a better way to reduce Australia's greenhouse gas emissions, without crippling Australia's economy, costing us jobs and lowering our standard of living. One of the key components of the Gillard government's carbon tax is the $5.5 billion compensation package for electricity generators. Yet nearly all that money will go to Victoria and South Australia, and the generators in New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia will get no compensation at all. The O'Farrell government in New South Wales have stated that the cost to that state alone will be in the vicinity of $5 billion, the reality is that that loss in Queenslandalthough the Queensland Labor Premier, Anna Bligh, has not come out with a complete figure-would have to be close to that same figure, $5 billion. Even the figure she has given, $1.7 billion, is still a substantial amount of money. No matter how the Queensland government tries to downplay it, there is clear evidence from two reports released last month that Queensland will be hit hardest by this carbon tax. It has been interesting to watch Premier Anna Bligh try to take two bob each way. She is a good enough politician to know what this is going to do to Queensland. She knows, as she travels around Queensland, what people are saying, but she is trying to support a Prime Minister who is in desperate trouble and desperately trying to appease her alliance partners, the Greens. Anna Bligh knows that in an economy so dependent on energy and resource industries, like Queensland, the Treasury modelling says that the state's gross product will be 3.5 per cent lower because of this tax by 2049-50. Another report, from Deloitte, shows that, based on a carbon tax of $33 a tonne, economic growth will fall by 4.11 per cent by 2050. That is the impact on the economic growth, but of course the central feature of the carbon tax is that it will increase cost of living pressures and the cost of operating expenses for homes and business by forcing up the price of energy used in those homes and businesses. The chief objective of a carbon price is to make activities that generate a lot of greenhouse gas emissions more expensive. The theory is that that will encourage a switch to alternative activities that generate fewer greenhouse gas emissions. But that switch is already happening. Households and businesses in Australia are doing everything they can to lower their energy footprint. and Also, this tax is not big enough to actually cause a change in fuel use by electricity generators. As the Minister for Resources and Energy, who is sitting opposite me, knows, the price is something like $60 a tonne. Is that really the agenda of this government-to get in a small tax and then treble it? We have much to worry about as we look at what is going to happen under this government's proposed tax. The fact remains that, whatever happens, there is going to be a change in Australia's electricity base, and in Australia's coal fired electricity base the change will be the greatest. By the government's own modelling, by 2050 coal fired electricity will contribute just 10 per cent of Australia's energy mix-down from 80 per cent. We know what that means. We know it means less coal being mined and it means fewer jobs. But, most of all, it means higher cost electricity. This is all pain and no gain. When the Greens, the Labor Party's alliance partners, demonise large industry and call them 'big polluters', they are actually talking about industries that quite literally power our economy, put electricity in our homes and employ tens of thousands of people. I hear those opposite wax lyrical about clean, green jobs. Well, show me where they are, prove to me the sustainability of those jobs, and show me an example of an economy that has done that. How about we look at Spain-four to six jobs lost for every green energy job created. Is that what this bill is going to do to us? Is that the damage this carbon tax is going to wreak on Australia? I think so. This mirage, this petticoat, of green jobs that they keep trying to the hide behind, is not real. The jobs of building solar panels and wind turbines are going to go to those countries already dominating in that field, and, as we all know, Australia is not one of them-in fact, China is. While I mention China, we need to be mindful, of course, that China's emissions are going to rise by 496 per cent on their 1990 levels by 2020. The world changed at Copenhagen. To use the words of the previous Prime Minister, there was a fork in the road. The rest of the world went the way of common sense, maintaining their economies, keeping the cost of living down and keeping their industries competitive and Australia has gone this way-and this way ends up in oblivion. That fork in the road is what changed my view on whether or not we should have a carbon trading scheme now. I certainly never supported a carbon tax, but if we want to look at where we are now and where we are heading, while the rest of the world fights to keep their economies afloat we are blindly sailing off to the left by ourselves. There is no-one else in sight-no other country with a carbon trading scheme anything like the magnitude of this, no other country putting at risk its industries, no other country inflicting costs on households. Here we are, led by the Gillard-Brown government, sailing into oblivion as Australian industry is destroyed by this tax. The coalition does have an alternative. As well as that alternative, there are numerous ways-smart ways-by which we could lower emissions, if we were really serious about lowering emissions by 150 million tonnes a year. Just get out of the way of the LNG industry and do everything we can to promote it so that it lifts its exports to 60 million tonnes. The offset in coal being burnt in Japan, China and Korea would more than amount to a global saving of 150 million tonnes. Let's employ new technology like what I saw yesterday, where municipal waste is no longer dumped in landfill but used to generate electricity and thus save the emissions of methane gas. This has long been a spend-and-tax government. This tax is going to add to the tax list that they have compiled but in the process, unfortunately, will destroy Australia's future.",30
15,Mr NEUMANN,BILLS," I note the previous speaker has had a road to Damascus conversion on this issue, because he previously was the chief negotiator for the member for Wentworth when he was the Leader of the Opposition. He said on Lateline on 30 April 2007, displaying his climate change scepticism: … what I am sceptical about is some of the more exaggerated claims that are being made about the connection between CO2 emissions and climate change. So he is another sceptic. He has gone from being a supporter of taking action on climate change under the opposition of the member for Wentworth to being someone who is an Abbott devotee and a paid-up member of those people who listen to the ravings of British hereditary peers who present the case that we are engaging in some sort of communist conspiracy. It is a nonsensical attitude that they are undertaking. The absurd, misleading and deceptive aspects of the coalition's scaremongering on this issue are appalling. It is deceitful, unprincipled and reckless. Once again the Leader of the Opposition demonstrates he is unfit to lead this country, and we saw that on display again today. He was a senior minister, and so was the member for Groom, in the Howard government. They went to the election in 2007 advocating a carbon pollution reduction scheme. We saw, for example, that the Leader of the Opposition had position after position after position on this issue. He is a complete weathervane. He came in today and talked with such unctuous and righteous indignation about this when he supported this type of arrangement under John Howard when he was the Prime Minister and under Malcolm Turnbull when he was the Leader of the Opposition. He was on the public record on numerous occasions supporting an emissions trading scheme in this country. And now, today, having had this road to Damascus conversion himself, he tries to claim that he now never believed in this sort of thing. This is what the opposition are about: constantly campaigning on fear, never on the facts. In relation to political issues, I did not principally come into politics to advance green issues. In my maiden speech nearly four years ago you will barely find a word in relation to climate change or environmental issues. I got into public life to advance the cause of the Labor Party and the labour movement by ending Work Choices and replacing it with a new, fair, simple and balanced industrial relation system; to build better schools and universities; to improve health and hospital systems in my area and my state; and to fix the Ipswich Motorway locally and create a more sustainable, jobfriendly, healthy and environmentallyeffective community in Ipswich, a fastgrowing area in South-East Queensland. I did not stand for preselection to build some green utopian Jerusalem but to achieve practical and pragmatic outcomes to help families and individuals in Ipswich. My sympathies have always been with the jobs of law-abiding timber workers and their families rather than lawless people who chain themselves illegally to trees. But my decision to support the Clean Energy Bill 2011 and its associated bills comes not from some green, pantheistic passion but from two sources: firstly, my faith; and, secondly, the facts. First, I believe we are placed by providence on this planet and have a responsibility to care for it. We are stewards or custodians of it. We need to give the planet the benefit of the doubt. Second, I prefer not to respond to the rantings and ravings of shock jocks. I accept the findings based on evidence of the CSIRO, the Bureau of Meteorology and the Academy of Science. I accept the recommendations of reports and reviews by Stern, the IPCC, Garnaut and the Productivity Commission. They tell us that climate change is real, that it is caused by greenhouse gas emissions, that human activity contributes to climate change and that, if we do not act, there are serious adverse environmental, economic and social consequences to our country and our communities. The most environmentally effective and economically efficient way to deal with dangerous climate change is by pricing carbon and by an emissions trading scheme, and that is what we are proposing to do today. The clean energy legislation before us does indeed introduce a carbon pricing mechanism. It is a market based scheme we are going to. In the Labor Party we believe in the market and the national interest, and we believe in the market in the national interest on climate change. But take a look: we have 18 related bills, far more than just a carbon tax. The real issues we are debating are real action on climate change, protection of Australian jobs and assistance with cost of living. The clean energy legislation is part of one of the most significant reforms this country will ever face, and one of the biggest challenges we will ever face is climate change. I challenge those opposite to avoid the trap of mindless nay-saying. It is time to investigate this legislation, it is time to pass this legislation, it is time to act on climate change. Since 1994 we have had 35 parliamentary inquiries, numerous reports and reviews into climate change. I charge that those opposite will not be distracted from the duty they have to act in the national interest. Before us is a raft of legislation designed to transform this nation's future into a sustainable one, to transform the way we live, to sustain the environment, jobs and households. The experts say that since the 1940s every decade has been warmer than the one before and that the 2000s were the warmest decade on record. Australia happens to be one of the world's largest emitters of carbon pollution per capita, equating to about 27 tonnes of carbon dioxide per person. About 30 countries in Europe are already participating in an emissions trading scheme. Ten states in the United States already participate, with California joining next year. Even across the Tasman, New Zealand has an emissions trading scheme. We have heard businesses questioning these reforms locally. Three-quarters of New Zealand's businesses were sceptical, according to surveys in 2008, but three years later about two-thirds of them now support the scheme. And China is transitioning to emissions trading schemes in many provinces with hundreds of millions of inhabitants. China invests more in renewable energy than any other country and has some of the most ambitious emissions targets in the world. This legislation of associated bills will deliver a reduction of 160 million tonnes of carbon pollution by 2020, the equivalent of taking 45 million cars off the road. But we are going to protect jobs, as we did during the global financial crisis, because that is in our DNA. Unlike what the member for Warringah, the Leader of the Opposition said in relation to this issue, we supported jobs during the global financial crisis and we are going to create jobs in the future. Treasury tells us there will be 1.6 million jobs by 2020 and 500,000 jobs by the middle of 2013. Those opposite tell us this legislation is bad for the economy, but I say it is time to act. is not bad, it is important for the economy. They say it is not time to do this, but they have always said it is not time to do this because they are always nay-sayers. Whether it was universal superannuation, the pension or Medicare many years ago, they have fought reform tooth and nail. They always have, they have always been on the side of reaction. They are not liberals, they are reactionaries. We have created under our watch 750,000 jobs since being elected in 2007. We are going to support jobs in high-polluting industries with competitors in countries where those industries do not yet have comparable carbon constraints. Over the next three years we will devote $9.2 billion of the carbon-pricing revenue to assist those industries and to help jobs in those industries most affected. This includes $300 million to help transform the steel industry, $1.2 billion to support the coal industry, $1.2 billion to clean energy technology and manufacturing. The jobs and competitive program we are undertaking will support activities in those areas that generate about 80 per cent of emissions in the manufacturing sector. They say all politics is local, and I want to talk about one of the major employers in my area, JBS Australia. They are the largest meat-processing company in Australia. They will certainly be among the top 500 polluters, mainly because of the power they use. The largest meat-processing plant is in Dinmore, in my electorate of Blair. I can assure you that JBS Australia is already acting to reduce its impact on the environment. In Dinmore they have invested millions to develop ways to recycle water, to minimise waste and odours, to minimise the amount of power they use. The water they release back into the Bremer River is much cleaner than the water already in the river. The Dinmore plant is an example of best It practice in meat processing in Australia, if not the world. This is a company that will take advantage of the food and foundries investment program, worth up to $150 million in the food processing industry. They will be able to apply for grants to support them and other businesses as they invest in research and development. The carbon-pricing mechanism will not apply to 9,971 small businesses currently operating in Blair, in Ipswich and the Somerset region. These small businesses will not have to monitor carbon pollution or electricity use. They will not have to fill in one additional form as part of their reform package. This government recognises the contribution of small business, with over two million businesses employing about five million Australians. The government is legislating to make changes to benefit business with tax reforms designed to improve cash flow while allowing small businesses to depreciate assets more quickly, while reducing compliance costs, and by simplifying depreciation rules. I ask again: when is a good time to introduce this legislation? When is a good time to act on climate change? It will cost us more if we do not act. I can assure you, Deputy Speaker, we have a responsibility to the Australian people to act, because a coalition government could not and would not act and procrastinated for 11½ years under John Howard. What we know is that the coalition continue to flip and flop on issue, salivating slogans as the Leader of the Opposition goes around the country, whipping up fear, when in reality their plan would cost people in my electorate and across the rest of the country about $1,300 a year. That is right: families and communities would pay, not big polluters. The difference between us and them is that big companiesthe big polluters-pay and the community is supported and assisted under our scheme. Under the coalition's scheme the community pays and the big polluters and their supporters get subsidies and assistance. It is once again a demonstration that the coalition is not on the side of the market or small business or families and individuals. They will not create jobs. Their plan will not work. As the member for Wentworth said: it is the plan you have when you do not want to have a plan. This accords with what they did in the last election and since then: their failure to respond to the Queensland floods and come up with the savings they needed, their failure in relation to their costings before the last election-the $11 billion black holeand the $70 billion budget black hole that they have also talked about. The depth of the gap between their promises and Australia's fiscal reality-not to say action on climate change-is stark. The coalition would tax every man, woman and child in this country in relation to climate change. And they have not ruled out cuts to pensions and the cuts that we will make to taxes. We will give assistance in my electorate. Of the 53,000 taxpayers in my electoratetaking in most of Ipswich and all of the Somerset region-about 47,000 taxpayers will receive a tax cut, and 40,000 of them will receive a tax cut of a least $300 a year. Those tax cuts, and the assistance we provide, will be permanent in the future. In my electorate 42,800 people will receive some form of household assistance through this pensions and family assistance payments. About 14,100 of my local families will receive household assistance through family assistance. This assistance provided is greater than the anticipated cost increases caused by the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and the carbon-pricing mechanism. I have 23,000 pensioners in my electorate and I am pleased to say that every single pensioner will be $338 better off while couples will receive $510, and they will be better off. The pension increases will come in next year. They will be better off because we will put a buffer into assist those on low incomes and fixed incomes. We are Labor, and we support those in need. We support them and we want to make sure that they are not left behind. It took the Leader of the Opposition 25 full minutes in his speech to finally talk about the coalition's policy in relation to this. As the member for Wentworth has said, it is not possible to criticise the opposition's policy on climate change because one does not really exist. When it comes to climate change there is only one party that will act right now. Across the country, we need to take steps in relation to climate change. We are the party that will undertake this reform. We are the right people, on the right side of the Speaker's chair, to take action. It is the right package at the right time. It is a bold step. It is acting in the national interest. Other countries-South Korea, China and the USA-are acting as well. This legislation is important for the future of this country and it is in the national interest. (Time expired) Ms JULIE BISHOP (Curtin-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (10:47): The opposition will be opposing the Clean Energy Bill 2011 and associated bills. We oppose a carbon tax. We do so not simply because it represents one of the most breathtaking cases of monumental deceit in modern Australian political Australians well remember that the Prime Minister promised during the last election campaign: There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead. We do not simply oppose it because the Prime Minister has trashed her solemn promise to the Australian people. It is not just because the Prime Minister has broken faith with the public. We oppose this carbon tax because it is bad policy. The government's carbon tax is more about socialism than environmentalism. It is actually a massive redistribution of wealth, motivated by the need to raise revenue rather than to reduce emissions. Indeed, the tax itself will not even reduce Australian emissions. The extent to which that may occur at some point in the future would be due to other action taken, not because of the imposition of a tax. We also oppose this policy because now is one of the worse times to introduce such a damaging economic instrument. This is not economic reform, as the government maintains; this is economic vandalism. Has the government even bothered to scan the world economic environment before proceeding with this reckless scheme? Has the government honestly and objectively assessed the Australian economic environment before proceeding? Since 2008, Treasurer Wayne Swan has brought down successive budget deficits so large that he has been too embarrassed on occasions to publicly acknowledge them. Over his four budgets, the cumulative deficits total $150 billion. The government has borrowed to fund the deficits, and net government debt is now around $120 billion. Our debt ceiling has been lifted by this government from $75 billion to $250 billion. The current budget deficit is $49 billion, yet history. the Treasurer continues with the pretence of announcing a 'return to surplus' several years in advance. This lack of fiscal discipline has made Australia more vulnerable to the impact of a second potential world downturn, and no longer as well prepared to resist external shocks as we were in 2007 and 2008. Australia should be wary of relying heavily on other nations to provide protection from global economic events without first ensuring that our own house is in order. This means cutting wasteful spending and reducing expenditure rather than embarking upon tax grabs from productive sectors of the economy. The threatened increase in the cost of living from a carbon tax is sapping business and consumer confidence. The combined threat of the carbon tax and mining tax is raising serious concerns internationally about Australia as an investment destination. With an uncertain global economic environment likely to remain for some time, the government should abandon its carbon tax and do everything in its power to build greater confidence among consumers and businesses within Australia and those looking to invest here. Let me turn to some other aspects of the government's carbon tax policy. A key element of the policy is designed to ensure that Australia reaches the target of a cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020, not by cutting that volume in emissions from Australia but by purchasing carbon credit offsets from other countries. When asked about the purchase of offshore permits the Prime Minister said: Yes, this is going to be an internationally linked scheme and so it should be. It is alarming that the Prime Minister has given no indication that she is even aware, or has any understanding, of the recent history of the operations of international carbon credit markets. The World Bank reported recently that the international market in carbon credits has suffered a debilitating collapse, and expressed doubt about the ongoing viability of global markets. According to the World Bank, trading in credits commenced after the Kyoto protocol was adopted in 2005 and about $25 billion was generated over the years to 2009. However, that market collapsed to $1.5 billion last year due to ongoing concerns about the commitment of nations after the expiry of the Kyoto protocol in 2012. The United States withdrew from the Kyoto protocol in March 2001 and has indicated it will not commit to any replacement treaty. Russia, Japan and Canada have all stated recently that they will not continue with the protocol after it expires. Last December the European law enforcement agency, Europol, issued a statement about extensive defrauding of the European Union emissions trading system. Europol reported that it had raided several hundred offices throughout Europe and had arrested more than 100 people. In one operation in Italy, the police conducted raids on 150 companies in eight regions as part of an investigation into huge volumes of suspected fraudulent transactions on the Italian Power Exchange. Europol reported five per that raids also occurred in Norway, Switzerland, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Latvia, the Netherlands, the Slovak Republic and Portugal. After all these actions, trading volumes in Europe dropped by 90 per cent. It has also been reported that 90 per cent of trades in the European Union emissions trading system were fraudulent, resulting in a loss to European taxpayers of more than $6.6 billion. The Wall Street Journal concluded that the European Union emissions trading system was not actually a functional scheme at all but was a 'political smokescreen' to enable European politicians to claim green credentials while avoiding difficult decisions on reducing emissions. A former correspondent for the Australian Associated Press based in Port Moresby wrote recently of the 'cowboys' who flocked to PNG in pursuit of carbon credit riches. He detailed the first arrival in 2009 of 'carbon cowboys' offering villagers 'sky money' for the right to use their land in international carbon trading schemes. This led to alleged corruption of local officials who also stood to gain from these get-rich-quick schemes. The Prime Minister of Australia is proposing in her carbon tax policy that an estimated $57 billion of Australian taxpayer funds will be sent offshore to buy carbon offsets to enable Australia to reach Labor's new target of an 80 per cent reduction in emissions by 2050. The logic of her proposal is that Australians should pay people overseas tens of billions of dollars for the right to burn our own coal so as to meet her commitment that the coal industry has a 'bright future'. This is apparently to be achieved through a non-existent international trading system. It is naive at best for the Prime Minister to assume that such a scheme will emerge given the clear signals internationally that major emitting nations are moving away from trading in carbon credits, and the minister in the House at the table knows this. Of more concern is that the Prime Minister appears blithely or wilfully unconcerned about the fraud and criminal activity that has beset trading in carbon credits in developed countries of the European Union, let alone what is taking place in developing countries. Deloitte Australia has warned that carbon credit fraud is 'the white-collar crime of the future'. The Prime Minister must explain clearly, before there is a vote on this legislation, why it is that her carbon tax on what she terms 'the big polluters in Australia' will not meet the emissions reduction target by 2020 and why billions of dollars in taxpayer funds need to be sent offshore in order to do so. How on earth can this Prime Minister ensure that the tens of billions of Australian taxpayer committed to purchasing international carbon credits will not end up in the clutches of carbon cowboys? So we oppose this bad policy because it is full of flaws. We also oppose it because it will cripple the mining sector, which contributes so much to Australia's prosperity. The government accuses the opposition of a scare campaign, but it is the government's shameless scare campaign that should be condemned. The Prime Minister has spent months attacking the 1,000 big polluters-or is it 500 big polluters? Then it was 400 big polluters, and yesterday it was back to 500 big polluters. Tomorrow it could be 1,000 big polluters. She has demonised these Australian companies by claiming that they are causing 'more bushfires and drought', 'agricultural land in the Murray-Darling Basin no longer being able to be used for agriculture' and 'icons like the Great Barrier Reef being threatened'. These examples of her scare campaign run into reams of paper. But the reality is that the government's policies will massively damage the coal sector. In order to meet Labor's latest target of 80 per cent reductions in emissions by 2050, the coal industry cannot continue to operate in this country. Yet the Prime Minister seeks to con coal workers into believing the government wants to support the coal industry's 'bright future'. Given that the vast bulk of our electricity is generated by coal-fired power stations and that coal is by far the largest contributor to Australia's greenhouse gas emissions, the Prime Minister is either unaware of the contradiction in her two positions or being deliberately dishonest. The Prime Minister cannot have it both ways. Either coal mining has a future in this country under her Clean Energy Future or it does not. Her powersharing partners in government, the Greens, have no such difficulty. Greens leader dollars Senator Bob Brown was asked during an interview on 26 June this year whether the carbon tax will close down mines overnight, and Senator Brown, the co-prime minister of this country, said: But that has to be the outcome. You know the coal industry has to be replaced by renewables. Further, the Prime Minister conveniently ignores the fact that the challenge of reducing emissions is a global problem. The atmosphere does not differentiate between emissions released in Australia and those in other parts of the world. Australia is responsible for just over one per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, and as a developed country we should play a responsible role in the global context. However, Australia could reduce emissions to zero yet produce no discernible environmental gain if the major emitters such as China and India continue to increase emissions. Adopting the Prime Minister's flawed logic, companies mining coal which is burned to produce electricity in Australia are big polluters here and must be punished to prevent damage to the environment, yet simultaneously companies mining coal to be burned in power stations overseas and for steel production overseas have a bright future in this country. What the Prime Minister is deliberately trying to conceal from the Australian people is that her carbon tax is designed to make electricity generated from coal increasingly expensive to the point where it virtually guarantees the shutting down of the coal-fired electricity sector in this country. There can be no other way to meet the target of an 80 per cent emissions reduction by 2050. According to the Productivity Commission, Australia is the only country on earth seeking to introduce an economy-wide carbon tax or emissions trading scheme. Despite the glowing references to the European scheme by government ministers, it should be noted that European steel companies recently wrote to the European parliament warning of the competitive disadvantage that would come from unilateral action on carbon pricing and that it could 'increase global emissions as market share is off-shored to non-EU countries with inferior emissions standards'. If other nations such as China, India and, indeed, the United States do not impose an economy-wide carbon tax, Australia is handing manufacturers offshore an enormous competitive advantage over Australian manufacturers. The Prime Minister is wishing and hoping that her leadership will encourage other nations to follow suit. The arrogance behind this policy on a wing and a prayer ignores the lessons that should have been learnt from the Copenhagen climate change conference. Most countries in the world are focused on their own economic development and improving the standard of living for their citizens. Australia's so-called leadership seems hell-bent on destroying the standard of living our country enjoys. The government has been unable to implement the simplest of concepts-pink batts in people's houses, building school halls-without disastrous consequences. We have no faith that this government can competently implement good policy. Imagine what it will do with bad policy and with legislation that runs to 2,065 pages. History will judge this Prime Minister and, even if it is only a footnote rather than a chapter in Australia's political history, it will begin with her broken promise to the Australian people that there would be no carbon tax under a government that she led.  to voice my strong support for the Clean Energy Bill 2011 and 18 related bills before the House. It is an honour to do so with you in the chair, Deputy Speaker Livermore, because I know you feel passionately about this as well. I note that this is the third time. I have risen in the House to speak in support of a system that will set Australia on a course to a clean energy future. Mr Randall interjecting wrecked our previous two attempts to put a price on carbon emissions, although I should commend the member for Wentworth, the Hon. Malcolm Turnbull, for his courage to cross the floor on those occasions and also the two very brave Liberal senators, Sue Boyce and Judith Troeth, who had the courage to also cross the floor in the Senate. I saw them do so on the day that the Greens voted with the National Party against that legislation. Who knows what would have happened if a few more people had had the courage to support the CPRS then, but that is history. We cannot change our yesterdays, but we can influence our tomorrows. Mr Randall interjecting Ms Plibersek: I rise on a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. If the shadow parliamentary secretary for roads and transport is going to continue to interject, you might wish to ask him to listen in silence.",37
16,Mr Randall,BILLS,"Is that a point of order? Ms Plibersek: Yes, it is a point of order.",45
17,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, I take the Minister for Human Services' point. I ask everyone in the chamber to listen to the member for Moreton in silence. Mr Randall interjecting,45
18,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,"The member for Canning will not start up again. Listen in silence please.  ignore him, but I know it is harder for others. The member for Warringah has won some positive headlines lately as a result of his opportunism and opposition, but this debate is not about the polls or tomorrow's headlines; it is about our future. One hundred years from now our descendants will face the consequences of our decisions in this place. I hope they can be proud that as a parliament we put egos, political divisions and ambitions aside to come together as one on this issue of climate change. As the largest polluter per person in the world and the 16th overall, Australia must not shirk from our international responsibility to reduce our emissions. We cannot continue to ignore the science that tells us that excess carbon pollution is causing the climate to change in dramatic and previously unseen ways. Extreme weather events, higher temperatures and deaths associated with those, more droughts and rising sea levels are just some of the things that are happening. In Australia, the driest continent, our environment and climate are particularly vulnerable to climate change. While so much of the political debate focuses on our differences, we should also acknowledge what the major political parties have in common. We have much in common. Both major parties agree that climate change is real and that human activity through carbon emissions is contributing to it. Former Prime Minister Howard took this notion to the ballot box in 2007, and so did I. The Hon. Tony Abbott took this to the ballot box in 2010, and so did I. The major parties agree that now is the time for Australia to act, and the major parties agree that with sluggish global action we need to start with a modest reduction target of five per cent. That is what the major parties agree on. I note that in his speech the Leader of the Opposition was trashing his own five per cent target and in the same breath misleading us about China's growth. The 500 per cent figure for the projected growth in China that Mr Abbott used is completely misleading. The 500 per cent growth figure is for the years 1990 to 2020. Now, I have not been to China for a while, but a little bit has happened in China since 1990. There has been quite a lot of development since 1990, so we are actually talking about the next eight years. It is quite misleading for Mr Abbott to suggest that there will be a 500 per cent increase-totally misleading.",45
19,Mr Baldwin,BILLS,"Madam Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: I would ask you to remind the member that he is to address members by their correct titles.",46
20,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,"Thank you. The member for Moreton will address ministers by their correct titles.  Warringah. Of course, where we differ is on the best way to achieve this target. It that the once great defender of the free market, the Liberal Party, is advocating a centralist state solution through its direction action plan-although, to be honest, I have not heard the Leader of the Opposition or anyone opposite talk about this plan much lately. There is actually a deafening silence on either side of that shrill 'No!' In his 30minute speech on these bills, the opposition leader devoted just 15 seconds to his direct action alternative-and I notice the member for Groom, who followed, was actually a little bit duplicitous there as well. The member for Groom said that this mirage of green jobs is not real, but his own direct action policy document says: The Coalition recognises the potential for clean energy to underpin future employment growth in key regional areas. The member for Groom, based in Toowoomba, needs to read his own document. The Labor government is introducing a market based carbon pricing mechanism. Hearing the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, I was surprised to hear that the member for Curtin no longer supports a price on carbon. Just a few years ago, the member for Curtin said: The Liberal Party has a policy of both protecting the planet and protecting Australia. We support, in principle, an Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) as part of a three pillar approach to climate change which also includes clean energy and ongoing international pressure for reduced world emissions. The opposition also claim that the government does not have a mandate to introduce this legislation. That is complete rubbish. They need to go back to the maths books and work out what a majority is. As far as I can work it out, a majority is 50 per cent plus one. They can either rewrite the is ironic laws of mathematics or rewrite the Constitution, but to suggest that we do not have a mandate is completely erroneous and specious. They seem to think that just because the Leader of the Opposition could not cajole or bully the Independents or sell anything to them to entice them into supporting him that somehow that is a reason that we do not have a mandate. This is the Leader of the Opposition who was elected, I recall, by one vote: 42 to 41. That was in a ballot where there was spoiled ballot paperand how you can spoil a ballot paper when there are only three people in it I do not know-and a sick MP who did not turn up for the vote. But the Leader of the Opposition says, 'Oh, no, no.' I would not for one minute suggest that he does not have the right to be the Leader of the Opposition. My understanding of mathematics is very simple: if you get the majority, you have the support of those behind you, even the 41 who did not vote for you. The Leader of the Opposition wants to bully this parliament into rejecting this bill and waiving our responsibility to secure Australia's clean energy future. As the government, we were elected to govern in the best interests of the Australian peoplefor today and for our future; for our children and our grandchildren- and that is exactly what we are doing. My electorate knows where I stand on action on climate change and they always have. At the 2007 and 2010 elections, I was upfront with my electorate that a Labor government would price carbon pollution-and I am more than happy to show my election materials to anyone who doubts this. The Gillard Labor government made a clear election commitment to put a price on carbon, and that is exactly what we are delivering. I know full well that my community will hold me accountable to deliver on that commitment. Wherever I go in my electorate-at street stalls, at schools, at aged-care homes, at shopping centres and at other places of business-there is strong support for action on climate change. At a community cabinet in my electorate earlier this month speakers on the floor expressed strong support for a carbon tax. The Clean Energy Bill introduces a mechanism to price carbon and to set Australia on a course of global leadership in our response to climate change. From 1 July 2012, 500 of the biggest polluters-those that emit more than 25,000 tonnes of CO2, will pay a charge for each tonne of carbon pollution they emit. For the first three years, the charge for each tonne of pollution will be fixed and will start at $23 per tonne. Then, from 1 July 2015, the mechanism will shift to a cap-and-trade emissions trading scheme. Under this system, the market will set the price. I am sure the Liberal Party remembers what a market is. The fixed price in the initial stages will provide stability and certainty for business and enable a smooth transition to our new low carbon economy. Smart businesses will then be able to focus on reducing their greenhouse gas emissions and thus reduce the costs of production. Those businesses that innovate and reduce their emissions will be the ones ahead of the game, both domestically and globally, and the ones able to pass on the savings to their customers. That is how a market works. Once the market shifts to the flexible price, the government will set a carbon emissions cap to ensure Australia meets its pollution targets. As I said, they are targets that are the same as those set by those opposite. A price ceiling of $20 per tonne higher than the expected international carbon price and a price floor of $15 a tonne will be set in 2015 to ensure that there is no risk to long-term investment in clean technologies. The carbon price will apply to stationary energy, non-legacy waste, industrial processes and fugitive emissions. The price will encourage pollution reductions across all sectors of the economy. It will provide the motivation that industry needs to invest in renewable energies like solar, wind, geothermal and wave and build the momentum needed to get new technologies like clean coal out of the science laboratory and into the real practical solutions to climate change. In turn, these alternative energy industries will be a source of thousands of new low carbon, green jobs. The bills before the House represent a major reform and a massive shift in the Australian economy; we acknowledge that. But they also include appropriate measures to assist households, to protect Australian jobs, to shield trade-exposed industries and to support innovation. Nine in 10 households will receive assistance through some combination of tax cuts and payment increases. On average, the carbon price will cost households $9.90 per week but, to compensate, they will get about $10.10 in assistance. Government payments, such as family payments, pensions and allowances, will increase by 1.7 per cent, well above the average price impact. Obviously, if you just went out yesterday and bought five new air conditioners, you will be disappointed, but if you are energy frugal, you will actually do very well out of this. Of course, government assistance will increase as necessary in the future. The Gillard Labor government will devote $9.2 billion of the carbon price revenue to assist high-polluting, trade-exposed industries. These companies will receive free carbon permits to shield their businesses from the impact of a carbon price while maintaining incentives to invest in cleaner technologies. As the world follows Australia's lead-and that is what will happen as per the commitment at Copenhagen; I know it was not humanity's finest hour, but there were some positive things that came out of it-in moving to a clean energy economy, Australian industries will have an advantage on their international competitors. And we do need that advantage because, in terms of competition and productivity combined with our high wages, we need some advantages. It will be good to see Australian green steel being sent around the world. The Gillard government will invest $800 million in a clean technology program to help manufacturers invest in lowpollution technologies and processes. That is a logical investment, rather than just the Work Choices, low-cost-labour target of those opposite. We will also deliver an additional $200 million over five years to support research and development. This government was elected to act in the national interest. We cannot turn our backs on the science. I am not a scientist, but I must believe the CSIRO. So, when the CSIRO, the Bureau of Meteorology and the Australian Academy of Science stand in agreement with other scientists around the world, we must respond; it would be stupid not to. Now is the time for Australia to act to move to a clean energy future before the task becomes more costly and more difficult. I commend the bills to the House.",46
21,Mr RUDDOCK,BILLS," In a debate of this type, it is very interesting to focus on the comments of the member who spoke before you because they sometimes bring the issues into clarity. What interested me was the member for Moreton's statement that the world was about to follow our lead. This is about Australia leading the worldthat is the comment that was made-and it is, I think, the major difference between the government and the opposition in relation to a price on carbon. I would be encouraged if I believed the world was about to follow our lead, but I see little evidence of that. I am strongly of the view that Australia should play its part in concert with the rest of the world, but there is no evidence, following the Copenhagen conference, that even the enthusiasm that was evident at Kyoto will continue. There is another conference planned, in Durban, and there is no evidence yet that suggests that the major emitters of the world are going to respond positively, with new initiatives, then. It is important to understand, whether or not you accept the science, that Australia produces a little over one per cent of the world's emissions. Our acting alone, our 'leading the world', will not make one iota of difference to climate change, if the evidence is as the member for Moreton suggests. The reason I wanted to speak in this debate was to spell out my own views. I am not a climate change sceptic. I am one who is strongly of the view that, if the evidence is that clear and unambiguous, the world would want to respond and in that context Australia should play its part. I am not of the view that Australia should be trying to set some example which it hopes, after disadvantaging itself in world trade terms, others will want to pick up. It is very interesting to look at the way in which this issue is progressing. Even the participants in the global carbon market have told the World Bank that they are pessimistic about the likelihood of any new, globally legally binding treaty being reached on climate change in the near future. I think that really is the test that we have to look at Union. in relation to these matters as we debate this Clean Energy Bill 2011 and the related bills today. There are commitments that have been made by the opposition, to the Australian people, as to how we can deal with these issues in a modest way, directly, out of the budget, with budget savings, without the imposition of new costs on Australian businesses and industries and without destroying our international competitiveness. This is not a question of Australia being left behind. This is a question of whether we ought to tie one hand behind our back and leave ourselves exposed internationally to the loss of markets for the sorts of products that we are able to produce and allow others to produce goods and services and put them on the Australian market in circumstances where Australian industry cannot compete. So, for me, the major issue with this new tax is that it is the worse possible time for Australia to be destroying its international competitiveness. Let us look at what is happening around the world right at this time. In the United States, there is the possibility of a second double-dip recession. They are looking at unemployment rates in excess of nine per cent and growing. They are grappling with in the order of 27 per cent of their population living in poverty. This is a situation in which the United States is unlikely to be able to lead Australia out of the very difficult environment in which the world is operating. In Europe-and it is in the United States and Europe that people are expecting serious activity in terms of limiting potential change-what are they worrying about at the moment? They are worrying about whether the banks in places like Portugal, Spain, Italy and Greece are likely to survive and whether the governments of those countries are likely to be able to keep them within the European This is a diabolical time for Australia to be tying one hand behind its back in terms of its international competitiveness and to believe that we are able to lead the rest of the world. The fact is that under this legislation Australia's manufacturing industry, which is already under pressure, will face a carbon tax which will increase costs and which our overseas competitors will not have to pay. Jobs in Australia will be going offshore as a result. If other countries were imposing similar taxes or implementing an emissions trading scheme which imposed additional costs, it might not be as difficult or as diabolical for us. But the fact of the matter is, and it has been acknowledged, that in the United States all efforts towards a national cap-and-trade scheme have been abandoned. There are suggestions that in one or two states there may be some initiatives. Europe has an ETS, but it does not cover the whole economy. It provides industries with free emissions permits. I saw reports from Emma Alberici on the ABC about the way in which people are avoiding their obligations under the ETS in Europe. It or raises only about $500 million whereas Labor's carbon tax will raise over $9 billion a year from Australians. The government claims that China is acting to reduce its carbon emissions, but we all know that emissions in China are forecast to rise by 500 per cent by the year 2020. We are pursuing an initiative which will have no appreciable impact upon climate. The CO2 emissions for Australia will continue to increase, according to the climate government's own statements, from 578 million tonnes to 621 million tonnes between 2012 and 2020. Even Professor Flannery, one of those people whose comments they adopt, observed: If we cut emissions today, global temperatures are not likely to drop for about a thousand years. When you are dealing with observations of that sort it is very important to understand that, in the climate in which we are disadvantaging ourselves, we are not going to appreciably change anything when others have not essentially come on board. The other matter I want to deal with is Labor's claims about the nature of this package. This package will clearly disadvantage Australian industries. It will lead to people losing jobs. Labor claims that families will be compensated for the price impact of the carbon tax. I do not know why you impose a tax if you are going to compensate people for it. There seems to be a little disconnect there. We now know that the compensation will be only 50 per cent of the carbon tax revenue going to families as compensation for the direct cost of living hikes. We know that pensioners, self-funded retirees, small businesses and people who struggle to be able to make ends meet will be facing very significant increases in their costs. This $9 billion carbon tax will see, for instance, electricity prices considerably. In Sydney, where I live, we have faced significant hikes already under the former state Labor government. We will see as a result of this measure a 10 per cent increase in electricity bills alone in the first year and a nine per cent increase in gas bills for the same year. ",48
22,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," Order! I beg your pardon, I was reminding the member for Moreton that he should be listening in silence.",50
23,Mr RUDDOCK,BILLS,"Was he being rude? Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. Higher marginal tax rates for lower and middle income earners will be a consequence as well. In addition, its proposals will have an impact on the budget. These are very significant issues for the Australian community. As I said in my initial remarks, I am not a climate sceptic. I am prepared to see Australia play its part, but I do not believe Australia ought to be leading the rest of the world, as the member for Moreton suggested. What I want to do today is to put in context some of the comments that the government members have been making about former Prime Minister Howard and the commitments made by the former Howard government. It is important to understand that the Howard government was quite prepared to be part of a world solution, but John Howard in his own comments since Copenhagen has made clear his disappointment that the rest of the world was not ready to come on board at that time. That had an impact on his view as to the way in which the commitments that were made by his government ought to be seen. I say to honourable members opposite that if they want to know the way in which substantial tax reform ought to be go up implemented in this country they should follow the lead of John Howard. John Howard was a Prime Minister who was able to put in place very clear and significant tax reform. Its impact on the Australian economy has been commented on favourably. The Howard government went to the Australian people seeking a mandate for the direct tax change-that is, the GST-that it intended to implement. Members opposite have been prepared to say that Howard at an earlier point in time said 'there would be no GST under a government I lead'. He conscientiously went to the Australian people at another election after he made that commitment. I remember well fighting the election campaign on that issue. That is quite opposite to the way in which this government is endeavouring to implement this change-I will not call it a reform. This change is clearly a change that the Prime Minister said before the last election should not be anticipated. But, even worse than that, the government are trying to force this issue through the parliament without adequate scrutiny. I encourage them to look back and even to reconsider the approach they are taking and use the approach the Howard government agreed on in the consideration of the GST. The Howard government and the coalition agreed to four separate parliamentary committees to inquire into the GST. They had four months in which to report. No debate on the measure occurred in the parliament after the introduction of the measure. All the committees had non-government majorities and were overwhelmingly chaired by Labor. The coalition submitted itself and its policies to total public scrutiny, and there is the difference. We are debating this measure today that was introduced into the parliament only on Tuesday, yesterday. We are debating it knowing that there is to be one committee that will scrutinise it, with very little time be able to thoroughly address those issues, and knowing that the matter is being considered under a guillotine. This is not the way in which substantial economic reform in this nation, if it is claimed to be that, should be achieved. The Howard model was far better, more appropriate and far more honourable because John Howard sought to make changes after he had the endorsement of the Australian people at an election. These proposals have never been endorsed by the Australian people at an election.",50
24,Mr CREAN,BILLS,"Hotham-Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government and Minister for the Arts) (11:30): The Australian economy is in transition. We are confronted by many challenges, not just climate change. Our high dollar is impacting not just on our manufacturing base but on other big export earners, such as education services and tourism. Natural disasters have also played their part in reducing our capacity and competing for resources. There is also the uncertainty in the global economy. Against all of those challenges and uncertainties Australia is better placed than any other developed economy to absorb those challenges. We are the only developed economy in the world to have avoided the last recession. We have posted incredible job growth-750,000 jobs since we came to office four years ago-growth that recovered quickly from the downturn and from the disasters. We have room in monetary policy. We have a huge pool of domestic savings in this economy that will be set to grow further, courtesy of a compulsory superannuation scheme that was introduced by Labor and that will be continued and expanded under a Labor government. Those successes that I talk about all came from our preparedness as a nation to confront to the challenges we faced in the 1980s and 1990s-the need to open our economy, to seek new markets, to become competitive and productive and to diversify our economic base. It was a Labor government again that led those reforms. The floating of the dollar, the cutting of tariffs, the controlling of inflation and the implementation of national superannuation and Medicare were all bold reforms. Some of them were unpopular at the time and some of them were contested, but all of them were necessary because they laid the foundation for our prosperity and are the reason why today we are the envy of the rest of the developed world. It is against that context that the Clean Energy Bill 2011 and related bills become so important. Climate change is just another challenge. If we handle it properly and boldly we can be set up for even greater sustainability, environmentally and economically, looking forward. Our planet is warming. Human behaviour is a significant factor. Climate scientists around the world are telling us that carbon pollution is causing climate change. Ninetyseven per cent of climate scientists, those who specialise in studying our atmosphere, agree that climate change is caused by humanity. We have compelling advice and on that evidence we have to take steps to change human behaviour in a lasting way to lower the carbon footprint and to cut pollution. We also need to do that in a clever way that rewards good behaviour. We owe it to our future generations, but the current generation can benefit as well because a carbon market that rewards good behaviour is a market that will reward creativity and innovation. It will play to our strengths and create new job opportunities. Treasury has estimated 1.6 million jobs will be created by 2020 under the proposals that we are putting forward. As the Minister for Regional Australia, Development and Local Government the challenge is: what slice of that job growth action can the regions secure? It is a challenge they are rising to. There are new manufacturing jobs, new service jobs and green jobs from green energy solutions. I have spoken much about the patchwork economy and I have visited many of those patches, our regions. I have held 16 carbon forums around the country in the last two months. Those forums were organised by regional development bodies and were attended by community leaders and stakeholders. All of those forums and all of the RDAs have two common themes built around seizing the opportunity, firstly, to diversify the economic base and, secondly, to embrace a cleaner energy future. both Both themes embrace not only economic opportunity and jobs but also liveability-a cleaner, healthy environment for them and their children. Communities, local government and businesses set their own targets to reduce emissions well before our package was announced. They had determined what needed to be done. They were looking for how they could be helped to achieve their agenda. This package of bills supports that agenda in so many ways. These bills ensure that nine out of 10 households are compensated. The price effect of the carbon price is low. It is less than 1c in the dollar. Remember that the GST added 10c to every dollar spent. This opposition has the gall to complain about the cost impact of these proposals. Compensation will be made through increased pensions, direct payments and tax cuts. The assistance is permanent and it will increase, and, if people change their behaviour, those payments will make them better off because they are compensated as if they do not change their behaviour. But Regional under our Low Carbon Communities fund we will help low-income households make the efficiency improvements. Industry too will benefit. There is a significant package of grants and access to loans through the Energy Finance Corporation available to industry to assist them make the transition to cleaner energy options. We do not expect them to do it on their own. Likewise, in the skills and jobs space there is significant assistance. It is going to be very important to develop the skills to strengthen our capability to get the competitive advantage that will be sought not just here but around the world, and there is a $9.2 billion Jobs and Skills package to develop green job skills to build our capability to develop better our competitiveness, a competitiveness that a carbon market will value and will reward. Also, in terms of the farm sector there $1.7 billion package for carbon farming and biodiversity. Farmers do not pay the tax but under these initiatives they can be big winners. They can be winners through the Biodiversity Fund which enables them to access grants to improve soil and vegetation quality thereby lifting productivity. That is going to be of advantage because it will improve their farm outputs. But it is also a valuable service export to a world that increasingly is being challenged by the food security issue. There is also the additional opportunity under the Measures for Carbon Farming, where in the development of the capture of carbon, the measurement of it and the storage of it, they can trade the credits. As for local government-because I have the responsibility for local governmenthere too there are significant opportunities terms of landfill. We know that landfill generates methane. We are looking to encourage more innovative solutions for local government to reduce landfill waste and emissions, initiatives that involve recycling. The Lismore City Council is a great case in point in recycling all of its organic waste. There is the capturing of methane gas for electricity, which is happening in the Shoal Bay waste disposal site in Darwin City. There is the flaring of gas, which is happening in the Moreton Bay Regional Council. And there is the diverting of compostable household waste away from landfills, and that is happening in the Hobart City Council organic waste measures. These are opportunities that we want to continue to encourage-to have the councils see the opportunities that are there in the challenge that we must embrace. So this is a package of measures available to assist in making the transition, a package designed to reduce carbon emissions by five is a per cent by 2020. Interestingly, that is an objective shared by both sides of this parliament because it also happens to be the coalition policy, although you would not believe it when you listen to them. Both Labor and the coalition therefore agree on what needs to be done. The question is: how do we achieve it? This package of measures is our 'how'. The coalition package of measures, Direct Action-and I do not hear them talk about that much these days-has been ridiculed by all objective analysts. It gives no assistance to small business and it will make households pay an extra $1,300 per year. Yet they cry crocodile tears in arguing that ours is going to price people out of existence. The Leader of the Opposition has become the Dr No of Australian politics. It is not in surprising when you think of his background, because his background is around boxing and debating. He became the opposition leader and he is always looking for an opponent to knock down, and he always seeks the no case when it comes to a debate. His inflexible opposition to the measures in these bills-and they can complain all they like about the lack of time to debate thismeans that we know what the end result will be under his leadership. It will be to say no. He will listen to no reason because he is hellbent on opposing everything that is put forward. But in the opposition blindly following him down this path, they will be denying households their tax cuts and pensioners their pension increases, and imposing under his proposals another $1,300 on top for all households. They will be denying industry access to the land grants and they will be denying farmers the carbon farming initiatives. I have had the opportunity over the last couple of months to visit many regions that are looking at innovative solutions. I have been to Geraldton and the midwest Gascoyne region of WA. They see themselves as the second Pilbara, but they have committed themselves as a town and a region to become carbon neutral. They are looking to renewable energy sources to power the huge growth that is going to happen. They have got private investment interested in coming there and they see this package as underpinning that commitment. I have also been to Whyalla in South Australia where the Leader of the Opposition, Dr No, went and said that they would be wiped off the face of the earth when this package came in. I went to sites that were looking to increase job opportunities, sites involved in rare earth extraction. Because China has closed their exports of rare earths, there is the opportunity to extract and process rare earths. Why are rare earths important? Because they underpin green technology. They underpin smart solutions in terms of lighter ceramics and the sorts of technology, manufacture and fabrication that we are going to need for the challenges that are ahead. Australia is the best placed of any country in the world in terms of its resources, its innovation and its capability. What we want is a market that recognises and values those things and that is why this package, the suite of measures that we are introducing, is designed to create that market to advantage and secure Australia's future going forward. We do not expect people to do it on their own and we have a series of transition measures that we are talking about. I have seen local government, I have seen businesses, I have seen regions rise to the challenge. They know what needs to be done. This side of the House also knows what needs to be done. We have taken the hard decisions. This is the same reform that we were prepared to embrace in the eighties and nineties to set the country up and that is why these bills need to be supported today. (Time expired)  Opposition Business) (11:45): I am pleased to rise to speak on the Clean Energy Bill 2011 and related bills or the carbon tax package of legislation. I begin by saying that in 2007 and 2008 I was a supporter of an emissions trading scheme. The Howard government proposed a policy in favour of an emissions trading scheme based on the Shergold report. Throughout 2008 and then into 2009, when the debate occurred over the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, while the opposition at the time had serious concerns about the CPRS and attempted to make it better and assist the government to introduce an emissions trading scheme that was not able to be done for a number of reasons. Many of those reasons were because, in the negotiations that the opposition had at the time, the government, instead of accepting the good faith of the opposition and working with the opposition in order to bring about an emissions trading scheme, turned it into a political issue and used it to bludgeon the opposition on a daily basis. We have seen already the precedent that this government establishes when it wants opposition support. It does not come to the opposition and say, 'Can we work together?' Even when the opposition offers to get the government out of a bind of their own making what we do not see is the government attempting to work with the opposition. What we instead see is the government abusing, hectoring and bludgeoning the opposition as though that will achieve the outcome that it is seeking. And so we saw that with the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. When the member for Wentworth was Leader of the Opposition and did attempt to bring about an outcome that would see an emissions trading scheme he essentially had sand kicked in his face by the then Prime Minister, the now foreign minister, and the attempt to work together with the government was stymied by them in not negotiating in good faith. Then of course the world changed at Copenhagen at the end of 2009 when all the goodwill that countries like Australia had invested in the Copenhagen process of bringing about a world response to climate change faltered on the rocks of the Copenhagen conference. China was one of the leading nations at the Copenhagen conference to ensure that there was not a world agreement to move forward and try to bring about action on climate change. I support action on climate change. I believe that climate change is occurring and I believe that it is a mixture of natural impacts that occur whatever human beings do and of human beings playing a part in bringing about some change to the climate. I do believe that we should act on climate change and I did support an attempt to do that between 2007 and 2009. But the Copenhagen conference dramatically changed the world outlook on action on climate change. The government responded in two ways. Firstly, they pretended that the Copenhagen conference had been a tremendous success and that they were going to plough on with their Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. Secondly, the then Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Education convinced Kevin Rudd, the then Prime Minister, to abandon the CPRS. They did that for base political reasons because they believed that they were losing politically on the issue. Having done that the government dumped the then Prime Minister, the member for Griffith, and during the election campaign the Prime Minister deceived the Australian people in a baldfaced way by telling them that she would never countenance a carbon tax in any government she led. After the election the Prime Minister ditched that promise to the Australian people and that is the hole in the heart of this Prime Minister's stewardship of this government. That is one of the reasons that the Australian people have utterly lost faith in this government and in the authority of the Prime Minister. Now we see the government trying to introduce a carbon tax which will do tremendous damage to the Australian economy. It will obviously export our emissions to overseas countries. It will export jobs to those same countries. It will not produce any environmental benefits. In fact, emissions will increase. It is a great big new tax built on a deceit during the election campaign which will push up the cost of living of every Australian whether they are a family or an individual and, of course, it will push up the prices for every business. I support the direct action plan of the coalition to address climate change. It is a 'no regrets' policy. What that means is that, even if you do not believe that climate change is happening, even if you do not believe the government should take action on climate change, because it is a hologram, these are still good policies and good changes that will benefit the environment and ensure that the Australian government is playing its part in ensuring that we have a better environment in the future and better environmental practices. The direct action plan of the coalition achieves exactly the same target as the government's plan: a five per cent reduction in emissions by 2020. It does it without any cost to families, it does it without any new taxes and it does it without raising prices-which of course the government will raise through its carbon tax. I can make that claim because every one of the $3.2 billion that has been allocated over the next four years for the coalition's direct action plan is funded out of savings which we announced at the last federal election. There are no new taxes to pay for this policy, no new increases in prices, no imposts on business, no exporting of jobs and no exporting of emissions. And it is a 'no regrets' policy, which means that it is a good policy in spite of any views about climate change. There are no new taxes, yet the government keep making the claim that we will add an impost to Australian households. That is a complete fabrication from a desperate government prepared to say and do anything to try and convince the Australian people that they are not one of the most incompetent and inept governments in Australian history-'Please don't vote us out, because the opposition is worse.' The government are now at the point where they are trying to argue that, even though they admit they have made many mistakes and cost the Australian people many hard-earned dollars through wasted taxes",51
25,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," The member for Sturt has been given a great deal of latitude on these bills, but we are actually dealing with the clean energy bills and I would bring him back to the bills before us.  tax and the fact that the government are so desperate to try and hang on to power that they are prepared to pretend that figures that they have pulled out of the air actually reflect fact. But I hear your admonition, Madam Deputy Speaker, and because of my long standing respect for you",56
26,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,"You are too electricity kind, Member for Sturt!  action plan of the coalition. The direct action plan of the coalition has a number of elements. It establishes an emissions reduction fund. The funds that we have allocated to addressing climate change will be placed in that emissions reduction fund, and there will be a proper process by which the best ideas, the best projects and programs from around Australia, will vie for the funds out of the emissions reduction fund-ideas like capturing carbon in soil, planting trees on non-prime agricultural land, cleaning up waste coalmine gas, cleaning up landfill gas, promoting energy efficiency and converting some of the older, dirtier, coal fired power stations to gas. This would achieve exactly the same reduction in emissions, of five per cent, that the government claims it will do through its own policy. One of my most serious objections to the government's carbon tax legislation is that it will very seriously impact on Australian households, individuals and families at a time when they can least afford it. Households are struggling with the rising cost of living, and yet the government's response to the rising cost of living is to slap a new tax, the carbon tax, on the Australian people through this legislation, which will push up cost-of-living pressures even more. The South Australian Council of Social Service's annual Cost of Living survey shows that since 2001 food prices have gone up 13.2 per cent, utilities have risen 33.4 per cent, health costs have gone up 22.8 per cent and rental costs have gone up 8.4 per cent above inflation. In Adelaide, utility prices have skyrocketed, with a 37 per cent increase in electricity in August this year, a 14 per cent rise in gas prices and a 30 per cent increase in water prices. One of the roles of any government is to do no harm to the Australian people. Yet this carbon tax does direct harm to the Australian people through increasing prices at a time when they can least afford it. Now is the time for the government to be reducing pressure on households, families and individuals across Australia. Now is the time for the government to find measures that reduce the footprint of government in the Australian society, reduce regulation and reduce red tape, not create new programs which require more bureaucrats, more regulation, more red tape and more spending. Ms Plibersek interjecting opposite, the member for Sydney, has been in favour of every spending proposal that has ever come across her desk as a minister or as a member. As a leading member of the Left, she has never even thought of any possibility of saving taxpayers' money because, as far as she is concerned, it is her money. The member for Sydney regards the taxpayers' money as her money. This carbon tax will also cost jobs. It will export jobs overseas. Every government in Australia along the eastern seaboard and Western Australia have done their own analysis of what the carbon tax means, and it is not good news for those people who need their jobs to be able to pay their mortgages or school fees, or just to pay their grocery bills. The Deloitte Access Economics report that was commissioned by the Bligh government-which, last time. I looked, was a Labor government-predicts Queensland's gross state product would be 2.76 per cent lower by 2020 and 4.11 per cent lower by 2050 than it would be without a carbon price. It predicts the loss of 21,000 Queensland jobs and a net loss in the economic value of the state's generation companies of $640 million, meaning higher electricity prices. The Victorian government commissioned an analysis, which found that 23,000 jobs that would have been created will not be created across Victoria by 2015 as a result of the carbon tax and that the Victorian economy would be $2.8 billion worse off in 2015 and $3 billion worse off in 2030. In New South Wales, analysis commissioned by the Labor government and released by the O'Farrell government found that 31,000 jobs will be lost in New South Wales by 2030 and 18½ thousand in the Hunter Valley alone. In Western Australia, the Western Australian Treasury has shown that over half of all Western Australia households will be worse off because of a carbon tax. In the closing minute of my speech on the carbon tax legislation, I want to deal very briefly with the issue of the government hypocrisy in even being prepared to come into this House and introduce this legislation. I do not need to remind Australian people of the Prime Minister's promise: There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead. They certainly have that indelibly printed on their minds. Then there was the Treasurer's promise: We have made our position very clear. We have ruled it out. But someone obviously did not tell the Minister for Finance and Deregulation that they were going to go ahead with a carbon tax, because during 2009 and 2010 she said things like, 'A carbon tax does not guarantee that emissions reductions,' and, 'A carbon tax is not the silver bullet some people might think.' We know that she cannot have any environmental certainty with a carbon tax when she says: I have been very upfront about why I think a carbon tax isn't the most sensible thing for Australia. I could not agree with her more. (Time expired)",56
27,Ms ONEILL,BILLS," I heard the intense argument coming from the shadow minister for apprenticeships and training regarding this package of clean energy legislation, but the reality is that he is on the record with a few interesting comments of his own. On 27 July 2009, he made these comments on Sunday Agenda: Let's not forget it was the Opposition that first proposed an emissions trading scheme when we were in government. The idea that … the Liberal Party is opposed to an emissions trading scheme is quite frankly ludicrous. We are on our way towards that goal and I think there is too much protesting by far going on on the other side for no reason other than simply to obstruct the progress of this nation. Again, in December 2009, he said: … we took an emissions trading scheme to the last election. We believe in climate change action. Judging by today's speech, you could have fooled me that he really believes that. Mr Pyne said on that day: I believe passionately in climate change action. Today he is passionately telling us that there is nothing wrong and we should advance no cause. Somewhere in the middle perhaps lies the truth, although I would not be absolutely confident of that in this context. I welcome this day. I am very proud to stand here as a Labor member to add my voice to those of the Prime Minister, the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, my colleagues and fellow travellers in this place to support this historic legislation. Today, after years, decades even, of public debate on climate change, it is our Labor government, through these landmark clean energy reforms, that is setting our country on course for a secure, sustainable, clean energy future. Let no-one be tricked by those who seek to diminish and dismiss the importance of this challenge. For years, governments all over the world have education, wrestled with the reality of climate change. And no government has taken as measured, as methodical or as inclusive an approach to this issue as the Gillard Labor government. There was exhaustive debate in the last parliament about an emissions trading scheme, two major reviews by Professor Ross Garnaut and no fewer than 35 parliamentary inquiries. No one issue has had so much parliamentary scrutiny. The public scrutiny has been even longer and just as intense. There were the policies for action on climate change that Labor took to successive elections, through to the government's formulation of our Clean Energy Future package at a macro level. At a micro level, the Clean Energy Future materials all householders received over the last month have ensured that, despite those who would spread fear and alarm, the detail and reality of our careful and household centred package of support is now available to all. We have spread the message and the facts-the real information-far and wide. At Kariong, in my own electorate, the Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government provided a carbon pricing forum just last week. We have been comprehensive and inclusive in our approach-because that is the Labor way. Now it comes to us in this House to act. I strongly believe that our role as members in this place is to make the difficult decisions, not for the short term or for narrow political interest but for the long term and the national interest of our constituents. I am so proud to have as my leader here in this place a strong woman, our Prime Minister, who is committed to leading our nation, taking determined action for the long-term national interest. I have absolute confidence in her. The future of my children, my nieces and nephews, my former students and their own children-all these young people-matters to me. I care deeply for their future and I know that I am absolutely in unison with the thousands of Central Coast residents who are dedicated to building a great future for our kids. I will leave no stone unturned in doing everything I can to make sure that there are jobs and opportunities for our young people where we live. This is the Labor way-rising to the tough challenges and faithful to those reform. ordinary Australians who live alongside us as equals, not beneath us or subordinate to us. It is the opportunities and jobs for the future of the Central Coast that I am most excited about when I look at the package we are debating today. As the minister for regional Australia explained last week at Kariong, a clean energy future will allow regions like the Central Coast to diversify their economies a way that was formerly unimaginable, by encouraging the uptake of new skills and by the development of smarter, clean energy economies. A price on carbon will provide an incentive to cut our carbon footprint, create sustainable environmental jobs and drive different renewable energy options. I know that the people on the Central Coast are avid early adopters of the massive uptake of various solar energy initiatives have seen across the coast at federal and state levels. As a region we want our fair share of the projected $100 billion that go into renewables by 2050. And we on the Central Coast want our fair share of the 1.6 million new jobs that Treasury modelling is projecting by 2020. We want a future for our children that embraces a sustainable region not only in terms of the environment but also in terms of the work and opportunities that our growing community needs. The people on the Central Coast love where we live. We are committed to making sure that, for our time of custodianship of this land, we act in a way that allows our children and their children's children and further generations after that to enjoy our place. That is why Labor is determined to undertake this major structural economic reform in a way that not only meets the environmental challenge but also ensures that we make sure our people, ordinary working Australians, do not bear the burden of this major structural economic That is why nine out of 10 households will receive assistance through some combination of tax cuts and payment increases. Two in three households will get tax cuts or increased payments that cover their expected average price impacts, and over four million Australian households will get assistance that is in fact 20 per cent more than their expected average price impact. And, yes, this in assistance to households will be permanent, ongoing and indexed to the CPI. On the same day that the Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government was holding a forum in my electorate, the Leader of the Opposition was also on the Central Coast, deliberately spreading his poisonous misinformation about this assistance. To the Leader of the Opposition I say this: this we government is about caring for older Australians. All you are about-and all you revealed on your visit to the coast-is a will capacity to scare older Australians. So I repeat: the Gillard government's household assistance under this legislation will be permanent, ongoing and indexed to the CPI. That will include very many households on the New South Wales Central Coast. In addition to this, one million Australians will no longer need to lodge a tax return. That is going to be a very welcome piece of news to very many Australians, and particularly to those people who are going to be earning up to about $20,000 now without having to engage with the taxation system. I have spoken to many people on the Central Coast, particularly mothers grandmothers, who will now consider taking up part-time or casual work because we are tripling the tax-free threshold through this legislation. Some of those opposite acknowledge that there is a problem with carbon pollution spewing into our atmosphere. That is why their policy goal for 2020 is exactly the same as the Labor goal: a five per cent reduction in emissions by 2020. But their solution is to pay big polluters to pollute and punish ordinary working Australians. That is the difference between us and them. We in the Labor Party have in our DNA a deep commitment to the ordinary householders and workers who carry this nation each and every day. The Leader of the Opposition's plan is to take $1,300 from ordinary households-from people like those I represent in Umina, Kincumber and Woy Woy-and use their hard-earned money. These constituents on the Central Coast in the seat of Robertson can ill afford the irresponsible $1,300 bill that the Leader of the Opposition would give them. That is right: those opposite would take from the little guys and give to the big guys; they would subsidise polluters and rip off regular families in areas such as mine. This is the bottom line. It is the dark underbelly that is the reality of the modern Liberal Party, because the buck never stops with them. If those opposite were true conservatives, they would respect the institution of the CSIRO-an institution that a conservative prime minister established. Instead, those opposite have trashed and ridiculed the sensible, mainstream science of that treasured institution. In my role as a member of the Australian parliament, I respect mainstream science and I certainly respect the CSIRO. I respect the intellect and integrity that informs that institution, and I acknowledge the great guidance that the and CSIRO and other such learned institutes have provided the Australian public over many, many generations. It is well known that if global emissions continue to increase at the present rates then we face the certainty of dangerous climate change. These are the conclusions of sensible, mainstream scientists-scientists that the Leader of the Opposition continues to call 'crap'. I support the clean energy bills because they will provide the incentive mechanisms needed to drive private investment in clean energy. As one of the biggest per capita polluters in the world, Australia cannot claim that as a nation we do not have the ability to reduce our national emissions. Furthermore, I do not believe that those opposite can deny that it is in the nation's interest to provide an incentive to invest in clean energy. Indeed, if they were true to their party's policies they would be supporting sensible, practical measures designed to reduce our emissions by five per cent over year 2000 levels. If those opposite were true to their principles they would support a market based mechanism. They would support that to enable the private sector to invest in a clean energy future. I support the government's market-based solution because it is right, because it makes the big polluters pay for polluting and because it provides a powerful and correct incentive for the industry to invest in a clean energy future. The details of the government's clean energy plan have been debated at length both inside and outside this parliament. It is important to understand that the fixed price of carbon is only a temporary measure and that it will only operate for a short period of time until an emissions trading scheme is implemented in 2015. The charge of $23 per tonne will rise in accordance with inflation over the next three years. According to the fixed-price mechanism, businesses covered by the legislation will be charged $23 for every tonne of carbon pollution they put into the atmosphere. Finally, I want to bring in a faith perspective to this debate in the House today. I want to put on the record in the chamber the response of Christians who take seriously the words of the Holy Bible, in particular Genesis chapter 1, verses 28 and 29, and Genesis chapter 2, verse 15. They are the elements of the Bible that we often hear about, on the intimate relationship with the earth on which we walk. The intimacy of humankind's relationship with the earth is embedded in these famous pieces of text. The custodianship of the earth and the incredible responsibility that that confers each of us is to keep the earth and to replenish the earth, and that is not lost on Christians whose faith provides the moral compass of our lives. The understanding of the importance of the response to the challenge of climate change is well articulated in the Australian space by the Micah Challenge group, who are so active in our communities and determined to ensure that Christians are taking up our share of the burden in achieving the Millennium Development Goals. I know that many of those opposite support the Micah Challenge. I know that they worship in communities that support the Micah challenge. They need to heed the very clear advice that impels us as Christians to act to price carbon and to undertake the change to a clean energy economy. It is time for leadership and responsible action, particularly by those who express a Christian faith and have this discourse to inform their conscience and their political action in this place. This is no time for carping negativity, for selfishness or for cheap political stunts. The future we create for our children and their children and the future we offer all who share this planet with us depends on our capacity to get out of our own way, to abandon selfishness and to act for others. In the long term, millions of others will receive the benefits of this honest and responsible enactment into law of wise custodianship of our earth, our sea and our sky. In the true Labor way, we have ensured that ordinary Australians, for whom we are the voice in this place, will be assisted financially through this major economic reform which will set us on a path to a clean energy environment and 1.6 million clean energy jobs-and all of that by 2020. I close by encouraging all people of Christian faith and all members of this House on to consider the clear advice that impels us to act in the interests of our country and the future of our planet. I commend these bills to the House.",58
28,Mr ROBB,BILLS," I rise to speak on the Clean Energy Bill 2011. In the absence of a global emissions trading scheme, imposing a carbon tax in Australia is an act of economic self harm and totally futile from an environmental perspective. I think that both sides of the House share the view that we should protect our land and our country, but this bad policy does nothing. There is no obligation to support bad and futile policy in the pursuit of supposedly protecting our land. To better understand why going it alone on a carbon tax will harm the Australian economy, think for a second about the question solely in an Australian context. What would happen if a great big new tax on carbon was levelled at businesses only in my home state of Victoria and in no other state? In no time at all, in order to remain competitive, Victorian businesses and jobs would start to relocate-to the great detriment of the Victorian economy-to New South Wales, to Queensland and to other states where no tax was applied, and the emissions that relocating businesses generated would go with them. If you go back and think about the proposed carbon tax, you will realise that the same thing will happen, except that in this case it will on a global basis, because our businesses, becoming increasingly uncompetitive, will simply relocate to other parts of the world, and the emissions created by those businesses will go with them. Australian businesses, jobs and emissions will relocate where no tax applies. Key Republican congressman on climate change Jim Sensenbrenner, who led the US congressional delegation to Kyoto, described what the Gillard government is doing as 'unilateral economic disarmament'. We know that the prospects of either a cap-and-trade system or a carbon tax are dead in the US. We know from key Democrats that President Obama will not be campaigning on either in the lead-up to next year's election. After the failure of the Copenhagen conference, the world is further away from a global agreement than it has ever been. The government lectured us for three years about the importance of a global scheme in the lead-up to the last election, but now we are being lectured about the importance of bringing in a scheme unilaterally. The world is further away from a global arrangement than ever before, yet there is urgency here, the face of very difficult economic circumstances for many sectors of manufacturing, to bring in a great big new tax. It makes no sense unless you look at the politics behind the introduction of this bill. While the Gillard government likes to highlight the European emissions trading scheme as a reason that we need to undermine our great strengths, even in Europe there is a high degree of pessimism about the prospect of a global scheme. In fact, the UK parliament's Energy and Climate Change Committee recently launched a new inquiry into the EU emissions trading system. The committee said that, in the absence of binding emissions happen reduction commitments under the UN reduction framework, the scheme 'is looking increasingly isolated'. It went on to say: The lack of an international framework for emissions reductions and carbon trading poses some serious difficulties for the future viability of the EU ETS … Regardless, though you would not know it from the rhetoric, the European schemewhich has been the subject of huge rorts-is really nothing more than a pilot scheme, is a mere pilot compared to the carbon tax proposed here. The European scheme does not apply at all, in many cases, to electricity generators, much less many other trade exposed industries. The Gillard-Brown scheme will raise more in revenue in its first four months than the European trading system has raised in total over the last five years. If you were to put a price on carbon, this scheme would be just about the most inefficient and most complex way you could go about it. It is the most bureaucratic, the most interventionist and the most socialistic scheme that you could contrive. There are many other schemes that you could use if in you were to put a price on carbon. There are even cap-and-trade schemes which you could design to put a price on carbon and which would give you exactly the same price but not strip the balance sheets of companies, which is what will happen with this government scheme-they will tax every tonne of CO2, and the cost of abatement is only one-sixth of the total tax take. This is a scheme designed to maximise the tax return-as we are seeing in Ireland, where they have just doubled the price of carbon because they have a fiscal problem. The same thing will happen in Australia, and it will not be one scheme but 500 schemes. The so-called '500 big polluters' that Labor has raged about for 12 months no longer matter, but we still do not even know which companies will be taxed. When we do, however, there will be bureaucrats crawling all over them. Under the government's scheme, different activity definitions apply, different levels of assistance apply and the enormous tax churn not only underscores the scheme's inefficiency but also suggests that, first and foremost, the scheme is a vehicle for wealth redistribution. Herein lies the fundamental difference between the carbon tax and the coalition's far more efficient direct action policy. The carbon tax approach requires many tens of billions of dollars in compensation because of the huge increases in electricity prices, and the direct action approach requires no compensation because it does not drive up electricity costs. Frontier Economics exposed this fact with an analysis it did based on Treasury's 2008 modelling of a carbon price. Looking at electricity generators alone, it found that the cost of technology to reduce CO2 emissions from 2012 to 2020 was $6.6 billion-that is, the cost of abatement for electricity generators over the next eight years would be $6.6 billion. During that period the government would reap not $6.6 billion but $37.5 billion in tax from the generators, and consumers would pay an additional $45 billion for electricity-the price would be passed on to electricity consumers. This shows that those who are creating the CO2-the so-called 'big polluters', the derogatory term used by this government-are not paying. It will be consumers who pay, and everyone knows this. The government is doing itself a great disservice by trying to imply that the tax falls on the so-called 'big polluters' and not on individual Australians and small business. This shows, too, that the government's tax take is almost six times the actual abatement cost, and the increased cost of electricity is nearly eight times the actual abatement cost. As Frontier's Danny Price prophetically said earlier this year 'the excess tax will be churned via the political process which will bring its own distortions'. Bureaucrats will be making decisions about technology and innovation, not companies themselves. This town will be crawling with lobbyists seeking some investment crumbs from the government's table. It is a giant money-goround, but the money will end up in the hands of politically well-chosen beneficiaries. Danny Price said that political control of so much tax revenue explains why the Greens have been such enthusiastic supporters of the carbon tax. He said, 'They will be in the box seat in deciding how these funds will be distributed,' and he was spot on. These bills will provide for the creation of the $10 billion Clean Energy Finance Corporation-or the Bob Brown bank. The slush fund",61
29,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, Order! The member knows he must refer to people by their appropriate titles.,63
30,Mr ROBB,BILLS,"will be all borrowed money. It will be used to fund high-risk pet projects of the Greens and Labor, projects the private sector would not touch with a barge pole. The lessons of the failed Tricontinental bank, the failed State Bank of South Australia and WA Inc. are so easily forgotten. It is criminal; it is pure politics; it is not policy inspired. No less than Don Argus said he was bemused that such vast sums of money were being staked on risky and expensive renewable energy and not carbon capture and storage-it was explicitly excluded from those $10 billion funds. He said: This example highlights just how politically expedient this government's tax reform agenda has been. … The government has rushed ahead with proposals that are … not in the best interests of our countrydespite the endless mantra about what is the in the interest of the country being pursued. While Senator Brown rages against foreign ownership in mining, he remains silent about wind farms. About 30 per cent of Australian wind farms are foreign owned and their manufactures are all foreign owned. Doesn'the have a problem with this-their proliferation and the way they are shattering communities? We know from the lessons learned in Europe that all the talk about green jobs, which will replace jobs in traditional industries, is pure nonsense. In fact, it is quite disingenuous the way in which this government comes into this House every day to talk about green jobs. The US study by Verso Economics recently found that for every green job created 3.7 jobs in other parts of the economy were destroyed. This supports similar findings from Spain, Germany and other parts of Europe. This is what we can expect in Australia in manufacturing, mining and resources. Thousands of jobs will be lost-and the cost of green jobs is extraordinarily high, compared with traditional jobs. Look at the billions this government has wasted on green rip-offs: $2.4 billion on pink batts, $850 million on solar homes, $300 million on green loans and, despite the enormous tax take under this scheme, $9 billion a year that cannot even make the numbers add up. Incredibly, this scheme will cost the budget $4.3 billion over the forward estimates. That is a real black hole, yet, according to the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, this adds up to broadly budget neutral-and they wonder why people are so sceptical about their management skills of this economy. No wonder they are a laughing stock. Senator Wong wants nothing to do with this carbon tax. Here is a snapshot of her past comments: The carbon tax does not guarantee emissions reductions. … … … A carbon tax … is a recipe for abrupt and unpredictable changes. She goes on to say that the introduction of a carbon price ahead of effective international action can lead to perverse incentives for such industries to relocate or source production offshore. That is the current finance minister, the former Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. These are all contradictory in terms of the carbon tax policy that has been laid down and which we are debating here today. I could not have said it better myself. They are also creating six new bureaucracies to administer this dog's breakfast of a scheme. This will cost a staggering $382 million. I went to Tasmania recently, where they built a beautiful dam for $34 with hydro. It changed the economics of that small region. You could build 11 of those around the country for the cost of the carbon tax bureaucrats each year. By contrast, the coalition's direct action policy will cost $3.2 billion over four years and it will be transparently funded from savings within budget-and capped. Virtually all this money will be spent on purchasing least-cost abatement through competitive tender. Competitive tendering is a market based system but one which does not come with tens of billions of dollars of new tax and tens of billions of dollars of higher electricity charges. Direct action is a no-regrets policy. If there is still no global agreement by 2020, Australia will have remained competitive while reducing emissions by five per cent, avoiding tens of billions of dollars of still in a good position to assess the way forward from there. The direct incentives to invest in lower energy and emissions technology in our business sector, greater carbon levels in our soils and tree planting in appropriate areas will see major productivity gains regardless of action taken by the rest of the world. On the other hand, going it alone with a carbon tax and then an emissions trading scheme is highly irresponsible. This politically inspired going-it-alone policy approach guarantees that Australia will be far worse off than if a global agreement applied. In fact, under a global scheme, closures of inefficient power generation and value-adding resource plants, such as zinc and aluminium smelters, would occur elsewhere in the world first. This carbon tax will deliver around 40 million tonnes, or just 25 per cent, of overall abatements. The world economy is facing the likelihood of a further major slump over the next 12 months, yet this government wants to introduce an economy-wide tax. I urge any government members opposite who want to do the right thing by our nation and our communities to reject these bills. (Time expired)",63
31,Mr OAKESHOTT,BILLS," If I ask the member for Warringah or the member for the Cowper at the table whether they want to live under an emissions trading scheme, I suspect their answer would be no, yet the joke is that they already do. The New South Wales Greenhouse Gas Reduction Scheme was introduced on 1 January 2003. To quote from the website: It is one of the first mandatory greenhouse gas emissions trading schemes in the world. The new Liberal-National government in New South Wales maintains this scheme and it covers the seats of Warringah and Cowper. It is this same greenhouse gas abatement tax, yet scheme that the member for Warringah himself openly says is the backbone of Liberal and National party policy on climate change nationally. I have advocated for a price on carbon through emissions trading since my first speech in this chamber. At that time. I said that I looked forward to working with members and ministers on both sides on water quality, catchment management, natural resources management and renewable energy issues throughout the MidNorth Coast. We as a region are really well geared to address these other local issues if we can get some offset returns through the emissions trading scheme. My view over the past three years has not changed; if anything, it has firmed. At the last two federal elections at which I stood, in 2008 and 2010, I was open and honest with my communities and said that, if elected, I would be working on pricing carbon via emissions trading. I have remained consistent and today have delivered on those election commitments. Unlike many others who chop and change or describe themselves as weathervanes on climate change, my word is my bond and I do what I can to uphold that bond. So I stand up for the new economy of Australia, I stand up for jobs and I stand up for fewer taxes, and I do this by strongly supporting Australia moving to an emissions trading scheme in 2015. On behalf of the 90,000 residents of the Mid-North Coast, I personally chose to participate in the MultiParty Climate Change Committee processa unique cabinet process established to make sure that this time moral challenges will actually be delivered. My position on the Clean Energy Bill 2011 and associated bills is therefore well known to all. I will support these bills. I also expect the members for Melbourne, Denison and New England to support these bills and therefore expect these bills to pass. After all the discussion and debate on this issue over many years, I hopefully have time to say three more things. First, I say why I support these bills. They are the same reasons I have stated every time this issue has come before the parliament and they are the same reasons I have stated in open letters and public forums throughout my electorate over many years. At elections in 2008 and 2010, I publicly and openly supported a price on pollution in emissions trading markets. Unlike almost every other Australian politician, my position has not changed. In my view, common sense tells me to seek and trust expert advice. If your child is sick, you go to the local doctor for trusted medical advice. If you are planning to retire, you trusted financial advice. The issue of climate change is no different. Even the most conservative Australian scientific advisers, including the CSIRO, who we have trusted for 70 years, tell us that climate change is a risk demanding a response. The most conservative Australian economic advisers insist that the lowest-cost response is to make the biggest emitting businesses reduce or pay for their emissions. I have chosen to respect and accept this expert advice on both the science and the economics. In my view, politicians who reject this advice ignore the scientific risks and accept higher long-term economic costs. The features of this package before the House that improve on the old CPRS-that at one point, I remind everyone, 148 out of the 150 members of this parliament publicly supported-are many. Included in the improvements negotiated through the MPCCC is a better governance model with the independent Climate Change Authority. Members can check unsuccessful amendments last time around with the CPRS and will see my consistent position on this. It is important that this is now a governance feature piece. I am pleased this suggestion helped as a circuit-breaker in the trench warfare on emissions targets between the Labor Party and the Greens that had stalled this issue for too long. This is an important improvement that removes the toxic debate and focuses decisions on independent science and independent economic advice. Secondly, we have increased benefits to protect pensioners, retirees and lowto middle-income earners from consumer price changes of less than one per cent. Thirdly, we took the opportunity for tax reform, turning Ross Garnaut's very good work into Ken Henry's very good tax reform work, and achieved substantial tax reform as part of the agreements reached. Fourthly, we worked to seek assist key industries and helped small business to adjust, including $150 million for adjustments in the important food processing sector and financial support for small business. Fifthly, we have allowed new resource and development funding that will allow us to keep pace with the world in both renewable energy and in carbon farming. Sixthly, we now have a $1.8 billion land sector package that does push back on behalf of marginal lands, pushes back on concerns of the international peak soils crisis globally and pushes back on behalf of the high loss of biodiversity in Australia's unique ecosystem. I thank those who took the time to participate in the land use forums that I hosted in the parliament earlier this year, at a critical time in the decision-making process around this. It did and does matter. Finally, and I think importantly, we have negotiated Indigenous enterprise in land use and the targeted land sector provisions for Australia's original-and, in my view, bestland managers. I am pleased to hear that the two groups who are already hitting the phones to environmental planners on this topic are agriculture companies and individuals as well as Indigenous enterprises, both looking for ways to value-add to the 18 bills before the House today. All of this is done with a firm eye on the macro-economy. I can confirm that undisputed, independent Treasury advice identifies our economy will continue to grow and our standard of living will continue to rise, even with a price on carbon. The Australian story for the next 50 years is a good story not a bad one. We really do live in the right place at the right time. Reform for the better suits these times. It is my view therefore that the bills before us are best overall solution to the real climate risks facing Australians of the future and that our generation does owe it to future Australians to resolve this issue now. I acknowledge that many members of parliament and community members do not agree with this decision, but I am confident that at least understand it and I am confident that consistency in thought is at least respected. This brings me to my third and final point. In the politics of the debate in Australia, one thing that has hampered constructive public debate on this topic is the lack of detail, clarity and consistency of the major parties. I include the Labor Party, the Party and the National Party in this criticism. They have collectively been consistent in their inconsistency on pricing carbon. Today we see the Liberal and National parties, in opposition, showing all care on pricing carbon and absolutely no responsibility. They say they care, but a responsible opposition would at the very least put an alternative policy to the legislature for debate. They have not. They have called for a plebiscite as a demonstration that they have private members' powers to contribute to the parliament, but they deny the Australian people to look at or see the details of this alternative policy. What have they got to hide? This is not a choice in this House between an emissions trading scheme or nothing. It is a choice between an emissions trading scheme or what I consider a Liberal-National party grants tax that Australia is consistently being denied the details of. I was disappointed again today to see the member for Warringah once again dodge the opportunity to table their alternative for the House to consider. Consider this-and this is not politics at play-if parliament rejects the current 18 firm bills before the House, those of us like me the who have consistently supported action on climate change must consider supporting the Liberal-National parties' alternative option. But what is the alternative? If I asked the member for Wide Bay or the member for Warringah the following six questions, I am assuming at this stage the they answers would be 'yes'. Firstly, do the Liberal-National parties support a five per cent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2020 on 1990 levels? My understanding the is: yes. Secondly, do the Liberal-National parties support the words spoken by the Leader of the Opposition in the launch of his policy in February 2010 that their policy is Liberal modelled on the New South Wales Labor government's GGAS, meaning a lot of emissions reduction at comparatively modest cost? My understanding is: yes. Thirdly, would the Liberals and Nationals establish an emissions reduction fund to invest an annual average of about $10.2 billion in direct CO2 emissions reduction activities by 2020, funded by tax revenue? My understanding is: yes. Fourthly, will the emissions reduction fund purchase 85 million tonnes per annum of CO2 abatement through soil carbon by 2020, regardless of whether soil carbon is in any relevant future international agreement-at an estimated cost of $8 to $10 per tonne-and is this the single biggest investment the emissions reduction fund will make? My understanding is: yes. Fifthly, will the emissions reduction fund be prevented from purchasing emissions reductions from overseas, even if those emissions reductions are verifiable and less expensive than those able to be purchased in Australia? My understanding is: yes. Sixthly, and finally, if a business that already reports under the Howard-CostelloVaile-sponsored National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Scheme undertakes an activity with an emissions level above its business-as-usual level, will that business incur a financial penalty? My understanding is: yes. In other words, the Liberal Party and the National Party are pursuing the same reduction in emissions, relying heavily on just one technology, to be purchased at an assumed price by a government fund-with any trade in carbon emissions specifically prevented. Big emitters under this approach face the real possibility of financial penalties if they expand, with no opportunity to buy offsetting abatement from another source. This is a potential job killer and a potential economic growth killer. With this in mind, there are two more questions I would like to ask and have answered, but the answers at this stage are critically unknown. Firstly, will the Liberal National party members of this parliament match the $14.2 billion over four years in reduced income taxes, Indigenous employment, soil research, biodiversity funding and higher benefits provided for under the package currently in the 18 bills before the House and, if not, what exact level of reduced income taxes or higher benefits would the Liberal and National parties provide and how would these be funded? Secondly, if the Liberal-National party members of this parliament think they can buy abatement at $8 to $10 a tonne, how do they justify any argument that says the market price in an emissions trading scheme would not be the same? Surely the price of a tonne of carbon is either $8 a tonne or $29 a tonne in 2015. Which one is true? Again, until this is answered, in my view they debate with false anger. At this stage, on this difference between $8 a tonne and $29 a tonne, someone's policy in this debate is a fraud. I am backing $29 a tonne in 2015 based on all sound economic advice, yet it is unknown how on earth based on this advice the coalition can then buy in at $8 a tonne. What product in history in any market economy can be bought at one-third of its price on an ongoing basis? Do we buy milk at 80c a tonne when it is $2? Do we buy bread for $1 when it is $3? How is this so? Please, member for Flinders, member for Warringah, member for Wide Bay, explain your policy. I would be grateful if that is answered in this debate. Until then, I strongly support the 18 bills before the House. I strongly support pricing carbon. It is not a tax. We all know you cannot buy and sell a tax. This is a carbon permit trading scheme. It is the smartest, lowest cost, lowest risk solution to the very real science question before us. I strongly encourage this House to this time, importantly, in the national interest, back this package.",65
32,Mr TRUSS,BILLS," The Constitution of Australia requires in section 52 that the parliament shall make laws for the 'good government of the Commonwealth'. This legislation is not good government, it is not good law and it is not good for the people of Australia. It is an incredible piece of national self-harm, a massive new tax that will add to the cost of all that we do, a new tax that will cost Australian jobs as industry relocates to other parts of the world that do not have a tax like this. It is a massive new tax that seeks to destroy our competitive advantage by artificially raising the price of electricity. It is bureaucratic, it is concocted, it is illogical, it is negative, it is dishonest, inconsistent and it is structurally unsound. It will do nothing for the environment in Australia, and indeed it will increase global emissions. With all the overblown rhetoric that we have heard about this scheme and about the legislation before the House, it cannot possibly achieve its objectives. Is it any wonder that the public are bewildered? They see this as a gigantic scandal, a fraud being perpetrated on the Australian people. They are asking: 'How could our government do such a thing? How can a government that is interested in the welfare of the people do such a thing? Why do they want to hurt us so much? Why won't they listen when we cry out for sensible policies?' This is a monumental piece of government incompetence. It will be a $9 billion tax in the first year and collect well over $30 billion in the first three years, still leaves behind it a $4.7 billion black hole, and that is without the compensation that will have to be paid to close down coal fired power stations. This is simply illogical. US Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner put it correctly when he described what Australia was doing as 'unilateral economic disarmament'. It simply makes no sense. It is a tax that is based on two broken promises by the Prime Minister. At her very first media conference after the coup that removed the member for Griffith, the member for Lalor said that she had convinced her predecessor to dump his carbon pollution reduction scheme because he did not have community consensus: I came to that decision because I fundamentally believe that if you are going to restructure our economy so that we can deal with a carbon price and deal with all the transformations in our economy that requires, then you need community consensus to do so. You must have community consensus. There clearly is no community consensus in favour it is of the carbon tax. There is very strong consensus in opposition to the carbon tax. The Prime Minister has broken her promise to develop community consensus before taking action to implement a carbon pollution reduction scheme or a carbon tax. The second broken promise is even more profound, and it rings in the ears of every Australian every day when they are talking about this issue. Infamously, before the 2010 election, she said: There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead. She later went on in a pathetic way to say she did not really mean to mislead. If she did not mean to mislead, why didn't she correct the statements that were in the media before the election instead of waiting until after the event, when she was trying to negotiate to get the keys to the Lodge, to walk away from but it that commitment? It was a fundamental breach of trust. The chairman of the company produced a prospectus and asked the shareholders to invest in the company. The prospectus included a promise that there would be no carbon tax. As soon as the share offer was over, the prospectus was changed and revised. The prospectus was false. If our Prime Minister were a company director, she would be heading for a long term in jail. But she is the Prime Minister and she is not in jail; in fact, she is still in the Lodge. But she still fundamentally misled the shareholders of the company. I know some of the other company directors are now plotting to get themselves a new chairman, but it is not just the chairman who is to blame; it is the whole company. As I see members opposite standing in this House to defend this legislation-members who have refused to speak out in their own electorates even though they know this legislation is going to devastate local industry, who have already seen factories close with the threat of this legislation but refuse to speak out-they are just as culpable now as the chairman of their board. How could anyone believe any of them ever again? They identified themselves with the promise; they have now identified themselves with the breaking of the promise. Is it any wonder that public respect is at an all-time low for this government and its Prime Minister? My greatest concern, my deepest regret, is the damage that this is doing to our democracy as a whole. The public respect for our parliament is in decline. Lasting damage is being done to the profession of members of parliament. When members' word is not their bond, when they make promises to the people before the election and then walk away from them as though nothing had ever happened, is it any wonder that the public upset and disgusted with the performance of this government? We know why it has all happened. The Prime Minister was so keen to get the keys to the Lodge that she was prepared to make any compromise. She was prepared to cave in for the carbon-pricing ambitions of the Greens. The Independent members for Lyne and New England are just as culpable as the Greens in driving this extremist and pointless agenda. I recall the infamous press conference where the Greens and the Independents took over the Prime Minister's courtyard and grinned at the Australian public as they announced the ditching of Labor's no-carbon-tax promise and the harshest carbon tax anywhere in the world. The member for Lyne certainly wanted a new carbon tax, as he made it abundantly clear in his own recent remarks. He had said previously, 'Let the market rip, let the science fly.' He also made that clear when discussing the CPRS bills. He said the Prime Minister's plan did not go anywhere far enough. The member for New England rejected the CPRS bills because they did not go far enough. He said a five per cent reduction was nonsensical and he wanted an 80 per cent cut in emissions by 2050, but more of that shortly. The reality is that the government ditched their promises and their commitments because they were so desperate they were prepared to trade off anything to get the keys to the Lodge. But then there was the so called Multi-Party Climate Change Committee. It just had Greens, Labor members and Independents. You were not even allowed to be on the committee unless you were fundamentally committed to Labor's version of the carbon tax. You were not even allowed to participate in the process unless you were determined to deliver on are exactly what the Greens and the Independents wanted. This tax is just like that committee-a camel-full of anomalies. Everybody got their little piece. There was no consultation with the community. There has been no attempt to address the issues. They were not listening when people raised genuine concerns, and so we end up with a scheme that lacks public support. In spite of what the member for Lyne just said, the public do not understand it. The government have not attempted to explain it to the Australian people. If any scientist or economist had different views to those associated with the gospel on climate change, they were simply excluded from the process, ridiculed and not treated with any respect. The government spent taxpayers' money on television advertisements, and now on a 20-page booklet, about the carbon tax. There are actually only three pages out of that 20 that even talk about the carbon tax. The rest are about taxation changes, many of which are not relevant to the purpose of the carbon tax, which is supposed to be to reduce CO2 emissions. The starting price of $23 per tonne is precisely the level set down by the Greens in January 2010, 13 months before the so-called Multi-Party Climate Change Committee was even established. The concept of a built-in growth mechanism over the fixed period is precisely the mechanism put forward by the Greens in January 2010. The transition to a floating price and full emissions trading by 2015 is a mirror reflection of the transition process favoured by the Greens in January 2010. The quasi-independent body to advise the government on rolling caps for the trading era beginning in 2015 is precisely the format sought by the Greens and by the member for Lyne. The whole Multi-Party Climate Change Committee was also a facade. The agenda had already been laid down by the Greens, and the government was prepared to pay the ransom price just to get the keys to the Lodge. This legislation is dishonest, counterproductive and deceitful. It will be a massive blow to the Australian economy, which this government has already brought to its knees with its mismanagement and its waste. It will make no difference whatsoever to the Australian climate. It will actually result in increased global emissions, as factories and industries leave Australia and go to countries where there are no rules like ours. Prices will increase across the board. Treasury has estimated 10 per cent more for electricity and nine per cent more for gas. Car manufacturers estimate an increase of around $400 for the price of a new car-that is, of course, if we are left with a car industry in Australia at all, as manufacturers move to places where you can make your cars without paying this tax. Builders have told us to expect $6,000 more for the price of a new home. Groceries are estimated to go up between three and five per cent. Bus and train fares will rise. From 2014, all road transport costs will rise with the planned reduction in the fuel tax credit. Our export industries, including agriculture, will be hit with the extra cost burden that our competitors simply do not pay. Steelmakers are unable to compete and the government has included in this package of legislation compensation for the steel industry, even though they are saying that the recent closures have got nothing to do with the carbon tax. The reality is that decisions are already being made by Australian industry on the basis that this tax is ahead of them and gives them another good reason to relocate elsewhere. Coalmines with high levels of methane emissions will close. The cost of building roads will go up by an estimated five per cent, meaning that we will have less money available for the vital infrastructure we need across the country. Even taking a load of rubbish to the dump will cost more because the operators of the land fill will be responsible for methane emissions. It just goes on and on. All this is supposed to be something that Australia is going to do by itself to save the planet-to save the polar bear, the Great Barrier Reef and the Murray Darling Basin. Australia, accounting for 1.4 per cent of the total global emissions, is somehow or other going to change the climate of the world on our own. Even Professor Flannery says that is rubbish and that it will take a thousand years to make the slightest difference to our temperature, and no difference at all if, in fact, the rest of the world does not follow the nonsense in the direction that Australia is following. We were told we had to do this so that we could catch up with the rest of the world, but in practice there is no other country that is proposing a tax of this nature. There is no carbon scheme anywhere in the world that comes close to what is happening here. The Americans are walking away from a capand-trade scheme and the Chicago Carbon Exchange has actually closed. They talk about reductions in China, but in the time that we will reduce our emissions-our very small emissions by global standards-by five per cent the biggest emitter in the world, China, is going to increase theirs by 496 per cent! What we are doing is complete nonsense. Also in relation to what China is supposed to be doing-closing down coal-fired power stations-for every one gigawatt they close down they are opening up 10 gigawatts of new. We have to close 90 per cent of our power stations in Australia but we are going to double our coal exports so that other people will in fact use our coal to achieve the same objective. This is the biggest carbon tax in the world, and the government has no mandate to deliver it-no authority; they have lost their legitimacy. It will do nothing for the environment, and this legislation should be rejected. (Time",68
33,Ms SMYTH,BILLS," It is always a privilege to be in this place and to stand here as a member of a Labor government, but never more so than on days like today when I know that my voice and my vote will make a very real difference in a significant national debate and a very real difference in relation to a global threat. I knew on coming into this place that this government was not going to shy away from these sorts of big debates-debates that had been left aside by our predecessors. These are big debates that, then and now, they have neither the capacity nor the moral courage to address. We all recall that John Howard aspired to a relaxed and comfortable Australia, but in reality what he and his party aspired to then and now was stagnation-a kind of policy stupor that left to one side issues critical to our nation and to our globe. This included the increasingly urgent question of climate change. When the Howard government finally began to see climate change as possibly an important issue it was in the way that a rabbit might see the headlights of an oncoming truck. But at least I can credit John Howard with recognising that it is a critical issue on which action is required. At least I credit him with respecting the science and some of the economics of the issue. These certainly are not attributes shared by his successors, and certainly not by those on the other side who have very recently contributed to this debate. I have to say that it will be to their great shame when our country inevitably reflects on this debate in the future. Indeed, we have seen so many members of the former Howard government who originally said that they supported pricing carbon now change their minds to score cheap political points. For instance, one of the last speakers, the member for Goldstein, expired) said on ABC on 27 July 2009: We are very supportive of a price on carbon. We introduced the scheme to do that. He went on to say: … we are serious about good policy in this area. We are serious about a price of carbon. What a difference a couple of years makes in this debate, so serious is he now about pricing carbon that he is in fact debating on the opposite side of it. On so many issues Labor has shown that ours is the only party that has both a vision for the future of this country and the tenacity to manage the transition to make that vision a reality. To make ideals and vision a workable reality for all Australians requires that we work with people right across our community. On this issue that has meant dialogue and cooperation with expert scientists and economists, industry, community organisations, farmers and others to achieve a realistic nationwide change. The bills before us today will make Labor's vision for a clean energy future a reality for every Australian and will contribute to the very real global action against climate change. On that note I might correct some of the views that were put by the most recent speakers from the opposition in this debate, who seem to have missed quite a few fairly significant international events around the issue of carbon pricing and climate change. For instance, the member for Goldstein remarked that we were 'further away than ever from a new international agreement'. He might be advised that, in Cancun in December 2010, some 89 countries representing 80 per cent of global emissions pledged to take action on climate change. That is hardly evidence of a lack of action, the opposition increasingly likes to claim. Scores of countries have already started the transformation to a low-pollution economy: 32 countries and a number of US states already have emissions trading schemes. Indeed, Australia's top five trading partners-China, Japan, the US, Korea and India amongst others-have implemented or are piloting emissions trading schemes, carbon taxes and coal taxes at a national, state or city level. We know that New Zealand introduced a trading scheme in 2008, initially covering only forestry, but which in 2010 was expanded significantly to cover the liquid fossil fuels, stationary energy and industrial processes. We know that China has indicated that it will introduce emissions trading pilot schemes across a number of provinces, including the industrial centres of Beijing, Shanghai and Guangdong. The World Bank has recently indicated that these regional schemes may be expanded to a national scheme by 2015. So far, from the remarks of the member for Goldstein, the leader of the Nationals and others on the opposition benches asserting that there is seemingly no international action on these matters, it seems that at least the top five of Australia's trading partners are taking meaningful action on climate change and the issue of carbon pollution. Indeed, some 89 countries around the world have pledged their commitment to take meaningful action on climate change. If we are to meet a target of a five per cent reduction on year 2000 levels by 2020 and an 80 per cent reduction by 2050 we are not going to do it with a piecemeal approach. The problem that we face in climate change calls for concerted, nationwide action and a change in attitudes and behaviour, and these are the attitudes of whole industries, as communities and regions. A price on carbon is the way to ensure that fundamental and permanent economic and behavioural changes are made. The coalition has put forward its so-called direct action plan, and we already know that it will rely on $1,300 from every household in every year in order to be implemented. We know that it is not intended to, and will not, change the actions of big polluters. We know that the coalition is not serious about the abatement mechanisms in their policy, because otherwise they would have supported the government's efforts to incentivise farmers and other landholders through the Carbon Farming Initiative to really put an emphasis on abatement mechanisms. When it came time to support real abatement activity, the opposition shirked that responsibility. So essentially we know that the direct action plan will be expensive, poorly targeted and amateurish. But then there is the important question that has been raised even by members of the opposition themselves: the question about whether the direct action policy would ever be implemented at all or whether it might just be ditched. I believe I am speaking a little earlier in this debate than had been anticipated, because we have had a notable person remove himself from the debate today-namely, the member for Wentworth. I presume that he is revisiting his position in relation to the carbon price as we speak. We heard the member for Wentworth as recently as last year saying in very strong terms that direct action policies on climate change were a 'recipe for fiscal recklessness'. Specifically, he had this to say this year: … a direct action policy where the Governmentwhere industry was able to freely pollute, if you like, and the Government was just spending more and more taxpayers' money to offset it, that become a very expensive charge on the budget … The member for Wentworth is right: it would become a very expensive charge on the budget-an $11 billion charge on the budget, requiring hundreds of public servants to deal with the administration of the plan-and it is still not clear how it might have meaningful carbon abatement effects. So, despite the Leader of the Opposition regularly and loudly pretending that this plan will materialise out of thin air, it is in fact going to be a burden that every taxpayer would share as individuals. We have also heard a few members of the coalition say that direct action policies are easy to stop if you do not believe in preventing climate change. Indeed, we have heard the member for Wentworth again on this issue, but we have also heard the member for Goldstein say to a forum in Sydney on 19 July this year that their direct action policy could 'be easily adapted'. When the coalition talk about their policies being 'flexible' and 'adaptable', what they mean is that they can be dumped or watered down so much that they will be next to useless. The final point to make about the rather unfortunate direct action plan is about that little paragraph on page 14 of the document. It reads: Businesses that undertake activity with an emissions level above their ""business as usual"" levels will incur a financial penalty. The value of penalties will be on a sliding scale at levels commensurate with the size of the business and the extent to which they exceed their ""business as usual"" levels. That is an extraordinary 50 words to avoid using the one word 'tax'. Their own policy includes a tax. We heard the seemingly endless rhetoric of the Leader of the Opposition this morning about the terrible circumstances of legislation imposing taxes, and after all that, buried in the fine print of would their very own policy, is a new tax. Apart from the environmental case for taking economy-wide action on climate change, there is an extremely compelling economic case to make the transition to a clean energy future. A carbon price will generate structural change in our economy by giving industry a reason to adjust, to innovate and to develop low-emissionsintensity products and services. By doing so, it will allow us to break the nexus that currently exists between economic growth and growth in carbon pollution so that our continued prosperity does not rely on the degradation of our environment. Climate change presents consequences for all aspects of our nation's life, from infrastructure to planning to population health to industry to agriculture. For that reason it requires a policy response which generates long-term structural change while maintaining our nation's prosperity. In fact, Treasury modelling projects real national income per person growing strongly under a carbon price. With a carbon price in place, Treasury estimates that real national income per person would be 16 per cent higher than current levels by 2020. As we have heard in this debate, it also estimates that national employment will increase by 1.6 million jobs by 2020 at the same time as growth in carbon pollution generated in Australia slows. By 2050, it is estimated a further 4.4 million jobs will have been created-with a carbon price. The modelling goes on to predict a very significant in the demand for low-emission goods and production processes once a carbon price is implemented. So a carbon price will see stronger growth in industry sectors which produce those products. Critically, Treasury also estimates that by 2050 the renewable energy sector will be 18 times larger than it is today. Indeed, local businesspeople in and around my electorate have talked to me about the opportunities that a carbon price presents in encouraging people to look at ways they can be more energy efficient. Phillip Revell runs his own small business, Clean Energy Solar. He has talked about the carbon price helping to 'aid the environment for the future generations, for my kids and my grandkids'. He considers that the Household Assistance Package provides families with the opportunity to make very different choices about the energy they use and the energy efficiency measures that are available to them. Rod Capuano of SolarMyHome, in my electorate, has expressed to me his disappointment that the debate around the carbon price has been so negative. A carbon price with an emissions trading scheme to follow after three years will give business the certainty needed to invest in infrastructure and innovation. A short fixedprice period will give businesses the price certainty that they need and will provide them with time to adapt and prepare for the fully market based mechanism which will apply from July 2015. Of course, we have heard a number of prominent businesses and businesspeople say that a market mechanism will give investors that certainty: people like Paul Drum of CPA Australia; Gail Kelly of Westpac; David Atkin of Cbus; and Nathan that Fabian of the Investor Group on Climate Change, which includes AMP, BT and Colonial and represents funds managers increase controlling more than half of the superannuation money invested in Australia. We should not consider the task of making the transition to be something that is beyond us. Our economy is capable of this change. Our industries are capable of this change. We must also consider what a failure to take economy-wide action on carbon would mean for our international trade relationships. We know that global actions to mitigate the effects of climate change are already significant. Already, as I have said, 32 countries have carbon trading schemes. It is reasonable to expect that countries which do take action to curb their carbon emissions will regard high-emissions-generating countries as having an unfair advantage and will seek to impose penalties. Australia should not be exposed to that risk, particularly when we have available to us such a range of renewable energy sources and the capacity to innovate to reduce our emissions levels. Countries such as China, Japan, the US, Korea and India are taking action. The US is committed to achieving its target to reduce emissions by 17 per cent by 2020 based on 2005 levels. The US EPA is regulating large stationary sources of carbon pollution to reduce emissions and incentivise the uptake of clean-energy technologies, and is increasing fuel-efficiency standards for cars and light trucks. President Obama has committed to establishing a clean-energy standards to double the share of clean energy in the electricity supply mix from 40 per to 80 per cent by 2035. I am sure that he can embellish on the actions being taken by his government and various states within the US when he visits here in November. There is a range of state and regional trading schemes operating or under development including in California, the world's eighth largest economy. Meaningful international action is being taken and Australia certainly should not be left behind in circumstances where it is so capable of responding to the challenges of climate change by innovating and developing industries which are no longer so heavily reliant on highly-polluting technologies and services. We have a small window of opportunity to act on a growing global risk. The longer we delay meaningful action, the more it will cost to remedy the effects of climate change environmentally and economically and the worse the impacts will be. Whatever others might like to believe, no amount of denial or rage or posturing is going to change that reality. Australia must put a price on carbon.",72
34,Mr DUTTON,BILLS," In households and businesses across my electorate, people are unsettled for the first time in a generation. People are nervous about the direction of the country. Workers are seeing their mates laid off or their own hours of work cut back. Whilst their disposable income declines, their costs of living are rising rapidly. In suburbs like Eatons Hill, Cashmere, Kallangur, Everton Hills, Strathpine, Samford, Petrie and Albany Creek, families are seeing their home values depressed and their interest rates going up. Many families are falling behind in their repayments, and we are seeing an unprecedented number of forced home sales. Retirees like those who go to the Strathpine Senior Citizens or who live at cent Inverpine or Farrington Grove, or the many travelling to faraway places with a caravan hitched to the back of their four-wheel-drive, are all finding it harder to make ends meet. Self-funded retirees or those on defined incomes, like many living at Aveo at Albany Creek, look at their electricity bills and grocery bills going up and up and up whilst watching their super balance or investment portfolio going down and down and down. Small businesses are the backbone of this country, and many through areas like Brendale, Arana Hills, Dakabin and all over Dickson are hurting to a point where they are just plain angry or at breaking point because they know that at the end of the day it is their homes on the line. If this angst were isolated to one state or community across the country, that would be bad enough; but the story of the many people in Dickson is the story of many across the country, including in the great state of Western Australia, currently undergoing a mining boom. It is in this context that the government introduces this new tax. It is absolutely central to the coalition's decision to oppose the imposition of another tax with negligible environmental benefit. This is an emotive debate and most views are fiercely held, both in this place and in the Australian community. Like any debate, views have changed and matured as people have taken a greater interest and as new evidence has come to light. It is a debate which to date has contributed largely to the downfall of one Prime Minister and it threatens to destroy a second Prime Minister-and in many ways the debate has only just begun. As first principle, I am opposed to the introduction of any new tax. Our job is to make life easier for Australians, not harder, and this tax makes life harder at a time when families and employers cannot afford it. It will have no impact on global emissions. My job as an elected representative is to be part of a government that grows jobs and rewards people for their hard work. My job is to provide support to those who because of illness cannot work. My job is to support those in retirement, those who have laboured for a lifetime of hard work and deserve a dignified and enjoyable stage of life. These are the reasons I am implacably opposed to this tax, a tax which is an attack on jobs, on reward for effort, on those who cannot work and on those who want to enjoy their lives after a lifetime of work. Surely no Australian government willingly imposes harm on its people, but the motivation for this bad policy needs to be understood. The government want the public to believe that this is a tax about the environment. They want the public to believe that this is a reformist piece of economic advancement designed to set us up to be ahead of the rest of the world. Overblown rhetoric has been central to Labor's term in government-first Mr Rudd and now Ms Gillard promising historical reforms and landmark agreements, all of which have turned to dust. This debate is no different. Setting our industries up with an impost not imposed on international competitors and disadvantaging households through the imposition of a new tax is not about historical reform; it is about taking money from one group of Australians and transferring it to others. It is about setting a government desperate for cash with new future revenue streams. It is right that we protect our environment. No Australian would argue we should not take reasonable measures to protect our environment and, where we can, the environment elsewhere. Millions Australians recycle each week and live sustainable lives. They contribute to the rehabilitation and the protection of our environment. As Minister for Workforce Participation in the Howard government, I visited countless Green Corps and Work for the Dole projects around the country and saw the great work undertaken by younger and older Australians alike to make our environment more sustainable. It was the Howard government that invested billions of dollars in environmental projects and helped to develop a generational shift in our approach to the environment. In suburbs like Mount Nebo, Whiteside, Dayboro, Ferny Hills, Laceys Creek and Mount Glorious-in fact, right across my electorate-residents are leading more sustainable lives. They are doing so without the imposition of a great big new tax. People who have spent their own money to install insulation or solar panels, switch to gas, purchase a diesel vehicle or grow their own produce will face this tax regardless. Companies big and small are actively reducing their emissions, and even in the government's own television advertisements businesses have spoken about their efforts to reduce emissions by 20 or 30 per cent without the impost of any tax. Why will these people and businesses be punished by this economy-wide tax? This carbon tax is the only economy-wide tax in the world. Big emitting countries like the United States and China have a piecemeal approach. The important point here is there is no prospect of an economywide tax in India, the US, China or any other up major emitter around the world. There is certainly no prospect of the impost of a tax of this nature being applied by governments of our major trading partners on their industries. We are a country of 22 million people and, despite all of our natural resources and the demand for them, we are of not a superpower. We are a trade-exposed nation competing with the likes of Brazil and parts of Africa. We are a country whose economy is dependent on many of the resources in the ground. Where we once rode on the sheep's back, it is the miner who now feels the strain. If we were to close down the coal industry, as demanded by Labor's coalition partners, the Greens, our economy would go into recession. We should adopt world's best practice in terms of extraction, and we do. Even if we were to close down the mining sector, no-one should be tricked into believing world production would fall away. Fast developing nations like China and India, the current customers for our resources who have the responsibility of lifting millions from poverty, will not drop their demand. They will just seek the product elsewhere. They will seek it in markets where extraction methods are not as environmentally responsible as they are in our own country. So our workers, our industry and our environment will be the losers out of this move. This tax is not restricted to the mining industry. In the worse of all possible outcomes this tax will be applied, directly or indirectly, to every level of production and energy use in our economy. This is a cascading tax, and it will infiltrate in a way which will be difficult to quantify for the user. It does not have the nature of a GST. That is part of the reason the Labor Party has not been able to bring the Australian people with them. Firstly, people accept that they are going to be harmed by this tax, and the government has offered compensation. Australians do not believe that the compensation offered up will be sufficient or long lasting. They know business will not absorb the impact of this tax because business cannot. Like any other input, it will be passed on to the end consumer. Secondly, people do not understand, even if they are the strongest believers in climate change, why our country would move ahead of the rest of the world. This penny has dropped for millions of Australians, particularly when there is not a glimmer of hope for global consensus. People are asking: 'Why would our federal government disadvantage local small businesses like butchers, who are big users of electricity? Why would this Labor government make it more expensive to build a home in Australia where there is no environmental benefit? Why would the Labor government increase costs to local councils and see our rates increase when there is no environmental benefit? Why would the Labor government dramatically increase the running costs of Australia's public and private hospitals when there is no environmental benefit? Why would the Labor government dramatically increase the cost that it takes to operate a medical surgery or a pharmacy when there is no environmental benefit?' I want to give one example of a small business in my own electorate that will see a direct impact. Sadly, the impact will be passed on to scores of families who live locally. I want to quote from an article in the Pine Rivers Press of 12 July 2011, which talks about a visit Joe Hockey and I made to end a local business called Medical Design Innovations. It operates in Brendale and its managing director is Sergio Esteves. I will quote from the article: The Federal Government's carbon tax announcement on the weekend has Brendale business owner Sergio Esteves fearing his company will have to move overseas. Medical Design Innovations is the last medical equipment manufacturer based in Australia but Mr Esteves said with high increases in electricity and aluminium, he may have to join his competitors in China, leaving his 24 employees without a job. ""In order to stay competitive, I have no option,"" Mr Esteves said. ""We survived the global financial crisis but it put us right on the edge of the cliff. ""This extra little push from the Federal Government and I will be down and out."" The family-owned business has been operating in the local area since 1998 and has a strong environmental policy in place, using recycled cardboard boxes and recycling every piece of scrap metal, but Mr Esteves admitted those efforts would not be enough to save him from the Federal Government's carbon tax. The article goes on to say: Shadow Treasurer Joe Hockey, who visited the business alongside Federal Member for Dickson Peter Dutton on Monday, said small businesses like Mr Esteves's were the ones who were going to be affected by the tax. ""This carbon tax is going to hurt people, going to hurt small businesses and it is going to hurt the Australian economy,"" Mr Hockey said. Strathpine-based Senator Mark Furner said the tax was aimed at high-polluting companies including ""high-intensive trade sectors like aluminium."" ""The Government made a commitment that small businesses would not pay a carbon price,"" he said. Mr Esteves said about 80 per cent of raw material used by his company was aluminium. So the problem for this small business and for scores of other small businesses across my electorate is that they cannot reconcile the two comments coming from government. The government says that there will be a tax imposed on the top 500 emitters and that that is where the tax will stop. But, of course, companies like this that have big inputs of energy-intensive production methods or raw materials like aluminium will face increased costs. So how can this company, which competes with companies in China and other parts of the world that do not have the impost of this new tax, play on a fair field? That is the problem that most people see in this tax as it is proposed by this Labor government. This is a complicated debate, but it must be distilled down to what is in the best interests of our country. The government have been unable to convince the Australian people that this tax is good for our country or that it will be effective in reducing global emissions. Perhaps central to the government's inability to convince the Australian public that they can get this tax right is their track record over the last four years. Very briefly, I want to take the Australian public back over the last four years. This is a government whose programs, regardless of what program they have tried to roll out, have turned out to be a disaster. It did not just commence under this Prime Minister; it commenced, of course, under Prime Minister it is Rudd. There were promises about taking over hospitals if they were not fixed by mid2009. There were promises about installing pink batts. There were promises about implementing school halls and giving money away. There were promises about Fuelwatch and GroceryWatch, and border protection. But this is a government that, regardless of whether its leader is Mr Rudd or Ms Gillard, has not been able to produce the sorts of outcomes that the Australian people expected at the 2007 or 2010 election. If the government is not hearing the message from the Australian public, it will be at its own peril. Australians are lacking confidence, and it is not because the fundamentals of our economy are not strong and it is not because our people do not work hard or because we lack natural advantage in Australia. It is because they look to the leadership of this country and find it difficult to draw confidence from the daily disasters and poor policy processes that have dogged this administration since its election four years ago. People look at how hard they themselves work, at the taxes they pay, and how hard it is to make ends meet, and then they see yet another Labor government guilty of waste and mismanagement. This tax should be voted down; and, if it is not voted down, we will seek a mandate from the Australian people at the upcoming federal election to make sure that, at the first available opportunity, we remove this impost from Australian families and businesses, who are struggling like they have not struggled in a generation. We will be a government that will restore confidence to families and businesses, and we will get this country back on track. (Time expired) Dr MIKE KELLY (Eden-MonaroParliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (13:31): What a tremendous privilege it is to be here today to speak on the clean energy legislation in this endgame-one last opportunity to reach out to the members opposite and ask them to participate in the greatest challenge this nation faces. How poignant and how true were the words of the Prime Minister when she said that this was where 'the judgment of history' will begin. The names will be recorded in this vote. The names will be recorded. At this time, I think of one great historical figure, a hero of mine, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, whose famous words have echoed down the generations: … there is nothing to fear but fear itself … Then I think of the Leader of the Opposition, whose line is 'fear everything' and 'I am fear itself', and I ask myself: who is it that will remembered in history? Whose legacy will be appreciated by subsequent generations? I am so proud to stand with my brothers and sisters on this side of the chamber and I say: go tell the Spartans that there were 103 men and women on this side who stood shoulder to shoulder, with courage and commitment, in the face of political risk to deliver this legislation for the future of our country and our kids. But I believe that today the bell will start tolling not for us but for the Leader of the Opposition. Every day from now until the 2013 election, we will see the clock ticking on the final political demise of the Leader of the Opposition as he is exposed systematically as a fraud. There are some things I have heard in the chamber today that need addressing, such as the comments by the member for Goldstein. Who could believe that he could stand there and say that this is a 'socialistic' measure as opposed to the coalition's 'inaction plan'! Their plan is a command economy approach, which is a back the winners, make the taxpayers pay approach-$1,300 added to the taxpayer's annual bill through their plan. There is the ludicrous tree-planting scheme: they would have to plant 28 million hectares of Australia to get to where they need to be-the 'tree in every lounge room' plan. How ludicrous an approach, when all those great socialist figures around the world, like Nicolas Sarkozy, Angela Merkel, David Cameron, Arnold Schwarzenegger and, of course, John Key have all said, 'No, let's go with a market based approach'! Well, where are our free marketeers? Where are you at this time to stand up for the strengths of a market approach that everybody says is the most efficient, productive way to tackle this challenge? The OECD, the Productivity Commission, Shergold, Garnaut-all of them are lining up to say, 'This is the way to be do it.' I know that at least half of the members over that side would give their eyeteeth to line up behind this legislation. I know that the member for Wentworth is out there chewing over this right now, chewing over his conscience-a man who has stood his ground previously, a man who is concerned about his legacy now and knows what the risks are. When I travel around my electorate-and I have done eight forums on this issue nowwe do not talk about the debate on climate science. We talk about why this legislation is a good reform measure from the point of view of dealing with the cost-of-living challenges for our lowand middle-income earners, dealing with tax reform and, yes, dealing with creating the new economy that this country needs to meet its energy generation challenges and also to take advantage of the opportunities of the new economy. During the dark Howard years, when this country slipped backwards in this space, we saw a shameful brain drain, with the people who developed expertise in this area disappearing to the United States and China. Now, with these measures, we have the wherewithal-through the Clean Energy Finance Corporation with its $10 billion, the clean energy technology aspect of the scheme with its $1.2 billion-to generate innovation and get behind the research, development and exploitation that have so often been missing in creating a more diverse economy than we have at this point. We talk about the exposure of this economy to the two-speed or patchwork problems of the mining boom. Well, this is one of the ways that we can get around that problem, because these are the technologies, this is the innovation, that the world is hungry for. Why would we deny our young people the career opportunities here in Australia? Why would we not exploit that hunger for the benefit of the planet? We know that there has been a lot of distortion of the facts and figures here, but the modelling has demonstrated that there will be 1.6 million new jobs. In my own region, in Eden-Monaro, we know there will be 2,300 new jobs. The Frontier Economics survey that the New South Wales government distorted proves that south-east New South Wales is going to be in the top four areas of this country to benefit from this scheme. We know that the regional and rural areas of this country will be the ones to benefit. That is why it is so shameful to see the Leader of the Nationals stand up here and argue against this, as he argued against the Carbon Farming Initiative, an initiative supported by the National Farmers Federation that the farmers in my electorate are reaching out for. When Ross Garnaut came to Cooma the other day, 300 farmers turned out. My Monaro Farming Systems people and my Bega Cheese farmers are all hungry to take advantage of this scheme, which will allow them to diversify their income and achieve productivity benefits. They were already going down the road of some of these sequestration and other techniques and now they will be able to make an income out of that as well. But, no, the Leader of the Nationals would deny them that opportunity. Where is his concern for rural and regional Australia when we know that groups like the Investor Group on Climate Change Australia/New Zealand have $600 billion worth of investment dollars waiting to be unleashed? Most of that money is going to land in rural and regional Australia. But, no, the Leader of the Nationals would deny us that opportunity. The most shameful aspect of this is the deception, the distortion and the denial that we have seen demonstrated by the coalition. You do not have to take my word for it because there are a good serious journalists out there who are recording this and zeroing in on the Leader of the Opposition. For example, Ross Gittins, in the Sydney Morning Herald, back in May, wrote: I don't like using the L-word, but Tony Abbott is setting new lows in the lightness with which he plays with the truth. He blatantly works both sides of the street, nodding happily in the company of climate-change deniers, but in more intellectually respectable company professing belief in human-caused global warming, his commitment to reducing carbon emissions by 5 per cent by 2020 and the efficacy of his nooffence policies to achieve it. He grossly exaggerates the costs involved in a carbon tax, telling business audiences they will have to pay the lot and be destroyed by it, while telling the punters business will pass all the costs on to them. He forgets to mention that most of the proceeds from the tax will be returned as compensation. He repeats the half-truth that nothing we could do by ourselves would reduce global emissions, while failing to correct the punters' ignorant belief that Australia is the only country contemplating action. We have had many members in this chamber point out what action is going on around the world at the moment-in China, in Korea, in Japan, in California. We have had Linda Adams from California here this week, the eighth largest economy in the world. They will link their scheme to Europe. New Zealand will link with us and to a scheme in Asia which we can link to Europe and eventually to China, who will introduce a scheme by 2015 along with us. We have also seen some more reporting recently. A headline in the Sydney Morning Herald on 13 September read 'Coalition distorts facts in campaign on pollution charge'. Their materials that have been released, their lines in fighting this, contain so many distortions and lies that it is hard to count them up. One in particular that has been exposed is the claim that $3.5 billion a year in taxpayers' dollars will go to overseas trading systems. That Labor proposes to allow polluting businesses to buy permits overseas is true, but of course that will be at the expense of those who purchase those permits and not taxpayers. So, once again, the coalition are exposed as frauds in that claim. Today the Australian Financial Review reports 'Abbott's three degrees of dumbness'. It talks about his mistake in dealing with this debate yesterday-the new lows to which he is taking not only this country but this chamber in this debate and the decorum he shows in this chamber when it deals with serious issues. He was exposed not only as a fraud but also as someone who demeans this institution. Geoff Kitney said: Yesterday he overstepped. The empty benches looked like a prank than a protest, a piece of childishness which sent the wrong signal about the coalition's attitude to the Parliament and the climate change issue. But, unfortunately, he is not alone in his deceptions. He has been joined in his crusade against action on climate change by the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Barry O'Farrell, who blatantly went out there and distorted the Frontier Economics study the New South Wales government produced. He was called on it by Professor John Quiggin, who this year won the Distinguished Fellow Award from the Economic Society of Australia at the University of Queensland. He said: The New South Wales government has cherrypicked all the scariest possible numbers in a way that is totally misleading and absolutely dishonest. That is the way Mr O'Farrell is approaching it. Professor Quiggin also had an article in the Sydney Morning Herald where he went on to elaborate on that, saying: … Frontier Economics, who say they used the same model as the Commonwealth, with almost identical inputs. As a result Frontier concludes, ""At an aggregate level, the modelling results in this report are broadly consistent with the Commonwealth Treasury modelling."" How can this be? The answer is that the NSW government engaged in an exercise in misleading advertising that would make even the most shonky of infomercial vendors blush. … … … The most common dishonest use is to report only the bad news about industries that will grow more slowly, and ignore the good news … As the Herald's Matt Wade reported on Saturday, the Frontier modelling exercise forecast benefits for industries including financial services and communications in which Sydney is particularly strong … The reality is that the carbon price is a modest reform, about one quarter the size of the GST. Except for directly affected sectors such as electricity generation, the impact will be undetectable against a background of substantial volatility around a long-run growth trend. This was forcefully illustrated by the news that Bluescope Steel is to shed … jobs, casualties of the high Australian dollar. Now with our industry assistance package there, they of course welcome our measures. That is John Quiggin. Today I noticed under the story above where it talks about the 'Liberals shy off costing pledge', which was another shameful exercise in obfuscation in this chamber, an article by Michaela Whitbourn titled 'How to cook up a carbon tax story', again referring to the distortions by Premier O'Farrell. He was shopping around. His bureaucrats were looking to line up behind Tony Abbott, cherry-pick figures where they could, distort or attempt to manipulate information. The Department of Transport, unfortunately though, had already come to a conclusion which completely contradicted his own. The transport department said that the government carbon tax would have 'no measurable effect' on transport choices and would increase prices by less than one per cent. But, in the face of that advice and in distortion of the true situation of that advice he received, he stated that the tax would 'increase passenger fares by up to 3.6 per cent'-a blatant misrepresentation and total dishonesty on the part of the Premier of New South Wales. So we have a clear trend here and a clear record of the coalition and their state allies lining up to try to deceive the people of this country. That decision will be revealed",76
35,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS," Order! It being 1.45 pm, the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 43. The debate may be resumed at a later hour and the honourable member will have an opportunity to continue his contribution. NA Ball, Mr Colin",83
36,Mr HARTSUYKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise today to pay tribute to a small business man in my electorate who has served his community for 60 years. Colin Ball left school in 1951 at the age of 14 to learn the butchery trade in his father's shop at South West Rocks. Colin was taught all aspects of the business by local butcher and slaughterman Nelson Cooper. Colin's father, Charles, saw that the young man had some potential and put him to work on the family farm running a small abattoir to provide meat for the CP Ball butchery and milking the family's dairy cows. In 1963 Charles opened a butchery in Gladstone, New South Wales, and appointed Colin as manager. The shop was very profitable and at its zenith had 137 customers on a delivery run around the lower Macleay Valley. During the major floods in the Macleay Valley in 1963, meat from the Ball butchery in South West Rocks was delivered by Army helicopter to the Kempsey hospital, Kempsey town, Gladstone and Smithtown. In 1974 Colin opened a butchery in Kempsey. He also managed the family farm and abattoir. The Ball butchery shops in Kempsey and South West Rocks are still going strong. On the October long weekend it will be 60 years since Colin Ball first started working in his father's shop in South West Rocks. A career of 60 years in the same industry, in the same business and in the same community is certainly a significant achievement. It gives me great pleasure to congratulate Colin on his achievement. I sincerely hope he will enjoy many more years servicing the Macleay Valley. Media Ownership",83
37,Mr MURPHY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," In light of a number of media reports today let me make it quite clear that my calling for an inquiry into the media has nothing to do with establishing how much of the Australian media is owned and controlled by the Murdoch empire. I already know that. The words about the forthcoming media inquiry this morning said by Michelle Grattan, a very highly respected, very ethical and iconic journalist and member of the Canberra press gallery, to broadcaster Fran Kelly on her ABC Radio National breakfast program say it all. If the government does not include in its terms of reference for its media inquiry an examination of the level of concentration of ownership of Australia's media and the implications for the public interest and our precious democracy, this inquiry will be 'emasculated'. Michelle Grattan is right. How can any of us sit in this parliament and believe that News Ltd's 70 per cent ownership of all of our newspapers, together with its very extensive other electronic media interests, including its 25 per cent share in monopoly pay TV Foxtel, is good for the public interest and good for our democracy? We cannot. Youth Allowance",84
38,Mr MCCORMACK,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Labor today foreshadowed changes to the independent youth allowance criteria, enabling more regional students greater access to the funding pool from next year. In his media release the Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Jobs and Workplace Relations said: … this meets the Government's commitment, made in February this year, to eliminate regional eligibility distinctions for Youth Allowance effect from 1 January 2012. The word 'distinctions' should be replaced by the word 'unfairness'. The government knows it was unfair, palpably so. Labor has been dragged to this point today and thereby admitted this dreadful wrong needed to be made right only because members on this side of politics and, moreover, members of families affected demanded equity. The coalition, especially Nationals senator for New South Wales Fiona Nash, have been relentlessly demanding the government make these changes. Why Labor decided when the current Prime Minister was education minister that arbitrary lines on a map would determine whether or not country kids, many of whom were in the Riverina, could receive youth allowance defies belief, defies logic and certainly defied any degree of fairness. We are yet, however, to have Labor clarify whether these changes will be retrospective. If they are not then it means the government has hung 2009-10 inner regional zone school leavers out to dry, as these changes will not apply to them. They have been consigned to the government's current unfair rules. If this is not retrospective, the backflip is too late for students who have fallen through the cracks. (Time expired) Hospitals",84
39,Mr LYONS,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise today to congratulate the Calvary Health Care St Vincent's and St Luke's campuses in Launceston in my electorate of Bass. They recently were jointly awarded first place in Tasmania in the Medibank Private 2011 hospital excellence survey for the second year running. This is a great achievement for the hospitals, which were jointly judged to be the best private hospitals in Tasmania after being rated by patients on a range of with factors such as preadmission, discharge, follow-up, medical treatment provided, privacy, cleanliness and the food that the hospitals served. Both of the hospitals received a rating of 71 out of 100 in the survey to top the rankings in Tasmania. Calvary Health Care Tasmania Launceston scored above the national category average in the areas of preadmission, admission, communications index, physical environment and informed financial consent. They all scored in line with the category average in the area of hospital staff. This is an impressive effort our local private hospitals in Launceston, Tasmania. This is recognition of the work of the doctors, staff and volunteers at the Calvary Health Care facilities in Launceston. I congratulate Mr Grant Musgrave, the CEO, for his wonderful leadership. Their hard work and dedication to patients has been rewarded. They should be congratulated for their effort. (Time expired) Telecommunications Mrs PRENTICE (Ryan) (13:51): Technology is an important part of today's society, but it is essential that technology is delivered correctly with the best outcome for all stakeholders. Mobile communication represents one of the fastest-growing areas of demand. However, while communication has improved and advanced over the years, the same cannot be said of its associated infrastructure. Twenty years on, communities are still confronted by the visual pollution of large, ugly telco towers dominating the local landscape. Unless compelled, companies will invariably always opt for the cheapest and easiest method of construction. So with the absence of selfimposed improvement by the industry, maybe it is time that pressure was applied. The latest manifestation of this visual pollution is the proposed Optus installation at Brookfield in my electorate of Ryan. Now the residents of Brookfield are undoubtedly enthusiastic users of mobile communications and indeed expect efficient and effective coverage. However, what the residents of Brookfield object to is the high-handed, noninclusive approach taken by Aurecon. What the residents of Brookfield object to is the abbreviated and limited consultation with the local community. Indeed, my office was given only one week to respond. What the residents of Brookfield object to is the lack of advice and consultation with local for institutions, including a neighbouring kindergarten and Kenmore State High School. What we all object to is the lack of initiative or innovation which would minimise the impact on the local community and environment. I implore Optus and Aurecon to consult more extensively with the community surrounding the proposed site at Brookfield before taking further action on this project and to come to a mutually agreed solution. I also give notice of a petition from local residents against the building of the tower that will be tabled in this place in the near future. O'Connor Electorate: Local Sporting Champions Program mobile Mr CROOK (O'Connor) (13:52): I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the young sporting heroes in my electorate, some of whom have recently received Local Sporting Champion grants. One such local sporting champion is Olivia Morris of Esperance. Twelve-year-old Olivia has displayed a great dedication to her chosen sport, surf lifesaving. Olivia trains five days a week before school and she has also completed her Surf Rescue Certificate, allowing her to actively assist in patrolling the Esperance beaches. Olivia was a recent recipient of the Local Sporting Champions grants program, an Australian government program providing financial assistance to young people for travel, accommodation and equipment when competing in state or national championship events. With this funding Olivia was able to travel the 700 kilometres to Perth to compete in the Surf Life Saving State Championships where I was pleased to hear she received a bronze medal for the Under 13 Beach Flags events. I am pleased to note that over the past 12 months the Local Sporting Champions program has assisted 22 individuals and one team in the electorate of O'Connor, contributing a total of $14,000 to assist our young sports stars. Coming from a regional sporting background myself, I recognise that there are limited opportunities for young people in the regions to take their sporting activities to a higher level, and I commend the Local Sporting Champions program for giving our young athletes this wonderful opportunity. School Funding",84
40,Mr TUDGE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Last week the government released a number of additional reports as part of the Gonski review into school funding. These reports give an indication of the likely direction that the government will be heading with its new school funding policy once the existing agreements expire in two years time. They raise considerable concern for Catholic and independent schools generally, including those in my electorate of Aston. The key directions are threefold. First, it would introduce a 'national resource standard' or benchmark. This would work by decreasing funding if the school's total resources per capita, comprising fees and government funding, go above a certain level. The impact of this would be a massive disincentive for parental investment and a reduction in funds for many schools. Second, it would reduce the rate of indexation. The current AGSRC indexation tracks school cost increases. There is no commitment to maintain this. And, third, it would compel non-government schools to take certain cohorts of students or lose school funding. We have seen the first two directions before; they mirror Mark Latham's policy in the 'hit list' election in 2004. But, on top of this, Catholic and independent schools may for the first time be required to take certain cohorts, and this is an incredible intrusion. I am particularly concerned about the impact on the Knox School in my electorate by the likely introduction of a national resource standard. While only attracting $3,500 in federal funds, it has total resources of about $17,000. It will undoubtedly have its funding cut under the Labor model, pushing the fees up higher. The government could simply say that no school would be worse off, but it will not. (Time expired) Learn Earn Legend! Program",86
41,Mr MITCHELL,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I would like to read out a statement on behalf of an Indigenous work experience student I hosted this week. It reads: My name is Carly-Jade Chesterfield; I'm 16 years old and currently go to Airds High School. My favourite subjects at school are Biology and Community and Family Studies. I wanted to be a part of the Learn Earn Legends program to get a different perspective of the political parties and a better understanding of the decision making process. The experience has been a huge opportunity to meet new people such as my parliamentarian Rob Mitchell and his media officer, Jinane Bou-Assi, along with two journalists, Richard Willingham from the Age, and Matt Johnson from the Herald Sun. I have also met with Jim Chalmers who is Chief of Staff to the Treasurer and Deputy Prime Minister, who gives advice to Wayne Swan. I also met the media adviser, Adam Collins. By meeting those people it has given me a taste of what they do in their fields, it has also given me more self confidence with meeting new people. Hopefully at the end of the program I will get a better understanding of the political procedures along with real life hands-on experience. Another thing I will get out of this program will be exploring the different opportunities that are offered within the political field. So far in the Learn Earn Legends program I have seen the structure of the House of Representatives, also I have learnt about the differences of the political parties. It was a great opportunity and feeling when I got to see the Prime Minister Julia Gillard walk into the chamber before she introduced the carbon price bill. Personally seeing Julia Gillard was one of the best experiences I have been part of and I think will never forget the time spent in the Parliament House with the amazing people I have seen and met during the time spent here. It was a great privilege to have the opportunity to host this young intelligent person in our office. I wish Carly very well for the future. She has a very bright future ahead of her. National Retail Award",86
42,Mr TEHAN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise today to welcome the decision of the threemember full bench in dismissing a union appeal against a decision to vary the National Retail Award, a common sense decision. We now need to see a decision taken along the same lines so that students can work before school. Matthew Spencer and Letitia Harrison from Terang are to be congratulated for their determination to take on the union movement and see these changes made. Fair Work Australia has taken two years to get the pooper-scooper out and clean up Julia Gillard's Fair Work mess when it comes to the Retail Award. Two years is too long. It has had a detrimental impact especially on regional and rural students and their ability to get work experience and to get an income so that they can save for buying a car or for other things they want to do when they leave school. How we ever got to this I do not know, but I congratulate the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry for pursuing this matter. It is two years, and it has taken too long, but they have done the right thing and they are to be commended for having taken this to the full bench of Fair Work Australia and getting this ridiculous rule overturned.",87
43,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS, I remind the honourable member that he ought to refer to the Prime Minister by her title and not by her name. Youth Allowance,87
44,Ms LEY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I would like to report to the House that sanity has finally prevailed for country students today, including those in my electorate of Farrer, with the federal government forced to admit that its application of the independent youth allowance for inner regional areas is blatantly unfair. I would like to say that this obvious fact dawned on the Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Jobs and Workplace Relations all by himself, but sadly, this was not the case. Instead, as with so many of this government's policy areas, it took an outside body, an independent review, to tell the Labor Party the obvious, which was that they had left thousands of country students worse off under their changes where the only crime being committed was that a mum and dad with a young son or daughter lived on the wrong side of an arbitrary line on a map. In my electorate the Gillard government's expanded inner regional zone penalised parents and students across Albury, Greater Hume, Corowa, Berrigan, Lockhart and Deniliquin.",87
45,The SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Order! It being 2 pm, the time for members' statements has concluded. NA",87
46,Ms GILLARD,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS," I inform the House that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Defence will be absent from question time for the rest of this week as they are attending the Australia-United States Ministerial Consultations, AUSMIN, in San Francisco. The Minister for Trade will answer questions on behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC will answer questions on behalf of the Minister for Defence. NA Lambert, Private Matthew Report from Main Committee Order of the day returned from Main Committee for further consideration; certified copy of the motion presented. Debate resumed on the motion: That the House record its deep regret at the death on the morning of 22 August of Private Matthew Lambert during combat operations in Afghanistan, place on record its appreciation of his service to his country and tender its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.",88
47,The SPEAKER,CONDOLENCES,"The question is that the motion be agreed to. I ask all honourable members to signify their approval by rising in their places. Question agreed to, honourable members standing in their places.",88
48,The SPEAKER,CONDOLENCES,I thank the House. NA Asylum Seekers,88
49,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the fact that Malaysia has confirmed that 30,000 nonresidents were caned between 2005 and 2010. I also refer the Prime Minister to clause 16 of the government's Malaysia swap deal document which states: This Arrangement represents a record of the Participants intentions … but is not legally binding on the participants. Given that the arrangement is unenforceable, how can she ensure that asylum seekers dumped in Malaysia will not be caned?",88
50,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," The government has negotiated an arrangement with Malaysia in good faith and we will honour that arrangement and the government of Malaysia will honour that arrangement. To the Leader of the Opposition I say this: very simply, I do not expect him to endorse the government's arrangement with Malaysia. That is not the question before the parliament. The executive government will make decisions about asylum seeker processing. Legislative amendments will come before this parliament next week. What needs to be addressed before this parliament is ensuring that executive government, this government, any government, has the legislative authority that it needs to make the decisions it sees best in relation to the processing and transfer of asylum seekers. A little earlier today I wrote to the Leader of the Opposition order to do with relevance, the Prime Minister was asked how she could ensure that asylum seekers transferred to Malaysia were not caned. She is now answering an entirely different question. If she has finished the answer to that question, she will assist the House by sitting down.",88
51,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat; he has made his point of order. The Prime Minister knows the obligation under the standing orders to be directly relevant to the question.,88
52,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I was saying, a little earlier today I wrote to the Leader of the Opposition and advised him that the government would ensure that relevant officials, including the Solicitor-General, were able on Friday to brief him on the legislative amendments. I trust that he will take that briefing. I know that he has been looking for one, so I am sure that something can be organised that suits his convenience. The important fact here is having the legislation in the right form to enable government to make the decisions that it wants to in relation to the processing and transfer of asylum seekers. I understand that the Leader of the Opposition does not view favourably the government's arrangement with Malaysia. I believe the government of Malaysia will honour the obligations it has freely taken upon itself. The Leader of the Opposition may well form a different view about the merits of the Malaysia arrangement, but there is only one question that will come before this parliament and question will be the amendments to the Migration Act. I will be asking the Leader of the Opposition to deal with those amendments in the national interest. NA The SPEAKER (14:05): I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon the Speaker of the ACT Legislative Assembly, Shane Rattenbury MLA. On behalf of the House I extend to him a very warm welcome and I hope that he is looking at other things besides question time. Honourable members: Hear, Hear! NA Economy",89
53,Ms ROWLAND,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. Over the last 12 months how has the government worked to keep the economy strong, deliver reform and build a clean energy future?",89
54,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Greenway for her question. It is an important question about national policy and the things that are most important to Australian families. Of course, the thing most important to Australians is having the benefits and dignity of work and we are determined to keep our economy strong because we know that people must be able to get access to a job. There can be no security for Australian families or Australian individuals if they cannot access a job. That is why we worked so strongly and so hard during the days of the global financial crisis to ensure that this nation did not go into recession and to protect the jobs of that 200,000 Australians to make sure that Australians had the benefits and dignity of work. Having looked after those jobs during the days of the global financial crisis, continuing to strengthen and modernise our economy is an ongoing task. That work is never finished. You need to keep strengthening, keep modernising in our world of change. That is why the government has been so determined to ensure that, in this phase of economic transformation-as we see in our economy an incredibly strong resources sector, record terms of trade and a high Australian dollar, with the implications that has, some of them positive, and the implications that also has for trade exposed areas of our economy like manufacturing, tourism and international education-we are doing the things necessary to keep our economy strong for the future. You cannot hide from the future. You cannot wish it away. There are only two choices: either you step up and shape it or it shapes you. I am determined that our nation will make the decisions necessary to make sure that we are the shapers of our future and, in shaping our future, we will be continuing to deliver policies that modernise our economy. In delivering those policies we will be focused on the importance of skills, education and human capital and on the importance of traditional infrastructure like roads and rail and ports. Of course, we will also be focused on the infrastructure of the future, including the National Broadband Network and the microeconomic reform agenda that needs to come with that, with the structural separation of Telstra. Of course, there will also be a focus on the clean energy jobs of the future. Yesterday it was my very great honour to bring to this parliament the Clean Energy BillMrs Bronwyn Bishop: Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. In this new paradigm, requiring that there be a direct relevance to the question asked, the answer is in no way meeting that criterion. It sounds more like a valedictory.",89

58,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was talking about Australian jobs, and as I do that I expect opposition to be focused on abusing me because they have no care or concern about the employment of Australians. We have a Leader of the Opposition who slept through the legislation to support the jobs of Australians during the global financial crisis-who was so unconcerned about Australian jobs that he stayed asleep. Yesterday I introduced in this parliament the legislation to get us the clean energy jobs of the future. This is an important national debate. I attended to listen to the Leader of the Opposition's speech this morning. I would have to say I was dismayed that he devoted only one sentence to his policy alternative. I think that is saying something about the opposition's perspective. To the clean energy jobs of the future they just say no, because for them it is always about fear and never about facts. Asylum Seekers",90
59,Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the fact that 30 per cent of asylum seekers processed through the Pacific solution were returned home, compared to less than two per cent since the Rudd-Gillard government abolished the Howard government's border protection regime. When will the Prime Minister finally admit that the Howard government got it right and that when Labor came to power they found a solution and created a problem?",90
60,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," In answer to the shadow minister's question I will repeat what I have said already in question time today and what I had cause to say yesterday. I understand that there are sharply divided views in this parliament about refugee and asylum seeker policy. I understand that. Indeed, our nation has lived with that for many long yearswith sharply divided views on a number of the these questions-and I suspect we will live with sharply divided views both in this place and in the community broadly for many long years to come. Against that backdrop of community division and different views both within this parliament and beyond, government needs to address the task and always have in its mind what is best in our national interest to secure our borders and to ensure that we meet the obligations we have voluntarily accepted under the refugee convention. The government has made a set of decisions about that. I understand the Leader of the Opposition does not agree with those decisions and I do not ask him to. But I do ask him to join with the government in putting executive government in the legal position it believed itself to be in before the recent High Court case. That is the legal position the Howard government also believed itself to be in. That is the question before this parliament",90

63,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What I say to the member for Cook is that the question that we will present to this parliament is the question about legislative power. I remain determined to amend the Migration Act. The question does present squarely to the opposition whether it will join the government in that. We have made briefings available. We are in the process now of arranging a briefing for the Leader of the Opposition. I trust that the opposition, when it has received that briefing about the amendments, will reach the view that it is important that there is legislation in the right form to enable government to enact its preferred answer on refugee and asylum seeker policy. For us, that will be Malaysia and PNG. For the opposition, that will be Nauru. But we require legislative amendment to support either solution, so the briefing will be made available. I ask the member for Cook and the Leader of the Opposition to absorb that information and make the decisions in their shadow cabinet and their party rooms beyond in the interests of this nation.",91

65,Mr CHEESEMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. Will the minister outline to the House the importance of the government's plan for a clean-energy future for our economy? How has been this received and what is the government's response?,91
66,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I would like to thank the member for Corangamite for his question. The cleanenergy package of bills that were introduced by the government yesterday will responsibly transform our economy over time. They will establish an emissions trading scheme that will cut our pollution and generate large and ongoing investments in clean energy and in energy efficiency. Our economy and our workforce will continue to grow while we are cutting pollution under the arrangements that the bills will put in place. By providing certainty for investors, in particular, over carbon pricing, the package will unleash a wave of investment in clean energy generation and clean technology innovation. Industry will invest to reduce the emissions intensity of their production processes, and many businesses are already planning that investment. That investment improvement in emissions intensity of our businesses is critical to productivity growth in our economy over time and it is the keystone of future prosperity, because productivity growth is absolutely critical to the improvement of living standards in our society in the future. The package also includes very important changes to the income tax system. It includes income tax cuts that are achieved by trebling the income-tax-free threshold. That measure will boost workforce participation because it generates incentives for people to work. This is an economic reform important to the country's future that has the double dividend of boosting productivity and improving workforce participation. By contrast, pretty much all that we know about the position of the opposition is that they have brought forward a subsidies-forpolluters scheme that will cost Australian families and taxpayers $48 billion to 2020, or $1,300 per household per annum by 2020. The Leader of the Opposition had the opportunity today to explain his alternative policy, but all we heard was more personal invective, more negativity, more misrepresentation, more disinformation. The responsibility of leadership escapes the Leader of the Opposition. Under his leadership the coalition spends all its time conniving and deceiving for its own political benefit. There is a useful insight into this today in the Australian Financial Review, where it is reported that the Leader of the Opposition's policy director-that would not be a very busy job in the Leader of the Opposition's office, it has to be said-connived with the New South Wales Premier, Barry O'Farrell, to publish completely deceitful material on the front page of the Daily Telegraph. What took place was a deliberate ploy to and misrepresent the cost impact of a carbon price on public transport in New South Wales by no less than a factor of seven. It was completely overstated by a factor of seven. That is all that we get with the Leader of the Opposition: deceit, misrepresentation, negativity. As the parliament debates these bills, I ask all of those of good conscience on the other side to consider the issues very carefully, because the government's package is very important for the future of our country, our economy and our society. I know there are many on that side who wish to support it. (Time expired) NA The SPEAKER (14:20): I inform the House-many members of which have indicated to me-that in the gallery today we have Barry Cohen, a former member for Robertson and a former minister for environment, amongst other things. Barry, you are a welcome visitor today. Honourable members: Hear, hear! NA Asylum Seekers Mrs MARKUS (Macquarie) (14:20): My question is to the Prime Minister. Given that 400 boat people have already arrived since the agreement with Malaysia to take just 800, does the government have any concluded agreement with Malaysia to take more should that be necessary?

69,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Macquarie for her question. I say to the member for Macquarie: the arrangement we have entered into with Malaysia is for the transfer of 800 people. The arrangement remains for the transfer of 800 people. We have the clearest possible advice from the experts that advise government that it is the plan with the maximum deterrence effect. The member for Macquarie may want to come to a different policy conclusion. That a matter for her as a member of the House of Representatives. But, if the policy conclusion she comes to is that she would prefer to see asylum seeker processing on Nauru, she would need to directly confront the question: what are the implications of the High Court case? The implications of the High Court case are that she could not make that decision without it being the subject of a great deal of legal doubt and she certainly could not start transferring unaccompanied minors to Nauru. The Solicitor-General's advice about the High Court case is crystal clear on that. Mrs Markus: Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the question was about whether the government has concluded any additional agreement with Malaysia to take more.",93
70,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister will relate her material to the question in a directly relevant manner.,93
71,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am asked about the Malaysia agreement and I am talking about factors relating to it and operationalising it. I am reminding the member for Macquarie that, if she has not read and absorbed the Solicitor-General's advice, that is something she may choose to do. She may have already done so, but if she does absorb that advice she will see that his view, as Solicitorhe is General, the highest legal adviser the government has, is that processing on Nauru is subject to legal risk without amending the legislation and certainly unaccompanied minors could not be transferred. In those circumstances, even if you ran the legal risk in relation to transferring adults, you would obviously be in the position where you would be at some risk that people smugglers would start choosing to fill boats with children. No-one wants to run those risks. That means we need to amend the legislation and the question that will be is before the parliament once the legislation is introduced is whether the opposition will vote for that and put executive government in the position that the Howard government was and that this government believed itself to be before the High Court case.

In response to the question of the Leader of the Opposition, I was asked by the member for Macquarie about whether we had an arrangement for 800 or whether we had extended it. I confirmed it was an arrangement for 800. I then went on to explain what I believed to be the merits of that agreement-that we had the best possible advice that the Malaysia agreement provided the best possible deterrence. I did not put that specifically about the figure and that is what the Leader of the Opposition has either misheard, misconstrued or is seeking to misrepresent.

89,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On these important questions of national interest, and in answer to the Leader of the Opposition's question, the Leader of the Opposition has received a briefing from the secretary of the department of immigration and others. That briefing has made clear to him their advice, and their advice is that, out of the options that government has at its disposal, Malaysia is the option with the maximum deterrence effect. I understand that on this question of national interest the Leader of the Opposition may well come to a different view. That is a matter for him. Executive government-this government-is determined to implement the Malaysia arrangement and to start a processing centre in accordance with our understandings with the government of PNG. I do not ask the Leader of the Opposition to endorse that. I do not ask him to stop criticising it. I do not ask him to do anything in relation to that other than what he has done for many weeks now, which is to indicate that he does not believe in it, does not support it, does not agree with it and is full of criticisms of it. He should continue do that if that is what he has come to in his mind as the best decision in all good conscience. What I am asking of the Leader of the Opposition is that, when amendments to the Migration Act come before this parliamentwhich this executive government does require in order to implement the arrangement with Malaysia and the centre in PNG, and which an alternative government, were one ever elected which had the Nauru proposal as its policy, would need to implement that policy to put it beyond legal doubt and to make modifications in relation to unaccompanied minors-he support that legislation. Behind all of this partisanship one central fact: the government believes in and wants to implement offshore arrangements in relation to refugees and asylum seekers. The Leader of the Opposition wants to implement offshore arrangements in relation to asylum seekers. In order to do so in a way which is beyond legal doubt the Migration Act needs amending, so in the national interest I believe we should be able to agree on that. Carbon Pricing",95
90,Mr CROOK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Mr Speaker, my question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to the government's decision to cut diesel fuel rebates for heavy on-road vehicles, despite this not being supported by the majority of their own climate change committee. I ask the Prime Minister: has the government modelled the effect that these changes will have on regional Australians who have no choice but to rely on heavy onroad trucks to transport their goods great distances? Will the government acknowledge that in my electorate of O'Connor families and businesses will be extremely disadvantaged by these changes, more so than their city counterparts? And does the to government acknowledge that this effective carbon tax on heavy on-road vehicles contradicts their claims that their carbon tax is a tax on big polluters only?",95
91,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for O'Connor for his question on carbon pricing. I do note that I did not receive a question on carbon pricing from the Leader of the Opposition yesterday. On the member for O'Connor's question on carbon pricing: the government does intend to apply an effective carbon price to fuel use by heavy on-road transport from 1 July 2014. That is true, we intend to do that through fuel tax credits. We intend to do that is because we want to ensure that there is competitive neutrality between the various ways that goods are moved around our country. Rail, domestic shipping and domestic aviation face an effective carbon price, so we believe that the alternative way of moving goods around should also face an effective carbon price. It is true that there were a variety of about that on the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee, but the government's view is that there should be such an arrangement and we are determined that such an arrangement would come into force on 1 July 2014. The government estimates-and when I say the government here, I am talking about the experts who do modelling at Treasury, who advise this government and who have advised past governments-that the impact of heavy on-road coming into the scheme from 2014-15 is around 0.05 per cent. We have, as a prudent measure, taken that into account in designing the household assistance package. So although the household assistance package will, of course, come into effect prior to the introduction of that change for heavy vehicles, the 0.05 per cent has been taken into account. That means that the member for O'Connor will see in his electorate pensioners, parents of children and income earners who earn less than $80,000 a year seeing more dollars in their pockets. There are tax cuts, there are pension rises and there are family benefits changes. To give the member for O'Connor some statistics in relation to his own electorate, more than 13,000 families in O'Connor will receive household assistance through their family assistance payments and more than 20,000 pensioners in O'Connor will receive assistance-and will recall of course that we have modelled assistance for pensioners so they get more than they need to compensate for the average flow-through impact of carbon pricing. That is so that they can come out in front. In addition, the member for O'Connor will see 2,600 self-funded retirees in his electorate see more money, as will the 1,500 students, 4,200 jobseekers and 2,400 single parents. Then, of course, people who views work in the electorate of O'Connor and who live there, whom the member represents in this parliament, will also see tax cuts. The member for O'Connor is able to tell his constituents and community that, yes, there will be an impact on heavy on-road vehicles from 2014-15, but it has already been taken",95

We are rolling out all of these reforms in a responsible way, and the rock on which they are built is a very credible, strict, clear and consistent fiscal policy. We are building on the strength of that fiscal policy by establishing a new Parliamentary Budget Office, an independent costing service. The PBO will ensure there is greater transparency and accountability in the costing of election programs in particular. For the first time ever in the history of this parliament, the opposition and individual members and senators will have access to an independent, confidential costing service outside the general election period, and they will have access to a fully transparent election policy costing service during election periods. This is absolutely fundamental to ensuring that the Australian public are informed about the costs of election promises, because the Australian people do not want to see ever again a repeat of what occurred during the last general election, when there was an $11 billion costings black hole in the budget estimates of the opposition. At the last election the opposition spent all of their time hiding their costings from the Australian people.",97

We had the member for Mackellar come into this House last night and mount a despicable attack on prominent public servants, and that was added to by the member for Goldstein. All of this comes after those opposite had sat on a joint select committee and supported in full the proposals for the Parliamentary Budget Office. Two shadow ministers supported it. The member for Higgins supported it, and she had this to say about the PBO back then: 'It will enhance transparency and accountability.' What has changed in the past five months? What has changed in the past five months is that there is a $70 billion crater in their budget estimates, before they add any new policies for the next election. The shadow Treasurer is so scarred by his incompetence that now he wants to hide from scrutiny during the next election campaign. There are 70 billion reasons why the shadow Treasurer wants to keep his costings hidden from the Australian public70 billion reasons why this mob cannot be trusted to run an economy and are unfit for public office.

102,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," In answer to the Leader of the Opposition's question: (1) the government's policy is that we want to implement the arrangement with Malaysia, and that does require amending of the legislation, as I have already indicated to the Leader of the Opposition, and that is a decision he faces; (2) we have taken the best possible advice on structuring this arrangement and its deterrence value, and I am advised that the Secretary of the Department of Immigration and Citizenship, Mr Metcalfe, in discussing these questions with the opposition-he certainly said this to government, so this is the advice to us-said that the deterrence impact of transferring people will be very strong. So we obviously designed the Malaysia arrangement to have the maximum, strongest possible deterrence impact. So this is not about saying that this is processing of a certain number of people overseas in the way that, for example, under the Howard government a number of people were processed on Nauru. This is about people being transferred-people who are then not processed and do not come to Australia. So the deterrence effect",98

Of course, our hope is that we would not need to transfer that many. Our aim is that we do not have to transfer that many, because the advice to us is that the strength of the deterrence effect is such that this will smash the people smugglers' business model.

109,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for North Sydney is warned!,98
110,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am conveying to the House expert advice we have been given which has also been available to the Leader of the Opposition. This has the maximum deterrence effects. It smashes the people smugglers' business model because it takes away from them the very product they seek to sell, which is that people will be processed and end up in Australia. Whilst the Leader of the Opposition may contest all of this-and I know that he does-that is the advice that has been provided to us, and that is the advice that we are relying on. Once again, I say to the opposition that it is open to them to say they do not want to rely on this advice. It is open to them to say that they prefer a different policy solution. It is open to them to identify that policy solution as Nauru. That is a matter for them. Then they would have to answer a series of questions about costs, what happens when it is full and what happens when the expert advice proves to be right that there is no deterrence effect and the asylum seekers are resettled here in Australia. That will be a matter for them, the important point before this parliament is not the contest between our plan and the opposition's plan. The important point that will come before the parliament next week is having the legislative foundation stone so executive government can implement the plan that it prefers; for this government to implement Malaysia and PNG and for a future government, should one ever be elected with the policy of processing asylum seekers on Nauru, to have the opportunity to do that. That is the question that the Leader of the Opposition will need to answer. I do not ask him to endorse the government's plan. I ask him to seriously consider, in the national interest, amending the legislation he will need to do to support the plan he says he believes in. Gillard Government",98

114,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (14:46): I thank the Chief Government Whip for his important question, which comes 12 months to the day since the Gillard government ministry was sworn in after our election victory last but August. That is why we are sitting on this side of the House and why the opposition are still on that side of the House. Indeed, the government has a very big agenda. Since we were sworn in, the House of Representatives has carried 191 bills through the House-that is, 191 in this column and a big zero in their column because not one piece of legislation has been defeated. The parliament is functioning and it is functioning well in spite of the wrecking tactics of those opposite. The parliament said yes to the structural separation of Telstra; those opposite said no. The parliament said yes to rebuilding Queensland after the devastation of the floods and Cyclone Yasi; as those opposite said no. The parliament said yes to a fully-costed and fair paid parental leave scheme; those opposite said no. The parliament said yes to a budget that invested in jobs and the economy with record spending in mental health; those opposite said no. The parliament said yes to national health reform; those opposite said no. The parliament said yes to the National Broadband Network, with not just one but five bills carried through the House; those opposite said no, no, no, no and no. The government is determined to meet our future challenges. That is why we are saying yes to the creation of a Parliamentary Budget Office. That is why we are saying yes to the clean energy bills that are before the parliament, but in this case not everyone is saying no. The member for Wentworth, who was due to speak this morning on the clean energy bills, took himself off the list. But he knew that he could contribute because prior to question time he had this to say in response to the question, is the carbon tax to the plan that you and Ian MCFarlane negotiated? I think all of these schemes have got a lot in common. This one obviously has quite a lengthy fixed-price period. That's why it's called tax. All of these schemes-whether it is one Peter Shergold canvassed when we were in government or the Rudd CPRS, as amended in the negotiations with Ian and myself, or this onehave a lot in common. Indeed they do. Both had a fixed-price period, both led to an emissions trading scheme and both were supported by the member for Wentworth-not just in his heart but in his head, as they are supported by everyone who takes climate change seriously. It is only this side of the parliament that has a future agenda on jobs, skills, infrastructure, education and health. Those opposite simply have a negative agenda of carping and opposing everything that is put forward. Asylum Seekers",99

116,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," The question simply is not right. The member is misrepresenting the situation, but if the member is in any way interested in expert advice then I would suggest that he get across the expert advice that is being provided to government and to the opposition. Can I say generally to the opposition, I understand that there will continue to be political contest about the nature of policies and plans in the area of refugees and asylum seekers. So be it. That is what the House of Representatives is for. We will in that political contest refer to the expert advice that supports us. The opposition may choose not to rely on that expert advice. That is a matter for it. What a carbon this parliament will be called upon to determine is the legislation and how it should read. Facts are facts and you cannot wish them away. The Solicitor-General has been clear that for offshore processing to proceed, whether that offshore processing is in PNG, in Nauru or whether there is the Malaysia transfer agreementMr Abbott interjecting",100
117,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition is saying, 'That is not a fact; it's an opinion.' It is a fact that the highest legal officer who advises government gave this advice. That is fact and you cannot wish that fact away. The Solicitor-General has advised government that to put offshore processing beyond doubt, even it were occur in Nauru, as the Leader of the Opposition prefers, the legislation needs amending to ensure that such arrangements could include the transfer of unaccompanied minors. If you do not make that amendment then you run all of the legal risks. Then what do you do? You send a message to people-smugglers to fill boats with children. These are facts. They cannot be wished away. They cannot be denied. They must be dealt with. The only thing we are asking the opposition to do as we absorb these facts together, and the Leader of the Opposition gets the opportunity to have briefings in depth, is to put the law in an appropriate stateMs Julie Bishop interjecting",100
118,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Exactly. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said, 'Put the law back as it was.' Yes, put the law back so executive government is in the position that the Howard government believed itself to be in in relation to offshore processing and this government believed itself to be in in relation to offshore processing before the High Court case. Then, having amended the law, we will implement the Malaysia arrangement and one with PNG, the opposition can knock themselves out with criticisms of that arrangement, we will have the election in 2013, and the Australian people can make a decision between the government's policies and plans and the opposition's policies and plans. What the opposition should not do, in my view, is refuse to amend the legislation and in doing so deny themselves the legal foundation stone for the policy that they say they support. So this is the decision for the parliament. Legislation will be introduced next week. The Leader of the Opposition will get briefings on Friday afternoon. it is a very good thing that he is availing himself of those briefings. I am pleased we were able to negotiate and get a time that works for everybody on Friday, and I trust that he will seriously consider the advice and information that he receives during that briefing in the national interest. Anti-Dumping Reforms",100
119,Ms BIRD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Justice, the Minister for Home Affairs and the Minister for Privacy and Freedom of Information. Will the minister update the House on the progress of the government's anti-dumping reforms in supporting Australian industry? What other proposals have been put forward and what is the government's response? Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR (GortonMinister for Privacy and Freedom of Information, Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Justice) (14:55): I thank the member for Cunningham for her question. She is a true advocate and champion for manufacturing workers in this country, and I can assure her that the government is working to keep our economy strong by making sure that Australian manufacturers are supported from unfair trading practices such as dumping. The government's improvements to the anti-dumping system will deliver faster resolution of complaints. Indeed, we are committed to increasing staff of Customs from 31 to 45 to ensure Customs has the right level of resources but also to ensure additional experts such as forensic accountants in order to ensure we have quicker and more effective advice so we can prevent dumping in this country. Customs, of course, will also consider the need for provisional measures at the earliest opportunity in an investigation rather than waiting until verifying all data, something I think that I believe has been a problem for manufacturers and producers in this country for some time. Indeed, the legislation that has passed the House will have a 30-day time limit on the minister's decision making for such cases. By way of comparison, under the Howard government Minister Vanstone would take up to more than one year to make decisions in this area. That certainly frustrated the parties. The government's improvements will also enable us to identify dumping behaviour by making particular market situation provisions more effective and making significant changes to the appeals process and amending the definition of material injury. The reforms will ensure greater consistency with other countries by taking into account relevant cases and practices in other jurisdictions, specifically in relation to non-cooperative parties. Indeed, legislation currently before the parliament also rectifies an omission of the Howard government, ensuring that Australian industry can take action against the same unfair subsidies overseas that everybody else can. These are very important reforms. The government will also ensure compliance with the trade remedies in place through increased monitoring and anti-circumvention measures. The International Trade Remedies Forum has been established, representing industry, to provide ongoing advice to governments on the effectiveness of anti-dumping. I have been asked about alternative views. The fact is that there are no alternative views coming from the opposition, other than to say that the Leader of the Opposition, in his budget reply in speech in May, made reference to dumping but has done nothing since. Indeed, in February, the opposition set up a task forceMrs Mirabella interjecting",101
120,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The member for Indi will withdraw. Mrs Mirabella: I withdraw. Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR: Indeed, the member for Indi chairs this task force, which has no tasks and indeed no meaningful force. It has been there since February, telling workers around this country it is going to help them. But what have we seen since February? Absolutely nothing. The member for Indi was at the Press Club today. She spoke for 30 minutes. There were no announcements, no reforms, in this very important area, because in the end, when it comes to the opposition, they are a policyfree zone. We have rhetorical drivel from the member for Indi. The reality is that this government cares about manufacturing in this country and it cares about agriculture in this country. That is why the employer bodies, the unions and the National Farmers Federation have supported our reforms. What we know is that the Leader of the Opposition may talk about dumping but in the end he will use workers as a prop in a media stunt; he will walk away from those workers in the same way he will walk away from their entitlements. Giving the Leader of the Opposition control of employment conditions is like giving Dracula the keys of the blood bank. (Time expired) Member for Dobell  Opposition Business) (15:00): My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the disparaging remarks she made with respect to the Chief Justice of the High Court when he rejected her failed Malaysia people-swap deal. How does the Prime Minister reconcile her criticism of Chief Justice French for doing his job with her rock-solid support for the member for Dobell, who is alleged to have misused the union funds of the poorest paid workers on personal items of art; restaurant, accommodation and liquor bills; airline tickets for himself and his spouse; election expenses; and escort agencies?",102
121,Mr Albanese,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, as you would be fully aware, that question is out of order. It is not in order for a member of parliament to cast aspersions upon another member.  order: the question simply juxtaposes the Prime Minister's statements about the Chief Justice of the High Court with her full, expressed confidence in the member for Dobell, and mentions that the items that I read out are allegations. Mr Shorten interjectingMrs Mirabella: Mr Speaker, I ask you to ask the Assistant Treasurer to withdraw his offensive comment.",102
122,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,102
123,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! Before we proceed can I just ask members to proceed with a great degree of care. We will deal with the matter immediately before me. I did not hear a comment but, given the reaction, as I said earlier this week, I think that it is in order that I ask the Assistant Treasurer to withdraw.",102
124,Mr Shorten,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I withdraw. Mr Mitchell interjecting,102
125,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The member for MCEwen should not take the lead from some of his more senior colleagues during today. I have indicated that the haranguing from either side does not assist, especially at this point in time. When the question was first asked, whether by juxtaposition or otherwise, the comments made by the member for Sturt about another member appeared to go further than was allowed by the standing orders. His explanation on the point of order is not the way that I characterised the question. But if he is saying that he has only couched the things he has mentioned in the way that they have been couched on other occasions, it would be in order. But what this does illustrate is that there is a fine line. I have indicated that I am troubled by questions about members, especially members that are not part of executive government. But it has appeared over this parliament and the previous parliament that the House has wished me to give some flexibility. That is the only reason that I allowed those questions. What I am saying is: people should be very careful in the way that they use material that would go beyond the ability and capacity for this House to make any sort of judgment about the actions of a fellow member. It would be in that context and that context alone that I would allow the Prime Minister to respond to the question. But it is not in any way condoning a form of words that has been used against a member of this place that goes beyond the standard practice.",103
126,Mr Albanese,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, with due respect, standing order 90 is very clear: All imputations of improper motives to a Member and all personal reflections on other Members shall be considered highly disorderly. And action is allowable understanding order 91. I also refer you, Mr Speaker, to standing order 100(d): Questions must not contain: (i) statements of facts or names of persons, unless they can be authenticated and are strictly necessary to make the question intelligible; It is out of order understanding order 100(d)(ii)-arguments. It is out of order understanding order 100(d)(iii)-inferences. It is out of order understanding order 100(d)(iv)-imputations. It is out of order understanding order 100(d)(v)-insults. It is out of order understanding order 100(d)(vii)-hypothetical matter. I would ask you to rule the question out of order.",103
127,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Well, this is a big change in the game. I have to decide whether I rule out most of the questions from both sides. I am happy to do that if that is the wish of the House. I have tried for four years to get a sensible set of rules for question time. If members want me to implement my version of the rules, I am happy to because I have would rule every question about members of the House out of order. I have the dilemma that I have to decide what the House wants me to do. That is an interesting dilemma because the same will apply to responses. If we want to start from now, I am happy to rule the question out of order. Pensions and Benefits",103
128,Ms VAMVAKINOU,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Mr Speaker, my question is to the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. Minister, how is the government delivering on its commitments to support pensioners to balance their budgets? What risks are there to this support? How is the government responding?",103
129,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The last two parts of that question are out of order. I will allow the first part.,103
130,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Jagajaga-Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs) (15:09): I thank the member for Calwell very much for her question because she knows that this government is determined to continue to implement the commitments we have made to put a price on carbon pollution and the commitments we have made, and continue to make, to pensioners to support them and help them meet their household budgets. It is the big polluters and not Australian pensioners who are going to have to pay for the pollution that those big polluters put our atmosphere. We are delivering a real and permanent increase to the pension. Under our plan to put a price on pollution, Australia's 3.4 million pensioners will receive assistance that more than covers their average expected price increases. Australia's 3.4 million pensioners will get that extra assistance as a result of the legislation that this government has introduced into the parliament. Pensioners will receive both the clean energy advance and a clean energy supplement to make sure that they get ongoing assistance. That assistance will be worth $338 a year for singles and $255 a year for each member of a couple. It will be the case that both the pension and the clean energy supplement will be indexed to make sure that pensioners can keep up with the cost of living. As the member for Calwell and everybody on this side of the parliament knows, this builds on the very significant increases pension that we have delivered since 2009. From next Tuesday, 20 September, pensioners in Australia can expect to get another increase to their pension as a result of improved indexation that this government has delivered as a result of the major reforms we have put in place. What we know, unfortunately, is that the Liberals in New South Wales",104
131,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,104
132,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister should be very careful. She is now wandering past the part of the question that I allowed.,104
133,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is absolutely relevant to what we are doing for pensioners because, as the Speaker may recall, the Prime Minister put a request to the premiers and chief ministers of Australia asking them to make sure that the pension rise that we put in place in 2009 stayed in the purses and wallets of pensioners, that it was not gobbled into up in the increased public housing rents. Unfortunately, it is the case that last week the New South Wales Premier announced that he is reneging on that agreement and they are increasing public housing rents.",104
134,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister will now bring her answer to a conclusion.,104
135,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They are now increasing public housing rents for 68,000 pensioners in New South Wales. Union Funds Ms JULIE BISHOP (Curtin-Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (15:13): Mr Speaker, my question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to her answer yesterday where she agreed with the Minister for Human Services that the use of the union funds of some of the poorest paid workers for sexual services was inappropriate. Is this the Prime Minister's to the belief in all cases?",104
136,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I suggest to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that if she is going to quote the Minister for Human Services, she do it accurately and in its entirety. My attitude today is exactly the same as the attitude I expressed yesterday. Tobacco Plain Packaging",104
137,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Mr Speaker, my question is to the Minister for Health and Ageing. What progress is being made on plans to remove advertising and the glamour from cigarette packages? How does this fit with international developments?",105
138,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for his question. The government are proud that 12 months ago, when we were sworn in as a government, we had already declared that we would be the first country introduce plain packaging for tobacco products. Now, 12 months on, this chamber has passed the measures. We expect that the measures will be before the Senate next week. I hope very much that the Senate will support the measures in the same fashion that they were supported in the House. It would be particularly timely given that next week, as part of the United Nations General Assembly, the first non-communicable diseases conference is being held. It will be only the second time in the history of the United Nations that they have had a dedicated health forum combined with the General Assembly. Last time, as members would know, it was to deal with HIV. Now it is to deal with the growing burdens caused by cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and a range of other illnesses, which are caused in large part by a number of risk factors and tobacco is the leading one amongst them. We are very proud to be part of a government that is delivering on our commitment to be the first country to introduce plain packaging. Of course this reform has not been easy. It will not necessarily have an easy passage in the Senate. It is being met by very ferocious opposition from big tobacco companies that have spent in the order of $10 million on negative advertising campaigns. We are absolutely determined to do what is right here. We know that, if we can reduce the harm from tobacco related disease, not only will we significantly reduce the number of Australians who die each and every year from tobacco related illnesses-15,000-but, more importantly, we will also ensure that the number of families who suffer as a result of those deaths is reduced in the future. I hope the opposition will encourage their Senate colleagues to support this measure in the Senate next week. I think it will be a to proud moment for Australia, which has a history of both sides of politics having taken ambitious steps in leading the world on tobacco control, to have this measure passed at the very time the rest of the world is debating measures that can also be taken on tobacco control. If Australia is the first to introduce this measure, we know we will not be the last. That will be good for countries around the world and many thousands of people. It is estimated nearly six million people around the world die every year from tobacco related illnesses. We can take a step to make a difference. We can help the rest of the world take a step to make a difference too. Member for Dobell  Opposition Business) (15:17): My question is to the Prime Minister. In light of the Prime Minister's answer to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's question and her answer yesterday, does she stand by her statements she has made in the last few weeks that she has full confidence in the member for Dobell?",105
139,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If I were going by my thoughts on this I would be ruling this question out of order, but given that this arises from previous questions-and only on that basis-I will allow the question.",105
140,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I believe the member for Sturt's question is grossly inappropriate because it doing what I do not think should be done in this place about any member of parliament and what I will specifically decline to do about members of parliament who face some sort of inquiry and that is to make a decision in advance of that inquiry about what the facts may be. If I were the sort of person who did that then I could start doing that about a senator from the Liberal Party. I do not believe that would be appropriate. Indeed, I believe that would be quite wrong. Let us be very transparent about what has been done today. Mr Speaker, on another occasion you may choose to reflect on these questions. The opposition has put a values proposition about something in general and then has basically sought to assert that a member is in breach of that values proposition with no facts or evidence before them. If we are going to start that, I do genuinely fear where it will end. The appropriate conduct for members of parliament if matters are being investigated by appropriate authorities is to await the outcome of those investigations. Education Mr STEPHEN JONES (Throsby) (15:19): My question is to the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth. What reforms has the government delivered to our education, schools and training system to help Australians secure the jobs of the future?",106
141,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Kingsford Smith Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (15:19): I thank the member for Throsby for his question. I know he carries on a very proud tradition of members from the constituency of Throsby really arguing long and hard for jobs in their electorate. The government is serious about reform because reform is all about making Australia is a better place for people to live in and to grow up in. It is about tackling dangerous climate change by putting a price on carbon pollution. It is about rolling out an accessible National Broadband Network. It is about transforming education right around the country to make every school a great school. It comes on the back of a proud tradition of Labor reforms which can tell people what we on this side of the House are about. Whether it is Medicare or compulsory superannuation, we are fair dinkum about reform and about bringing these policies through to make sure they improve the opportunities for Australians in the future. There are some big reforms out there in education if you think about it. There is a new building in every one of our schoolsnot 3,000 flagpoles against 3,000 libraries, but new halls, new classrooms, new science laboratories; an Australian curriculum accessible to every student wherever they live; national standards for the teaching profession; and hundreds of thousands of computers installed. I put out a statement today saying that I am pleased to see that we had 75 per cent of the total installed by the end of June. We have invested record amounts in literacy and numeracy and record amounts in assisting kids from low socio-economic communities lift their education capacity. Of course there is the once-in-a-generation opportunity through the independent Gonski review of school funding. We are also doing it in higher education. There is a significant amount of investment again-nearly double what we saw from the previous government. There are 130,000 new training places now being provided and record numbers of apprentices and trainees with skills. In higher education we now have more young Australians than ever before being given the opportunity of a university degree. There was an announcement today that students from inner regional areas are able to access the independent youth allowance under exactly the same rules that apply to students from outer regional, remote and very remote areas. I am asked how this is being received. On the BER, Trevor Gordon, the Principal of Cairns State High School, said in the Cairns Post in October: It is one of the most wonderful facilities I've seen in my 38 years as a teacher. I have heard many comments like that from principals around Australia, as I know have my colleagues on this side of the House.",106
142,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,107
143,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister has the call.,107
144,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On the national curriculum, Martin Dixon, the Victorian minister, said: It is a historic occasion. It is one that teachers and educators have been waiting for for a long time. I could not agree more. On national professional standards for teachers, Sheree Vertigan, who is from the Australian Secondary Principals Association, said: The standards are a crucial platform for building teacher quality in all secondary schools across Australia. Those opposite may not be willing to have their budget cuts subject to the scrutiny of the Parliamentary Budget Office, but our investments in education ensure that young Australians now will have jobs in the future. Carbon Pricing",107
145,Mr TEHAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the fact that the government is amending the Fuel Tax Act as part of its carbon tax package to remove the exemption which allows the delivery of fertiliser to farms to be defined as important agriculture. Does the Prime Minister agree with Clarke Roycroft, the owner of a fertiliser business in Camperdown in my electorate, who says that whoever proposed this amendment has been 'doing too much drinking downstream of the herd'? Mr Crean interjecting",107
146,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! I invite the minister for regional development to first of all read Practice where it says, whether you like it or not, a member when they are quoting, whether a constituent or not, is assumed to be quoting directly. Also, I say to the minister for regional development, if he wants to make comments on points of order, there is a procedure in the standing orders that allows him to come to the despatch box to make that point of order. I have a different view from the member for Wannon's predecessor about the naming of people in questions. In this case, it is on the shoulders of the member for Wannon that he is actually quoting the person that he has named. The Prime Minister has the call.",107
147,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," To the member for Wannon I say that I am happy to talk to him about an individual constituent matter, if that is what he would like me to do. More generally I say to him that we are determined to create a clean energy future for this country. That is why we introduced the legislation yesterday. This is a nation-changing reform about jobs and prosperity in the future and about making sure that we do the right thing by our environment and that we accept the best of scientific advice and the best of economists' advice. It does really amaze me as we move to the end of the second question time after the introduction of these bills that the Leader of the Opposition has been asking about everything else but not asking about this. Perhaps that is because he knows he cannot explain his policy, because he failed to do in his speech today, which I came into listen to.",107
148,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Prime Minister will bring her answer to a conclusion.,108
149,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"So, to the member for Wannon, if he genuinely has an issue on behalf of a constituent then I am very happy to address that matter with him directly. Defence Equipment",108
150,Ms GRIERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Minister for Defence Materiel. How has the government improved the capabilities provided to our troops over the past 12 months? What is it doing to strengthen the skills of the Australian defence industry?,108
151,Mr CLARE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Newcastle for her question. In the last 12 months we have delivered a lot of equipment for our soldiers in Afghanistan. That includes the upgrading of our Bushmaster vehicles. Our troops in Afghanistan now also have new combat body armour and are wearing a new combat uniform. We have also rolled out a new counterrocket system that warns our troops of rocket attacks at the base at Tarin Kowt well as a number of our forward operating bases. They are all part of the $1.6 billion Force Protection package that the government is implementing. I was in Afghanistan a few weeks ago and had the opportunity to talk to our soldiers about this new equipment, and their feedback on the ground was very positive. That said, there is still more work to do. There is always more work to do particularly in the area of IEDs. Earlier this year we made the decision to purchase an additional 101 Bushmaster vehicles to replace those that had been destroyed, as well as supporting so current and future operations. On Monday, the Minister for Defence and I announced an agreement with the Canadian government for a number of ground-penetrating radar systems to help to clear the roads of IEDs in Oruzgan province. In Air Force in the last 12 months, 20 of our new Super Hornets have been delivered and the next four Super Hornets will be delivered in the next month. In March, members may remember, we made the decision to purchase a fifth C17 heavy-lift aircraft, and it will arrive in Australia in the next few weeks. Work is also well underway on the first air warfare destroyer and I know some of that work is occurring in the member for Newcastle's electorate. Work is also underway on the two new landing helicopter dock ships. The Largs Bay, which we have purchased from the UK government earlier this year, will arrive in Australia in December where it will be commissioned HMAS Choules, after Claude Choules who died in May this year and who, members will know, served in the Royal Navy in World War I and then migrated to Australia and served in the Royal Australian Navy in World War II. The question also asked about the Australian defence industry. The Australian as defence industry does a lot of work for Defence, about $5½ billion worth every year. Over the next decade that will increase to about $7½ billion in today's terms. There is a reason for that. Over the next 10 to 15 years we will replace or upgrade 85 per cent of our military equipment, and that is a big challenge. It is important that we get it right and a key part of that is making sure that we have the skills that we need to do the job. The biggest mountain we will have to climb is the future submarine project, potentially the biggest and most complex defence project Australia has ever undertaken. It will potentially involve hundreds of companies, thousands of workers and a lot of skills we do not currently have in sufficient numbers today. Some of the skills will come from overseas but many will need to be grown here in Australia. That is why I have asked Skills Australia to work with Defence and the defence industry on the range and depth of skills that we will need over the next decade and the best way to build them. This will help us to meet the challenges lie ahead. Ultimately, that is what government is all about: meeting the challenges of today and the challenges of the future. Whether it is climate change, building the National Broadband Network, increasing superannuation of Australian workers or providing our troops with the equipment that they need, this government is delivering now to meet the challenges of the future. (Time expired) Ms Gillard: Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be place on the Notice Paper. NA Selection Committee Report",108

158,Mr HOCKEY,IMPORTANCE," Mr Speaker, I appreciate you staying for my speech! The Westpac-Melbourne Institute Index of Consumer Sentiment came out today and indicated an unexpected rebound in consumer confidence in the month of September. I see that as good news, but it was unexpected because business confidence is down and consumer confidence generally remains extremely flat. When you look at the actual data, it reported the major news items recalled by consumers in September as it does every three months-this is a report by an investment bank. It said that the most recalled items were economic conditions, probably owing to the solid second-quarter result; taxation, reflective of ongoing concerns about the carbon tax; international conditions, given recent financial market activity and concerns about global growth outlook; and interest rates. Of those four issues only sentiment towards interest rates was less negative than in June. Of course, consumer confidence and business confidence are fingers on the same hand; one travels with the other in many ways. If consumers are confident, they engage in retail spending, they engage in commerce. So many small businesses which are unincorporated, often family businesses, take the risks of everyday life. That in turn stimulates business investment; it stimulates business confidence. But one of the fundamental principles that cut to the core consumer and business confidence is stability and consistency from government. If we had believed everything that has been said by this Prime Minister and the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency over the last few days, we would have thought that there really was no need for a parliamentary debate on the carbon tax because it has been going on for years, the dust has settled and all the concerns of everyday Australians have been totally allayed. I thought I might have misheard it-but I doubt I did-when the Treasurer yesterday said something along the lines of: 'On the big reforms you have to take the Australian people with you.' We love Swannie! Why doesn'the come into this place and engage in debate? He even boasted today about the Parliamentary Budget Office-how successful that was. It was so caught up in committee in this place last night with the member for Lyne casting doubt on the bill. The Treasurer was so proud of his achievement that he boasted about it today in question time. This is a man who does not create confidence in the Australian people. I do not rush out to the shop with my credit card when I see the Treasurer on TV saying everything is all right, and I do not think I am alone; I do not think that is a lonely path. I do not think Australians are imbued with confidence when they look at this government, which has had five different policies on a carbon tax and an ETS, four different versions of a mining tax, three different policies on live exports to Indonesia, two Prime Ministers in four years and one lame duck Treasurer-no confidence. I would have thought that the dust has settled, that we are all wasting our time engaging in the debate. I would have thought everything was before the parliament, of everything was before us, and the Australian people could be confident that the full carbon tax package is here. But then I came across this comment today from the Leader of the House, who said: Further bills to establish the Australian Renewable Energy Agencywhich is a core part of the carbon tax packagewill be introduced in the coming months … I thought 19 bills at over 1,000 pages did job, but, no, there is more-'Wait, we're tossing in some steak knives'! He goes on: … and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation will be introduced in early 2012The Clean Energy Finance Corporation is being funded to the tune of $10 billionmore than a third of the total of the carbon tax-and it is not part of the carbon tax package, it is off budget. These guys have made an art form of taking things off budget. Most spectacularly, the $4 billion for the National Broadband Network-well in excess of $38 billion now-is not accounted for on the budget because, if it was, it would make the deficit look far worse. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation is now off budget. I looked at the terms of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. I thought to myself, 'Gee, this looks familiar,' and I consulted my colleague the member for Groom. I said, 'Doesn't this look like the Commercial Ready program that used to be a part of the budget and was abolished by the government in May 2008?' It was a program of $700 million over four years that the government had, with very similar terms of reference to those of the $10 billion Gillard bank that is now going to be off budget. Why is it off budget? Because it would be a $10 billion hole in the budget. Now the government has nearly $50 billion of expenditure off budget. And the $10 billion associated with the buyout of Senator Bob Brown to get his agreement. The $10 billion Commercial Ready clean energy program-the former Minister for Finance and Deregulation said about it that there were too many programs, too many initiatives, that were already funded by the private sector: 'Why would we fund them from government money?' No wonder old Lindsay is turning and spinning in his political grave. We miss him. He was a spine the stiffener over there when it came to budget activity. The spine stiffener has gone, and, most spectacularly, the program that he thought in May 2008 was a waste of taxpayers' money is now nine times bigger and is off budget. This government does not have direct ministerial control of the money. I can understand that-gosh, with the $350 billion they have direct ministerial control over at the moment they are doing tremendous damage. Why would you give them any more money? I can understand them taking it off budget for that reason. But you know what? The lack of accountability and the lack of consistency mean the Australian people remain confused-confused about this government, its policies and its true intentions. Why wouldn't they be confused? We recall the Treasurer saying on numerous occasions that the carbon tax package would be 'roughly budget neutral'. It is $4.134 billion short. You could almost fit that into a brown paper bag-that $4.134 billion shortfall. And this Treasurer has the audacity to come to this place on a regular basis and give us a lecture about integrity. The Treasurer-the high priest of integrity-says a rounding error, or close to budget neutrality, is $4.134 billion. The government was so concerned about a $1.8 billion hole associated with the Queensland floods that they imposed a new levy. Now they have a $4.134 billion hole and are not explaining to the Australian people how they are going to pay for it. They are not telling anyone how they are going to make up that shortfall, nor are they telling the Australian people where the $10 billion for the Clean Energy Finance Corporation is going to come from: 'Oh, that can wait till next year. That's not part of the equation now. We'll find $10 billion next year.' What is this? Is this like a scene a bad British comedy? It is like On the Buses over there and the guy with the moustache is the Treasurer. Was that Arthur? I miss Arthur. But he is reborn and comes from Lilley-a Queenslander! Yesterday in this place the Prime Minister stood up and said the modelling on the carbon tax is settled. The Prime Minister had said before the debate that we would have the carbon tax modelling. The only problem was that the macro modelling was on $20 a tonne and the household impact was on $23 a tonne; so, in fact, it is impossible to properly analyse the impact on Australian business when the modelling is done at $20 a tonne. But thank goodness the states have done a bit of work. They have done proper assumptions about the economic modelling, and they have identified that with the government's flawed modelling there is a presumption that capital will be available to restructure Australia's energy sector and that workers will reduce wage demands and move locations in response to unemployment in ways that are not easy to achieve in reality-a rather heroic assumption from the government. The government in its modelling also ignores the implications of current economic conditions. For example, they ignore the uncertainties posed by the risks of further global downturn from a European sovereign debt crisis. The Commonwealth's modelling presumes Australia's actions against a backdrop of significant global abatement efforts and that will allow Australia to import permits at a lower cost than domestic alternatives. It presumes leakage will not occur. The government's modelling assumes the existence of a credible international permit market. The government says we should have a out of properly informed debate. The Prime Minister often reminds us that we have to refer to expert opinion. The Prime Minister said yesterday that updated modelling will be available next week, well before the parliament votes on the legislation. Well, I was ready to go today. They want us to have our one speech before they have actually delivered the economic modelling of at least $23 a tonne, which will significantly influence the debate. You would like to think so. But of course this government is not very good at delivering anything. Modelling by the New South Wales Treasury states that in New South Wales there will be an absolute reduction of 18½ thousand jobs in the Hunter region by 2020, 7,000 fewer jobs in the Illawarra region by 2020, 1,000 fewer jobs in the Central West of New South Wales by 2020",115
159,Mr HOCKEY,IMPORTANCE,"and, of course, one less job in Moreton! The Victorian government recently commissioned Deloitte Access Economics to undertake the modelling. The modelling showed that the carbon tax will reduce jobs growth by more than 24,000 and reduce the state's output by more than $2.8 billion in 2015. The modelling commissioned by the Victorian government reveals that in the electorate of Melbourne Ports the Port Philip local government area will have over 1,000 fewer jobs and $113 million less output in 2013. In the electorate of Bruce the Monash local government area will have more than 1,000 fewer jobs and $122 million less economic output. But the Western Australians have also done their modelling, and what they reveal is that the carbon tax will increase the cost of essential services. For a typical Western Australian household there will be an increase in state government tariffs, fees and charges of at least $144 in 2012, and that will cover electricity, public transport, water and so on. But modelling performed by Western Australia's Treasury reveals that over 400,000-half-of Western Australia's households will not be sufficiently compensated by the federal government. Queensland-one of your estimated the impact on the government of $250 million, rising to $360 million. These are the facts. These are the real impacts. this government, through its own incompetence and inconsistency, that has shown it is not fit to run the country. (Time expired)",117
160,Dr EMERSON,IMPORTANCE," Being lectured by the shadow Treasurer on budget discipline is like being lectured by Lord Monckton on the science of climate change. Lord Monckton does not believe in climate change, and the shadow Treasurer does not believe in budgeting. In fact, the shadow Treasurer was exposed, along with the shadow finance minister, who is still with us-they cannot stand each other-before the last election as having to go to an accounting firm because they knew that they had a very big budget black hole. They went to an accounting firm instead of chancing their arm to have their costings done by Treasury and Finance. When the Independents insisted that those costings be done, voila: an $11 billion black hole was exposed. But, in the period of one year since the ministry was sworn in, that $11 billion black hole has not been plugged; it has exploded to $70 billion. The $70 billion comes from none other than the shadow Treasurer, who told the shadow cabinet that they had a very big problem, whereupon the Leader of the Opposition said: 'This $70 billion is in fact just media talk. It's just the Labor Party.' But in a moment of candour on a Sunday program very recently the shadow finance minister indeed confirmed that there is a very big problem to the tune of $70 billion and the coalition has no idea how they are going to plug it. This points to the fact that the opposition leader is, as described by a former employer-that is, Mr John Hewson, who own- was also an opposition leader but is a professor of economics-'innumerate'. He has described the opposition leader as It is 'innumerate', and so he is. While we are talking about the impact of carbon pricing, this is a man who has estimated the weight of one tonne of carbon dioxide as zero. He has been asked, 'What does a tonne of carbon dioxide weigh?' and his answer was, 'Zero.' I can imagine him at school. When they asked, 'What does a tonne of lead weigh?' he would have said, 'A tonne.' When they asked, 'What does a tonne of feathers weigh?' he would have said, 'Well not so much, because feathers are lighter than lead.' So if they had asked, 'What does a tonne of carbon dioxide weigh?' he would have said, 'Nothing at all.' I am told that the teachers realised then that young Tony had a problem with numeracy, and since they thought he was quite a good sports person they started asking him questions such as, 'Young Tony, who won the fabulous tied test of 1960-61?' whereupon he said, 'Australia,' and they said, 'No, it was a tie.' He was then asked, 'After which famous cricketer was the Victor Richardson stand named?' and young Tony said, 'Wally Grout?' They said, 'No, no, that was Victor Richardson.' The final question was, 'Okay, young Tony, how many balls in a six-ball over?' and the reply was: ' Sir, sir, I know! Is it eight?' 'No, it's six, Tony.' Then the teacher said: 'Look, you are completely innumerate. You could be the leader of the Liberal Party.' That was the recommendation and here we are-he is the leader of the Liberal Party. This motion was put forward by the shadow Treasurer as: The adverse impact of the carbon tax on the Australian economy. Let us have a look at the impact on jobs. You would think that this would be central to the argument of the coalition. They have said virtually nothing about it but, in fact, the modelling does estimate that there will be 1.6 million extra jobs in Australia by 2020 under a carbon-pricing mechanism. That is not job losses, but 1.6 million extra jobs to build on the almost three-quarters of a million jobs that have already been created under this government during adverse economic circumstances, including the deepest global recession since the Great Depression. We could ask: what are some of the other authorities saying about this sort of thing? The IMF, in fact, gave a glowing endorsement of the carbon-pricing mechanism when they said just last month that they: … support the proposed introduction of a carbon price as part of a transition to a permits promise. trading system to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. Of course, they are economists, and we know that the opposition leader believes that economists do not know what they are talking about. The opposition leader believes that lawyers do not know what they are talking about. He believes that scientists do not know what they are talking about. Only the opposition leader knows what he is talking about. But the opposition leader has detractors from his own side. They are getting very, very tired of this economic Hansonism that is being espoused by the opposition leader. We know that he has a DLP background-that is, he has said, 'I worship the very water that Bob Santamaria walks on'. Bob Santamaria himself was quoted as saying that capitalism is worse than communism. These were the great interventionists of the 1950s and the 1960s, but here is Mr Abbott back as the reincarnation of Bob Santamaria.",118
161,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE, Order! The minister will refer to the Leader of the Opposition by his title under the standing orders.,119
162,Dr EMERSON,IMPORTANCE,"Yes, I will. The opposition leader is back as the reincarnation of Bob Santamaria. We now have contributions to the debate by people such as the member for Mayo, who has basically had a gutful. After the appalling CEDA speech from the opposition leader, where he effectively declared himself to be Australia's first free-trading protectionist when he said that he is in favour of free trade but he is in favour of protection as well, this first free-trading protectionist got this from the member for Mayo in an opinion piece during the week: The truth is that we can't save jobs by government protection, no matter what self-interested players Well there is a self-interested player: the opposition leader! The member for Mayo went on to say: There is a role for government to assist industries to adapt to changing environments, but taxpayers funding a romantic attachment to a bygone era is not a position the Australian economy can afford or sustain. … … … We simply can no longer afford to be throwing good money after bad to satisfy the political posturing of a chosen few. Who were the chosen few to whom he was referring? The Leader of the Opposition! He is self-chosen. He was chosen by Bob Santamaria and he is faithfully walking in his footsteps-but not on water! The member for Mayo is joined in his frustration by the member for Higgins, the member for Moncrieff, the member for Kooyong, the member for Bradfield and the member for Casey, who have all had a gutful of this irresponsible economic policy-making from the Leader of the Opposition. We saw the apples legislation. We talk about impacts on jobs: the apples bill that was brought into this parliament was completely noncompliant with our obligations under the World Trade Organisation and would have led to retaliation against our exporters. Sixty per cent of the value of our agricultural produce is exported. It would have led to retaliation against them, but the opposition leader does not care. He has a palm oil bill that he is supporting which is the same thing-it would lead to retaliation and is completely non-compliant with our World Trade Organisation obligations. The opposition leader does not mind the idea of international trade just so long as it is not with foreigners. This is where we are. This is where his thinking is. This is economic nationalism from the opposition leader. But it gets worse. We have revealed today, through documents that were obtained in New South Wales, the conspiracy involving the opposition leader's office in respect of this very issue that debating. The timing of the shadow Treasurer could not have been better. In fact, I wonder if the shadow Treasurer realised exactly what he was doing in putting this matter of public importance on today, because he did mention state modelling. I think he referred to Western Australian state modelling, Queensland state modelling and Victorian state modelling, but he did not refer to New South Wales state modelling. There is a reason that he did not refer to New South Wales state modelling, because these documents reveal a conspiracy. This is an email from Peter Grimshaw of the office of the Premier. He says, 'The ""Tele"" is very keen to do a story for tomorrow's paper on the impact of the carbon tax in relation to public transport versus cars. If we have any figures/modelling he thinks he can get a big run on this tomorrow, with the theme being there will be an incentive for people to use cars under Gillard's plan because rail uses electricity, buses use diesel,' et cetera. In other words, the Daily Telegraph gets in contact with the Premier's office and says, 'Look, if you can cook up some figures for us that will be great. We will put it on the front page'. This is what happened. The Premier's office then commissioned figures, but they were warned in an email from Matthew Crocker, 'Juicy quote from the Department of Transport's brief (note there are some not so helpful quotes in the brief too, so do not ask me for a copy of the original)'. In other words, do not ask me for the original Department of Transport brief because I am going to have to tell the truth, and we really do not want to tell the truth when it comes to modelling the impact of carbon pricing on public transport. So then in comes the Leader of the Opposition's office. The fact is that he has been running around trying to scare the we are daylights out of every family, every steelworker and everyone working in rural areas-everyone in Australia-saying, 'We are going to have this great big monster tax'. Of course, right on cue, in comes the opposition leader's office with talking points on carbon tax, and this is what they want the Daily Telegraph to print: the carbon tax is a catastrophe for New South Wales and will affect everyday prices and hurt jobs in New South Wales. They tried to feed that in, but it is actually refreshing and encouraging that there are professional public servants in New South Wales who would not go along with this. We have from Roger Shu, financial analyst with Transport and Planning in the New South Wales Treasury an email where he says about the impact on transport prices in New South Wales that 'the real impact is miniscule'. There is an honest public servant, but he did not prevail. What actually happened is that on 15 July the Premier of New South Wales put out a press release asserting that it would put up fares by 3.6 per cent, and on song-because the Daily Telegraph wanted him to say this: It's crazy for the Federal Labor Government impose a tax which is a disincentive for people use public transport. So they have bodgied up a figure of 3.6 per cent. You have Treasury saying that the real impact is miniscule and-this is also Treasury-saying, 'The model computed by the Department of Transport defies basic mathematics'. I know someone else who defies basic mathematics, and of course that is the Leader of the Opposition. I think that what actually happened then is marvellous, because subsequently the New South Wales Treasury got so squeamish about this estimate of 3.6 per cent that they produced this document: New South Wales Government, the Treasury: Carbon price impact-transport, 1 September 2011. It actually quotes the Premier of New South Wales on 15 July, saying, 'The carbon tax due to take effect from 1 July 2012 will lift the cost of public transport fares by up to 3.6 per cent.' That is in that same press release. Then they go through Treasury modelling and it says that as a result, 'This equates to an average fare price increase of 0.49 per cent'. So one-seventh of the dodgy figures that were produced by the Department of Transport were then headlined in the Daily Telegraph. Why would you believe anything that the Liberal Party ever said? They engaged in the conspiracy involving the opposition leader's office, the Premier's office in New South Wales and the Daily Telegraph to bodgie up figures so they get a front-page headline saying that fares would go up. I think the estimate was by something like $150 a year. That is 3.6 per cent, and everyone involved knew that that was untrue. So you get the opposition leader running around here saying, 'I'm gospel truth Tony. When I write it down you can trust me, it is absolutely true.' His office knew that they were engaging in a conspiracy to deceive the people of New South Wales on the important to issue of the impact of the carbon price on to public transport fares. That conspiracy involved the Department of Transport, the Premier's office in New South Wales and the opposition leader's office here in Canberra. Why would you believe the very figures that the shadow Treasurer produced? I would not believe a word that they ever said, with this exception: that they do have a $70 billion budget black hole. That is what they have said and I reckon that estimate is spot on. That is the problem: they have said that they are going to get rid of this carbon price. They are going to yank the whole thing out, they are going to increase taxes and to reduce the age pension if they get into office. Mr Ian Macfarlane: That's rubbish!",119
163,Dr EMERSON,IMPORTANCE,"That is exactly what they have said. It is not rubbish, it is exactly what the opposition leader said, 'If we get into office we will rescind the carbon price and we will increase personal income tax and reduce the age pension'. There is the choice for the Australian people: a government investing in the future and making sure we care for our environment and for our economy or an economic vandal who, according to John Hewson, is completely innumerate. The only figure they have ever got right is the $70 billion black hole that remains completely unplugged.",121
164,Mr ROBB,IMPORTANCE," Could I just suggest that a friend needs to take the Minister for Trade aside and tell him that this sort of lightweight performance that we have just heard over the last 15 minutes does him no credit, nor the government. It was just pathetic. Dr Emerson: Oh, thanks for your moralising.",122
165,Mr ROBB,IMPORTANCE,"No, it is not moralising. It is just a fact: that was pathetic, it was absolutely pathetic, Craig. There is a serious topic here about the impact of a carbon tax on a vulnerable economy, and you stand up there and give us that absolute drivel. You are a minister of the state and you ought to behave yourself a lot better than just standing there and giving us that drivel and that mock humour. Dr Emerson interjecting",122
166,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE, Order! The minister will remain silent and the member for Goldstein will direct his remarks through the chair.,122
167,Mr ROBB,IMPORTANCE,"In Australia we are very blessed. We have enormous resources and energy opportunities, we have an agricultural sector which is a great strength and we have an education sector which is a great strength. All of these three are perhaps the three biggest strengths that we have had for 200 years. These strengths happen to coincide with the Asian century. We are geographically so well placed. Also, all of the things that Asia needs in this century we have as our strengths: great resources, energy and agriculture. We feed 60 million people. If we marshalled the resources, technologies and possibilities that exist in Australia, we could feed 120 million people. We have an education system which now is poised to educate so much of the region and to forge long standing and deeply fruitful links with the Asia region. All of these things we have going for us right at this very moment. Yet, despite that, there is a crisis of confidence in this community. It runs right throughout the community. In fact, today we saw a business confidence report released by the National Australia Bank-a survey which is used by the Reserve Bank to gauge the health of business. It shows a 10 per cent fall in confidence to a level not seen since the middle of the great financial crisis. We have seen the biggest falls in confidence in the finance sector, the manufacturing sector and the transport sector, with retail also depressed. This comes off the back of layoffs of 10,000 identified by Merrill Lynch over the last two months, with job losses concentrated, again, in the manufacturing, consumer, government and finance sectors. It also leads to a conclusion by the chief equities analyst, Tim Rocks, who said that job losses from these sectors alone were likely to reach 100,000 over the coming quarters. The Australian community are not stupid. They have a sense of gathering cloudsstorm clouds. In fact, it explains why savings rates have gone from minus one per cent 12 months ago to 11½ per cent now, the biggest jump in savings rates in this economy on record. It represents about $70 billion that Australian households have saved-money that would normally have been spent for discretionary expenditure. It is a level of saving which has meant that the retail sector is on its knees. But why have people been doing this? Why is business not investing? The reason falls largely at the feet of this government. Now we have a carbon tax which has become a symbol of chronic incompetence within this government. We have a situation where we have all of these blessings yet we have a government which has put this economy into a situation of great vulnerability if there is any further slide world economic conditions. The fact is that the world economy is facing the likelihood of a further significant slump over the coming 12 months. There is a much greater prospect of that happening than not. The job of any government is to do its best to weatherproof an economy against forces external to this country that it has control over. The government does not have any control over what happens in the United States or in Europe, but what this government can do is weatherproof our economy, prepare our economy and gather in the acorns to get ourselves prepared, just as the households are doing. In the absence of government, they are living within their means. They are paying off their mortgage. They are paying off the plastic. They are saving money because the government is not. They are doing the opposite of what the government is doing. Here is a government with the biggest budget deficit on record two years in a row. Here is a government that has taken a surplus and no debt and gone to nearly $200 billion in gross debt and the biggest deficits in our history. Here is a government that is borrowing as if there is no tomorrow. Here is a government that has presided over the biggest growth of government in our lives. The carbon tax is the prime example. The government has reregulated the labour market in the face of the global financial crisis. It has renationalised telecommunications. Now it is bringing in a carbon tax which is dripping with intervention and bureaucracy-hundreds of millions of dollars worth of new public servants to monitor and crawl over every company. There will be 500 companies that will have bureaucrats coming out their ears for years to come. The government gets this massive tax: $1.5 billion of the first $9 billion in the first year is the cost of in abatement and the rest of it goes straight to tax for the government to churn back through the economy. The government will make the decisions and strip the balance sheets of companies so that they cannot make decisions on innovation. It will be up to the government and up to public servants. We will have the biggest line-up of lobbyists no here that you have ever seen in this country because of what this government is doing. A lot of this is now being compounded by the carbon tax, because the carbon tax shows absolutely no empathy with what is happening in the real world out there. Because of this, people know and sense that there is no direction in this economy. There is no competence. We still have all the examples that go back four years. There is no sense that anyone is in charge. You can see it on their faces on the other side ever since the last election: they are looking for a story. What does all this add up to? What is this carbon tax? What does it do apart from costing jobs, imposing further taxes on people and shifting income-redistributing it from one sector to another? What does it do? It does nothing for the environment. It does nothing for our competitive position. It will lead to the loss of jobs and industries offshore. It just confirms that this carbon tax has become a great symbol. It is the thing that is reinforcing that loss of confidence both amongst households and amongst business. There is a lot of money out there. It is not being spent, because there is this sense of unease-a great sense of anxiety; a great sense of no leadership; a great sense that nobody is in charge. We have heard the drivel from the Minister for Trade in the last 15 minutes. None of these issues was addressed. What are they doing about this vulnerability? We have a situation where this government has caused a crisis of confidence in the economy. Quite rightly, increasing numbers of Australians have written this government off. It has had too many chances, but it has proven incapable of performing its fiduciary duty when it comes to managing the economy. That is at the heart of this. The Prime Minister talks about being on the right side of history, but the only way this country will get back on track is when this government is confined to the dustbin of history.",122
168,Ms ONEILL,IMPORTANCE," I had to have a good laugh when I was listening to the member for North Sydney and waiting for the killer argument in this debate. What was the best thing he had to offer us? New South Wales Treasury modelling. We have heard from the Minister for Trade what a load of rubbish we have been presented with. The reporting is a problem and the misuse of the information. The member for North Sydney was using the same old chestnut that his shonky state Liberal mates have been using all this year to try to deceive the people of New South Wales. The minister has gone into this in great detail, but what we see in the chamber is a continuation of the great scare campaign. Our job is to expose that for the sham that it is. The Australian people are onto you guys. They are watching and listening because they know that you cannot continue to put mistruths in front of them. They will see through them. It is not only the member for North Sydney who is deliberately misleading us in this debate.",124
169,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE, Order! The member for Robertson will withdraw the imputation that the member for North Sydney is deliberately misleading. It is disorderly.,124
170,Ms ONEILL,IMPORTANCE,"I withdraw, Mr Deputy Speaker. I say that the member for North Sydney is trying to mislead us in this debate. He has also indicated a talent for plagiarism. I can see why the shadow Treasurer might be referred to in other contexts as 'Sloppy Joe'. If I were his teacher I would make him stay behind and write out 200 times, 'I must not mislead the people of Australia'. I hope that if he were my student he would be sitting on this side of the chamber and he might have seen the light a long time ago. The adverse impact of the carbon tax on the Australian economy is what we are supposed to be debating today. I welcome the opportunity to engage in this debate on a matter of public importance, as the Australian economy is vitally important. It is important to the public, to me, to the people of Robertson and it is of vital importance to this government. That is why I am so proud to have taken my seat in this parliament, sitting just behind the Treasurer who delivered an economy that is the envy of the world. Celebrating the economy as a mere artefact is not enough. What we in the Labor Party celebrate in our strong economy is that through the GFC we kept ordinary Australians working. That is not what would have happened if those on the opposite side had had their chance to be in charge at that time. They parrot on about the stimulus package being a failure, but the reality is that the stimulus was wise spending in the interest of the Australian people. We kept Australians working. We kept Australians earning. We kept money moving through our economy. We kept lots and lots of small businesses on the Central Coast and other regions like mine operating because the money kept flowing through the economy. Even though we are absolutely linked to the global economy-where everyone else went into recession-in Australia we used the facts and expert advice on how to act to prevent the pain of recession. We got on with leading, delivered a stimulus package and saved the Australian economy and lots of families from the pain that is still being suffered by many people in many nations. Even with that strong leadership and our strong economy, we still have this carping negativity, the whingeing of those opposite who peddle a tale of permanent woe. We heard the member for Goldstein talking about storm clouds. Dr Emerson: That's right-talk the economy down.",124
171,Ms ONEILL,IMPORTANCE,Exactly. What do they hope to gain from such negative speech? Dr Emerson: If the economy fails then the Liberals succeed.,125
172,Ms ONEILL,IMPORTANCE,"The minister speaks the truth. Putting a price on carbon is what we want to do. We want to make the polluters pay. That is our plan. Those opposite want to call it a tax and that is their problem. It is really a fine on polluters who are doing the wrong thing. They will change their ways. Those on the other side shamefully continue to misrepresent it. Let us try to get some facts on board. Those on the other side talk about adversity, but I talk about the power of the Australian economy in a global context. We in the Labor Party deal with the facts, and the fact about international action in a global economy is that there are 89 countries accounting for over 80 per cent of global emissions and over 90 per cent of the global economy that have pledged to reduce or limit their carbon pollution by 2020. We cannot sit outside the global economy. We do have the capacity to control our economy and respond, and that is what Labor is committed to doing. Scores of countries have already started the transformation to a low-pollution economy. Thirty-two countries and a number of US states already have emissions trading schemes. We need to act. We need to deal with the economy in a global context. In my seat of Robertson the economy is probably most experienced at the household level. Let us talk about the household economy. Those opposite would have the households in the seat of Robertson paying $1,300. It was bad enough when it was $720 per household, but now they have said they are not going to deal with this as an international problem-they do not want to have anything to do with foreigners, they will keep it all contained in Australia. The cost is now $1,300 per family in the seat of Robertson. I know that people where I live cannot afford that. In contrast, we have our position on the household economy. The reality is that nine out of 10 households are going to receive assistance from a package that we have carefully organised to support them through this massive shift in the Australian economy, this important structural reform. The tax cuts that families will receive, the increase in family payments and the increase to pensioners, will be permanent, ongoing and linked to the CPI. That busts one of the other myths that we keep hearing from those on the opposite side. They ignore household economies. They want to cause fear and alarm. They want to tell people they are going to get one payment and they are never going to get another payment. That perception is wrong. Information of that kind going to the community is deliberately misleading. Apart from household economies, let us talk about the part of the economy that the Labor Party is always most interested in: the economy of jobs. We believe in jobs. It was the guiding principle that made us take the action that we did when the global financial crisis hit. We know that if families do not have work, children do not have opportunities and families get impacted in the most extreme ways: they can break down and they can have so many issues that arise because of the anxiety of financial hardship when people lose their jobs. So where do we put our money? We have a great story to tell. In all of those schools that I go to in my electorate I see-and I know many of those opposite go out to their schools and see it-the celebration of an investment in education. They also know of all of the people in construction in their area who went and got jobs at those schools: the people who drove the trucks, the people who put up the steel, the people who laid pipes and the people who fixed the roofs. All of those people who live in our local economy got the benefit of our stimulus package because we believe in jobs. Because we believe in jobs we are going to make sure that we make the transition to a clean energy future. With that, by 2020 we are talking about not just a couple of hundred jobs, not just a thousand jobs, but 1.6 million jobs spread right across the country and detailed in the analyses that the Treasurer forward yesterday. But, wait, there's more. What other elements of the economy are we dealing with, and certainly not in an adverse way? Let us talk about small business. Those opposite like to think they are the only ones who understand anything about small business. How wrong could they be. Small business is very widespread on the Central Coast. There are 20,000-plus small businesses in my region alone. They need to have money moving around in the economy. We made sure when we had the response to the global financial crisis that we supported families to keep on working and be able to continue to move that money through their local economy. Right now, we have small businesses that are going to benefit as we make sure that the 0.7 per cent impact in the economy is going to be balanced out in our local households by permanent and ongoing assistance. Families, if they are smart, might make a few adjustments with products that are slightly less in terms of their carbon price loading, and they will be able to salt away some of those benefits. We also have lots of families in my area that are going to get part of the extra buffer that will help them manage this change in the economy. That money will go into local small businesses in the seat of Robertson. This is not an impost on small business; this is a careful, managed integration with small business that we know is vital to our area. On the macro scale, there is so much more to say. Investment is one of the areas that we can see clearly is happening because we are moving to a clean energy future. In closing, I want to put on the record that we on this side have a clear contrast between those on the opposite side. On their side, polluters get paid to continue to pollute. On our side, polluters pay for their pollution. On put their side, the government picks the winners. On our side, the market picks the winners. We will achieve targets; they will not achieve targets. We need to get on with the job of managing the economy, and we will not be doing anything adverse to the Australian people. (Time expired)",125
173,Mr COULTON,IMPORTANCE," The topic of this afternoon's matter of public importance is the adverse impact of the carbon tax on the Australian economy. I might just touch on the contributions we have heard from the government side. We heard the rant from the Minister for Trade, the flippant 15 minutes of diatribe that was completely unrelated to the topic of the day. I might add that the trade minister actually grew up in my electorate, in a little town called Baradine. When he moved to Queensland, the IQ of both places improved, but that is by the by. But I am looking forward to the minister coming to visit his old town, because when he does he is going to find the consequences of what happens when government dabbles in environmental matters-when government takes blind philosophy and turns it into a disaster, both ecological and financial. When the minister goes back to his old town of Baradine he will find that, instead of the 10 sawmills that were there when he left, there is now none; instead of the vibrant, living forest that sustained employment for hundreds of people, there is now a choking wilderness of cypress pine of which every couple of years another 50,000 hectares or so goes up in smoke and tortures all the wildlife within. That is what the minister will find happens when governments start to dabble in environmental policy. We heard a contribution from the member for Robertson, and she spoke about the fear campaign in this debate. She did not mention the member for Sydney visiting the Central Coast a couple of weeks ago and scaring the pants off the good folk at a retirement village about the rising sea levels, saying that the Central Coast was going to be underwater. It was totally unsubstantiated campaigning. The member for Robertson also spoke about being in her electorate's classrooms. I suspect that those in her classrooms will be hearing that the government is their friend, that the government controls all and to stay away from those nasty farmers who use our water to grow crops and who have those belching cows that add methane to the environment. I can just imagine being in the classrooms in the member for Robertson's electorate, but we will move on. The tone of this whole debate, from right back in 2008, on the emissions trading scheme and now the carbon tax has been one of fear from the government. We heard the member for Isaacs in his speech on the emissions trading scheme talking about his electorate going underwater. It is unsubstantiated. We heard from the member for Makin-I think it was in December at the time and it was 43 degrees in Adelaide-and he wanted that legislation passed by Christmas because he was worried about sunburn when he went to the beach. This policy was formulated in the middle of the worse drought in this country's history. We had the member for Wills talking about the dry river system of the Murray-Darling, somehow putting 10 years of drought down to the veracity of farmers, climate change and global warming, and saying that we needed to react. All of these untruths and overstated, emotional types of arguments have been used by the government to scare the pants off people. The job of the government is to give confidence to the people they serve. How can you give confidence to the people you serve when you are scaring the pants off them? At the moment I am co-chair of the Australian Parliamentary Friends of Meals on Wheels. The Meals on Wheels volunteers are telling me that this winter, when they scare were delivering the meals, they were finding the old folk in bed-not because they were unwell but because they were conserving energy. They are frightened. It is not that they don't have the money but that they are frightened of what is to come, because they have been told that they need to show austerity and tighten their belts because of climate change. Why are we getting this argument from the government? I will tell you why: it is because of the background of the members who have come from the union movement. The member for Robertson spoke about the small businesses in her electorate. The member for Riverina quipped that they probably used to be big businesses before this government came to power. I would like to know how many members of the government have actually run a business. How many of them have actually run an icecream cart or sold a dagwood dog? They have grown up on the sweat and blood of the Australian worker, sucked their way up to the size of some sort of large parasite to get to the stage where they could come into this place, but they have no idea what makes this country tick. I saw a classic example of this. It used to be in the electorate of Parkes and it is now in the electorate of Hunter-the Kandos cement plant that has been mentioned many times in this place. It is now closed. Despite the protestations from the member for Hunter, it is now closed because of the upcoming carbon tax. Cement Australia have been coming into my office for the last four years telling me, 'If we get a carbon tax the plant Kandos will close.' I went up there the day after that announcement was made and the members of the Australian Workers Union were there. Were they in uproar? Were they going to the media talking about this terrible government policy that had closed down a plant with a 100-year tradition and was putting over 100 people out of work? Not a squeak. Where was the champion of the Australian Workers Union, the member for Maribyrnong? Where was he when he should have been standing up for the workers of the cement industry? Put him in front of a TV camera with his head down a mine shaft, he is a champion; bring him in here and have him actually stand up for the people that he supposedly represents, not a squeak. This is a disgrace. The country is suffering a crisis of confidence because of this government. In the electorate of New England we have one of the largest meat processing plants in Australia, Bindaree Beef, run by the MCDonald family. It is the largest employer not only in Inverell but in the district. Off the top of my head, about a quarter of million cattle a year go through that plant. The increase in energy costs alone from this tax is going to cost that plant about $2.25 million. It is another impost. Members on the other side have never run a business. Margins on a plant like that are so small that an impost like that is unsustainable. Not only will we find 600 workers in Inverell out of a job, but the cattle producers from the four states that supply that plant will no longer have a market. Where is their local member? Where is the member for New England? Doing some sort of a cosy deal with Bob Brown and Co. Where was the member for New England when it was decided to bring in the idea that agricultural transport would be hit by this legislation? Agriculture-the backbone; the one industry that kept this country out of recession a at couple of years ago-is going to get hit from all sides. Every input that we use in agriculture-whether it is fuel, fertiliser, machinery-is going to be hit. They put in a scheme called the Carbon Farming Initiative. It is basically untried claptrap that will have very little effect on the environment and offer very little income to the farmer. In closing, why are we having a carbon tax? The obvious answer is: to save the environment. When was the last time we heard anyone from the government speak about the environment and how this was going to have that effect? This is like having a high school debate-it is removed from reality. No-one is saying that this is going to improve the environment one scrap in Australia or in the world. If it is not going to have an environmental effect, why are we doing it? Are we going to subject our children and our grandchildren and future Australians to becoming a second-class nation for some grand gesture? Does the Prime Minister think that the Greens and Bob Brown will be happy with this if it gets passed? What will be the next stage? The Greens are like that cancer eating away at the side of your head: not happy until they have consumed your entire body. It is not going to stop there. It is now time for members of the government to stand up for their electorates and show a bit of backbone. It is about time for the Independents, who sit up here behind me, to show a bit of ticker, stop looking after their political futures and look after the future of the people they represent. (Time expired)",126
174,Mr SYMON,IMPORTANCE," It is a pleasure to contribute to this matter of public importance. After some of the things we have heard in this debate today it will be good to get back to a few facts. The first one that I would like to talk about is the fact of global warming. While both sides of parliament have actually made commitment to do something about it, I really do wonder about the other side and where that commitment goes to. If Australia does not change its ways we will be left behind and the rest of the world will keep going. If we do not become a lowcarbon-emitting and efficient economy then the 21st century will be the century that Australia missed out on. Whilst other countries in the world-89 of them representing more than 80 per cent of global emissions and 90 per cent of the global economy-have pledged to reduce or limit their carbon emissions pollution by 2020, in Australia we are still arguing about it. Really, the time for that has passed. Just about the entire world is moving to reduce its carbon intensity by adopting new technologies and efficiencies. That is great see because it does take action from everyone, but if we do not act then why should anyone else? If that was applied to many of the things that had happened in the world in its recent history, nothing would have changed so action is essential. Australia has to be here and now, not waiting for everyone else to deal with it. It is estimated that the low-carbon goods and services sector that is already worth about $4.8 trillion today and employs around 28 million people worldwide is going to grow at four per cent a year. That growth will continue to accelerate as more countries introduce schemes to reduce their output of carbon emissions or greenhouse gases. The opposition has made all sorts of claims about the impact of the carbon price but the fact is the government will support our industries to become more efficient and help create new jobs in new industries. Treasury modelling, for instance, shows that with the carbon price jobs will continue to grow. In fact 1.6 million more jobs will be created by 2020, a a huge figure when you think about it. The Clean Energy Future package will tackle Australia's carbon emissions by charging the 500 largest polluters a price for the carbon emissions that they emit, which, up till now, is something they have done for free. The rest of us have to put up with the pollution that is put into our atmosphere, so user pays is not a bad principle for this type of thing. A price on carbon will create an incentive to reduce the emission of carbon and the revenue generated from the scheme will help industries adopt new technologies and will compensate consumers. In taking this step to introduce a price on carbon, it must be understood that industry needs support to adapt to a low-carbon future because it is a big change. Recognising the importance of to manufacturing and heavy industries that compete on international markets, use large amounts of energy and generate significant levels of carbon pollution is something that is accommodated in the Clean Energy Future package. Part of that package is the Jobs and Competitiveness Program to provide assistance to emissions-intensive tradeexposed industries. Over the first three years of the carbon price, the government will devote $9.2 billion of that revenue to assist those industries. There will be two categories of assistance under the Jobs and Competitiveness Program. The most emissions-intensive trade-exposed activities will initially be eligible for free permits representing 94.5 per cent of industry average carbon emission Manufacturing activities like aluminium smelting, steel manufacturing, flat glass making, zinc smelting and most pulp and paper manufacturing will be covered. The steel sector has the $300 million Steel Transformation Plan which provides additional assistance to help the industry transition to a clean energy future. Activities which have lower levels of carbon pollution such as some plastics and chemical manufacturing, tissue paper manufacturing and ethanol production will be eligible for free permits to cover 66 per cent of the industry average carbon costs. Liquefied natural gas projects will also receive a supplementary allocation to ensure an effective assistance rate of 50 per cent. The Jobs and Competitiveness Program will provide support for activities that generate more than 80 per cent of emissions within the manufacturing sector. There is also the $1.2 billion Clean Technology Program to support industries to become more competitive in a clean energy future. That includes $200 million to support jobs in food processing and metal forging industries and $800 million to provide grants to manufacturers to support investments in energy efficient capital equipment and lowpollution technologies, processes and products. That is a particularly important point because if manufacturers are still using old plant that was designed, made and has been used for many years, in many instances that plant was not really thought out properly when it came to energy efficiency. Did it do the job? Yes. Did it produce what was needed? Yes. Is it the most efficient in energy use? That was not a consideration maybe a few decades ago but is most definitely a consideration these days. There is also an additional $200 million over five years for grants to support business investment in research and development in costs. the areas of renewable energy, low-pollution technology and energy efficiency. That is also particularly important because it takes a lot of investment in R&D to come up with the ideas that we will use in the future. Australia cannot rely on the rest of the world to do all our R&D for us. It is allowing our best and brightest to go overseas when those ideas could be well catered for, at least the embryonic ideas, here and then brought to fruition here. That is another great advantage of the Clean Energy Future package. To help small business, the government will extend the small business instant asset write-off threshold to $6,500. If you think $6,500 is not that much, when you look at it across 2013-14, in one year that is worth more than $1 billion to small businesses, which is a significant amount. By boosting cash flow, it will help small businesses grow and invest in assets many of which, as I said, may be more energy efficient than what they currently are. In some ways you could compare it to buying a new car versus an old Holden you might have sitting around that is 30 years old. There is quite a difference in what you can get out of an engine in power and fuel usage but, again, that many years ago that was not really the top priority. For many years now cars have become more efficient with each model as technology has improved. That is just one example of where technology, through research and development, can create more efficiency and therefore less cost. The government will also establish a $40 million program to provide information to small businesses and community organisations on practical measures they can take to reduce energy costs. That is also very important because a lot of the time that energy is used and, because the bill comes later, it is not always realised what is used now. Many households can tell you about that when they receive their quarterly electricity, gas or even water bills because the instant use in an hour does not seem to add up. No-one sits back when they leave their lights on and says: 'Well, in three months time. I'm going to get the bill. It's going to be this much because I haven't turned off my lights.' But if you do not turn them off every night, or every day as the case may be, at the end of the quarter you in for a nasty shock. It also applies to businesses. Not knowing what you are using and not knowing the best way to use what you have got can cost you. So having a package to provide information to save money is a win-win for everyone. The Energy Security Fund will be established as part of the Clean Energy Future package. That fund is about shutting down old generation assets. In Victoria, where I come from, most of the baseload power is generated by brown coal power stations. Some, like Hazelwood, date right back to the 1960s. They were built at a time when pollution and efficiency were not taken into account. What was taken into account was the massive amounts of very cheap brown coal upon which these power stations in the Latrobe Valley literally sit. Whilst they have been of great service to Victoria over the years, many of them should have been shut down a long time ago. After the State Electricity Commission was privatised, private entities bought these generators. (Time expired)",129
175,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE," Order! There being no further speakers, the discussion is now concluded. NA Queensland Floods",131
176,Mr MCCLELLAND,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS," by leave-Today the government tabled its response to the Queensland Floods Commission of Inquiry interim report. The Queensland floods were catastrophic on every level-but most significantly in the 34 people who lost their lives and the three people who remain missing. Obviously our thoughts remain with their families, friends and communities. These events were a tragedy not only for those families and communities and are Queensland but for our nation. The floods brought enormous devastation to many communities across Queensland and caused billions of dollars of damage to property and infrastructure-damage that will inevitably take years to rebuild. Since the floods struck, the Australian government has said it will stand by the people of Queensland to help them rebuild their lives and their communities, and that is happening. Overall, we are investing $4.7 billion in Queensland to help families, businesses and the community get back on their feet. The government has committed an extra $950 million for regions affected by tropical Cyclone Yasi. The Australian government provided over $840 million in disaster recovery payments and income recovery subsidies through Centrelink to help individuals and families cope through the floods and after Yasi hit, helping more than 735,000 Queenslanders in that difficult period. We have made an advance payment of more than $2 billion to Queensland to provide an immediate boost to recovery and reconstruction efforts. The vast majority of this funding is being invested in repairing damage to essential infrastructure, such as road, bridges, schools and other public infrastructure that is so essential for life return to normal. With the Queensland government, we have also provided more than $477 million in ‘advance' disaster payments to 56 councils across Queensland. This has been managed through the Queensland Reconstruction Authority. Funding from both governments for road repairs and reconstruction has been allocated across the state including:  $928 million to repair roads in the Fitzroy region, including Rockhampton;  $463 million to repair roads across Far North Queensland;  $155 million to repair roads in North Queensland;  $300 million to repair roads in Mackay and the Whitsundays;  $195 million to repair roads in north-west Queensland; and  $470 million to repair roads in the Lockyer Valley and Ipswich regions. Already 8,482 kilometres of the 9,170 kilometres of damaged state roads in Queensland have been reopened and 4,421 kilometres of Queensland rail infrastructure have already been rebuilt or recovered. This is great progress, but no-one is under any illusions about the magnitude of the job that still lies ahead. While the government are supporting the rebuilding of communities Queensland as quickly as possible, we are also ensuring funding is spent effectively and efficiently. We have done this by putting in place strong oversights through the Queensland Reconstruction Authority and the Australian Government Reconstruction Inspectorate. We are determined to work with the Queensland government and local communities to rebuild this great state. While this reconstruction work continues to across Queensland, the next wet season is quickly approaching. This is why acting on the commission's interim report is so important. It makes recommendations about what can and should be done now, as far as is possible, to avoid the devastation of last year's events and should Queensland be unlucky enough to suffer through another severe wet season this summer. The Commonwealth welcomes the commission's findings and recommendations. They provide the opportunity to critically examine and improve the emergency management arrangements and capabilities not only for Queensland but for the entire nation. Of the commission's 175 recommendations, eight are directed to the Commonwealth either in full or in part. A further 26 recommendations directed to the Queensland government and local councils also require Commonwealth involvement and assistance. The Commonwealth accepts all of the recommendations directed to it by the commission and will work closely with the Queensland government-and where necessary with other states and territoriesto ensure those recommendations are implemented. Most of the recommendations of relevance to the Commonwealth focus on forecasts and warnings issued by the Bureau of Meteorology. It is clear that effective warning systems are an essential part of any across emergency management framework. The Bureau of Meteorology has a critical role to play in this by providing warnings about weather conditions and the potential for flooding. As recommended by the commission, the bureau will work closely with the Queensland government and local councils to improve information sharing during flood events and to improve arrangements for flash flood warnings including providing technical support to local councils for the establishment of appropriate river height and rainfall gauges. The Australian government has separately established a review of the bureau's capacity to provide seasonal forecasting services and to respond to extreme weather events and natural disasters. Other recommendations of relevance to the Commonwealth address the contribution of the Australian Defence Force to disaster planning and preparation as well as the Commonwealth's involvement in community education. The Commonwealth plays an important role in helping Australian communities to prevent, prepare for, respond to, and recover from disasters. We will continue to support the states and territories in their disaster planning and preparedness activities and are doing that this summer in a number of ways. Firstly, Emergency Management Australia undertakes annual pre-season briefings on disaster planning and preparations with state and territory emergency management agencies and we also plan to continue the practice of pre-positioning Emergency Management Australia liaison officers with state and territory emergency response agencies. This year's briefings are scheduled to commence in October and will include presentations from the Australian Defence Force, Bureau of Meteorology and other Commonwealth agencies that have a key role in supporting states and territories during a crisis. The Commonwealth will also ensure the Department of Health and Ageing continues to advise facilities of their responsibilities under the Aged Care Act 1997 with respect to prevention of harm and, specifically, evacuation plans for their residents. Facilities are required to have appropriate evacuation plans in place under the act. In upcoming facility visits, the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency will ensure high priority continues to be given to inspections of the arrangements that homes have in place to manage emergency events including evacuations should they be the subject of a natural disaster. On behalf of the Australian government, I would like to commend the commission for its efforts and for delivering its Interim report within such a demanding time frame. It is an impressive feat given the sheer scope of the event and the evidence put before it. The government will continue to cooperate with the commission as the next round of hearings commences and we look forward to receiving the commission's final report in February of next year. There is no completely foolproof way to floodproof Australia. We should be preparing communities to be prepared and to be capable of dealing with natural disasters when they occur, and the Australian government will continue to work in partnership with all levels of government and communities to reduce the risk of future devastating floods as we saw in Queensland and across the country this year. I thank the House. I also present a copy of the Commonwealth response to the Interim report of the Queensland Floods Commission of Inquiry and a copy of my ministerial statement. I move: That the House take note of the documents. I also ask leave of the House to move a motion to enable the member for Stirling to speak for nine minutes. Leave granted.",131
177,Mr MCCLELLAND,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent Mr Keenan speaking for a period not exceeding nine minutes. Question agreed to.,134
178,Mr KEENAN,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS," In acknowledging the government's response to the Queensland Floods Commission of Inquiry Interim report, the coalition joins the government in extending the parliament's condolences and sympathies to the families and communities who endured horrific tragedy and loss last summer. Those 34 lives lost represent an unfulfilled future. Every one of those lives would have been important to many others as a father, a mother or other family member, or as a friend, and they all would have left large holes in the lives of people they left behind. The pain and loss would also be ongoing for families of the three people who remain missing, and not knowing the fate of loved ones would continue to haunt them. We acknowledge too that for many that suffering continues long after the skies have cleared and floodwaters have receded. It is appropriate too, in reflecting upon the Queensland Floods Commission of Inquiry Interim report, to once again take the opportunity to recognise those who made deep sacrifices to assist others in those extraordinary days and weeks. We recognise the professionalism of those in uniform: State Emergency Service volunteers, police, fire and paramedics, the men and women of the Australian Defence Force, helicopter rescue pilots and those responsible for the countless acts of generosity, heroism, charity and kindness that did not feature on our television screens. We acknowledge too the leadership shown by the then Lord Mayor of Brisbane, Campbell Newman, and the Queensland Premier, Anna Bligh. We remember the announcement of the Prime Minister on Australia Day with flood victims in Toowoomba, that she would introduce a National Emergency Medal to recognise the heroes of that summer and those of the Victorian bushfires. This is a promise that the opposition looks forward to the Prime Minister keeping. The Queensland Floods Commission of Inquiry Interim report was the product of public hearings held in Brisbane, Toowoomba, Dalby, Goondiwindi, St George, Ipswich, Rockhampton and Emerald. The commission heard testimony from 167 witnesses, and met with communities, including Murphys Creek and Grantham. The focus of the Interim report was upon matters related to preparedness for the next storm and flood season, which is nearly upon us. The commission's final report is expected in late February next year. It is understood that this report will deal with other issues, including the vexed issue of property insurance. We are now halfway through September. Communities around Australia are already preparing for the hazards of the season ahead, be they the risk of bushfire, floods, cyclone or severe storms. As communities prepare, so too must governments. The Queensland Floods Commission of Inquiry Interim report was timely and presented the Queensland government with many ways it can better deal with disasters of this nature in seasons to come. At a Commonwealth level, as the Attorney has mentioned, there is important work to be done by the Bureau of Meteorology, Emergency Management Australia and the Australian Defence Force, among others. Preventing, preparing for, responding to and recovering from natural disasters has always been the collaborative responsibility of the Commonwealth, state, territory and local governments. Much has been learned, at all levels of government, from last summer. The Attorney-General was correct when he said that we cannot completely floodproof Australia. We in Australia have always been subject to the harshest elements of nature. Our harsh and unforgiving environment has done much to shape our national character and instil within us resilience as a people. The disasters of last summer were catastrophic on every level. But, as catastrophic as they were, the response of Queenslanders was courageous and inspiring and we salute them for their resilience in the face of nature's terrible Debate adjourned.

Dr MIKE KELLY (Eden-MonaroParliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (17:04): Before concluding the contribution I began earlier today in this debate on the Clean Energy Future package of bills, can I say that some of the submissions we heard from what I would call the 'flat earth society' in the matter of public importance debate put me in mind of the old Army expression 'Lead, follow or get out of the way.' What we know is that during those 12 Howard years when the chance was there for leadership nothing was done in this space. In fact, shamefully, our renewable energy capacity in this country went backwards during those 12 years, from 10 per cent to nine per cent. So that 12 years of opportunity was lost, no ratification of Kyoto, complete abrogation of responsibility. Then this government came into power in 2007 and the very first act that Kevin Rudd did as Prime Minister was to ratify Kyoto. Before the rest of us had even been sworn into our portfolios that ink was drying. It was a fantastic step forward. So the opportunity was there then for the opposition to follow and, I must give them credit, there was a time when they did. There was a time when Malcolm Turnbull and Ian Macfarlane lined up and engaged constructively with the government to move this ball forward. Then, of course, came the coup, a coup driven by the desire of the Leader of the Opposition based purely on politics and his ambitions to become Prime Minister, so that opportunity to follow was lost. Now here we are in this parliament where there is an opportunity for this opposition just get out of the way. Effectively they made themselves irrelevant in this debate. They have absconded from the field when we had an opportunity to engage through the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee and they did not engage. I ask for the opposition to just get out of the way now that they have made themselves irrelevant. Go home over this weekend, have a look at your children and your grandchildren and think about their future and think about how you want to be remembered. What will be your legacy and where will your name be in relation to this vote when this debate is done? (Time expired)",135
184,Mr MORRISON,BILLS," I rise to speak today in defence of Australian jobs, Australian families and Australian small businesses-especially those jobs, families and businesses in the Sutherland shire of my electorate of Cook. The Leader of the Opposition astutely concluded his remarks today by describing these clean energy bills as one of the longest political suicide notes by a government in our history. There is a reason for his observation. The government have spoken about the judgment of history. That judgment will not be kind to this government. But what they do not want to do is enable these bills to be judged by the Australian people, and they have sought to thwart and deny that judgment at every opportunity. The Prime Minister and this government misled the Australian people before the last election. The Prime Minister declared there would be no carbon tax under the government she leads. Having broken this pledge, forming her government on her deceit, she has compounded the insult by vilifying those who now seek to hold her to account. That is not just those in the opposition; it is the millions of Australians across the country she and her colleagues to have demonised as an ignorant mob. Her have ministers have arrogantly claimed in this place that those who sought to oppose this government were of no consequence. This government will ultimately have to keep a date with the Australian people when they will be judged for their deceit, their incompetence, their arrogance and their hypocrisy. For most Australians, that day cannot come soon enough. The solution most Australians want, whether it is on the carbon tax, illegal boat arrivals, reckless spending or Labor's simple inability to get anything right, is an election solution. The impact of this carbon tax will be far reaching. It will tax everything that moves and breathes. However, if they believe these measures will cool the globe-while mortgaging Australia's future in the process-they are simply dreaming. As Senator Joyce has remarked: … if taxes cooled the planet, the place would already be an icebox. Lincoln said: No man is good enough to govern another man without that other's consent. His singular reference to gender was not intended to exclude our Prime Minister from this wisdom. This tax is more than a broken promise. It is another fundamental betrayal of trust by a government that simply cannot be trusted. The majority of shire families will be worse off under Labor's carbon tax. On the government's own figures, those who will be greatest hit in the shire will be Labor's forgotten families, especially those where one parent stays at home to care for their children. They are the biggest losers under this government's bad tax. The government's own figures show that single-income families earning $65,000 or more, with one child, will be worse off. For single-income families with two children, the pain begins at $80,000. For two-income families, the pain begins at $105,000 per household. The average income of a person in such a family is less than the average annual national earnings for a person-less than $10,000 than those same average earnings annually for a person in New South Wales, let alone Sydney, where the cost of living is one of the highest in the world today. These impacts will be felt more severely in Sydney than anywhere else because of our already high costs of living. Neither the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, the Assistant Treasurer nor even the minister at the table, the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, understand the daily life and costs of living that Sydneysiders must already bear. We are struggling with rising rents, rising electricity prices and increased costs of living across the board. This is a government that is completely oblivious to the challenges faced by Sydneysiders on a daily basis, and this tax is a prime example of the way that this government simply does not get it in terms of what is happening in Sydney-whether it is in the plains of Western Sydney, the Blue Mountains or the Sutherland shire in my own electorate of Cook. In the shire, the 2006 census revealed that the median household income for families with children was between $104,000 and $130,000 a year. Five years on, average weekly earnings have leapt by 20 per cent. This means the majority of shire families will be beyond the reach of Labor's compensation package. But it is not only families who stand to be hurt by this tax. A constituent recently, last month, wrote to me and stated: Single people get absolutely no tax breaks or benefits. Yet our incomes are chipped away through ordinary tax increases, carbon taxes, flood and Medicare levies and insurance premium increases. I feel that single people are being discriminated against in all of these government decisions. The carbon tax comes on top of yet another broken Labor promise-their budget assault on more than 100,000 Cook residents covered by private health insurance, with Labor's plan to cut access to the private health insurance rebate. The flood tax, costing around $250, kicked in this financial year. From 1 July, residents of New South Wales are already facing an average 17 per cent leap in the price of power before this government introduces its carbon tax. This tax will increase also electricity prices by a further 10 per cent in the first year under the carbon tax, which will also see gas prices go up by nine per cent, on their own figures. This toxic tax will also cost local businesses and threaten jobs. In my electorate there are around 400 manufacturing businesses that employ one or more people. One of those businesses is shire engineering and tool-making business C A Rich Patternmakers and Toolmakers in Taren Point, run by Stephen Rich. Stephen's father, Charles, started this business in the 1950s with his wife, Gwendolin, who did the books for many years as well as raising their family. They are like so many other entrepreneurial small business people who set up businesses in the shire at that time. These businesses have driven generations of prosperity and opportunity for themselves, their employees and our shire. Their business is more than just a job; it is their passion, their obsession and their legacy. This carbon tax will put at risk generations of hard work by these families to create a viable business and generate local employment. These family businesses have already had to weather the tough financial climate and fight increasing competition from overseas. The last thing they need in the shire and elsewhere in this country is a carbon tax to add to the pressures they face. Like so many engineering and light manufacturing businesses, CA Rich are carbon rich in their production. This carbon tax will hit almost everything that moves on their factory floor, whether it is the electricity they need to keep the machines running, the heavy steel, aluminium or other metal material inputs they work with or the transport costs of shifting this around to and from their suppliers and to their clients. They will be hit from every single angle imaginable. In additional to manufacturing, the carbon tax will also strike our local transport, freight, maritime logistics, aviation, utilities and construction sector. In my electorate, there are around 11½ thousand of these businesses. Manufacturing, transportation, construction and utilities account for more than one-third of the jobs of Cook residents. Thousands of shire residents are employed in these sectors, especially in and around the airport. I particularly make the point that Caltex, Qantas and Virgin will feature in Labor's list of dangerous big polluters who they say will and should be taxed. The global aviation industry is incredibly competitive and it is not a level playing field. Any impost at all within the group structure of these airlines impedes the ability of these businesses to profit and, as a result, employ-especially locally here in Australia. Qantas estimates the carbon tax will cost it approximately $100 million to $115 million in 2012-13 and Virgin has put the cost to its operations at $45 million-and there is no compensation. Caltex directly employs 500 people at its operation in Kurnell and a further 500 contractors, though contractor numbers can increase significantly during maintenance programs that occur at the plant. There is no doubt these bills will not assist the ongoing viability of Caltex's operations at Kurnell, which are already vulnerable. When interviewed on Lateline Business recently, Caltex CEO and MD Julian Segal noted Caltex had already initiated a review of the ongoing role of their refineries, including their operations at Kurnell and, more specifically, the two catalytic crackers. Energy analyst Mark Samter said in the same report that Caltex refineries may now be converted to import terminals. At a time when such marginal decisions are in play, the blindside hit of the carbon tax can only make operations more marginal and potentially tip the balance against local jobs. But it is not just local families, residents and businesses in the shire who will be hit. I recently attended Civic Disability Services, who for more than 50 years have provided care and a sense of purpose for those with disabilities in the shire. They do a fantastic job and have managed to do it on commercial terms, despite the pressures of an increasingly tough economic climate. Civic Disability Services employ more than 100 people, the vast majority of those with disabilities, doing meaningful work so they can better support themselves. But here is the issue: after paying to employ people with disabilities, their second biggest cost, they told me, is their power bill. The Gillard government's carbon tax means a 10 per cent hike in those bills in the first year alone, and after that the prices will only go up. Civic Disability Services are able to provide meaningful employment and purpose to the lives of people with disabilities in the shire because they can provide a commercial and competitive service to real commercial clients, who expect high standards at an major affordable cost. Every time Civic flicks the switch and turns on the lights, let alone powers up a machine on the factory floor, Labor's carbon tax will make the services they provide to their customers, including international contracts, less competitive. Yet Labor is offering no compensation for notfor-profit organisations like Civic for the cost impacts of the carbon tax. There are many other not-for-profit organisations like Civic in the shire, and they will all feel the pinch. Many will be forced to pass the carbon tax costs on to the very people they serve through increased fees, reduced services or simply walking away. These businesses should be encouraged and rewarded for the continued standard of care and commitment to their community, not taxed mindlessly. Finally, there is the issue of simply how you could trust the Labor government, the most incompetent we have seen, to implement such a massive change-a $9 billion new tax. The government have not been able to deliver any major program without excessive waste, bungling or catastrophe, be it the roof batts, the NBN, BER or, particularly, my own portfolio area, border protection, where costs have blown out from less than $100 million a year to more than $1 billion a year. This carbon tax is also an egregious intrusion of big government into our economy and our society. Australians are not whingers, but there comes a point when businesses, families and single people within our community are pushed beyond their limit. There will be repercussions for a government without a mandate trying to ram through this legislation, and it will be fatal for them. These measures are all pain and no environmental gain. Under this package, our domestic carbon emissions in 2020 will actually be higher than they are now. Twothirds of the abatement will have to be bought offshore from foreign carbon traders at a cost of $3.5 billion, rising to $57 billion in 2050, or 1½ per cent of GDP-a scheme which the Australian Crime Commission has highlighted will involve $5 billion in fraud. And we will be out there on our own. The Productivity Commission found that there was no other country seeking to impose an economy wide carbon price. The government seems to have developed complete amnesia about the collapse of the carbon price agenda at Copenhagen. The European ETS raises only about $500 million a year, or $1 per person. Labor's carbon tax in this country will raise $9 billion, or around $400 for every Australian. In the United States, where I visited earlier this year, it was very clear based on my own inquiries with congressional members from both sides of the aisle that a cap-and-trade system is not on the agenda anytime soon, and certainly not before 2020. At least the United States have worked out that a carbon tax or even an ETS in the current economic climate is the economic lunacy. In Canada, they have equally made the sensible decision, not just in economic policy but in a democratic sense as well, where the government has listened to the Canadian people and walked away from these policies. While the Labor government cites China as emissions reductions leader, the truth is that its emissions will increase by 500 per cent by 2020. The coalition have fiercely opposed this tax from day one and we will continue to fight this tax, here and everywhere we can, for Australian jobs, small businesses and families, and particularly my own community and the shire. I particularly want to commend the Leader of the Opposition for being the people's champion on this issue, ably supported by the member for Flinders and my many other colleagues, including the member for Indi, who is at table with me today. The coalition is the only force standing in the way of this toxic tax. We are energised by the support of the Australian people in this endeavour and we will not let them down. If the Prime Minister in her arrogance persists in ignoring the voice of Australians and imposes this odious tax, then let it be on her head. History will indeed judge her and it will not be kind. When the time comes for the Australian people to have the opportunity to act on this issue, an opportunity that this Prime Minister and this government have denied them time and again, their judgment will be absolutely resounding. Mr STEPHEN JONES (Throsby) (17:21): Modern Australia was built on the efforts on men and women who were willing to make an investment in the future of this great country, men and women who had a vision beyond the present and men and women who thought about the future of this country and what it might look like for their children and beyond. They were led by governments who in the main believed in building a country which was the envy of the world and a place to build our hopes and dreams. The question for this generation of leaders, the people who occupy this place, is whether we have the right to claim the title of heirs to this legacy, whether we have the courage to build and to introduce policies which are in the future national interest and look beyond short-term political opportunism, because this generation does indeed have a challenge. We know that greenhouse gases are one-third higher than before the Industrial Revolution. We know that global temperatures have risen by 0.7 degrees Celsius over the past century. We know that unabated they will continue to rise. We know that the last decade was the world's hottest on record and we know that globally 2010 was the equal warmest year on record. We know 2010 was the 34th consecutive year with global temperatures above the 20th century average and we know that climate change and global warming are real. We know the consequences are real and we know that we have to change the way that we do things in Australia and around the world if we are to avoid catastrophic changes. We know that if we do not act our children will pay the price. This government has a realistic plan on how it will respond to this generational challenge. We have a target, which is shared by those on the other side of the chamber, though they sometimes deny that climate change is real. Nonetheless, we have a target which is shared by all in this place of reducing our carbon emissions by five per cent over 2020 levels. On this side of the House, we have a plan to tackle this in the most efficient and effective way. Our plan will put a price on carbon, because we believe this is the most effective way to ensure that we change gradually and do not need to put in place dramatic efforts to reduce our carbon emissions if we leave the situation to continue unabated. We will do this in a way that brings households along with us and looks after those who are in need of assistance. Under our plan nine out of 10 households will receive assistance through either tax cuts or payment increases. Almost six million households will get tax cuts or increases in payments that cover the entire average price of the introduction of carbon pricing. Over four million Australian households will get an additional buffer with the assistance that covers 120 per cent of the average price impact of the carbon price. The net effect of this is that they will have the capacity to adjust the way that they live and the way they use energy and, if they do, they will be able to pocket the difference. If they are unable to make these changes, then they will be no worse off. This presents us with an enormous opportunity to put in place some significant tax reform. As a result of our increase in the tax threshold, shifting the tax threshold from $6,000 to $18,000, over one million Australians will no longer need to lodge a tax return. On average our package will cost households around $9.90 a week, but they will get $10.10 assistance in return. This assistance will be permanent, and the government will review the adequacy of assistance each year and increase it further necessary. It is no secret in this place and elsewhere that I have had a lot to say about the manufacturing industry and in particular the steel industry, as it is so important to my electorate of Throsby, which takes in Port Kembla and the BlueScope steelworks and many other manufacturing businesses. I am very pleased to see that, as a result of advocacy of many members on this side of the House, including me and my colleague from the Illawarra, the member for Cunningham, Sharon Bird, we have been able to see some significant assistance for manufacturing and the steel industry make the necessary transitions. I point to the Jobs and Competiveness program, which is an important part of this package of legislation. It will provide assistance to emissionsintensive and trade-exposed industries with the aim of supporting jobs and businesses make the transition. The way this assistance is provided maintains the incentive for companies to reduce their carbon pollution partly because they will compete with each other and other companies to look for costcutting ways to ensure that they do not lose a market edge. The initial rate of assistance will be 94.5 per cent for the most emissionsintensive and trade-exposed industries and 66 per cent for moderate emissions-intensive industries. This will provide significant shielding for many, many industries in my electorate of Throsby. In addition to providing the free permits and the free assistance for those emissionsintensive industries, two separate funds have been set up to assist businesses in the manufacturing of food and foundries and related industries to make the necessary adjustments to transform their businesses and to implement energy-saving and energyefficiency measures, technologies and as processes. I point to the $200 million Food and Foundries Investment Program, which will provide grants for manufacturers in the food-processing and metal-forging and foundry sectors to invest in energy-efficiency projects and low-emission technologies, processes and products. In addition, an $800 million clean technology investment program will provide grants for those manufacturers in a sector not eligible for other forms of assistance to invest in energyefficiency projects and low-emissions technologies, processes and products. Separate from the CEF package of bills, but being debated at the same time, is the Steel Transformation Bill 2011. The steel industry is facing considerable pressure in Australia and right around the world at the moment. Many say it has not yet recovered from the global financial crisis. In Australia we are facing additional pressures due to the high Australian dollar and the high input costs of iron ore and coal. The Steel Transformation Bill provides the legislative framework for the establishment of a steel transformation plan, which provides a $300 million special appropriation to assist the two main steel producers, BlueScope and OneSteel, to introduce mechanisms, innovations and investments to ensure that they reduce their carbon intensity and assist them make the structural transformation necessary to ensure that they still have a viable future in this country. Indeed, the bringing forward of $100 million in this special appropriation was instrumental in assisting BlueScope, which has recently announced a significant restructuring of its operations-including those in Port Kembla in my electorate. This will have a significant impact on the local economy, and I fear that without the bringing forward of that $100 million in assistance the future for BlueScope in Port Kembla would have been very dire indeed-much worse, in fact, than the current situation. The plan for the fund contains two elements. The first will provide for a competitiveness assistance advance payment, which I have just referred to, to the value of $164 million in 2011-12. The second element will be the balance, which will be made up to $300 million over five years from 2012-13. The net effect of the free permits provided under the Jobs and Competitiveness Program and the additional $300 million in assistance under the Steel Transformation Plan mean that, effectively, the steel industry is completely shielded from the impact of the carbon price and is provided with the necessary assistance to enable it to try to restructure itself and its way out of a very difficult global and domestic environment for steel. This government is committed to ensuring that there is a bright future for steel in the Illawarra and throughout the country. As a local member, I will be working with other members representing manufacturing electorates to make sure that our government does everything within its power to assist steel manufacturing through this difficult environment. The countries of the world are changing. They are, in effect, in a race to transform their economies. We are not the only country which is acting to transform itself to make sure that we have the capacity to reduce our carbon emissions and to transform our industries and to ensure that, as they grow, they do so in a way which is environmentally sustainable and preserves the planet for the future of our children. If we know that we are in a race to transform our economy, it beggars belief that in this country we would want to implement policies which would hamstring our country in the race-that we would say that we know that the world is in a global race to transform itself but that we should have a handicap and not start making the transformation as soon as possible. I am pleased to say that this package of legislation has the balance right. It has the balance right between providing assistance to households and ensuring that, on the one hand, our emissions-intensive trade-exposed industries have the right degree of shielding to be able to trade and be competitive in a difficult environment and that, on the other hand, they have the incentives to reduce their carbon emissions. It has the balance right in that it will provide significant funds to assist manufacturing, food and foundry industries to transform themselves with assistance from government through co-investment schemes. It has the balance right by ensuring that trade households and businesses are assisted through the process of transformation. We are doing the right thing by putting a price on carbon and, instead of having a centralised, government-controlled mechanism where government makes the decisions and attempts to pick winners, we will enable individual businesses and individual households to make the millions of decisions on an hourly and daily basis that are necessary for them to be able to transform their work and consumption practices and their household arrangements and so reduce their energy use and carbon emissions. In this debate there has been some criticism of our intention to ensure that, as we move to an emissions trading scheme, we will enable ourselves to integrate with other economies around the world which also have emissions trading schemes in place. In fact, the attacks I have just heard from those opposite include an attack on the international trade and emissions permits. This attack falls awkwardly from the mouths of those who deny the fact that there is international action on climate change. On the one hand, they argue that we are so far out in front that we are acting in a way completely incompatible with every other economy in the world; on the other hand, they criticise us for attempting to put in place a mechanism which will enable our emissions trading scheme to be integrated with similar emissions trading schemes in Europe and other places around the world. However, what lies at the heart of these criticisms is not a serious policy confrontation but an attempt to whip up the fear that there is some conspiracy behind these arrangements. These criticisms have very little policy credibility. I commend the package of legislation to the House. This is without doubt a difficult debate, but I return to the theme that I started with: the prosperity that we now enjoy in this great country of ours was the result of the efforts of men and women who were willing to put aside their immediate interests and invest in the future. They had the courage to put the national interest and the future interests of this country ahead of immediate short-term political opportunism, and I encourage all men and women in this place who are of good will to act in that tradition, which is in the best traditions of this country and this parliament, by voting in favour of these bills. Mrs MIRABELLA (Indi) (17:36): I do not think we need to dig too hard to find why that address by the member for Throsby could possibly go down as the most passionless, unconvincing address in this parliament, certainly in the almost 10 years that I have been here. As a member representing a manufacturing electorate he knows, in his heart of hearts-as do all the other members on the other side, including the member for Corangamite, and as do the senators who represent Victoria and New South Wales-that manufacturing regions are suffering. I am sure those members do their job and speak to those who run large that is manufacturing businesses and small manufacturing businesses and speak to the union members who work in manufacturing enterprises, so they know what everyone else in this country knows: a carbon tax is going to have a negative impact on our manufacturing sector. Why? Because it will make the cost of making things in Australia more expensive and, effectively, it will give a leg-up to imports that compete with our manufactured goods. That is one aspect of why the member for Throsby would be so downcast and passionless while perhaps doing his duty by his party. Perhaps it is time for him and others on the government benches to think about their duty to Australia and what they could do in the national interest. The Prime Minister has talked much about the national interest in the last few days. Perhaps some on the other side could think about the national interest in deliberating on how they will vote on these bills. In trying to encapsulate what is fundamentally wrong with the government's approach I was given some great insights and guidance by some of the comments that Morris Iemma, former Labor premier of New South Wales, has said. I will indulge myself and the House by reading some of his comments because I think they are very illuminating. He said: One thing is sure-it won't change the world, but it could change the government. We embraced economic growth, and the benefits of economic growth, in the HawkeKeating era, but we're fighting this battle on the Greens' turf, not our turf. Bob Brown wants to replace the Labor Party as a major party. He went on: Yes, we should take action, but we should not get so far out in front that we injure ourselves. He said: Every day there are reports of growth and development in China, its growth in emissions will far outstrip our total emissions. And: We've adopted a policy which is part of the Greens' agenda. And the Greens' agenda is anti-growth and anti-investment. Lower growth and lower investment lead to lower incomes and fewer jobs. We should always be standing shoulder to shoulder with steelworkers and miners and factory workers before we stand shoulder to shoulder with the likes of Bob Brown and Christine Milne. I do not think it could have been said in clearer words. Those are the sorts of words one would have expected a solid Labor citizen of bygone eras to have come out with but today we hear nothing of those words from current representatives in this House. Don Argus has also made some interesting points. Sometimes the obvious points are not repeated often enough. Don Argus has said that change is not reform. That is obviously true. When governments find themselves in trouble and they want to appear as if they are acting in the national interest they rush to change something. Irrespective of whether it is good or bad they will label it as 'reform' rather than 'change' because the word 'reform' has innate positive qualities. Let us ask ourselves why this government is pursuing this change. If you believe them, and it was to save the planet-to reduce worldwide emissions-then we would have heard the Prime Minister say, before polling day: 'We need to do our bit to save the planet. That is why I promise you that the government I lead will introduce a carbon tax.' But she did not. The only reason we are having a debate on these bills is that that is the price that was extracted by the Greens to support the Prime Minister in keeping her job after the election. I am very disappointed with that because the Prime Minister is touted as a great negotiator. If, in fact, the Prime Minister was a great negotiator she should have worked out that there is no way that the Greens would ever have supported the coalition. She did not have to sell the Labor Party's soul and give them this job-destroying, economydestroying carbon tax. We are here because the Labor Party panicked and decided to give into the Greens' demands. So when we hear those sanctimonious words-that this is all about the environment; this is all about saving the planet-we know that they are not true. What we may find is that we may end up with an increase in worldwide emissions because when we export our manufacturing to countries that are not as efficient as us they will make the same things we make but create more emissions in doing so. We have seen in Europe that they have effectively exported some of their manufacturing. They still have a demand for goods that produce emissions but those emissions are produced in other countries. That carbon leakage will certainly occur in this nation as well. There has been a bit of misinformation. The government are trying-they still are to convince us that we cannot be behind the rest of the world and that we have to stay in step with what the rest of the world are doing. But who are we staying in step with? Absolutely no-one. The only steps we are following are the ones carved out by the Greens in this parliament, and they are hardly the voice of mainstream Australia. We have seen disingenuous comparisons made with China. And we have seen the climate change minister embarrassed because he referred to a report that said that China had a higher effective carbon price than we did. That was found not to be correct and he embarrassingly tried to distance himself from the report. When we look at China's official policy we find that the policy is actually to reduce emissions intensity. If you look at the projected growth you find that if China reduces its emissions intensity by 17 per cent by 2015 it will work out to be an increase in total CO2 of 17 per cent on 2011 figures in absolute terms. When we look at the rest of the world, we see that no- go offshore. one has introduced the sort of carbon tax the Prime Minister is proposing. That is not because no-one smarter in the world has come up with this; it is because everyone else in the world is more concerned and focused on what they can do to assist their economies and industries to survive the current difficult economic times that they face. When we look at what Europe has done we see that 95 per cent of carbon permits in the first few years of its scheme were given out for free. We found that the scheme in Europe had effectively little impact in reducing emissions. A Euro poll found that there was about $5 billion worth of fraud in the purchase of overseas permits in just under two years. This government, on its own figures, says, 'By 2020 we will reduce emissions by 160 million tonnes.' Guess what? One hundred million of those tonnes will be through the purchase of permits from overseas. The European Union Emissions Trading Scheme raises about $500 million a year, and that is how much this government's carbon tax will raise in three months. The impact of the carbon tax in this country will be something unprecedented in the rest of the world. India, which accounts for five per cent of total global emissions, and rising, has no plans for an ETS. Canada has no plans for an ETS. The US has effectively abandoned all talk of an emissions trading scheme. So the time has come to really assess what the government are trying to do and for members on the other side to look in their heart of hearts and, for just once in the term of this government, put the national interest ahead of their party's interest, because the impact on the Australian economy and the cost of living will leave its mark. It will take years of suffering and years of restructuring our economy, and it will see efficient businesses Households are already suffering with the increase in the cost of living. We have seen the cost of housing increase, yet a carbon tax will increase the cost of a new home by $5,000. It will add $36 a month to the average mortgage of just over $340,000. The Food and Grocery Council said that the annual increase in grocery bills will be $120. Australian cars will be $400 more expensive than imported cars because of the carbon tax. Agriculture will have increased costs through the increase in the cost of fuel, fertiliser and electricity. There is even the local supermarket. I take the example of a supermarket in Wangaratta. The local IGA calculated the increase in their electricity costs. They said to me, 'Our competitive advantage is that we are 1c cheaper than the major supermarket, so we can't put up our prices. So we've already told our staff that, in order to pay for the increase in the electricity bill, we will have to reduce staff numbers.' These are real businesses out there trying to make a living and trying to employ people in their local communities. Many industries have commented on some of the government's figures. A very important part of our manufacturing base is the food and grocery sector. In fact, it is the largest manufacturing sector. Kate Carnell, the Chief Executive of the Australian Food and Grocery Council, said: For Julia Gillard to say that food companies who aren't in the top 1000 emitters won't be affected by carbon tax is simply wrong. Manufacturers will be impacted right across the supply chain from higher costs in transport, power, refrigeration and food and grocery manufacturing. We have seen comments right across the heavy manufacturing sector as well. Interestingly, we have not heard too much from someone who should be representing manufacturing workers. In April, Paul Howes, the National Secretary of the AWU, said: Carbon pricing could be the straw that breaks the camel's back as far as some of these industries are concerned. If one job is gone, our support is gone. I do not think I would rely too much on those words because jobs are going now in preparation for a carbon tax. The government has spoken much about compensation, but Graham Kraehe from BlueScope Steel says that compensation under this scheme would be like putting 'a bandaid on a bullet wound'. Industry compensation is supposed to last for four years. What happens after the four years when the price of electricity keeps going up and up? Does anyone honestly believe that industry planning for capital investment in five years time, after the compensation runs out, will not be starting to run down their operations now for the time when there will not be compensation? What about hospitals, nursing homes and schools, where the Victorian government has shown that electricity prices will increase by $120,000 a year? Community organisations will face increased costs. None of these have really been factored into the government's thinking on the impact this will have on local communities. This says nothing of the fact that most average Australians will be worse off under a carbon tax. The government should have a serious rethink and take this issue back to the people, because it lied about introducing a carbon tax and people should have a say. (Time expired)",137
185,Ms BRODTMANN,BILLS," It is with the greatest pleasure that I rise tonight to speak on Clean Energy Bill 2011 and associated bills and the need to take strong, positive and effective action to tackle climate change and drive a clean energy future-a future the next generation of Australians deserve. I have been waiting for three years for this opportunity and I am delighted that I am able to stand in this House today and add my support and the support of the many Canberrans who have phoned me, emailed me, written to me and spoken to me personally, calling for strong leadership and strong action on this issue. The science is in. It is clear. It is beyond reasonable doubt. The world is warming, the oceans are becoming more acidic and the biodiversity of our planet is at risk. This is the clear message of the research. I believe what the scientists say. I believe the Australian Academy of Science when it says that there has been widespread melting of glaciers and icecaps, when it says that the Greenland icesheet is losing more than it gains through snowfall and when it says that the Arctic sea ice has decreased significantly. I believe the scientists when they say that the average surface temperature in Australia has increased by about 0.7 degrees since 1960. This warming has caused an Australia-wide average increase in the frequency of extremely hot days and a decrease in the frequency of cold days. It is also clear that the leading cause of this rapid degradation of our climate and the broader environment is the emission of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere as a result of human activity. I say this because have read the science and I have spoken to the scientists. The ice-core samples I saw during a visit to the University of Tasmania, with the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories, clearly showed that the amount of carbon in the atmosphere has increased since the rise of the Industrial Revolution and the increase in the burning of fossil fuels that started that time. To support this, I offer again the words the Australian Academy of Science, which says quite clearly, 'Human activities are increasing greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere.' Anyone who has worked with a scientist or an academic will know that such clear, unambiguous declarations are rare from people who are very considered in their statements. The academy also says, 'It is very likely that most of the recent, observed global warming is caused by increasing greenhouse gas levels.' These statementsand statements by others-have convinced me completely that we must act to address the emissions of carbon. I agree that there are a number of ways we can do this and I agree that there is no onesize-fits-all approach. But the experts are clear and consistent in their agreement on best way to reduce carbon emissions. The experts agree that the most efficient and effective way is to place a price on carbon and to move towards a carbon trading mechanism. Once again, I do not make this statement unsupported or uninformed. I am informed and swayed by the people who know best: the experts in their areas. According to Macquarie Bank Chief Economist Richard Gibbs, consumers need a price on carbon to shift economic behaviour towards lower carbon and more energyefficient options. These experts, both the scientists and the economists, have convinced the esteemed magazine the I Economist. Once again, the government has listened to the experts and has acted on their advice. The package of legislation introduced yesterday will do precisely what the economists, academics, climate scientists and even the Australian have been urging us to do for years. Our package will put a price on carbon. It will reduce carbon pollution at and it will drive investment in a new cleaner economy. Our package will grab the of opportunities of a clean energy future. Our package will create new jobs and ensure that Australia remains the envy of the world for decades to come. Our package will transform and modernise the Australian economy, at the same time supporting the people Labor has always supported: workers, pensioners and lowand middle-income Australians. Our package will see Australia's annual emissions reduce by at least 160 million tonnes by 2020, which will be the equivalent of taking around 45 million cars off the road. Our package will drive investment in cleaner industries through the $10 billion Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the $1.2 billion Clean Technology Program, a program that will improve energy efficiency in manufacturing industries and support the research and development in low-pollution technologies. Our package will ensure builders, tradies, engineers and apprentices get the specialised green skills that will be increasingly in demand in Australia through the $32 million Clean Energy Skills program. (Quorum formed) Our package will support small business and action at the local government and community level. Our package will encourage farmers to explore carbon credit options. Our package is good for every Australian, every arm of the Australian economy and the economy as a whole. The modelling done by Treasury-and I know those opposite do not like the opinions of experts who disagree with them, but nonetheless they are indeed the expertsshows that this package will see 1.6 million new jobs by 2020 and gross national income per person increasing from today's levels, which are around $56,000, by around $9,000 per person to 2019-20. By 2050, the increase is expected to be more than $30,000 per person in today's dollars. This package will also support Australians as we transition to this new cleaner economy, though CPI is only expected to rise by 0.7 per cent-less than the impact of the GST-and the assistance to the average Australian household will outweigh the costs. Nine in 10 households will receive a combination of tax cuts and increased payments to help them with the cost of living. Almost six million households will be assisted through tax cuts or increased payments to cover the average expected price impact. Over four million households will get assistance that is at least 20 per cent more than the average expected price impact. Over one million Australians will no longer need to lodge a tax return. This is a comprehensive package that is supported by evidence and experts and has been extensively modelled. Contrary to what some in this place may be saying both here and in their communities, it is a package that has been in the public domain for discussion and comment for several months now. It is also a package that has received strong support from my electorate. I quote now from some of those supporters. Tara from Isabella Plains emailed me to say: I am writing as a constituent and a strong supporter of action on climate change. The scare campaign has confused people, but I wanted you to know that I want a price on pollution and I'm talking to others in your electorate about it. I urge you to vote in support of the price on pollution and the Clean Energy Future legislation and speak out in support of taking action on climate change. Jeanette from Conder said: I would like to support the government's initiative on the carbon tax, in strong opposition to the campaign being waged against it. I do not want to see my grandchildren's future held hostage by ignorance. Gerard from Gowrie said to me: I want you to know that, as a member of your constituency, I say yes to a price on carbon pollution, and Yes to new money for clean energy. Please support this important step forward for Australia – by voting Yes. Rona from Yarralumla wrote: I believe history will applaud you, and that those who come after us will feel respect and gratitude for your stand. I believe the majority of Canberrans want this package, particularly the women-the grandmothers, the mothers, the sisters, the daughters. I was deeply moved by the audience in the public gallery yesterday who had come to witness the historic introduction of this package by the Prime Minister. What moved me most was the number of women who had taken the time out of their busy lives to be part of that significant momentwomen young and old, women with toddlers and babies in slings. In fact, I understand one woman travelled from Adelaide to be part of history. Most of the people in Canberra want this package and want it for their children's future. Now is the time for leadership. Now is the time for considered action to protect our future prosperity. Now is the time to put aside the gross partisan politics that has gripped this current parliament and to act in the national interest. Now is the time to think big and long term; to be bold and innovative; to walk in the footsteps of Labor legends like Bob Hawke, Paul Keating, John Button, Peter Cook and John Dawkins; and to transform and modernise this economy so we can flourish in the future. As with the transformation and modernisation of the Australian economy in the eighties, we know reform is tough. But reform is part of the Labor DNA, and we know that this reform is right for this country today and tomorrow. Imagine what Australia would look like today if we had not undergone the reforms of the eighties. We would probably still have four banks and we would probably still be paying a premium for money if we could get it. We would still have protected industries clinging to the past with outmoded and inefficient work practices. We would probably just be entering the open and liberalised world now, as we see with some other countries throughout the world, having wasted decades of opportunities, decades of prosperity, decades of a possible future-the future that we have today. A failure to act-a failure to put in place the best policy for the future-risks not only environmental catastrophe but economic ruin, as Australia will find itself unprepared to compete in the industries and the world of the future. This country has always been a leader in adapting to changing times. We have always been able to absorb the changes to the economy, and we are more prosperous as a result. Now is not the time to allow our economy to atrophy. I would like to remind those opposite that now is not the time to look backwards. Now is not the time to say no. Now is not the time for the leader, rather than being a Leader of the Opposition, to be more the leader for opposition. Now is the time to look forward and plan to ensure our future prosperity. At the moment, what we have opposite is an opposition that has a 'plan'. I use the word lightly because it will cost Australia and Australians an extraordinary amount of money-some $1,300 per person-to pay polluters so they can kindly agree to stop polluting. In closing, I would like to say that I commend the government for introducing this bill. I intend to be able to look my nieces and nephews in the eye in 20 years time and say I showed leadership today. I intend to look them in the eye and say I was bold and innovative and wanted great leadership-that I did it for their future, their children's future and Australia's future. (Time expired) Mr JOHN COBB (Calare) (18:06): I rise to speak on what is in effect a carbon tax. Let me start by giving you an overview of my electorate. The Calare electorate is the powerhouse of New South Wales: it is built on mining, energy production, agriculture, forestry and transport-industries which will be absolutely hammered under the Gillard government carbon tax. It is also a regional electorate, and it is no secret that the regional areas of Australia are set to be the hardest hit under a Gillard government carbon tax. Recently released New South Wales Treasury figures underline that. One thousand jobs will be lost in my part of the world alone. The carbon tax is bad news for regional Australia and it is most definitely bad news for the electorate of Calare. Last month a community forum on the carbon tax was held in Bathurst. I was invited to speak along with three industry representatives of the three big industries that Calare relies on: mining, agriculture and small business. The aim of the forum was to give the public a chance to listen to industry leaders and gain a better insight as to how the carbon tax would affect our region's industries. The overwhelming response was that the carbon tax was certainly not welcome in Calare. There was no doubt that the forum was anti carbon tax, yet the question was asked, 'Why hold a one sided forum?' The taxpayers had $21 million of their money spent on advertising one side of this debate-the rubbish side-so I do not think there is too much harm. I think they have the right to have the facts and the actual cost to them as people and as businesses put to them free of having to listen to the rubbish the Prime Minister and her people have been speaking for some months. Over the past months I have been visiting businesses and residents in Calare regarding this tax. The people of Calare are not stupid. They know that reshuffling money-and that is what this is, largely, taking from someone and giving to someone else-and compensating families as Labor proposes will not in any way change people's habits. This is one of the huge hypocrisies: 'We are going to tax you to make you change what you do, but at the same time we want to give you money back so it will not hurt you.' So why the hell would you change? That is why the coalition supports a direct action plan, because we believe in practical action and common sense rather than making people do what they do not want to do and what they do not have to do at this time. New South Wales Treasury figures released last month confirm that regional Australia will be hardest hit. A total of 31,000 jobs are predicted to be lost in our state, with 1,000 these in the central west. It is the third hardest hit area for job losses after the Hunter Valley-the member for Hunter's part of the world, and you would think he would know better-and the Illawarra. These figures alone are damning enough. A carbon tax will cost local jobs, particularly at a when our region is still recovering from a decade of drought. It is the last thing we need. Central and western New South Wales need a carbon tax about as much as they need a hole in the head. We know that this tax will also significantly increase the cost of living for families. Figures are predicting electricity bills in New South Wales will rise by nearly $500 next financial year. It is interesting that the Prime Minister talks about a 10 per cent rise in electricity costs while the New South Wales government said, 'That is wholesale; it is 15 per cent at a retail level.' Electricity producers passing on the costs of their carbon permits is only for starters. For families that are already struggling with the cost of living this tax is the last thing they need. Families need this tax like they need a hole in the head. Mr Deputy Speaker, let me give you an overview of the business from across Calare that will suffer under this Gillard government's carbon tax. In Blayney, one of the progressive parts of my electorate, Blayney Wholesale Foods is probably one of the best examples of how severely this carbon tax will impact upon a local business. Over the past five or six years this local business has become a new, modern business. There is no way this business can have more efficient use of electricity than it currently has. This is a cutting-edge cooling and freezing and packing business. It operates two large freezer warehouses in Blayney and employs over 100 people. The of company stores and packages frozen food for a number of national companies and provides food services throughout the Blue Mountains, the central west, across Australia and to exporters. Almost all foodstuff spends time in cold storage, if not in frozen storage. Cold storage businesses specialise in time providing services in temperature controlled storage. George Tanos, the managing director of Blayney food products, has done the figures for his business and estimates the carbon tax will see a 20 per cent rise-not 10, not 15 but a 20 per cent rise-in electricity costs, and this is on top of what he has seen in the last five or six years, which is a 100 per cent increase in his power costs. The carbon tax is essentially a tax on electricity, and cold storage facilities such as this will have the company's ability to operate slashed. We are talking about a modern, innovative business which has already implemented every efficiency possible to keep usage of power down, yet with a carbon tax the cost must be added to food prices that are already soaring due to a tax which is also pushing up the cost of producing, transporting and processing that food. What is more, this tax will make Australian produce less competitive on the international market when it comes to trade. It really is a catch-22. It must be something to be proud of. I cannot believe that this government has worked out how to knock over Australian industry quite so efficiently. At the end of the day Calare's families will have to pay, whether they produce or whether they work for those who do. Should this tax become a reality, what benefits are there for this business? It can do nothing to avoid it. It cannot get more efficient. What is in it for this business, and what is in it for the people who are going to have to pay the extra costs that business has to absorb? Another example in my part of the world is a regional New South Wales grain processor. He buys about $50 million worth of local product and his annual power and gas bill will go up by one-quarter of a million dollars in the first 12 months. I am not talking about BHP here; I am talking about a family company that will cop another quarter of a million dollars in tax in the very first 12 months of this idiocy. And then on top of that you have Delta Electricity. Do you think they are happy? They are one of Calare's biggest energy producers and a very big employer in the eastern side of my electorate. We have Simplot Australia, a refrigeration, cold food, packaging, distribution and pet food company. Do you think they are happy? They are going to cop it too. The numerous truck owner-drivers through the transport industry will not be hit by this for a couple of years but, my heavens, they probably are the wildest of all those who have to face this tax. There would be over 10,000-something like 10½ thousand-small businesses in my part of the world in the Calare electorate. I do not know how one of them will get any off load for what it is going to cost them. Not one! A small coffee shop is going to wear about $1,500 worth of power costs in the first year. How offensive can you get? But Julia Gillard and her government want to give them hell, and they will. Power bills will continue to rise and businesses will be forced to pass costs on to the consumer because for most businesses there will be no forms of compensationcertainly not for small business. Businesses are already doing it tough, and as a carbon tax becomes a reality Australian businesses will be at a major disadvantage. And we are only talking domestically at the moment; this is before we get to the exporters. No other country in the world is going to go with anything like this. Under the current economic circumstances, why would you do this to your own people? Currently this government claims that agriculture-and this is wonderful-is excluded from the carbon tax. I have been a farmer my whole life and I can tell you that we are not excluded from this tax. Very few industries will be as belted by it as we will. Every farmer knows it. The agricultural industry alone will be one of the hardest hit. Fuel might be excluded for a couple of years but, heavens above, we are going to be belted after that. The government has ignored the major impact on the processing industries which take control of everything when it leaves the farm. We have to buy superphosphate, we have to buy diesel, we have to transport it and we have to grow it. Then the people who we sell to or work through have to process it and some of the processors for agriculture will be the biggest hit by the carbon tax-more than almost anybody-let alone the costs of processing. There are examples of that. The Murray Goulburn Co-operative will incur carbon costs of over $5,000 per farmer, and guess who will pay for that? The farmer. And that is without the fact that an average dairy-not a large one-will probably spend another 3½ thousand dollars on extra electricity prices. Then there is the fertiliser, then there is gas, and a lot of them also have cold storage. The big meat processors are in a similar position, whether they are the beef or sheep abattoirs. The sheep blokes are going to cop an increase in costs of about 30 cents per sheep and about two or three dollars for cattle. We are talking enormous money here on industries which only survive on narrow margins through large inputs. Rice farmers are particularly unhappy and yet they are not supposed to be copping a carbon tax. Let me tell you that about $10,000 per farm is what it will cost them in on-farm costs. That is what Sunrice will have to pay as a major emitter and there is only one processor and dealer in rice in Australia. As I said, New South Wales grain processors are going to cop it. And who do you think they get their grain from? Farmers. And given that a lot of this processed grain has to be exported, do you think they are going to be able to say to their trading partner overseas: 'Look, sorry, we are going to have to put the price up. Gillard and her government have decided we have to pay more.' Likely? Not very likely. Nobody is going to be belted harder than anybody who works the land, whether it is direct or indirect. I cannot believe that any government would decide that they have to do this to their own. Whether it is small business, someone who works for them or a farmer-whoever it is-why would you want to take a set on your own people? Why would you not listen to two-thirds of the population telling you to knack off and not to do it? This is very much about politics, about pleasing the Greens and about the Prime Minister remaining the Prime Minister-not for very long. There are people in this House who represent electorates and who have the the power but whose electorates not only do not want this but cannot believe that their representatives created the government that they have. There are people in this House who, if they listened to their electorates, could stop this. They could most certainly stop this happening. We are a democratic nation, and there are a couple of people who came to this House, created a government and said, 'We are doing that because we believe this will be the most democratic and open form of government if we create the Gillard government,' and yet those same people have combined with that government to guillotine the length of this debate, allowing for people to speak on average for less than one minute on each section of this bill. Ms Bird: You've had more than one minute! Mr JOHN COBB: There are 19 sections to it. I cannot believe that these people would even want to go home, because let me tell those who could stop this, whose electorates are begging them to stop this idiocy: if I were you I would not go home, I would go to hell.",147
186,Mr GEORGANAS,BILLS," I will be going home this weekend, very proud that I have spoken on the Clean Energy Bill 2011 and related bills. I believe that we all come to this place-all of us, on all sides of politics, from whichever political party-to make our electorates a better place. I heard the previous member speak about his agricultural area. I truly believe that he does care about his electorate and about agriculture in this country. But, if we truly look at this issue, we would be saying to those farmers and to those people the member for Calare was speaking about on this particular issue of our climate changing drastically over the next few years, and the next generation, that it will mean there will be no agriculture-absolutely zilch-if we do not do something about it. I think that, as members of this place who have been elected by our constituencies to be here, all of us want to ensure that when we leave this place we have done something for the betterment of the future generations of Australia. If we do not pass this bill, it would be remiss of us to think that we are doing our jobs. Our job is about the present but also about ensuring a better place for future generations, whether it be our children, our grandchildren or our great-grandchildren. That is why I will be very proud to go back to my electorate this week. It gives me great satisfaction to speak on these bills and to support them. They go towards correcting in Australia what is arguably the greatest market failure of all time: the historic ability of people to pollute our atmosphere with greenhouse gases without limitation, and that is what we have-without fee or fine, with complete impunity, to the detriment of us all and, even more importantly, to the detriment of future generations of Australians. The consequences of this market failure, as we are increasingly seeing, are promising to be dire. (Quorum formed) As I said, the market failures we are increasingly seeing are promising dire consequences for our worldour coastlines, our rainfall patterns, our ability to feed ourselves, and the composition and dynamics of our world. This market failure has to be corrected. The volume of hot air emitted by politicians, commentators and the like on this issue over time is itself a potential health hazard, I am sure. The number of ridiculous statements, contradictory statements and misrepresentations that we are hearing is enough to make many members of the public turn off from this debate and this issue. But the reality of our situation, our recent history and what is happening around the world needs clarity of perception and lucidity in thought. We need to recognise our reality and act appropriately based on the best available advice, as each of us strives to do in our own private lives. Here are a few quick facts. Yes, the world is moving on this issue. This includes, of course, not just the UK, Europe, Canada, South Africa, South Korea and very large blocks within the United States; it includes China, and no amount of camouflage from those opposite can conceal this fact. China is moving to introduce a carbon trading scheme in its three industrial powerhouses of Beijing, Shanghai and Guangdong, from where it will be rolled out across the country, and this is a reality; this is happening. So we are not leading the world on this issue, as opponents claim-as if that would be a bad thing anyway. We are seriously at risk of being left behind, to our own detriment. The assertion by the coalition that Australia is so insignificant a nation and a people that what we do does not matter is highly flawed and more than a tad insulting. Australia is one of the 21 highest-polluting nations in the world. We also emit more per head of population than any other country; we are the highest polluters in the world per capita. Also, we are one of 14 nations that emit similar volumes of carbon pollution: we are one of the 14 countries that each emit between one and two per cent of global emissions, which add up to 20 per cent of the world's emissions. So if we expect South Korea, France, the UK, Italy, Spain, South Africa, Canada and others to act-which they are doing-then how on earth can we argue that we do not need to? If countries the size of Australia were to sit back and do nothing, the global effort would be most seriously compromised and simply would not work. So we need to be smart in doing what is in the world's best interests, which also in our own interests. With our climate, is even more in our interests than for most. As I have said, more and more countries are pricing carbon emissions and moving to price carbon. The suggestion that it will destroy or even damage our economy is absolute rubbish. What will destroy our economy is if we do nothing. Apart from our trading partners pursuing similar policies, our trade-exposed industries will be generously protected from adverse consequences. They are facing challenges to their profitability that are much greater than this. There is more risk in the price of the Australian dollar, for example, than anything in this collection of bills. We have heard that people will be worse off as a result of the carbon price flowing on to consumers who will receive most of the revenue raised by the carbon price's compensation. That is the scare tactic being used by those on the other side. We have also heard the other side say that people will receive too much compensation. Nine in 10 households will receive compensation. The cost will be on average $9.90 per week, 50c or less per $100 of groceries, 70c per $100 of outlay overall. Compensation will on average be $10.10 per week more than the cost passed on to the average consumer. If that represents overpayment to pensioners, as we have heard from those opposite, then I am happy for the pensioners in my area to receive that payments and be better off under this policy. If people argue against these bills for fear of pensioners getting too much money, I will argue in their favour, as will all of us on this side. I do not object to that at all. Consumers, the public, have nothing to fear from this policy. Compared to the rising cost of our health system, for example, which has threatened to overwhelm our states' budgets and compared to the future is costs of Medicare, aged care and other public it services systems, this is not an especially large amount of money. We need to keep it in proportion. As I said, $9.90 per week for which compensation will be $10.10 on average. There has been an increase in the recognition of our need to address, individually and collectively, the issue of pollution. Support for this policy has been widespread amongst political parties as it has been amongst the public. This is evident in our recent history. Our previous conservative government grappled with the issue and ended up signing the Kyoto protocol. They did not ratify it, but they signed it and by signing it they adopted the policy of acting on greenhouse gases. Ultimately they supported the policy of a cap-and-trade emissions trading scheme which is what we have in the bills before us. Labor came to power in 2007 promising action on climate change. Soon we were developing our cap-and-trade emissions trading scheme. This ETS, named the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, was supported by all of us on this side. Evidently it was also supported by the Australian public through most of the last parliamentary term. After being blocked by the oppositionist Greens, Liberals and Nationals in the Senate on three occasions, the CPRS was withdrawn. But its future as Labor policy, the future reintroduction of an emissions trading scheme, has never been in doubt and was never in doubt. When former Prime Minister Rudd announced that Labor recognised the Senate was hopelessly divided on the issue such that the bills would not pass in the foreseeable future, he said that the scheme would be delayed; in his words he would 'extend the implementation date', clearly not Labor's choice, but due hostile Senate. Labor has been the party of consistency on the issue of climate change. We have been the party of consistency on our need to deal with it meaningfully and our support for a cap-and-trade emissions trading scheme as the way to do it. This has been constant throughout Labor's two terms in office, from 2007 when Labor first formed government to now. There has been absolute consistency that we need a cap-and-trade ETS and that we will introduce a cap-and-trade ETS. Everyone has known this since at least early 2010. It has been a matter of when not if. It has been as clear as crystal. This has been the government's position and the position of all of us on this side of the House. Back in 2009, a number of constituents argued in support of the opinion expressed by a few high-ranking US officials who advocated for a flat-rate carbon tax instead of a cap-andtrade emissions trading Conservatives who do not want Labor in power argued for a flat-rate carbon tax principally because Labor opposed one. A carbon tax does not limit the volume of pollution. It has no cap on pollution. A capand-trade scheme does and a cap-and-trade scheme cap can be lowered over time to decrease emissions. This is a pretty fundamental and glaring difference between the two approaches. They could not be more dissimilar. We need Labor's plan, a scheme which caps emissions by use of a finite number of pollution permits which are decreased over time, to lower the cap on pollution and decrease the volume of pollution. The public's view of anthropogenic climate change has been with the government. Over the period 2006 to 2009, Morgan polled public support for action on global warming at around 60 to 70 per cent consistently and, in 2009, recognition of to a human contribution to global warming at 83 per cent. In 2009, a Nielsen poll showed 65 per cent support specifically for the CPRS. The 2011 Lowy Institute poll showed 81 per cent of the Australian public supported action on climate change: 40 per cent supported action at low cost and a further 41 per cent supported action even if it was at high cost. That is 81 per cent support for action. We all know the overwhelming economic advice that a cap-and-trade emissions trading scheme is the most low-cost, meaningful action that a government can take. There is 81 per cent support for the government's strategy. People may cite other numbers derived in response to other questions and other perceptions of consequence, but the fact remains that the Australian public has and continues to recognise that human induced climate change is an issue and we need to deal with it. The Australian public scheme. has supported this action. (Time expired)",154
187,Mr BILSON,BILLS," It is an honour to stand before the parliament tonight and follow through on what I promised my electorate I would do. That was along with 148-maybe 147, if you want to argue the point-other members in this House, who all went to the last election promising that there would not be a carbon tax. I am happy to stand here tonight and honour my undertaking. I wish those opposite would do the same. In fact, my electorate and electorates right around Australia wish Labor members would actually do what they promised. They still have ringing in their ears the deceitful words of a Prime Minister who got elected by stooging the Australian public by promising, 'There will not a carbon tax under the government I lead'. The Prime Minister has rightly been attacked for making such a blatant and calculated statement so late in the election campaign and clearly motivated by the hesitation of many thousands of Australian voters who believed in their hearts that you could not quite take the Prime Minister word. After the backflip involving the abandonment of Kevin Rudd's climate tax arrangement and Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, people were not convinced-and we on this side of the House understood. That is why there were repeated challenges to the Gillard government, its ministers and the Prime Minister to be frank and straight with the Australian public about their intentions concerning a carbon tax. The Leader of the Opposition, I think at least a dozen times, highlighted what we understood was the secret agenda of the Labor Party and of Prime Minister Gillard and her ministers. That was to sneak in, slipPrime slide into office, hope that no-one really challenged them on their intentions with the carbon tax and go and do it anyway in the spirit of what Peter Garrett once outlined before the 2007 election-just get in, do what you need to do and then do whatever you feel like afterwards. That was the concern the Australian public had. So, staring down the barrel of a camera, just am doing now, the Prime Minister sought to reassure Australian voters that there would be no carbon tax under a government she would lead. That was designed to remove the hesitation that so many Australian voters had about what Labor was really planning, and because of that I am certain that numbers of voters in many electorates across Australia thought: 'Well, okay; that's as black-andwhite as it gets. If that's what the Prime Minister of Australia, albeit one that has only just arrived, is going to say, staring down the lens of a camera, maybe we could take her at her word.' That proved not to be the case. So a government was formed, a Prime Minister was re-elected by one of the most calculated deceptions, which exercised a great democratic deficit",156
188,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, Order! The honourable member for Dunkley well knows that it is outside the standing orders-in particular standing order 90-for him to accuse the Prime Minister of a calculated deception. I require him to withdraw.,157
189,Mr BILSON,BILLS,"I thought 'lie' was the word, but I am not using that and I will withdraw if that language is too strong.",157
190,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS,It refers to imputations or improper motives. Have you withdrawn?,157
191,Mr BILSON,BILLS,"Yes, I have, and you are right, Mr Deputy Speaker; I was accusing the Minister of improper motive. That was exactly my point, so if that offends the standing orders I do apologise, because that was precisely what I was doing. What happened after that reassurance? People voted, believing the Prime Minister. So a government was formed, and I must say that in this House of Representatives there are a number of Labor members who, on the as I basis of that reassurance, which has been proven not to be reliable, now sit in this place. There are elected Labor members here under false pretences, and the Australian public has not forgiven the Gillard government, the Prime Minister herself or, I would say, a number of the Labor members who went out to their electorates promising there would be no carbon tax under a government that the Prime Minister would lead. So I am here tonight speaking in support of the exact undertakings I gave my electorate prior to the election and during campaign and I just wish the Labor members would do the same. What has happened with one of the most extraordinary, not even subtle, about-faces for political self-interest that I can remember is that it has really rattled and unsettled the Australian community, and it has really caused an enormous chill to run through the Australian small business community. manoeuvring by the Gillard Labor government has been very poor in its creation, and I have touched on what I think was an extraordinary democratic deficit in the way in which it has been brought about. It is now being perpetrated with a conscious and intentional disregard of the impact of these actions on a very important part of the Australian community-that is, the small business community. Despite all of the carve outs and compensation arrangements that are touched upon and are a part of this bundle of bills that are before the House, the small business community has been completely ignored. More than two million small businesses and family enterprises will all face increased costs with no direct support, having been ignored by the Gillard Labor government. It is as clear as night following day and certain as to what the impact of this will be that the Gillard government is not on the side of small business, because if it were it would have factored small business's circumstances into its approach. Instead, despite a chorus concern from the small business community about the added cost to its energy requirements and all of the inputs that will build and compound at every step and every stage of the production and supply service chain, no compensation in any direct sense has been provided to guard against the risk to jobs and small business viability that this carbon tax creates. People in my electorate, as they are right the across Australia, are wondering why the government is prepared to risk their jobs just to try to secure their own-why the Prime Minister is trying to secure her position by risking the jobs of many hard working Australians and the viability of small businesses and the livelihoods of people operating and managing them. This dismissive attitude reared its head just This recently, quite remarkably, in the Hon. Greg Combet's speech to the Press Club. He sought to argue that there were a number of myths surrounding the debate about the carbon tax, and he chose particularly to say-and I think quite recklessly in the way he described it-that it was a myth that small businesses are in some kind of jeopardy from the carbon tax. He went on to describe how he thought that the cost impact on them would be modest, which I found quite a remarkable statement to make given that, while the government has done modelling on households solely for the purpose of assisting Labor MPs to sell this Labor policy in their electorates, no effort has been made to model the impact of a carbon tax on different sectors of the economy and particularly on small businesses and family enterprises. But despite that lack of any evidence, Minister Combet still sought to say to anybody who had done that work and arrived at conclusions that were unhelpful for the government that they were wrong and he was right. In fact, he went and distorted of some of the material that had been provided to him by COSBOA, the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia, who actually had been begging the minister to do some analysis on the impact of the carbon tax and provided some basic figures against which it hoped the government would do the work that it should have done long ago. Instead of using that material as an input to enable the government to get off its backside and actually do the work that it should have done a long time ago, Minister Combet waved that input data around as if it were the conclusion of some analysis and then said, 'Look, the impact was so minuscule, what are you worrying about?' But as if to be as insulting as he possibly could be, he went on to say: But the fundamental point is that the cost is modesthe is talking about the carbon tax, despite having no evidence to back that upand that it can be passed on to customers as small businesses are typically not trade exposed. I found that a very fascinating statement. He is saying that it can be passed on to customers. These are very price-sensitive customers already groaning under increasing cost-of-living pressures that have been overseen by this government, but somehow those customers will be ready to soak up even more cost increases. But then he went on to make some of the most extraordinary statements I have ever heard. He said: A drycleaner is not competing against drycleaners in China. And: Drivers cannot get their cars serviced What remarkable statements when, at the same time he is making those points, elsewhere in the same speech and in this place, and anywhere else where a Labor minister can get anywhere near a microphone, they talk about the power of the price signal in their carbon tax to reduce demand. The very purpose of a carbon tax is to put financial harm and hardship in the way of people hoping that they will consume less of what it is that the carbon tax will be applied to. He then basically says, 'Well, if you're in the dry-cleaning business, don't worry about it. Dry-cleaning won't be competing against drycleaners in China.' But the price signal will make sure that people think twice about taking their clothing or their household items to a drycleaner, because of the cost. Why? Because that is the design of the scheme. It is a price signal designed to reduce demand. Reduced demand means less work, less turnover, less activity for that small business drycleaner, yet the government seems to be completely indifferent or oblivious to that fact. In making his argument he is basically saying: 'Well, when it suits the government, the price signal of the carbon tax just doesn't apply, it just doesn't matter. Unless you are trade exposed, it doesn't matter.' He said: Drivers cannot get their cars serviced in India. But go and talk to any car maintenance and repair operation in Australia and they will tell you people are not getting their cars serviced. They will tell you they are not getting them converted to LPG, because they are concerned about what might come next from this government, given that when they look to the nation's capital they cannot see an adult in charge! They know that their turnover is dipping, their costs are going up, their commitments in rent and equipment continue, their inputs will be more expensive and their business viability is being placed at in India. risk at a time of difficult economic circumstances-and yet you cannot get the government to give two hoots about those people. That is why you look at the impact of what the government is doing. You look at survey after survey where you see this incompetent government is hollowing out confidence. It is hollowing out people's expectations of future prosperity, future growth potential. And does the government care? No, because they then say, 'But look at the macroeconomic figures: we're at trend growth now.' They are happy to say that we are the envy of the rest of the world-that is the language you keep hearing-because we have got an absolutely boisterous and prosperous mining sector. Apparently the joy there wipes out any concern that might happen anywhere else in the economy. That is the government's basic defence: we have mining, therefore it doesn't matter how the rest of the economy is functioning. I will share with the government what is going on. In the retail area they are dealing with anxious consumers uncertain about what the government is on about and absolutely clear that the government is not confident about its own policies because it will not have them properly analysed. Consumers are saving money. In a country where Australian households ordinarily 'save', and I use that term in inverted commas, negative 0.5 per cent of their household income-that is, they extend their credit cards and their mortgages and their lines of finance to improve their standard of living-right now about $10.50 of every $100 a household earns is being saved. It is being saved because of the anxiety people have about this cost-of-living pressure that never seems to stop. The bills are getting bigger, the discretionary income is getting squeezed. They are cocooning against the impact of bad government policy, and we are debating a package of bills that could never be more totemic of a bad government policy. This is not about whether you want to take action on climate change; that debate has been had. Both sides of the parliament, just as they agreed there would be no carbon tax after the last election, committed to a five cent reduction in emissions by 2020. The government's plan hurts and harms everybody, every business, every activity and every point of expenditure. Everywhere where energy is consumed or embedded in anything you might do at any time of the day, for as long as you could possibly imagine, will cost more. The hope is that it will hurt so much you will change your ways. Regardless of your capacity to change, regardless of your capacity or opportunity to adapt or to reduce your emissions, you will cop it anyway. The coalition's position is: why not work with those best placed to achieve abatements? Why not work with those able to reduce their emissions at least cost and provide some incentives for them to do so? So I say to this government: you stooged the electorate, but they are a wake-up to you guys. They know that you are not competent even at putting foil and fluff into the rooves of houses. How on earth can they have confidence in you implementing what your own side boasts will be a gargantuan change to the way we live and to our economy? And they think that you guys can get this right! I don't think so and many in the electorate don't. So I ask the government and the government members: why don't you do what you said you would do? Why don't you honour your promise to the Australian public? Why don't you make sure there is no carbon tax under the government the Prime Minister leads? (Time expired) Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP (Mackellar) (18:52): I am delighted to follow my colleague the shadow minister for small business who made such a strong and powerful contribution to this debate. It is disappointing that the Labor Party seems to have given up trying to defend its package of clean energy bills. Either the powers that be thought that their members were not up to per the debate or they simply ran out of people who had something to say. But there is plenty to say about these bills. There is plenty to say about the carbon tax. I almost felt sorry for the Prime Minister today. She is so dejected because she knows she is for the chop. But I thought, 'No, the pity that I have must be for the Australian people because they are the ones who are to be punished by this legislation.' And punishment is what those opposite are about. The whole concept of compensation is that first you injure somebody and then you compensate them. This government says on its modelling-its wonderful modelling, which has still not been released and not been properly done on the $23 a tonne it is going to impose-it is going to injure the average family $9.90 a week. That is the extent of the damage it says the average family will suffer. So it is going to compensate for that damage $10.10 a week. Anybody who thinks that Treasury can accurately model down to the last 20c truly believes there are fairies at the bottom of the garden. Every year Treasury gets it wrong with the budget. The figures are always wrong. Six months later we bring in supplementary estimates to correct the errors that were committed in the budget. To believe that Treasury could say, 'We are going to injure you $9.90 and compensate you $10.10,' and get that right, as I said, is to believe there are fairies at the bottom of the garden. The injury that is going to be done to the country is because of the way in which Labor always goes about governing. When Paul Keating was defeated he left a debt behind of $96 billion. It took us 10 years to pay it off, but pay it off we did. We left the country in really good shape. We left a surplus of $20 billion. We had set up various trust funds. We had set up the Future Fund. Now I hear this government is even going to raid the Future Fund. Nothing is sacrosanct. Dr Mike Kelly: You know that's not true. Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP: I know it is true. The fact of the matter is that it is in their DNA. It is usually tax and spend, but this time it is the other way round-it is spend and tax. We are now nearly $100 billion in debt again. That is net debt. It is getting close to $200 billion gross debt. When they took office the borrowing limit was $75 billion. It went up to $200 billion and it is headed for $250 billion. Instead of having a situation where we are in good shape to face what might be a second financial crisis in the world, the waste and pillage of that legacy that we left means they have left us vulnerable; hence, they want a new tax. But the problem is they cannot even get this one right. They say they are actually planning to spend $4.3 billion more than they are going to raise by the tax over the forward estimates. They going to bring $2.9 billion of that forward into this current financial year. Where are they going to find the money? They are going to borrow it. They are borrowing $135 million a day. That is why they want a great big new tax on everything-and it is a great big new tax on everything. It is a cascading and compounding tax, which will get into the nook and cranny of every individual's life. We remember with the GST when John Howard said there would never be a GST. He changed his mind. He took it to an election. He was elected and the GST replaced an abolished tax. The wholesale sales tax was abolished. The GST replaced that tax. The GST is a value added tax, which means that, although the tax is paid on every transaction between the origin of the good or service and its final consumption, it is refunded at every level so that only the final consumer actually pays the tax. But with this carbon tax, which is a tax on electricity, the tax will be paid at every transaction level and you will pay tax on the tax and a tax on the tax on the tax because it cascades and compounds so that the consumer pays a very high tax indeed. The way it works is this: the cheapest form of electricity you can have in the world bar none comes from coal fired power stations. Ninety per cent of power on the eastern seaboard comes from coal fired power stations, 80 per cent across Australia. The government is going to put a punitive levy, tariff, burden-call it what you willon the market price of coal. The price the market has set, which is cheaper than anything else, will have an artificial impost on it to make it more expensive so that other forms of energy source can compete. That is distorting the market, not having a market price. It then means that electricity Electricity touches everything we do, whether it is the clock ticking away leaving me a minute and a bit still to speak, whether it is the exit sign light over there, whether it is the trains that run, whether it is the sewerage system or whether it is our water system. Whatever it is, electricity drives it. That is the mark of a civilised society. This tax will be on everything that it does. Therefore the cost of food will rise because of the refrigeration costs and because of the costs of having trucks bring it. The Prime Minister has said there will be exemptions. There will not. Even the family car when you are filling up, which is supposed to not be affected, will be affected. What do they think keeps the lights on in the petrol station? How do you think you pump the fuel out of the tanks? Electricity. Everything will be touched and it impacts dramatically most on seniors. It does so because they are the people who are on fixed incomes. Debate interrupted. NA",157
192,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT," Order! It being 7 pm I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Breast Screening Mrs MARKUS (Macquarie) (19:00): I take great pleasure in advising the House of a wonderful outcome achieved for the local community in the electorate of Macquarie, an electorate that encompasses the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury. In February this year I stood in this place and introduced a petition signed by 2,274 wonderful people who wanted to raise awareness of the decision to remove access to critical health services. I speak of the removal of mobile breast-screening units in Richmond and costs rise. Springwood. I was first alerted to the closure of the mobile service operating from Richmond and Springwood by a constituent who lives at Colo Heights. This constituent was unable, due to circumstances beyond her control, to make it to established clinics and as such the Richmond mobile breast unit was ideally located and easily accessible for her. I investigated why the service was removed and found that mobile services in places like Springwood and Richmond were removed in 2009 and replaced with screening units set up in select Myer department stores, with the closest units located at Blacktown, Penrith and Lithgow. All those locations require either public transport or access to a car, which seniors and carers do not always have. While that option may be suitable for some women, it certainly was unhelpful for others. Rises in the cost of living place additional pressure particularly on pensioners and women who are already fighting breast cancer. One in nine New South Wales women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime. Many of us know someone who has been touched by cancer, whether it be a parent, a grandparent, a daughter or a friend. It is so important to make access to services such as breast screening easier rather than more difficult. The reason for removing the mobile-screening service was to cut costs. That decision clearly demonstrates how little value the then state Labor government placed on women's health. That is why I launched the petition urging the then government to return mobile breastscreening services to my local community. I would like to thank my local community in the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury for supporting that petition. Women, sons and husbands signed up and joined the fight. It was an issue that had to be fought for. Together with local women and their families we fought. I am able to say today that we did win. I am pleased to inform the House that the New South Wales Breast Cancer Institute has announced that mobile breast-screening services will be returned to Springwood and to the Hawkesbury. The announcement states that two new mobile vans with state-of-the-art mammography equipment have been designated to service Greater Western Sydney and the Blue Mountains. It is anticipated that the first van will be ready in November. It is scheduled to visit the Hawkesbury later this year. It will start visiting Springwood early in 2012 for an extended period. This is wonderful news for women who already have suffered from breast cancer and women of all ages who need to access this important service. This is an outstanding result and shows that the community can make a difference when it pulls together. I want to commend the decision to return the mobile breast-screening service. I thank all those who joined with me in making women's health across the Hawkesbury, the Blue Mountains and Greater Western Sydney a health priority. I also want to acknowledge the local media-namely, the Hawkesbury Gazette and the Blue Mountains Gazette, which covered on a number of occasions the launch of the petition, the signing of the petition, my speech in parliament and the tabling of the petition. I also want to acknowledge the Penrith Star. These three local papers drew attention to this matter. They acknowledged the significance of women's health and in particular their fight to identify and gain treatment for breast cancer. I thank all the local community who signed the petition. This is truly a great result that I am able to announce tonight. Automotive Industry Family Support Program",162
193,Ms VAMVAKINOU,ADJOURNMENT," Tonight I would like to speak about some very innovative manufacturing that has been developed in my electorate of Calwell. I was very pleased last Friday, 9 September, to represent the Minister for Innovation, digital Industry, Science and Research, Senator Kim Carr, at the announcement of a very significant funding boost to a local company based in Somerton in my electorate. Nexteer Australia has just received $63 million for its New Car Plan for a Greener Future project. Sixty-three million dollars is a significant investment in innovation and manufacturing. I am personally delighted that this project will deliver huge flow-on work opportunities. I am also very excited about what it could mean for my electorate of Calwell, especially since it is expected that this investment will result in the creation of about 670 jobs. The funding will be allocated over a three year period and it will come from the government's Green Car Innovation Fund. Nexteer's project is geared to attract investment in new green technology and will support the creation of a new Melbourne manufacturing technical centre. The project will also be strengthened by an additional contribution from the Victorian state government. Nexteer's Managing Director, Greg Malone, told me he was very grateful to the government for affording the company the opportunity to support its innovation and growth plans. This is an excellent example of government investment and support in Australian innovation and manufacturing. During my meeting with Mr Malone he told me that Nexteer's project outline was to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by developing electric power-steering systems, lightweight steering columns and driveline components that will make vehicles lighter and more fuel efficient. Nexteer has designed a sophisticated new technology in steering and driveline components which weigh about 21 per cent less than their conventional counterparts thereby saving more fuel, a feature that is very important in the development of the emerging green economy as it provides for energy efficient motor vehicles. This project also involves significant further innovation in the production of an Australian-made constant velocity joint that will be the first massproduced product of its type in the world, and steering components made from advanced alloys. The electric power-steering system is cutting-edge technology. It is smart following and practical and will improve fuel efficiency by about four per cent compared to traditional hydraulic systems. Most importantly, however, Nexteer's components will be manufactured by Australian workers here in Australia and exported to Europe, the United States, China, India and the Association of South-East Asian Nations. Mr Malone, the managing director of the company, said to me: We see the program being able to leverage manufacturing volumes to offer Australian Original Equipment Manufacturers worldcompetitive green products and technology through economies of scale. In short, Nexteer's project is exactly what the New Car Plan for a Greener Future is about. It is about attracting new investment in new green technology, and to date the Nexteer project is the largest investment a non-motor vehicle producer has received from the Green Car Innovation Fund. The funding is also one of the largest investments in the automotive supply chain in decades. In the bigger picture, Nexteer's project represents a $167 million co-investment and commercial vote of confidence in the local automotive supply chain. This new manufacturing capability will help Australia cement its place as a key supplier in a global network and it is estimated that about $2.1 billion will be pumped into the economy as result. This sets the future of manufacturing in Australia on a positive pathway and it is, as Minister Carr always says, 'A future worth fighting for.' The other issue I would like to talk about is the government's recent $8.7 million Family Support Program investment in my federal seat of Calwell. The funding will enable organisations to continue to provide the much-needed support programs in the electorate which positively impact the lives of residents. This funding will benefit the organisations and service providers: Anglicare Victoria, Family Mediation Centre, MACKillop Family Services, Uniting Church Australia, Banksia Gardens Community Centre, Victorian Arabic Social Services, the Hume Council and the Brotherhood of St Laurence. (Time expired) Malta: Battle of Lepanto",163
194,Mr CHRISTENSEN,ADJOURNMENT," It may seem strange, but in my electorate of Dawson in North Queensland the historic European Battle of Lepanto takes a special significance 440 years after the battle itself. Six years before the battle on the island of Malta 600 Knights of St John commanding a force of 8,000 men prepared to defend Malta. The Turkish fleet was desperate to take the island of Malta, but they were repelled. The Knights of Malta would be called on again as part of the Holy League to prevent the Mediterranean becoming an uncontested highway for Ottoman forces. Had the Holy League failed at the Battle of Lepanto, the face of Europe would be very different from what it is today. At dawn on the morning of the battle, Pope Pius V and a handful of the faithful prayed the rosary and asked Our Lady to intercede for a Catholic victory. Prayers continued in Rome while the battle raged in the Gulf of Lepanto, ending in what some historians regard as the most decisive naval battle anywhere in the world since 31 BC. Pope Pius V created a feast day, Our Lady of Victories, or Our Lady of the Rosary as it is also known, to commemorate that victory. This feast enjoys a special place in the of Maltese people as it is intrinsically bound up with the history of Malta. This feast, Our Lady of Victories, also enjoys a special place in the hearts of those in my electorate of Dawson. In the late 1800s, a shipload of Maltese migrants were indentured to work in the cane fields of North Queensland. As a result, the North Queensland city of Mackay has one of the largest Maltese populations in the world. Maltese families were attracted to Australia by migration campaigns urging many Europeans to try their luck in Australia. But it was not luck that was required to make it in Mackay in those early days. Clearing land and planting cane was hard work. Harvesting cane by hand was very hard work. But the Maltese people are tough, resilient and passionate. Just as they did at the Battle of Lepanto, they rolled up their sleeves and persevered with hard work until the job was done. Most laboured for sugar cane farmers, but they soon earned enough money to buy a farm and start a farm themselves, often in partnership with fellow countrymen. Such partnerships were formed in all kinds of business endeavours and the city of Mackay today is a result of the very strong Maltese influence. An active Mackay Maltese Club ensures continued celebration of the Maltese culture and influence on the region. The club has a new executive now, but I want to acknowledge the work of Carmel Baretta who was the first president of the club, someone who has served in the club for a long time. I had the very great pleasure of attending the Feast of Our Lady of Victories in Mackay on Friday, 9 September. It featured one of those spectacular processions with a statue of the Virgin Mary, of the kind you would witness somewhere in the hearts Mediterranean, being taken through the streets in the Procession of the Rosary, followed by an open-air mass and a celebration dinner the next night. For everyday families living in Mackay there are strong reminders of our Maltese heritage. Maltese names are everywhere, from business names and street names to respected community leaders, from the Deputy Mayor of Mackay, Darryl Camilleri, to the head of the Mackay cane growers organisation, Paul Schembri. There are business names like Borg's Real Estate and Zarb Road Transport, and even sporting greats we know like the former North Queensland Cowboy Paul Galea, or 'Galare', as the commentators used to mispronounce it. We are constantly reminded of the hard work and dedication of our early pioneering families. We are also reminded of the unerring faith of the Maltese and the good works that flow from that faith with the presence of the Franciscan Sisters of the Heart of Jesus at St Francis of Assisi Aged Care Home. In closing, I would like to quote from a piece by the late Bishop of Sandhurst, the Most Reverend Joseph Grech, who had visited Mackay in years past to celebrate Our Lady of Victories. He wrote about Our Lady of Victories and the Maltese character: Our ancestors were not afraid to face any difficulty that came their way. They were always ready to adhere to their convictions even if that meant that they had to undergo much suffering and pain. Today, we might be living in another country, which has provided us with so many blessings and opportunities. However, deep inside us, there is still a heart that is formed and sustained history of bravery and faith. I am proud to report that that strength of character and faith is alive and well in Mackay and North Queensland is all the richer for the Maltese influence over more than a century. Holt Electorate: Citizens",165
195,Mr BYRNE,ADJOURNMENT," I rise tonight to again pay tribute to the indomitable spirit of the people of my electorate of Holt. One of the most rewarding aspects of being a member of parliament is meeting people from all walks of life and every strata of the community. One of the great things that is emphasised about the quintessential nature of that Australian spirit is when you go to a citizenship ceremony. I often attend a citizenship ceremony that is conducted by the City of Casey. In that citizenship ceremony you have people from every corner of the globe who are taking a step to becoming an Australian citizen. It is a very humbling experience to be there as a member of parliament. One thing that strikes me is that as part of the ceremony we hand out a plant which is invariably an Australian native. With that plant there is an Australian flag. On the Australian flag we have the stars of the Southern Cross. The fascinating thing about that when you hand it over to those that have taken the oath or affirmation is that regardless of where you are in Australia when you look up at the night sky and you look at the Southern Cross it does not matter who you are, where you have come from or what race, colour, creed you are, we are all equal under the stars of the Southern Cross. That is one of the defining features of the Australian spirit. I am no more important, none of us are more important than the people whom we serve in our electorates. I note that the press gallery is empty, it always is at this time of night when there is nothing by a controversial that we might say, but the fact is that I get more common sense and insight into where our country needs to go and what it needs to do by listening to the people who walk through my door. It does not matter where they come from or what they do. They have a right to articulate their views and their opinions. They are much more erudite and informed than many of the articles are that I read in the newspapers. I can tell you that much for a fact. We are closeted away in this place in Canberra, this place removed from the Australian people. John Button once famously said that we built this new house of parliament and in some cases pulled ourselves away from the Australian people. We should be more connected to them. I know that we have a lot of visitors that come through this place. Last week, my constituents came through my door and I sat there and I listened to them as they raised their visions, their hopes, their ambitions and their experiences. We talk about our lives and our lives get reported upon in this place. It is basically the fish and chip wrapping, if you want to use that term, for the next day's feed or whatever it is, but the key thing is that their lives are really important. Their lives so rarely get reported on. A gentleman called Ron Webb came into my office last week, a man of 74 years of age with tremendous life experience and great values. He may well be on the conservative divide of politics but I heard wisdom from Ron in the experiences that he shared with me and in the achievements of his life. He was saying: 'I have lived this life, I have done these things but there has been no-one to chronicle my existence. There has been no-one who knows what I have done and what I have achieved.' What disturbed me the most about this was that he did not feeland he was talking about the community that he had been talking to-that we, collectively, listened enough. There is a great crisis of confidence in body politic at the moment and in the way the Australian people view Australian politics. That is a problem for us all, believe you me. I do believe that we need to be more removed from this place, talk to people more and listen because, as I said, there is more common sense heard in talking to our electors than I dare say in reading the articles of many of those people that sit on the second level. Our electors are the people who should be heard more often in this place instead of the people we read about in the newspapers. Minister for Foreign Affairs",166
196,Mr BRIGGS,ADJOURNMENT," I follow on from the contribution from the member for Holt. I think it was a worthy contribution and I congratulate him for it. One of the consistent things that I hear from my constituents is that they want us to treat the money that they work hard for, their taxpayers' money, with respect. It is our obligation to treat it with absolute and utter respect and to ensure that the very generous entitlements that we are given in this place are treated appropriately and that there is an oversight to it. Obviously, the members of the press gallery and the broader fourth estate do have a role in ensuring that that is the case. There have been many cases in recent times exposing examples where people have not been treating taxpayers' money appropriately but we have an important role here too. That is the issue that I wanted to talk about tonight. One of the roles that I have been asked to do by the Leader of the Opposition is to head up the Scrutiny of Government Committee on our side of the House. It is an important committee in opposition obviously to hold the government to account about the way that they spend their money. I think today there was a good example of the where we can play an active role in ensuring that people know and are reminded that spending taxpayers' money has to be done prudently and within the rules and acceptably to the Australian general public. Obviously, in relation to travel, the use of travel entitlements and so forth are important for us to do our job but this also needs to be done in an appropriate manner. It was concerning when I got a freedom of information request back from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. I think some of the travel and some of the expenses that the Minister for Foreign Affairs is racking up do raise questions about whether there would be a more prudent way to spend Australian taxpayers' money to effectively do the job. No doubt the foreign minister is well versed in foreign affairs and is doing the job as he sees fit; however, I think people would, rightly, be asking whether, in his first nine months as Australia's foreign minister, travelling more than the United States Secretary of State is appropriate and whether spending over $1 million is excessive. They might also question the priorities of the foreign minister in some of the visits that he has decided to go on. Obviously the foreign minister of Australia needs to travel. An important aspect of being the foreign minister is to engage in the world and represent Australia in the world. But, quite clearly, there are parts of the world which need, from an Australian foreign policy perspective, to be represented more than other parts of the world. I think there are reasonable questions to ask about the government's priorities when it comes to their choice of countries that the foreign minister is spending a lot of time in. Someone commented to me today, looking at the map that was outlined in the Daily Telegraph this morning, that the foreign minister seems to be spending more time in North Africa than Rommel did. There has been a lack of visits to important countries in our region. You will remember, Mr Deputy Speaker, that this time last year the Prime Minister announced there would be a processing centre for asylum seekers on East Timor. The East Timor government did not know anything about it but they were told they would have a processing centre; that is not now going ahead. But there has not been a visit from the foreign minister to that country. Obviously at the moment we are regularly debating a processing centre in Malaysia. I know some on the other side are very uncomfortable with the government's decision on this, and there have been some diplomatic discussions. The foreign minister has not visited Malaysia, according to the information that we have received. I would say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that, while it is important that the foreign minister travel and ensure that he is developing the links that are important for Australia's foreign affairs and trade arrangements, some of the trips in question do raise questions. He has made visits to Ethiopia, Switzerland, Turkey, Greece, Liechtenstein and Germany, rather than Malaysia and East Timor, or the South Pacific for that matter. Those are important countries in Australia's sphere of interest. The cost of this travel is also of concern. The hotels and accommodation that the foreign minister uses is of concern. The area that he is visiting is of concern. I think that the Australian people are starting to wonder whether it would be cheaper for them if the Australian Labor Party decided to make him Prime Minister once again. Jarman, Mr Robert Building the Education Revolution Program",167
197,Ms SAFFIN,ADJOURNMENT," I am here to talk about local issues, but I first want to make a factual correction. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has been to Timor-Leste. I had contact with him when he was there because he was with my old boss, President Jose Ramos-Horta. That is a correction-it is good to get your facts right when you come into this place.",168
198,Mr Briggs,ADJOURNMENT,It's on the information that his department's released.,168
199,Ms SAFFIN,ADJOURNMENT,Do some research if you want to get it right.,168
200,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT, Order! The honourable member for Page has the call.,168
201,Ms SAFFIN,ADJOURNMENT,I could not help but hear it. Now I will go back to local issues.,168
202,Mr Briggs,ADJOURNMENT,"I don't think you're right, Janelle.",168
203,Ms SAFFIN,ADJOURNMENT,I am right on that one.,169
204,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT, honourable member for Mayo will cease interjecting.,169
205,Ms SAFFIN,ADJOURNMENT,"Back to local issues, I want to congratulate Bob Jarman from Kyogle, a previous dairy farmer, who has just been granted the New South Wales Landcare Australian Government FacilitatorCoordinator Award. Bob does wonderful work through Landcare and other key natural resources organisations in ways too numerous to detail. I want to put on record congratulations to Bob, who recently received his award. I want to talk about some of the good things that have been happening in my electorate, particularly with the BER and the recognition ceremonies I have been able to go to. I went to Kyogle High School. They got a science lab there, and it was just wonderful to see. The students were so excited; they got facilities they would never have otherwise got. That was through a combination of the BER science money and also the NSP program. I also went to St Brigid's Primary School in Kyogle. They got a wonderful new library, a new lift so that there is accessibility for the students, and much more. One of the things I have been finding when I have gone to these schools is that they have been able to get what the money was allocated for, but with really good builders and good design they were able to get a whole range of other things, additional benefits. I went to Lismore Heights Public School, where they got new classrooms, refurbishment and walkways. I know a lot of the schools were able to get the covered walkways to link up the classrooms around the school grounds. The Lismore Public School got new student amenities and associated works, classrooms, COLAs and refurbishment-it was just wonderful to see. The St Mary's High School received a science BER project and because ag and primary industries is one of their subjects, with a strong focus on that because they are in a rural area, they have established St Mary's Earth Centre. It was lovely that I got to share in the recognition ceremony. Some of the students had just come back from the Brisbane Ekka, where they had been participating. South Grafton Public School got a wonderful new library plus a whole range of other benefits. Albert Park Public School in Lismore got a fabulous new library, and they were also able to turn a space into a real performing arts area. That was of great excitement to the students, the teachers and the principal. Just recently I was at Iluka Public School and joined the previous P&C president, the principal, the teachers, the students and some locals to participate in the opening of their library, which has a retractable door in the middle, where they can also get a new classroom, a walkway and then some. There have been comments about the BER, particularly from the other side, and yet I am still looking for the ones I hear talked about, because they are certainly not in my electorate. As I go around, principals make the comment that this has never happened and it is a wonderful thing. It did two things: it gave our schools first-class facilities and it also put money into the local economy. It made a huge difference, and we are the envy of the world for where our economy is situated. The stimulus really did the job that it was intended to do, particularly through our schools. One other thing recently: the Hon. Minister Crean joined me in Casino, and we opened the Casino Cultural Centre. (Time expired) Clean Energy Future Legislation WYATT ROY (Longman) (19:30): Yesterday the Labor government introduced 18 bills that will give effect to the introduction of the carbon tax from 1 July 2011. The introduction of the bills to this House represents a breach of trust and wilful disregard for the Australian people. The bills represent a major change in this nation-one where the Australian people have been denied their fundamental right to have a say. Since the Prime Minister announced that there would be a carbon tax in February of this year in direct contravention of her promise just days before the last election, my office has been inundated with concerns about the tax and the effect that it will have on families and local businesses. Unlike this Labor government, the coalition has been listening to the forgotten Australians about their views on the carbon tax. My friend and colleague the Leader of the Opposition joined me last week in Longman to hear the views of people in our community about the carbon tax. Over 200 people arrived to take up the opportunity to speak directly with the alternative Prime Minister. Even after all the taxpayer funded advertising and announcements government has had, it was clear from the questions asked at the forum that the people of my community continue to be unsure about what this tax will mean for them. They simply do not trust the Labor government when it tells them they will not be worse off. They do not trust a Prime Minister who promised there would not be a carbon tax under the government she led. When the government sent out its glossy brochures with patronising words about how everything would be okay after this tax was introduced, hundreds of people in Longman simply threw them out, left them unopened or dropped them off in my office unopened. I have a mountain of them in my office. Hundreds of people have signed the anticarbon-tax petition. But still the government will not listen. There are, however, two things that the people of Longman are clear about: that the cost of living will go up and up and up for families and that they have been denied their fundamental right to have a say on a reform that is going to have a major negative impact on Australia's economy. My community is not wealthy. It is made up of hard working Australians who have the aspirations that Australians have shared throughout history: being rewarded for hard work, building a better future for their kids and simply trying to get ahead in life. But with the spiralling cost of living that most people in Longman are experiencing they cannot be confident they are going to be rewarded for their efforts or that they are going to be able to leave a more prosperous future for their families. A mother of five children stood up at the forum to address the Leader of the Opposition. Although she was not an avid follower of politics-she said, 'I am still in the land of babies and nappies'-she urged politicians to be mindful of the impact that this their decisions had on her and her family. She said that Canberra had to understand that decisions made here had a big impact on her family. This is the basic truth that the Labor Party have forgotten. A pensioner stood up and said his life was getting harder and harder and the cost of living just kept increasing. He was concerned because he was already living week to week on his pension and was very worried about what it would mean when the carbon tax was introduced and electricity prices inevitably went up. When I ran for parliament I said I wanted to give the locals in my community a direct voice with the key decision makers in Canberra. I want to thank the Leader of the Opposition for directly listening to the concerns of the locals. While the Labor Party is walking away from the people they claim to represent, we in the coalition are keen to hear the views of Australians. In my community they are telling us loud and clear that they do not want this tax. I am yet to have one business owner tell me that a carbon tax is going to inspire confidence in the marketplace, make their business thrive and prosper and make it easier for them to employ people. They are worried about what it will mean for their families and they are worried that increasing costs will drive their already struggling businesses to the wall. My community was grateful that the Leader of the Opposition took the time to listen. This Labor government should listen as well, and members opposite should be true representatives of their communities and say no to this tax. Johnston, Mr Elliott, QC",169
206,Mr ZAPPIA,ADJOURNMENT," On the night of 25 August 2011, Australia lost a lifelong activist for social justice with the death of Elliott Johnston QC. He was 93 years of age, but the remarkable part of his longevity was his unwavering commitment to the end to a just and fair society and the defence of the disadvantaged. Committed to the ideals of communism and a long-time member of the Communist Party of Australia, he only resigned as a party member to take up his appointment to the bench of the Supreme Court of South Australia in 1983. Within Australia communism was anything but a prestigious political brand, well highlighted during the controversy surrounding Elliott's long-overdue appointment as a QC by the Dunstan government in 1970. Strongly supported by prominent members of South Australia's legal fraternity at the time, Elliott became Australia's only active Communist Party member to be appointed a Queen's Council. But Elliott's intellectual rigour, practical involvement in the struggles of ordinary people and concern for humanity's future on a planet under stress left little space for fashionable politics. His adherence to socialist ideals and aspirations, with their potential for equality and fairness through the elimination of suffering, almost seemed naive in the prevailing pro-profit productive practices that still govern global political and economic decisions despite their proven social and environmental destructiveness. Elliott was no shiraz socialist. He served Australia in New Guinea during World War II, rising to the rank of lieutenant. In 1942 Elliott married his wife Elizabeth, whom he had met three years earlier at Adelaide University. Their home in Adelaide became the venue for many meetings. Elizabeth, who died in 2002, was also a prominent activist in her own right and, amongst other things, had been a lawyer, former union leader and the chair of South Australia's first Sex Discrimination Board. Elliott was troubled deeply by the continued influence of corporations whose collective wealth dwarfed that of governments. For Elliott, the current financial crisis was the latest display of how the concentration of capital was being used to further extract money from the less well off through higher living costs and speculative investments. Nor was he persuaded by the shallow politics of law and order, and he remained sensitive to the penetrating violence from increasing social and economic disparity. In 1975, Elliott was appointed as one of three commissioners on the Laverton royal commission inquiry into Aboriginal arrests following clashes with police at Laverton and Skull Creek in December 1974 and January 1975. However, it was through his work and conclusion of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody that he came to national prominence. After the resignation of Jim Muirhead, he became the inquiry's lead commissioner and delivered its report in 1991. The report's 339 recommendations remain important reference points in improving the lives of Aboriginal Australians. Elliott's brilliant legal mind and calm and courteous mannerisms won him the admiration and respect of the legal fraternity. Some may wonder at the widespread public regard for Elliott Johnston given his avowed communist values. However, they will have missed the point, for the regard and admiration was not despite those values but because of them. Elliott was generous in his pro bono work and very early in his career was recognised as a friend to workers and a steadfast supporter of Indigenous Australians, becoming the first Chairperson of the Aboriginal Legal Rights Movement. His practical support and encouragement was devoid of any paternalism or superficial compassion and he was genuinely alert to the opportunity and need to learn from those he helped. It was not uncommon for this engagement to result in lasting relationships. Astute observers of his keen curiosity about the lives of others would have seen ingrained in his approach the belief that overcoming the individual's hardship was also the way to elevating the community and improving civil society. In more recent years Elliott's principles and values were further reflected in his belief in the need for urgent action on climate change. Weeks before his death, in a memo to the editorial chairman of his beloved journal, Australian Options, he urged for greater action to set up renewable energy sources, arguing that CO2 had a major effect on climate change. In 1994, Elliott was awarded the Order of Australia. Five minutes cannot do justice to the life of Elliott Johnston. However, his life was superbly documented by Penelope Dobelle in her biography of him titled Red Silk. The biography was completed and launched earlier this year. It is a personal regret that I was not able to attend his book launch or his 90th birthday because of my parliamentary commitments in this place. On Friday, 9 September hundreds of people from all walks of life filled Elder Hall at Adelaide University where a memorial service was held to farewell Elliott. It was a fitting recognition to the extraordinary life of a working-class hero, a unique individual, a legal legend and a great Australian. To his son Stewart, partner Janet and their family, I extend my sincere condolences. Economy",171
207,Ms ODWYER,ADJOURNMENT," This week is a week of anniversaries and sombre reflection. Tonight I speak about another event that sent shock waves around the world and changed the financial world as we know it: the collapse of Lehman Brothers on Wall Street three years ago, an event that has become synonymous with the global financial crisis. Fast forward to today. The European debt crisis is spreading like a modern-day economic plague, enveloping countries like Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece and Spain with speculation mounting about a Greek default. Global uncertainty is the only certainty. George Soros has recently warned that the European debt problem has the potential to be a lot worse than Lehman Brothers. It is timely to reflect on the lessons that we should learn from our response to the GFC here in Australia. As Sir Winston Churchill was fond of saying, 'Those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it.' While Treasurer Wayne Swan is quick to talk up his economic credentials, contrasting Australia's economic performance relative to that of our peers in coming through the GFC, he fails to understand why we got through the GFC as we did. In failing to understand this, our ability to deal with a potential GFC mark 2 is severely diminished. There were other, very important structural reasons why Australia came through the GFC. I believe in giving credit where credit is due. It was the Hawke-Keating government which floated the dollar, allowing our exchange rate to dive at the end of 2008 to support our export industries, and there was bipartisan support for a wholesale funding guarantee for our banking system and for retail deposits in the dark days after Lehman Brothers collapsed. But it was the hard work of the Howard-Costello government in paying off Labor's $96 billion debt and investing in the Future Fund that meant the national balance sheet was strong enough to support those contingent liabilities. It was coalition's regulatory reform agenda that struck the right balance between regulation and flexible markets. We introduced a dedicated prudential regulator, in APRA, which conducted regular stress tests on the banks. We reformed the Corporations Act to facilitate faster and more efficient capital raisings. Our FSR reforms, while not perfect, stood in the way of a US style subprime mortgage market emerging. A long history of stable coalition government and mature policy making gave international investors confidence and reduced foreign capital outflows. Our tax reforms improved budgetary stability during a volatile period. We left the country with a $20 billion surplus. It was the HowardCostello government that enshrined the independence of the Reserve Bank of Australia, with the RBA ensuring that our economy did not overheat pre-GFC. What is more, our RBA was able to deliver a huge stimulus directly into the economy because most Australian mortgages are floating rate. Finally, the coalition ensured that we maintained and nurtured diversified trading relationships, including with China, whose massive stimulus spending underpinned the Australian budget. In contrast, Treasurer Swan would have the Australian people believe that we saw off the GFC with an indiscriminate spend on pink batts, BER blowouts and $900 cheques. If only it were that easy. That is what is so worrying. This government thinks it can spend its way out of trouble. If only it were about borrowing and spending. Perhaps that is why we read reports this week that the government has plans to raid the Future Fund, to rob future generations of Australians through a smash-and-grab raid today to try and paper over its incompetent economic management during a time when we are experiencing historically high terms the of trade. To deliver a surplus by stealing from the Future Fund would be another broken promise and set a terribly dangerous precedent. The size, scale and spend of this government's stimulus package was wrong, and you do not need to take my word for it; you can listen to the advice of the Australian National University economic historian, Selwyn Cornish, who was quoted in the Australian: As it turns out, there was too much fiscal stimulus-there's even too much fiscal stimulus now. I think (the RBA) did what it had to do extremely well and the problem at the present time is not with monetary policy, it's with fiscal policy. University of Melbourne economist John Freebairn was quoted: … the fiscal stimulus was more than was needed and went on for too long. We have an opportunity in Australia to grow the economic pie; we should be doing much better than we are. We have the capacity to be a world-beating financial services hub, but to do that we need a government that can set aside the spin and understand Australian exceptionalism compared to the rest of the world during the GFC. (Time expired) Vibe Alive Festival",172
208,Mr MELHAM,ADJOURNMENT," I rise to commend the government for its ongoing support for the Vibe Alive Festival. Funding this year was provided from the Community Festivals for Education Engagement program for regional, rural and remote locations. The aim of community festivals is to promote a greater understanding of the value of education and to encourage students, particularly Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students, to stay in school, to complete year 12 and to live healthy, positive lifestyles. In 2011 Vibe Australia has produced a Vibe Alive two-day festival event in Moree for young Australians of all backgrounds to promote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures and to encourage tolerance and teamwork. Two more events were held in Port Augusta and Kalgoorlie. Vibe Alive incorporates music, sport, dance and art in a high-energy, youth-friendly setting. Participants also have the opportunity to meet inspiring role models, to learn about healthy living and career options and to boost English literacy and numeracy skills. All of Vibe's products promote a healthy lifestyle free from drug abuse and alcohol misuse. All Vibe events are smoke-free and all Vibe products encourage the completion of a full secondary education. Vibe Australia is also committed to increasing training and employment opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and to encouraging all young Australians to reach their full potential. Vibe Alive gives our young people the opportunity to demonstrate what they are good at, whether it is singing, dancing, sport or to display another hidden talent hitherto undemonstrated. In Moree over 30 schools registered for the event, and an estimated 1,500 people attended. The festival showcases major Indigenous talents and role models for the students. This year Australian singersongwriter Nathan Foley cohosted the event, along with actor Luke Carroll. Mr Foley said that Vibe Alive is all about getting active. He said: It's about getting kids up and out of the house and away from the TV and video games. It is about movement and getting the blood pumping through sports and other activities. It's also a great way to meet new mates. This year saw Little Vibe, which is a special program to give young people in early primary school the full festival experience. It was hosted by performer and choreographer Gail Mabo, and Courtney Walter. This year, Moree Vibe Alive included students from the Schools Spectacular Aboriginal Dance Ensemble, which fosters the development of talented Aboriginal students in dance and provides performance opportunities to encourage the pursuit of excellence in this art form. The ensemble operates in partnership with the Bangarra Dance Theatre, Australia's premier Indigenous performing arts company. A student from Sir Joseph Banks High School in Revesby in my electorate, Chris Bond, was one of the participants in the ensemble this year. Chris is just 14 years old and I am advised that he is the youngest to participate in the ensemble. Selection to the ensemble is no mean feat, and Chris is remarkably talented to succeed in performing with them. This week he is dancing at the New South Wales State Dance Festival, and it is worth quoting from their website: The culmination of hours and hours of technical training, stamina, creativity, confidence, cooperation and respect for one another, fostered by their dedicated and talented teachers … … … … Each performance unveils the determination of students and teachers to explore the art of choreography and to achieve performances of the highest quality. Later in the year Chris will be performing in the Schools Spectacular. I sincerely congratulate Chris for his success to date and for his future. There is no doubt he is incredibly talented. This is what we should be doing as a nation: encouraging these young people, particularly Indigenous people, and giving them every opportunity on the way through. It creates a positive environment for them, and they in turn become role models for successive young people as they come through. It is about working with Indigenous people. It is not a missionary approach; it is about letting them build on their talents and the creation of that opportunity. I commend the Vibe Alive Festival to the parliament. I think it has produced some good results, and it is worthy of ongoing support. Youth Allowance",174
209,Mr TEHAN,ADJOURNMENT," I rise tonight to congratulate the students of south-west Victoria and western Victoria for the campaign they have led to get the unfair changes that were made to the independent youth allowance in 2009 overturned. It is a fantastic day today for those students because Minister Evans has finally taken the action which Prime Minister Gillard would not do, admitted that the government got this wrong, and has gone back to the old policy. I still remember clearly attending a function in 2009 which had been organised by the South West Local Learning and Employment Network in Warrnambool in my electorate to oppose the changes which Prime Minister Gillard, as the then education minister, was putting through the House. Everyone who spoke that day at that meeting knew what was happening: the government was making budget savings at the expense of regional students. And oh, how this proved to be true; sadly, it proved to be true. Based on the figures that we have today, it would seem that, sadly, of the 2009 and 2010 cohorts, who missed out on being able to access independent youth allowance in regional areas, there are some 3,000 students who have been disadvantaged, who have been left in limbo and who have not been given the opportunity to afford a tertiary education. I would like to say to Senator Evans: congratulations on doing what the Prime Minister was not able to do, which is to admit that there was an injustice, admit that young country students were suffering as a result of the changes and go back to the system as it was in 2009. Senator Evans is to be applauded for having done that. I hope also that the government in time will recognise the damage that has been done to over 3,000 students in that period and recognise that something needs to be done to help those students access a tertiary education, because they were not able to afford to do it in 2009 and 2010. I would now also like to lay down a challenge for the government and for all of us in this House, because we have wasted two years in having to debate and get overturned a policy decision which was made and which was palpably wrong. But we now have some real work to do, because in country areas, for students accessing tertiary education, the gap between them and their city cousins is still continuing to grow, and we collectively need to do something about it. This is a problem that we all need to put our heads together on to come up with some policies which will not only reverse the trend but take some action and work to see the gap decrease. What we should have is a number of people from regional and country areas accessing tertiary education similar to the number in the city areas. If we can achieve that, we will have achieved something. The changes which were made by Prime Minister Gillard as Minister for Education in 2009 did not do that, and the announcement made today by Senator Evans acknowledges that. He has come in and cleaned up the mess that was made in 2009. With that behind us, I am hoping that we can all now put our heads together and work to have policies which will in a meaningful way start to address the gap. I applaud Toni Jenkins from the South West Local Learning and Employment Network, who has been fighting to see this happen. I hope that the coalition will be able to take a policy to the next election which will see this happen, and I hope that everyone on the other side of the chamber will be able to do the same. We have taken one small step to reverse a wrong. Let us now make sure that we go ahead and address the real problem. (Time expired) Electricity Prices",175
210,Mr OAKESHOTT,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Speaker, before I begin I congratulate you for your role in the chair today. It was an important statement that you made. On 29 March this year, Professor Ross Garnaut identified some issues in his Transforming the electricity sector through the process of pricing carbon. He said: The recent electricity price increases have mainly been driven by increases in the costs of transmission and distribution.  There is a prima facie case that weaknesses in the regulatory framework have led to overinvestment in networks and unnecessarily high prices for consumers.  The upcoming review of regulatory arrangements by the Australian Energy Regulator presents an opportunity to correct distortions in current regulations. Attached to that work was a startling graph that every Australian concerned about electricity price rises should see. It identifies that 68 per cent of that electricity bill is from increased investment in electricity networks-the poles and wires-to replace ageing assets and meet rising demand and, as has also been identified, to promote a failing market and the super profits of state based monopolies. State based monopolies with fixed rates of return on pole and wire infrastructure are continuing to lead to record prices on local electricity bills. Electricity bills on the mid North Coast of New South Wales are increasing again this year, by 18.1 per cent, even with a change of government in New South Wales. The increase was approved by the Liberal and National parties. This brings the cumulative price rises since 2007 to a staggering 76 per cent in this one utility alone. This is on the back of the new New South Wales government's approval of IPART recommendations for what I consider to be a ridiculous price rise. This latest rise again highlights the failures in the existing regulatory system, as identified by Professor Garnaut, and is delivering to New South Wales consumers the steepest electricity price rise in New South Wales history. Those who attended public forums at Port Macquarie and Taree were given an insight by Professor Garnaut into these market failures in state controlled monopolies. The truth is that failing regulation of the network and transmission infrastructure, the so-called poles and wires, has been the standout offender, particularly in New South Wales. The electricity network infrastructure spend was about $9 billion a year nationally, or $25 million a day, which is 2½ times the spend on the so-called infrastructure project of our time, the National Broadband Network. A monopoly with a fixed rate of return has no risk and will lead to unnecessary spending at taxpayers' expense, and what we are now seeing is exactly this: a record investment boom in poles and wires that is more focused on making money for state governments than on distributing electricity. Both major parties are complicit in this rip-off of taxpayers, and both need to start to explain their contributions to these cost-of-living pressures. This inappropriate network infrastructure spending of recent years has placed mid North Coast households and small businesses under tremendous pressure. The time has come to do things differently, and a change to the regulatory environment of the electricity sector-such as a better appeals process on rate of return decisionsis essential. Successive state governments have endorsed recent IPART decisions heavily impacting on households and small businesses, and I would urge the state government of New South Wales, the ACCC and the Australian Energy Regulator to win this fight.",176

The defence community is beyond service men and women in full-time our local communities and into our very own community out there or the Defence Force Cadets program. It is interesting that in your role as a community and you see very different experiences throughout the community.

I send out my warmest should be happy today that, from these experiences, reforms that are necessary. there were young Australians who were levelled at my generation.

But there on the the assumptions that are all too often levelled at there in the community far too often that our are lazy and that our generation are uninterested, our generation are interested, our generation are and willing to serve their country and to our communities and to the future of is appropriate that we do all that we can to support and all service men and women in whatever Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries Y, although I still ask a lot of questions his comments in relation to generation Y, who products in my previous role as the at the parade grounds of ADFA and RMC and organisation.

We had been through the Defence organisation across the board in every other area but hanging out there. If you wanted to improve the system highlighted in the Nathan Francis matter, control. This legislation, the Defence Legislation it to our agenda in this House, will address the responsibility of the CDF. Administratively, practical point of view, we then moved forward command structure. The cadets were sort of finding it very difficult to get their agendas into the reserve command structure, now Support Division-so now they have a home. because out there in the community quite often support of and are closely associated with a lot spread so broadly throughout our great communities they serve. The member for Longman is quite right terrific support on all of our important commemoration It is wonderful to see how the kids respond to their lives the concept that the state is not state as well.

When we see cadets in the community, they take that through all member for Longman is quite correct, too, cadets into the Defence Force in general-quite know that something around 57 per cent of the cadet experience. It is highly significant in through the Defence Force, so I General Hickling made a number of recommendations organisation is continuing to work through money that was allocated to the scheme by initiative that I commend-was being administered, that within the Defence organisation by the service chiefs but bizarrely the CDF had cadets.

They do formal training provided, whether it is in Force, but they also do it by making sure that community affairs. It is not surprising to see ANZAC Day, Remembrance Day services or Long the city, or other similar events, but they are civic events that occur throughout the year legislation, the service chiefs are individually cadet organisations. They are also held the safety of cadet activities. a voluntary, uniformed youth development Defence Organisation, comprising cadets, are organised on the basis of Australian Navy Air Force Cadets.

Young people can join the Navy and age and the RAAF Cadets when they are 13 years a close association with many cadet my area. The Royal Australian Air Force base in and in fact, not surprisingly, we have all three base adjacent to it. We have the 613th Air Cadet the TS Stuart naval cadet base just outside the Army Cadet Unit at Ridgehaven and a Air League, based in the region also. There are a Airport which are associated with similar briefly about those organisations because they are importantly, they are examples of what can be my association with them over the years, I are involved in them and the people who are are leading these organisations. Most of them them are people who have spent some time in one Force and have had personal experience in engaged with the cadet units. Most of them a terrific example of community leadership in for the future of these young people and they need as they progress through life. What they life skills which regrettably are lacking in too that not only through what you might call the the cadet units of the Navy, the Army or the Air these young people get actively involved in them at all the memorial services, whether it is Tan Day services that we have throughout also actively involved in a number of what I call in the local council areas of that region. NA Again, their participation and their involvement service on the day. What most impresses people at the services after the event and responsibility that they take by participating they are doing on the day and of the uniform be involved in the activity and they take it their participation on the day. I recall that, when I was mayor of the city the air cadets would lead us into the room. They the room ahead of me and all the other completed, they would lead us out of the were becoming new citizens on the day it just was a big and an important event and it people, because the air cadets are allowed to were in some cases fiveand six-year-old kids They all stood at attention and Importantly, what these cadet units do is teach ago, are sadly lacking. Because young people have lost touch with the opportunities that we skills which you never know when you may which can occur and arise at any time and at ability to respond to that situation. That is groups on their display and open days and they as part of their training. It is not just about about teaching them all of those skills. The year when I go to their presentation evening taught over the last 12 months and you see preparation for perhaps joining the Navy and required of them on a boat. These are skills through their lives. In addition I believe citizens, and that is something that is invaluable outside of the defence forces. For all of those reasons I commend the and their leaders for the cadets programs we 48 recommendations most of them were adopted through the report and noticed that many existing cadet units, in particular the National close association over the years with the Australia. That is an organisation that strongly opportunity to get involved in some kind of 'national service' in the military sense, necessarily; of civic force.

NA Ultimately, this program will have two major youth development program, and one that has regret that I see fewer and fewer young people Australia. On the other hand, the second purpose of the program-is that it provides the defence forces with the preparation they finally have to make if that is where they want for if they decide to join the Defence Force. have no doubt that a career in the defence forces what a young person thought it would be.

The fact that we were able to view such an event taking place in such a novel home soil in the United States. I think that image 21st century. As many speakers have said before me, dramatically. First and foremost, there was Australians were lost on that day. They died beginning of a whole series of events in the London bombings, the Bali bombings-all are civilians in the name of, in this case, Islam. what the Islamic faith actually stood for, what saying that people involved in terrorist acts, name of Islam are in fact doing the Islamic faith of my own constituents of the Muslim faith principles of Islam.

Sadly, it was a very live pictures brought home the impossibility of way of bringing destruction and loss of life on is an iconic one of a major catastrophe in the the events of September 11 changed our lives the loss of life of thousands of innocent people. in the towers and, subsequently, it was the past decade that have been referred to: the acts of terror perpetrated against innocent It was a time that focused our concentration on it represented, and I want to go on the record as such as those of 10 years ago, who say it is in the not only a great disservice but also, as many constantly tell me, not acting according to the religion and it abhors acts of terrorism.

At the forefront of that coming solidarity with the people who had lost their happened but also assisting the Muslim community because the truth is that they were the 'it' international community, not to mention the media, leaders came together in interfaith dialogues. basically help manage the pressure As I said on Saturday night in my electorate, marking the end of the holy month of Ramadan-we community here in Australia has got to 10 years positive story. The Muslim community has significant relationships with other members networks are very strong. So I can say that, much stronger and our awareness of each other because Australia has stood shoulder to shoulder the Iraq war that resulted from September Afghanistan, so we are fulfilling our responsibilities Australia is also a great example to the rest different ethnicities but also of different faiths, cultural and linguistic inheritance and their I have heard many times in the last 10 years, come here, references to Australia's society wonderful example of harmoniously and dialogues on the clash of civilisations that have years, Australia is always singled out as the of religion and diversity in an exemplary way.

That impact may not have been as of those who were in the Twin Towers in New on Muslims across the world, including the way to characterise the impact that those is to say that, the day after September 11, that, from being seen as migrants with a migrant community, they had suddenly become identified light as a result of those horrible events that for the community, they were very much risk to Australia and to the broader global impact on Muslim communities here in in a very successful multicultural community that the possibilities for great division together was not only acknowledging their lives and expressing their anger over what had in Australia to deal with this issuecommunity at that time, under the scrutiny of the particularly here in Australia.

It is about much more It is about much more than an aircraft now being a mode of transport. Last Sunday the US Ambassador to Australia, speech at a ceremony on the 10th anniversary remarks Ambassador Bleich noted: 'The simple the terrorist attacks was: what do we do now?' the world permanently changed on that fateful especially when so much has happened over were recently revisited the shock was brought yesterday. In the fullness of time there has Bleich deserve repetition in this place: In the 10 years since September 11, survivors understand what happened and why and how to stop together from New York to Nairobi, from Bali London and many other places and nations afflicted borders, we have been more aware in our intelligence, terror. But we have been more than that. We have have been more inclusive of religions-learning celebrating Ramadan and renewing our commitment hopes and beliefs even more freely We innovated and built new ways to communicate-social around the world than ever before in human history. ever in our alliances and in our communities around charities.

As other members on the night of September 11. In my case, I in Perth, at my desk at the headquarters of 13 Australia. Being the brigade major, the fullfor the brigade, I was at my desk when a very came into my office and said, ' Sir, a plane has I immediately thought that a light plane had have thought that was most likely. So I got up where a TV was on. I stood there trying to of other headquarters staff were there as well. it was, and it was as if it were in slow motionbuilding, black smoke pluming out of it. And then NA the plane appeared to the side of the picture point on, there was no doubt anymore what that this was a premeditated attack But we were watching on a TV screen from and safe environs-a big difference from being or US defence on the ground in New York. differences in perception between the moment other tower and what we knew an hour later, extremely substantial. It would been exceedingly on. The vulnerability of the buildings was not the towers, taking out those lateral beams, was not something that was known at the time. Again, at our defence base, Irwin Barracks, was very easy for us to take precautions, to arrangements. In the days and weeks that government buildings and all our bases around seriously upgraded. There is a huge difference before September 11 and those we had after speakers in this debate, it is clear that there From the timing of the attacks-a Tuesday second plane, around nine o'clock, then the towards the Capitol building in Washington-there demonstration of al-Qaeda's capacity to conduct very clearly, an intention to kill as many innocent intention, then they most certainly achieved beneath the towers, in the Pentagon and on terrorism around the world? Never do terrorists to take up arms on a field of battle against their about finding the weakest, most defenceless, possible. It is always the case that these opportunities that will cause the most terror back. That has always been the way and it will the sorts of people that you can turn the other offer the hand of friendship.

As these people, you cannot offer the hand of friendship and flew straight into the second tower. From that the world was facing. There was no doubt at all and that terrorism was behind it. the safe distance of Perth, sitting in its secure one of the commanders of emergency services The fog of war most certainly applied. The when we actually saw that second plane hit the two hours later and 24 hours later were difficult at the time to know what was going well known at all. When those aircraft flew into they terminally weakened the buildings-but that Karrakatta, on the night of September 11, it lock down the base and worry about the security followed, the security arrangements for all the country and indeed around the world were between the security arrangements we had September 11. As has been said by so many was a substantial change in the world that night. morning just before nine o'clock and, for the Pentagon and flight 93, suspected to be heading was no doubt that it was not just a an attack on the mainland United States but, people as possible. And, if that was their it: almost 3,000 people died in the towers, flight 93. And isn't that really the hallmark of seek to take the fight to their alleged enemies, opponents. It is never like that; it is always most vulnerable and most unsuspecting people cowards, these subhuman people, will look for and that involve attacking those who cannot fight always be the way.

In any case, what we get fight and take it to these people, because that, You take a step back, they will take a step forward; cut it off. I have ranged widely tonight. I would like families of those who died on the day of through injuries, and to those who suffered as the Pentagon and that Pennsylvanian field. courage; it most certainly is an example of great no hope, that there was going to be no mercy did what they needed to do. They knew that they knew that either they took control of the ground would be dead. So they sacrificed, they as did all those who died on that day who were the terrorists who continue to fight, the al-Qaeda of honour. They are not people with integrity, merely cowards.

It was that day; more than 90 countries lost citizens in and outrage of the attacks was not restricted 10 Australians that day as well.
