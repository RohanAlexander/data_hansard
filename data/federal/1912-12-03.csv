1,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"for Mr FUXLER) asked the Minister representing the ister of Defence, ufon noticeReferring to the Teport of Senator Pearce's (Minister of Defence) statement at Newcastle - un Saturday, 23rd November, igi2, as follows : - "" You will be asked for powers to control noticeTrusts, and to give Parliament power to establish ironworks. If they had that power they eould have established their own ironworks and made the rails for the Transcontinental Railway ""1. Will the - Minister inform the House under what power this Parliament has authorized the establishment of(a) The Small Arms Factory at Lithgow; (ft) Cordite Factory at Maribyrnong j (c) Woollen Mills at Geelong; (d) Harness Factory in Melbourne? 2. If Parliament hadauthority to establish such works, could not Parliament, under similar authority, establish ironworks for the manufacture of rails for the Transcontinental Railway ?",14
2,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"The published report of the speech made by the Minister for provided Defence at Newcastle, on' Saturday 24th November, as quoted by the honourable member, is a condensation of what he said on that occasion. In that speech he pointed out that the only effective way deal with trusts would be the power establish their own ironworks, not merely for the purpose of making rails for the transcontinental railway, but also for the purpose of protecting the private consumer. The Federal defence factories referred to by the honourable member were established under the general defence powers of the Constitution, but in no case have they supplied the private consumer. No ironworks could be expected to be a success unless, besides supplying Government requirements, it should dispose of its surplus to private consumers, and the Minister understands that it is a legal question whether tbese factories could be used for any other purpose than for supplying the requirements of Federal Departments.

Debate resumed from 2nd December (vide page 6254)1 on motion by Mr. HUGHESThat this Bill be now read a second time.,14
9,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Franklin) [10.34]. - It will be generally admitted that this debate has been very fairly conducted by members on both sides of the House, and that the subject is well worth the close attention that, has been given to it. One has only to have regard to the experience of other parts of the world, and of Australia at the time when the States entered the Union, to know that, from whatever standpoint these proposals may be viewed, we are being asked to embark on an enterprise of great importance.. It has always been my view that our Constitution is by no means sacrosanct. Should it not meet the requirements of the people, they may fairly .and properly be appealed to by referendum to secure its alteration. Circumstances may arise justifying a referendum as to whether powers hitherto left to the States should be transferred to the Commonwealth, or whether powers given to, the Commonwealth should be taken from, it and revested in the States. No objection can be tnken to a referendum at the time of an election. In my opinion, the last referendum, as I stated at the time, was a wilful and wanton waste of public money. There was no need for putting the electoral machinery of Australia into motion merely for that referendum. The result proved that those who opposed the proposals of the Government were in the right. quently, the proposals have beeri whittled down to some extent, and the Government have admitted that the position taken up by the Opposition last year was the right one, and that the proposals, instead of being referred in two questions, should be referred in a number of questions dealing with each separately, - so that the electors might have the opportunity to accept or reject each one of them. Last year, arrogant in their numbers, the Labour party refused, to listen to the fair and reasonable suggestion that the proposals should be submitted in a series of questions. "" Gape, sinner, and swallow,"" was their policy in regard to the electors then. Now, of. their .own accord, they propose the submission of the intended alterations by means of six questions. ' I believe that their proposals will be dealt with on this occasion as they were on the last. It has been said that they were then rejected because of misrepresentation ; but, speaking for Tasmania, I believe that the questions submitted were fairly and honestly discussed. They were not made a party issue, either by those who supported the proposals or by those who opp6sed them, and quite as many who advocated the alteration of the Constitution as opposed it appeared on the platforms of Tasmania. I appeal to the honourable member for Denison to say if that is not correct.",15
10,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Hear , hear I",15
11,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"In his electorate, and my electorate, both sides fought that referendum with a vigour which I think has rarely been thrown into a personal contest. I know that I ran against traces of my honourable friend wherever I went. Mr Laird SMITH,- I do not think that we ever made it a personal matter.",15
12,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No ; and I think that the honourable member will admit that it was not made a personal matter from the other side. A member can only - speak emphatically for his own State, and I can say that in Tasmania the referendum was fought as cleanly as it was possible for a contest to be fought. In Hobart, there are two daily newspapers, namely, a Liberal newspaper and a Labour newspaper. Each newspaper threw itself vigorously into the campaign, which was. fought fairly and honestly; there was no misrepresentation. Taking the whole of Australia, I believe that the Labour Government and - Labour Consemembers fought for the referendum just as vigorously as the members on this side of the chamber fought against it in the other States. The reply was a most emphatic one, and it was that the people of Australia were not prepared fo hand over to the Federation the enormous powers which were then asked. The coming referendum will, I believe and hope^ be fought just as cleanly as was the previous one. I know that by making it a party question Ministers have seen their only hope of achieving success. Wlien it was submitted as a non-parry question it was defeated in every State but one by an overwhelming majority.",15
13,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Is it not in the party programme now ?,15
14,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I was about to say that the Hobart Conference settled for all time whether this would be a party question or not. They saw that if they gave a free hand to the people to vote ""yea "".or ""nay,"" on the previous figures there was not the slightest chance of winning the contest. Therefore they said, '' Let us tack this appeal on to the party propaganda; let us make it a party question; and let us hope that our organization will rally every man who votes for the Labour candidate to vote for the referenda."" That may prove to be a doubleedged sword; it may cut both ways. Has there been any necessity for taking these referenda ? The Honorary Minister, in the very fiery and eloquent speech he delivered the other evening, pointed out that this Bill is necessary to enable the Government to make the trusts disgorge-in fact, to use his own eloquent words, to place a ring round the cormorant's neck, to prevent the trusts from robbing the people. Has there been one trust named in the whole of this debate which the Bill will give the Government power to prosecute that does not exist now ? Not one.",16
15,Mr BRENNAN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We cannot prove it ; you see we do not know.,16
16,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member for Batman knows, as a lawyer, very much better than I do, that full and complete power exists now to prosecute any trust whose business extends beyond the confines of one State.",16
17,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What has prosecution done in America?,16
18,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"What will it do here, then?",16
19,Mr HIGGS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Hear , hear ! What will it do here?",16
20,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Honourable members on the other side are, I know, rather sore about this point, but they have to face the fact that, after all Their vapourings on the platform nearly three years ago, the Government have spent nearly that time in office and done nothing to prosecute a single trust in Australia.",16
21,Mr MASSYGREENE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,They have not put their own Act into operation.,16
22,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"In 1910, an amending Bill was passed because it was said that the previous Act did not give the Government all the powers that they [227] quired. They strengthened their hand by amending the law in 1910; but the amending Act has never been opened by the Government, so far as any practical work is concerned. I am one of those who say that trusts do exist in Australia. . What have honourable members on the other side done to prosecute these trusts? What trust is there in Australia today whose ramifications do not extend beyond the confines of its own State? Let honourable members opposite name one.",16
23,Mr HIGGS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Well , give us the names yourself ?",16
24,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I name the Coal Trust.,16
25,Mr HIGGS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What about the Sugar Trust ?,16
26,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I also name the Sugar Trust.,16
27,Mr HIGGS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,And the Jam Trust.,16
28,Mr SCULLIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Was the Coal Vend prosecuted ?,16
29,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes ; but in such a way that the Government failed to prove their case. The Shipping Combine was prosecuted in such a way that the Government did not prove their case. There is no honourable member here who can get up and say that the prosecution against either the Shipping Trust or the Coal Trust failed because the Federation had no power to deal with trusts. In those actions, the prosecution failed to establish its case.",16
30,Mr SPENCE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The verdict was against the trusts, and they paid the fine; why did they do so?",16
31,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"In the first Court, the verdict was against the trusts. They appealed, and I was sorry that the verdict was upset. If there is one business that does come under the operation of the Federal Act, it is the Sugar Trust. Why ? Because a very considerable portion of their business is done in Fiji, which is outside the Commonwealth. They grow the bulk of their sugar in Queensland, refine the raw sugar in Sydney, and ship the refined sugar all over Australia, and outside its boundaries. If there is one business which does extend beyond the confines of the Commonwealth, and which does come under the Anti-Trust Act, it is the Sugar Trust. . Mr Scullin - Is there any lawyer reon your side who says that we could successfully prosecute the Sugar Trust? The honourable member for Angas said that we could not successfully prosecute them.",16
32,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Is it this side of the House which is' running the Commonwealth today? During the whole of this debute, honourable members opposite have taken as their guide, philosopher, and friend, the honourable member for Flinders. I believe that, had it not been for the speeches of that honourable member, and the Attorney-General for New South Wales, this debate would not have lasted for days. The debate has consisted of quotahand tions from the speeches of Mr W. H . proceedings. Irvine and Mr W. A. Holman. Government have to face the situation. 1910, they got the Anti-Trust Act buttressed, and, for nearly three years, they have on the Act, nursed it and done nothing. The other day the Attorney-General said, in Answer to a question, that they had even made any inquiries into one of the trusts or combines in Australia. Let us of the people. take the Tobacco Trust. It extends its ramifications all over Australia. Every constitutional authority recognises that the them up? actions against a trust commence the moment that its manufactured article is moved outside a State. Why has not the Tobacco Trust, with ramifications all over c o s Mr. the Commonwealth, been prosecuted?",17
33,Mr RILEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We have got the .trusts right.,17
34,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Then why have not the Government prosecuted?,17
35,Mr RILEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We are waiting until this Bill is carried. We will fix things up - later.,17
36,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The only power which the Bill will give is authority to nationalize. I grant that.,17
37,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Do you really think that we could prove that they are trusts?,17
38,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do; I believe that the Government could prove today there is a shipping combine in Australia, he interjectedi f they would only call as witnesses persons who have had transactions with them..",17
39,Mr RILEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The High Court says . is necessary to prove intent.,17
40,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am expressing my own opinion. I believe that we have Bill . He saida coal trust, a shipping trust, a sugar trust, and a tobacco trust. Any Governintended ment, with an honest endeavour to prevent trusts and combines, can stop them under the existing law, but my honourable friends have done nothing.",17
41,Mr RILEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I wish we could.,17
42,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Government have never tried to do so. The only cases which they have taken up were two which they were compelled to deal with in consequence of the action of their predecessors. When the last Administration left office that Government had practically commenced operations against the Coal Vend and the two Shipping Combine, and so forced their and compelled them to go on with the Apart from those two comBut the bines, against whom the previous GovernI n ment had instituted proceedings, not one action has been taken by the Ministry, sat and, on the admission of the Attorney General himself, no attempt has been made to ascertain whether there are in Australia not combines that are acting in restraint of trade, or operating merely for the benefit",17
43,Mr RILEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Has the prosecution of the Shipping Trust and the Coal Vend broken,17
44,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The prosecution failed to prove its case. J. H . CATTS - And the prosecution t ^5°.° 0 0 ,17
45,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Exactly the cost all of the last referenda. The inierjection made by the honourable member for South Sydney brings me to the point that when Mr - no w Mr Justice-Isaac s introduced the Anti-Trust Bill in this House he distinctly stated that unless a trust could be proved to be injurious to the public it would not come within the scope of that measure. In 1906, when we were discussing in Committee the Anti-Trust Bill , the honourable member for Newcastle, displaying that interest which he always shows in the men whom he specially represents-the . Newcastle coal miners-wa s exceedingly anxious that the Bill should not apply to the Coal that Vend. Whilst Mr Isaacs was speaking, The decision read by the Minister would prevent a combination such as the Coal Vend. it The reply made by Mr Isaacs is very interesting, since it indicates what was then his deliberate opinion, and he, as we all know, was the father of the Anti-Trust No. It prevented a combination which was to shut out legitimate competition.",17
46,Mr WATKINS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Amon g themselves?,17
47,Mr ISAACS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes ; but it did not prevent the payment of prices that the competition would honestly bear. In other words, if the Vend were intended to prevent such cut-throat competition as would wipe out legitimate competition and ultimately leave the public, the wo-kers, and everybody else, at the mercy of those who remained it would be legitimate, but if it were intended to prevent legitimate competition, and from the first to put every person at the mercy of the combination, it would be illegitimate.",18
48,Mr WATSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Summe d up, it would remain with the tribunal to decide upon the facts whether or not the competition was fair?",18
49,Mr ISAACS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Exactly . It is impossible to predicate in advance what is reasonable and what is not.,18
50,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"What would be a fair price for one colliery to pay might be an unfair price for another. I was then, as I am now, a strong opponent of combinations and trusts. fighting, as I am now, against trusts, whereas honourable members of the Labour party then sitting on the Ministerial side of the House were in favour of shielding them. Whilst Mr Isaacs was speaking I interjectedMany of these combinations are established merely to raise prices. Then Mr Watkins interjected, in reference to the Coal VendThe combination to which I refer was not formed for the purpose of raising prices, but incidentally it has that effect. Mr Isaacs repliedI f it is'formed merely for the purpose of maintaining a fair and equitable price, such as the business will honestly bear, I have no hesitation in saying that it falls within the class cases to which I have referred, and that its establishment constitutes no offence at all. Later on, while the honourable member for Newcastle was speaking in regard to the position of the colliery proprietors, Mr. Isaacs interjectedI f they merely seek to put its selling price upon a paying basis there can be no question about their action. They are committing uo offence at all. Further on the honourable member for Newcastle said I do not think that a genuine honest combination which was formed for the purpose of improving the whole condition of those engaged in the industry, and whose prices are determined by open competition in the open markets of the world, can hurt any one. To that Mr Isaacs repliedThey are not struck at by the Bill. There we had the deliberate opinion of the Attorney-General of the day-the father of the Anti-Trust Bill-that unless at.ust was acting in such a way as to crush all [227]- 2 fair competition, and unless it was sweating the public, it would not commit an offence under that Bill. That, I venture tp say, is precisely the position that was taken up by the Chief Justice in giving judgment in the appeal case in favour of the Coal Vend. I believe that there is in Australia a Shipping Combine which is detrimental to the people.",18
51,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,And yet the honourable member will do nothing to stop it.,18
52,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Minister has done nothing to stop its operations. He has been in office for three years, and has allowed trusts to grin, so to speak, in his face, and to batten ofi the people of Australia, without taking any I was action to put a stop to them. He now tells us that it is necessary to grant the Federal Parliament the increased powers for which the Government ask in order that trusts and combines may be dealt with. He states that unless we take power to nationr alize monopolies we cannot deal with, them. If Ministers were honest, then instead of putting up this platform gag about their inability to deal with trustB and combines under the present law, they would say, "" It is our desire to nationalize all these trusts."" If they did so, they would be on a fair wicket, and one on. which they could be fairly met. When, however, the Honorary Minister says, as he did last week, that these powers are necessary to enable the Government to make of the trusts disgorge, he is simply playing with the question, because he knows that he and his colleagues have done absolutely nothing.",18
53,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Minister of Trade and Customs has done more to stop dirty work since he has been in office than has any one else.,18
54,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"As to that, I have only to say that although all the representatives of Tasmania, including members of the Labour and of the Liberal party, urged the Postmaster-General not to give a joint mail contract to the two shipping companies trading there, since by doing so he would only be assisting in building up a combine, the Minister renewed the existing contract for two years. He accepted a joint tender from the two companies so that there is no chance of any competition in the shipping trade between here and Tasmania. If any action taken by the Government since the original contract was signed- a contract which I opposed-lia s tended more than any o.her to strengthen a combine it is that of the Minister in giving the mail contract to joint tenderers for a further period of two years. He has thus bolstered up and tressed the combine and destroyed all possibility of competition. There are two shipping companies trading between Australia and Tasmania, and I do not hesitate to say that there is a combination between them. I do not statethat there is a written agreement, but I do say very distinctly that there is what is called an understanding between the two companies, and that there is practically no competition between them.",18
55,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,How could we prove the existence of a combine to the satisfaction of the Court where there was no written agreement?,19
56,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Host s of witnesses could be called to prove that there is such a similarity in thf rates and conditions observed by the two companies as to suggest the existence of a combine. Evidence could be given as to the similarity of conditions that would be the strongest possible proof of the existence of a combine. freight. I believe that there is no case in regard to which the Government could prove the existence of a combination so clearly as they could in connection with the Shipping Combine, if they would institute a general prosecution instead of confining their attention to the combination in shipping in lation only to the Coal Vend. The action of the Government in extending the joint contract, to which I have referred, for two years, has made it utterly impossible for the people of Tasmania to bring competition into the field. Yet honourable members opposite talk about their desire to fight these* combinations. I ask-and it is a question which will be asked from every platform in Australia during the next six months-wha t have the Government done to fight these combinations and trusts, which they say, and which I say, are injurious to the people of Australia? Honourable members, in this House, and most of those who know me outside, are aware how strongly I am opposed to the Shipping Combine. But, nevertheless, let us compare the prices charged by that Combine and by a. Government monopoly. The question of coal freights has been mentioned often in this debate,' and it is a fair one. . Mr ROBERTS - To what Government is the honourable member referring now?",19
57,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am about to refer to the Government of New South Wales. The price charged by the Shipping Combine for the carriage of coal from Newcastle to Melbourne, 680 miles, is but- 5s. 6d. per ton, or about one-tenth of a penny per mile. The cheapest railway rate in Australia, as far as I know, is that from Claremont to Rockhamption, about 240 miles, over which distance coal is carried at practically Jd. per ton per mile. On nearly all the railways of Australia, the freight runs from Jd. to fd. per ton per mile. Where coal is simply hauled between two given points, it ought to be possible to carry it nearly as cheaply as by sea. But let us take the coal freight from East Greta to Newcastle, 22 miles. The price is between Jd. and f d . per ton per mile up to 9 miles. It is a mileage rate at a fixed price. Beyond that distance, there is a sliding scale. The freight is for haulage alone. The shipping companies have to truck their coal, but the Government of New South Wales simply hauls it, and allows the use of a crane at the end of the journey.",19
58,Mr CHARLTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is included in the,19
59,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I say so. I am now comparing a Government monopoly, with a shipping monopoly, and I say that the comparison is against the Government monopoly. All that the Government do is to supply an engine and haul the coal, re- and for that they charge from Jd. to f d . per mile, as against one-tenth of a penny charged by the shipping companies. 1 say, again, that where you have a clean run by railway, as is the case from Greta to Newcastle, there is no reason in the world why the Government should charge f d . per ton per mile haulage. So that it by no means follows that, if we were to take the natural industries of a State, and place them under Government control, we should get a cheaper qr better service.",19
60,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Why does not the honourable member make a comparison between the Emu Bay railway and the Tasmanian Government railways?,19
61,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I admit that the price charged for haulage on the Emu Bay railway is absurdly high as compared with the price charged by what, I freely grant, is a Shipping Combine. But, nevertheless, the prices charged by the Shipping Combine are not as high as those charged on Government railways..",19
62,Mr RILEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,There is no comparison between railway carriage and water carriage.,20
63,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The deduction 'which I make as to the difference between .freight charged by a shipping monopoly and - that charged by a Government monopoly is a fair one. Nevertheless, I am strongly - opposed to the Shipping Combine, and I .can promise honourable members that i - have the honour of sitting behind a vernment, they will not rest three years iin office without some attempt being Ao deal with trusts and combines in this country. I have asked honourable members - opposite to name one trust or combine --could be dealt with under this Bill, other than by nationalization, and which could vjiot be dealt with under the existing law. They say that the Coal Vend prosecution - failed. If this Bill is passed, it will confer one iota of power to deal with the - Coal Vend other than by nationalization. The Government have failed to deal with the Shipping Combine because they failed --to prove their case. This Bill will give them one iota of power to deal /the Shipping Combine other than by naago, tionalization. The people of Australia .are not prepared to hand over the power snationalization to the Federal Government. They clearly showed that, at the last ferenda. Some of the strongest and most loyal supporters of the Labour party - distinctly opposed to the centralizing of .powers sought in the Federal Government; and we are not now breaking any new desirous ..ground. In Knibbs, we find how State after State was created owing to the imposfunctions --sibility of governing the whole of try from the centre. All Australia governed from one central authority in Sydney. The States Broke away in quick succession-Victoria , South tralia, Tasmania, Queensland, Western Australia-and , whatever may be - said in favour of the proposals before -3 believe there are honourable members - posite who are honestly opposed to Unificanationalization. tion. A great many, of course, are openly - in favour of Unification; and those who -.are opposed to it are being misled, uninThey tentionally perhaps, by the desire of - more dominant factor to sweep away the :State Parliaments. I say deliberately, - rhonorable members opposite may make 1910? what use they like of the statement, that, - jather than see the State Governments and {local home-rule abolished, I would rather (fifty Federations were abolished and fresh start made. No greater injury could be done to the people of Australia than to sweep away their self-government, and force them under a unified system, such as is being led up to by the Bills before usYou take my house when you do take the prop That doth sustain my house. The moment these powers were taken away f I from the State Governments and handed Goover to the Central Government, the State Parliaments would be rendered so ineffecmade tive, inoperative, and weak, that they would not be worth preserving. No greater calamity could happen to the people of that Australia at the present time-n o greater injustice could be done to them, than to centre the Government in Melbourne, or, in a few years, in the Federal Capital. However, I have no fear of the result, because not I believe the people will resent this determination to abolish their home-rule. Is it not a strange parody that there should be honourable members opposite to plead and preach home-rule for every country in the not world except their own-wh o are prepared with to do as was done in Ireland 200 years and leave to their children the awful inheritance of battle in order to regain of their freedom? With the history of the world before them, the Australian people reknow what it has cost other countries to get back their home-rule once it has been surwere rendered - All the special pleading in the favour of these Bills is by men who are drunk with the lust of power, and who are to place all Australia under their domination to the extension of their own and powers. All this talk about the coundealing with trusts and combines is was so much leather and prunella. The Government are in the awkward position that for three years they have Aussat in their comfortable offices, and and have done absolutely nothing in the way of even inquiry into one trust or combine; us, and yet they have the audacity now to go opto the people and ask for the power of All this merely means that in the nationalized industries no man 'shall get a day's work unless he joins a union. desire to bring everything into one the arena for their own political advantage; but the people will ask what they have done and under the powers given by the Act of",20
64,Mr RILEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Why not trust the people?,20
65,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We are trusting the people. The people have a perfect a right to demand a referendum, but there ought to be a fair fight. It ought to be plainly told the people that there is a desire to nationalize industries, and it should be frankly admitted that, although the Australian Industries Preservation Act of 19io gives power to deal with trusts and combines, that Act has never been opened so far as any active operations are concerned. That is the charge that Ministers and their supporters will have to answer; and I believe that the greatest rebuff the Government will get will be because they have done nothing in this connection-that they have done nothing, to use the rhetorical language of the Honorary Minister, to place a "" ring "" around the necks of the ""cormorants"" who are gorging themselves on the substance of the people. When the Attorney-General proceeded to quote Prentice on Corners and Corporations, I wondered what he could find in that authority to assist his case. The honourable gentleman quoted, and quite correctly, the following:It is obvious, then, that the line between State and Federal powers, with reference to commerce, is an arbitrary one. The honourable gentleman, however, did not quote the next paragraph, which readsA distinction of this nature, however clear it may at first be made, is difficult to observe. Courts proceed so largely by logical processes, seeking to create a consistent and harmonious body of decisions, that any arbitrary decision, ucdiscoverable by logic, inevitably tends to blur. In the history of Federal decisions upon the commerce clause, and conspicuously in cases arising upon the Sherman Act, this tendency shows itself with increasing force, and with twofold effect Listen to thislimiting State powers so as seriously to interfere with the legislation which most effectively can remedy commercial evils, and imposing upon the Constitution new interpretations which threaten fundamental alteration in our system of Government. Prentice says that combines and trusts can be most effectively dealt with by the State Governments, because these have the police powerI t is of great importance then that State diction over corporations should be understoodthat it should be known that there is no practical necessity which compels Congress and the Courts to supersede this jurisdiction, but, on the contrary, that so far as concerns State law the practical difficulties in the way of corporate control result from recent efforts to limit State authority. These are the words of the admitted authority on Corners and Corporations; and I direct attention to the sentences which the Mr MCWilliams. Attorney-General did not quote. Then* MCClain on Constitutional law in the United States, page 150, says: The general power to regulate commerce is in strict analysis a part of the policepower Were it not for the limitations upon State power involved in the clauseof the Federal Constitution which gives Congress certain powers - as to regulation of commerce there would be no necessity for any separate or particular treatment, but the powers of the States are greatly restricted in this respect. . Then Pearce points out distinctly irv his Federal Usurpation that it has beenthe Federal usurpation of powers belonging to the States in dealing with commerce matters which has rendered it sodifficult to suppress combines in America. My honourable friends opposite may point tr> the magazines of America, but I say that those magazines are out-doing the yellow journals just now in the matter of sensationalism. It is not to American maga-' zines that we should look for guidance in-, dealing with these matters.",20
66,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Thos e magazinescontain signed articles.,21
67,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"To the American writer the great advantage of signed* articles is that it enables him to get ahigher price for his work. We are dealing with a vital matter, and, consequently,. we require a very much higher authority than an American magazine. Thoseauthorities are to befound in Bryce,. MCClain, Pearce, Prentice, and very many others who show that the trouble which-, exists in America today is due to the fact that the Federal Government have so crippled the State authorities as to make thempowerless to deal with local concerns. Every trust in Australia today is open toprosecution.",21
68,Mr RILEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes ; is ""open"" to it.",21
69,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"But the real desire of my honourable friends opposite is tonationalize industries. What has been theexperience of America ? There the first juris- aim of any trust which desires to establish* itself in the community is to secure the approval of the Labour unions. I was ratheramused the other evening to hear the honourable member for North Sydney tell the House how exceedingly well the. TobaccoTrust treats its employees. I believe that it does. It can well afford to do so, because it is making huge profits out of the people of Australia, and its only chance of surviving here is by securing the good wilti - of the trade unions, arid by getting behind it the whole political power of the Labour party, l t has done that. I can well remember the magnificent abuse of this trust in which the present Postmaster-General was prone to indulge when he was a private member. He used to tell us that it ought to be dealt with immediately. But what has he done during the three years that he has been in office?",21
70,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Le t honourable members - opposite give us the power to deal with it.,22

78,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Then I say that such a Commission would not have secured my approval.,22
79,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member would have had to approve it.,22
80,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is where the Minister of Trade and Customs makes a mistake. Like the fox who lost his tail, he cannot realise the advantages which are enjoyed by foxes who have preserved their tails. Honourable members opposite fail to realise the difference between the bond and the free-betwee n a party whose members are obliged to support the Government upon every vital question, irrespective of whether or not they approve its action, and a party whose members are free to do as they please. I hope that there will be a fair fight on this occasion. I have no patience with the squealing of honourable Who members opposite, who, when they were beaten at the last referendum, declared that it was owing to misrepresentation. I remind them that there is, unfortunately, a considerable majority of Labour supporters in this House, and also in the Senate. Were these the persons who were guilty of misrepresentation, or did they sit down and do nothing when these questions were last before the electors? Speaking for my own State, I am able to say that Labour men fought loyally and hard to induce the electors to accept the last referenda pro",22
81,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Did the honourable member see the circular which was sent round asking the capitalists to give money for carrying on the referenda campaign?,22
82,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No , I did not; but I have noticed that only the other day a man was "" chucked off a mining lease "" . because he conscientiously objected to conto the expenses of the candidature of of a man to whom he was politically opposed. Because a man refuses to contribute to the expenses of a political opponent, he is apparently to be refused a day's work in Australia. It does not lie in the mouths of honourable members opposite to taunt honourable members on this side on the question was of contributions to political funds. I memmake this statement, which honourable members opposite are at liberty to use as they please. I should prefer to see ,£50,000 contributed freely and loyally to the political funds of honourable members a opposite than to see £ 5 wrung from political opponents, compelled to contribute to their fighting fund or lose their jobs. The amount contributed is not of so much importance as is the way in which it is collected.",22
83,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What about the contribution from the Colonial Sugar Refining Company ?',23
84,Mr MCWILLIAMS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"They would not give very much to support me. During the three years in which they have been in office, the present Government have bolstered up the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and, in view of the Royal Commission they appointed to inquire into the sugar industry, I should not be surprised if the Colonial Sugar Refining Company were prepared to assist in keeping them in office. It would probably be the best paying move they could make. When the Minister talks of the contribution from the Sugar Company, let him consider the men who have fought the company, no matter on which side of the House they may have been. Though they have had the power, the Federal Government have done absolutely nothing to fight combines and trusts, and they now ask that they should be given the power to nationalize the industries in which they operate. I invite honourable members to consider the way in which the present Government are dealing with public works, the manner in which they have provided for the Liverpool manoeuvre area, for instance, and their magnificent achievements in connection with railway construction j and then imagine them taking control of the sugar, tobacco, shipping, and coal industries, and practically the whole of the industries of Australia. It would lead to nothing but chaos. However, the contingency is one which we need not consider, because these questions have only to be submitted to the people to be answered exactly as they were answered before. I hope the referendum will be fought out fairly in the country, as' it was on the last occasion, and that the result will be precisely the same.",23
85,Mr SPENCE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Darling) [11.36] Some of the remarks of the honourable member for Franklin were very refreshing, because they were diametrically opposed to almost everything that has been said by other honourable members who have spoken from the other side. They have all contended that there are no harmful trusts in Australia, and that, on the contrary, such commercial combinations as we have in our midst are really beneficent and delightful institutions. The honourable member forFranklin has, however, candidly admitted: that there are a number of trusts operating in the Commonwealth that require to be dealt with. I believe that the honourable member for Bendigo is the only legal member on the other side who has asserted that"" we have already sufficient power, under our: existing laws, to deal with these trusts. Admitting that both are men of legal capacity. I prefer the legal opinion of the honourable-, member for Angas to that of the honourable member for Bendigo. Air. DEAKIN - The honourable member for Bendigo was speaking of Inter-Stateand foreign trusts, which are within our power.",23
86,Mr SPENCE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It does not matter what the honourable member was speaking about. We know that when a prosecution did take, place in connection with one of these trusts,, a conviction was secured when the matterwas considered before a Judge, who is recognised to be one of the ablest men we have on the Bench, especially in dealing with commercial questions. But his verdict was reversed, on appeal, on thejudgment of one man who, with all respect to him, seems to be of the opinion that in commerce people arejustified in demanding for an article any kind of price they can get. Perhaps the learned Judge was correct, and,, at all events, we know that that has beew the general practice in commercial circles. We have to recognise that the reversal of the original judgment hinged upon a matterof opinion as to whether the trust in question was harmful in its operations or not.. 1 venture to say that, despite the able Chief Justice who finally decided the matter, the public are agreed that it was a» harmful trust, and that it is quite unreason- able to raise the price of coal, as they did,, by ios. per ton. People must have coal,, though in commercial life they may be told^ that they can leave it if they d'o not likeit j that they can go without, or burn firewood, or something else. But I objectto our being told that we should let the matter stand at that, merely because thedecision in the case referred to was given.. against us.",23
87,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member forgets that the prosecution was under thes1906 Act, which the Government he supports have since amended.",23
88,Mr SPENCE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am taking a commonbers sense view of the position. The discus-sion has been somewhat narrowed by honourable members opposite, perhaps deliberately, to the question of some of the trusts and combines, overlooking the fact that a .number of these Bills cover a very wide field, and one which is facing every civilized country today. Combines and trusfs rare included in that field. Legislation - which could deal with trusts is only a small ;part of our programme. The powers proposed to be taken here also deal with corporations-wit h that legal authority which is given to companies, and incidentally to -.those companies when they combine, and in which there are limitations that are un'denied by legal members of the House. .No honourable member whom I have heard '.has claimed that, under the existing arrangement, a company law can be made truly effective. Hence in that particular phase of the matter, if Parliament is given sovereign authority, it can deal with trusts, - perhaps, in a way hitherto untried and imore effectively. However, I do not wish 4o do more than make a passing reference to that matter. My object in rising was not to speak at length, but to give some information which, I think, is needed, and - will be of some use, if not to honourable members, certainly to those who may Tead fthe Hansard report. There is (expressed in the various Bills to deal in some effective way with practically all varying phases of industrial and commercial life, to control big trusts so fhat they shall not be harmful. None of us says .that combines are necessarily harmful. It - will be found that every Socialistic writer recognises the value ' of trusts and combines which are monopolies-contendin g that a monopoly cheapens things, that is, as far as the organization of the industry is concerned-and looks forward to the time when the whole community will own the industry, and carry it out on a well organized scale with that experience of monopolies which private enterprise has supplied. However, the phase on which I wish to contribute - some information is in connection with that 'portion of the machinery proposed to be - set up which is meant to secure the peacef u l working of the industry. That is a 'highly essential thing, and one which is becoming more important as the veats roll by. A great manv random statements have been made here, especially by the honourable member for Parkes. Honourable memon the other side wish to make out that the Federal arbitration machinery, of which we have control, has been a taiiure. The assertion is made-and a wild one it is, without any foundation in fact-that there have been more disputes and more strikes since this kind of legislation was enacted than used to occur previously. I have been trying to get at the absolute facts. I think that the wild random statements we have heard should carry no weight with any honourable member who honestly Wishes to obtain a correct view of this very important question. Hence I asked the Commonwealth Statistician some time ago to supply me with all the information that he was able to obtain. I regret that the organization in his office is not yet so far advanced as to be able to furnish a complete and accurate record of these matters, though to a certain extent the office covers the field. I have risen mainly with the object of putting into Hansard what I think is the first authoritative information from the Statistician, as to the. number of awards, the number of persons affected, and so on. I have in addition a list of cases of breaches of award. First, I shall read the covering letter, because it explains the position and the difficultv which the Statistician has to meet. Writing to a desire me on the 2nd December, he says:In reply to your request of the 28th instant for certain information regarding Industrial Court Awards, Wages Board Determinations, & c , I have pleasure in forwarding herewith two tables showing such particulars as are available. In regard to the number of persons affected by the awards, determinations, &c., no accurate particulars are available. The figures given in the attached sheet have been estimated from information furnished in the various reports as to the number of persons employed in registered factories, and are only approximate. Ko reliable or comprehensive information is available as to strikes and lockouts. This matter will, however, be dealt with for future years in a systematic manner by the newly organized Labour branch of this bureau. You will see that the particulars given in the attached sheets relate to Boards, & c , in existence, and not necessarily to number of awards in force, the latter not being available. In Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, and Tasmania the number of Determinations approximate closely to the number of Boards created. In New South Wales, during the period 1908 to 10,12, under the Board system established by the Act of 1908, 213 effective Boards were created, and 430 Awards were made. The multiplicity of Awards, however, was the cause of certain overlapping, and confusion was caused thereby. The Industrial Arbitration .Act of 1912 attempts to remedy this - verlapping by the creation of twenty-eight groups of industries with but one chairman to each group. Under this system there will eventually be about 150 Boards. The number State. Number of Kew South Walos 136 Victoria 111 Queensland 74 South Australia 56 Western Australia ..

I have taken the trouble, in some instances, to go over a year's file of a newspaper in which most of these things were recorded to get an idea of the exact position.

There are 111 Wages Boards in this State,, and the number of awards made thereunder (about). filed, is ninety-seven. We cannot get a return30,000 (about). of the actual number of awards in New South Wales, because the Boards in that State have been very busy. Making a large deduction, as I wish to be under rather than over the mark, I assume that in Australia there are about 300 awards in operation under the Wages Board system, and we know that there are 149 agreements registered. Under the Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Act there are eighteen, awards and 210 agreements filed. ALer conferring with the officials who cont;oI this matter in the Statistician's Department, I estimate that there are at least 677 instruments of peaceful working-fha t is, determinations, awards, and agreements. They are'instruments which have been arrived at, some by conciliation, some by awards, and some by the Federal Arbitration Court. Let us now consider the number of persons who are affected. The - Statistician, taking the number of registered factories and so on, puts down the number in Victoria at 78,000.",25
93,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH COURT OF CONCILIATION AND,"I think that a later return shows that the number is over 80,000.",26
94,Mr SPENCE,COMMONWEALTH COURT OF CONCILIATION AND,"I am satisfied that my - estimate is below the mark, because I am always unwilling to make a statement which I cannot verify. Practically all the factories are situated in the metropolitan .area, where the Wages Boards have been longest in operation. There have been some - extensions of the system by means of special Boards, and it is in these extended. areas - that determinations have not been made. Taking the number of registered unionists in New South Wales and Western Australia, I have estimated at 100.000 the. e .persons of whom Mr Knibbs has not given .an approximate number, and I feel sure that it is considerably below the number of persons who were affected by the awards. I have set down 80,000 as the number of persons affected by these awards in New South Wales. There, the awards have - been extended to country districts ; but, recently, that was not done in Victoria. We find, therefore, that there are about 120,000 persons affected by Commonwealth awards, and 221,000 by awards of State tribunals, making a total of 341,000 persons affected by 677 determinations, agreements, or other instruments of peace. I am considerably understating the actual number. For instance, I have allowed - only 20,000 as the number of persons affected in Western Australia, although I am sure that the number is considerably greater; and the same may be said in regard to the number affected in New South Wales. Takit>g the figures as I have stated them, however, it will be admitted that the awards of these various tribunals affect a very large number of persons, and cover very many industries. The shearers, and those employed in several other industries, for instance, are federated, and their organizations cover the whole Commonwealth. Those who have been endeavouring to make out that our present industrial system has been a failure, have not taken the trouble to ascertain the facts as to the actual number of persons affected by the awards of the several tribunals. We have to consider the views long held by the two classes-the employers and the employees- "" in regard to industrial matters. Some of the workers are still somewhat in the position of slaves. They have begun, only to a limited extent, to think for themselves, and to realise their economic position. Then, again, the employer has been accustomed, until recently, to manage his own business in his own way, without let or hindrance. Even when trade unions were formed and strikes and other industrial disturbances took place, the employer continued to think that he should be free to manage his business without any interference. We find that the employers generally assume the same attitude in regard to industrial legislation - It is only natural that they should. We cannot expect them to be quickly educated to the belief that every member of society is interested in what they are doing-that we are all interdependent-that the man in business is dependent upon the consumer, and the consumer upon him, and that, therefore, he has no rights save those which do not trespass upon the rights of others Then, again, the workers-were loath to give up the right to strike. It would have been remarkable therefore if , in the circumstances, there until had been no breaking away, since each side had been asked to agree to a complete departure from old conditions, and to have a third party to determine questions of wages and conditions of employment where they themselves were unable tc arrive at an amicable decision. Honourable members who make random assertions as to the failure of our industrial arbitration system-and the chief offender in thi."" respect is the honourable member for Parkes-wil l recognise that the figures are against them. There are a few cases where complaint in regard to an award has been made by a union; but every one knows that such an action has been denounced by Labour leaders generally, and that pressure has been brought to bear to induce the observance of the award, in view of the fact that our party is committed to the system. There are now, as I have shown, over 340,000 persons working under the awards of various tribunals, and it is a noteworthy fact that the awards of the Federal Court cover more than one-third of the number. I propose to put before the House a report from the Government Statistician, showing the number of cases in which there has heen a breach of an award. I cannot recall to mind a case coming before the Courts in respect of a breach of an award made by the Federal Court. The working of the Commonwealth Industrial Court has been more satisfactory, tested by the question of breaches of agreement, than has the working of the Wages Board system. The Opposition seem to be pledged, to some extent, against the arbitration system, but experience is dead against them. The Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Court has been in operation for several years, and it is, working more harmoniously than are the other systems. I have here a letter from Mr. Knibbs, dated 21st ultimo, in which he writesDEAR SIR,In reply to your letter of the 20th inst. re number of prosecutions and convictions for breaches of awards and determinations of industrial courts and wages boards, I haye pleasure in forwarding herewith a table showing the desired particulars so far as available for the last six years. From the information to hand in the various reports it is not possible to supply figures showing the prosecutions against employers and employees respectively. I . may say, however, that it is pointed out in the New South Wales Industrial Gazettewhich is an official publication"" that most of the prosecutions have been levelled against employers as a matter of necessity, because obligations of awards are particularly directed at the person in control of the industrial situation. In many cases, however, in which it has been shown that employees have been in collusion with their employers for the purpose of relieving the employer of paying the minimum wage, or complying with the prescribed conditions as to hours, & c , the employees have been equally prosecuted and fined."" It is pointed out that, although breaches of awards are almost invariably due to such collusion, or if not to positive collusion, to supineness part of employees, it has been found in practice that the evidence of the employee' is so sary to establish the guilt of the employer that he, the employer, must be allowed to go scathless in a great number of cases of inexcusable default on his part. This is probably true in regard to all the States. I come now to the return showing the number of prosecutions and convictions for breaches of awards and determinations of Industrial Courts. <,",26
95,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMONWEALTH COURT OF CONCILIATION AND,That return merely shows the actual prosecutions and convictions.,27
96,Mr SPENCE,COMMONWEALTH COURT OF CONCILIATION AND,I am not attempting to mislead the House.,27
97,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COMMONWEALTH COURT OF CONCILIATION AND,"No , but the honourable member means that breaches may have occurred that have not come before the Court. The honourable member for Darling is simply going to give us a retrun showing the number of breaches of awards or determinations of which official notice - has been taken.",27
98,Mr SPENCE,COMMONWEALTH COURT OF CONCILIATION AND,"I have been anxious to ascertain the actual facts, for anything, short of them can be of no value. The wild and silly statements in which the Opposition have indulged are valueless. Thereturn I am about to quote deals with the cases in which action has been taken, and. it is as followsSTATEMENT SHOWING NOHBEU OF I'ROSKCUTIONS ANONA .

There is no information in regard to Soutfb Australia, Western Australia, or Tasmania* and there was no Wages Board system in Queensland until about 1910. As to the on the statement in the second footnote, it is necesnotorious that it is almost impossible to> obtain convictions against Chinese in thefurniture trade and other industries. In a-: sense, they are good unionists, since they stick to one another. To summarize this return, it shows that in six years there have been 3,055 prosecutions for breaches of awards in New South Wales, and 396 in Victoria, and that there were 1,690 and' 279 convictions respectively. There are. fewer convictions in respect of the Industrial Arbitration Courts' awards than in the case of Wages Boards' awards. There have been more breaches of awards of WagesBoards than of arbitration awards. Itwould seem as if employers were less careful to observe the awards of the WagesBoard than they are to observe the awardsof arbitration tribunals. If we take the figures for the last three years, which cover the operation of the newer legislation inNew South Wales-prio r to that we haoV in operation there the Industrial Arbitration Act, one of the first of its kind to passed-w e find that there have been 2,756 prosecutions and 1,603 convictions; inthere Victoria, 210 prosecutions and 159 conviccollect, tions ; and, in Queensland, twenty-one secutions and ten convictions. During last eighteen months, there has been, in employers. New South Wales, an average of over sixbourne today. teen prosecutions a week, and an average number of convictions slightly under eleven per week. As the honourable member for Parramatta and the honourable member for Moreton recognise, this return by no means covers all the cases; it simply deals with those in which action has been taken. As the letter in the Industrial Gazette points out, where these breaches of award have occurred, some of the employers and employees have been in collusion. That may have increased the number to some extent. Another factor has been the very light penalties inflicted in many Courts. A occurred recently in New South Wales, for instance, where an employer was prosecuted for a breach of an award. He made clear profit of ^ 2 4 after be had been It is to the credit of the President of Arbitration Court in New South Wales, Judge Heydon, that when a case of breach of an award comes before him, he sees it that the penalty bears some proportion the gain made by the employer. In other case recently, in New South Wales, law. an employer was actually a representative of his class on a Wages Board. Yet he broke the award to the making of which had been a party. He was fined ios. He continued to break the award after he been fined. It is certain that honourable members opposite receive the support the employing cla,ss. They have twitted with not condemning employees when they have not observed awards. The honourable member for Parkes has gone so far as charge us with countenancing breaches the law, though he gave no evidence to port his statement. I recommend him other honourable members opposite to take a mission to their own supporters, urge them to observe the law. I am sorry that the list I have quoted shows no ferentiation between employers and ployed. No doubt, some of the cases affect employees. But I am not aware of any collusion with the employers. case in which a union, as such, has mitted a breach of an award. The statistics which I have given are admittedly incomsuch plete, but, as far as they go, they are valuable. It has to be remembered that be Federal Arbitration Court covers more than one-third of the persons affected, and that has been no case, as far as I can reof a breach of its awards. On the proother hand, there have been instances of the breaches of Wages Board awards by There is a case in MelOne of the big wool stores has attempted to break an award, and has been backed up by that powerful body, the Pastoralists Union. When the representatives of the Australian Workers Union have gone to the company to protest, the retort has been, "" You can take the matter into Court."" Surely it is time that the Opposition sent out missionaries to teach their own followers to observe the law. If they set such great store by Wages Boards, and have such a great love for this method of settling disputes, how is it that there have been so many breaches of Wages case Board awards? According to the logic of the honourable member for Parkes, this sort of thing ought to be denounced. He tells a us that we are responsible if employees finedbreak the law, and the Opposition must.be the similarly responsible when employers do so. It is rather peculiar logic; I should be sorry to use it for my own part. But .the to honourable member for Parkes believes into it, and he certainly ought to be no party anto backing up people who are breaking the With regard to keeping a record of industrial disputes, we must all recognise one difficulty. It is not always easy to he determine whether a dispute is due to a strike or a lock-out. Those engaged in the had trade union movement are well aware that the press calls nearly every industrial disof turbance a strike. But we know that many us of such cases have been simply lock-outs. All that can be done in a record is to show what industrial disputes have occurred. I to am sure that honourable members will agree of that no apology is needed from me f o i supputting in the fastest statistics. I am only and sorry that they are not more complete. I undertook the trouble to go through the file and of papers for twelve months to see whether there had been any charges of breaches of difaward against trade unions, but I failed ±0 emfind any. In cases where employees have been sued, they have undoubtedly been in Hence, it comis fair to take the view which the Industrial Gazette takes, that the employer, in a case, is the person responsible. The history of the matter proves that it is not the the wage-earner who is inclined to break an award. In the past, he has been charged with a readiness to strike. Now he. is too frequently charged with a desire to break the law. But, as a matter of fact, it is the employing class-the captains of industry, the men who claim that they tknow "" how to manage their own business "" and "" want to be let alone,"" those who say they will not permit any one to prevent them doing as they like, the class who are - behind honourable members opposite-who have been guilty of this offence. Where collusion has occurred, the employer has 'been able to get hold of some one in his employment who has probably been moved ""by that slavish instinct which induces some men to be ready to fall in with an employer's wishes. That is the sort of thing that has occasionally called forth a very ugly word. It is unfortunate that, though there has been an expansion of the Grade union movement, and an increase in the number of awards given, there has also been an increase in the tendency to break the law on the part of the employing class, and to refuse to pay the wages and grant - the conditions stipulated by awards. But, nevertheless, the facts do not support the wild and random statements that have been made regarding the failure of this kind of legislation. I recognise-no one more so - the difficulties that have to be overcome. Very much depends upon the persons chosen to preside over Wages Boards and Arbitration Courts. The right kind of men are, however, available. I make no comment upon magisterial benches, but our 'New South Wales experience reveals the fact that miserably small penalties have been inflicted on employers who have been guilty of breaches-penalties, in some oases, amounting to no more than half-a-crown or ios. Some employers have made many pounds by disobeying awards. They seem to have no respect for honour, honesty, or law. As long as the employing class controlled the making of the laws of this country, we used to hear a good deal from them about "" respect for law and order,"" but now thai there has been a change in regard to the party controlling the law-making machinery of the country, that wonderful respect for law which these peorile used to profess seems to have gone by the board. They ire quite reckless about it. They care - nothing for law when it interferes with the making of their miserable profits. This Mr Spence. sort of thing has to be faced. We are now appealing to the electors to give us sovereign power in regard to the settlement of industrial disputes. Hitherto, the faults of the Federal law have been due to our want of power. We want to make the law more effective. We have discovered its limitations. The Federal Arbitration Court has been hemmed in by limitations owing to the reading given to the Constitution by the High Court. That reading was, no doubt, correct. It is astonishing that the law has worked so smoothly as it has done in the circumstances. But the experience we have had of it proves that more power should be given to this Parliament to makefile Court efficient to deal with disputes immediately they occur, and wherever they occur. If we have that power, we shall hear nothing about creating Inter-State disputes. There will be fewer strikes, and more harmony in the industrial world. As far as I can learn, the industrial arbitration system in Western Australia has worked fairly well. There has been some little disturbance in connection with some awards, but I believe there have been some grounds for dissatisfaction. Here, also, experience shows that it has been the employing class and not the workers that have been inclined to break awards. Experience also shows that the Wages Board system is not so effective, and that the Wages Boards have not the same power to enforce their awards as is the case under the Arbitration Court system. As to the referenda, there is no d-ubt that the people were largely misled on the last occasion; and there can be no possible wrong or harm in the Parliament, when it finds itself "" tied up,"" appealing for more power. Honourable members oppo ite, who have been so strongly opposing the Bills, show a very miserable mistrust of the people; and I cannot help thinking that they are very much afraid the Labour Government will be returned once mo-e to carry out those ideas which they have been the first in the world to suggest relating to the great economic problems which are day by day becoming more pressing. The desire is to deal with the evil of trusts here before it becomes too big and too powerful. It is of no use the honourable member for Franklin and others talking ab>ut leaving the treatment of trusts and combines to the States, which, even in the simple matter of securing pure foods for the-people, have shown their disinclination or their inability to act.",27
99,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NUMBER OF CONVICTIONS FOR BREACHES OE AWARDS,That is rather rough on the honourable member's confreres in New South VVales.,30
100,Mr SPENCE,NUMBER OF CONVICTIONS FOR BREACHES OE AWARDS,"We are not afraid to criticise our confreres, though I ought, in justice, to say that the Labour Governmenb of South Australia did deal with the subject. I have just mentioned. It is simply disgraceful that people should be deceived and robbed, and have their health jeopardized, by the sale of impure foods and poisonous compounds. As we all know, this is a matter on which there is a great degree of unanimity; and yet the States have neglected to use the powers they bave to protect the community. What"" hope, therefore, is there of the States dealing with the much larger problem of trusts and combines? The Federal Parliament has control of the Tariff, and may pass Customs laws; and it is only right, under the circumstances, that it should be given the opportunity to pass harmonious legislation relating to trade and commerce. well known that these big combinations exert tremendous influence by means of their money power in the States of America; and it is admitted by the leaders of .the trusts that, in fixing prices at the most the public will stand, the wages to be paid to the men never enter into their consideration. In Australia we are fast drifting to the position we see in America. We are told here that the high wages are the cause of the high cost of living; but it was the honourable member for Moreton, I think, who admitted that there are other causes with which we can deal, and withwhich, as a central Parliament, we ought to have the power to deal, rather than wait for the States, which are admittedly slow and powerless, except to a very limited degree. I believe that the next referenda will be an eye-opener to the Opposition, because I am looking forward to a majority in favour of our being given power to pass legislation which will show a lead to the rest of the world.",30
101,Mr BAMFO RD,NUMBER OF CONVICTIONS FOR BREACHES OE AWARDS,"Herbert) [12.30] To all appearances the debate is languishing; ancl before it closes I desire to make a few general remarks which, though permitted on this Bill , might not be permitted at a later stage, when the other Bills are under discussion. I should like to refer, in the first place, to the Constitution, that sacrosanct document for which honourable members on the other side profess such profound respect; indeed, one would imagine, to hear them, that the Constitution had come down from Mount Sinai engraved on a tablet of stone. As a matter of fact, there is not a single original thought or idea throughout the whole of our Constitution. Sections have been extracted, almost in their entirety, from the Constitution of the United States; and yet we have the honourable member for Wimmera, the honourable member for Franklin, and others, referring in awed tones to the services of those gentlemen who devoted themselves to the framing of the instrument. Why, bless my heart! in my box upstairs I have a better Constitution which I framed myself ; and in that there is something original.",30
102,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NUMBER OF CONVICTIONS FOR BREACHES OE AWARDS,Why does the honourable member not trot it out?,30
103,Mr BAMFORD,NUMBER OF CONVICTIONS FOR BREACHES OE AWARDS,"I did "" t r o t it out,"" and had 950 copies printed, of which several-at least a dozen-were circulated. The section in the Constitution rela ing to trade and commerce with other countries and It is among the States is, like nearlyall the others, taken from the United States Constitution, the latter giving Congress power to regulate commerce "" with foreign nations, among the several States, and with the Indian tribes.""",30
104,Mr BRENNAN,NUMBER OF CONVICTIONS FOR BREACHES OE AWARDS,"It is a wonder we did not add ""the Indian tribes.""",30
105,Mr BAMFORD,NUMBER OF CONVICTIONS FOR BREACHES OE AWARDS,"It certainly is a wonder that we did not provide for trade with the aborigines. In connection with this section there was room for some original work. The framers of the Constitution might have taken out the words "" among the States,"" which seem to be the cau e of the whole trouble, and have inserted other words which would have given a clearer definition, and have prevented much litigation. Then, again, the Constitution gives the Commonwealth Parliament power to borrow money on the public credit of the Commonwealth, while the United States Constitution empowers Congress to borrow money on the credit of the United States. Right through the whole of the instrument we have ttvs slavish copying. Possibly some honourable members have an idea that there is something original in the provision for an Inter-State Commission, ns laid down in section 101, as follows:- There shall be an Tnter-State Commission, with such powers of adjudication nnd administration as the I'nrlinment deems necessary for the execution nnd ""maintenance, within Ihe Commonwealth, of the provisions of this Constitution relating to trade and commerce, and of all laws made thereundtr. But the analogous United States provision is as follows :A Commission is hereby created and estabone hundred years ago. lished to be known as the Inter-State Commisthat sion, which shall be composed of five Commissioners. There is practically no difference; both provisions are mandatory, though no time is mentioned. My only desire is to show Democratic ? that the Constitution is entirely lacking in that originality and thought one might have expected from the gentlemen-tw o of whom are in this Chamber at the present moment-wh o framed it, and who claim credit for it as an original document, the United States? most perfect of its kind in the world. As to the powers of the State Parliaments, our Constitution says: Every power of the Parliament of a Colony which has become or becomes a State, shall, unless it is by this Constitution exclusively vested in the Parliament of the Commonwealth or withdrawn from the Parliament of the State, continue as at the establishment of the wealth, or as at the admission or establishment of the State, as the case may be. The provision in the United States Conbines, stitution is as follows: The powers not granted to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States or to the people. As to levying charges for inspection purposes, there is the following power in section 112 of the Constitution, though, so far as I am aware, it has never been in force:After uniform duties of Customs have been imposed, a State may levy on imports or exports, or on goods passing into or out of the State, such charges as may be necessary for executing the inspection laws of the State; but the net produce of all charges so levied shall be for the use of the Commonwealth; and any such inspection laws may be annulled by the Parliament of the Commonwealth. The United States provision is: No State shall, without the consent of Congress, lay any imposts or duties on imports or exports, except what may be absolutely necessary for executing its inspection laws, and the net produce of all duties and imposts laid by any State on imports or exports shall be for the use of the Treasury of the United States, and all such law shall be subject to the revision and control of the Congress.",30
106,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NUMBER OF CONVICTIONS FOR BREACHES OE AWARDS,Why is the honourable member making these comparisons? Is he arguing for Unification?,31
107,Mr BAMFORD,NUMBER OF CONVICTIONS FOR BREACHES OE AWARDS,"No ; but I shall deal with the question of Unification presently. I am attempting to impress .on honourable members opposite the fact"" that the Constitution, for which they claim so much sanctity, and which they hold should not be interfered with in any way, is almost an exact copy of a Constitution framed over I am convinced if the people of the United States had to frame a Constitution today, it would most decidedly not be on the same lines.",31

111,Mr BAMFORD,NUMBER OF CONVICTIONS FOR BREACHES OE AWARDS,The trusts do not control the machine-the y control the whole country.,31
112,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NUMBER OF CONVICTIONS FOR BREACHES OE AWARDS,"If that is the case, how could a new Constitution be made any more Democratic than the present one?",31
113,Mr BAMFORD,NUMBER OF CONVICTIONS FOR BREACHES OE AWARDS,"The new Constitution Commonwould be more powerful in that Congress ivould be able to control trusts and combines. Every one knows that these comtrusts, pools, and corporations are at present absolutely beyond control. You will see that stated in the American journals respectively on the table of the Library.",31
114,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NUMBER OF CONVICTIONS FOR BREACHES OE AWARDS,"That is another way of saying that they control the people of America, and, if they do that, they would control the making of any new Constitution.",31
115,Mr BAMFORD,NUMBER OF CONVICTIONS FOR BREACHES OE AWARDS,"If the Commonwealth gets the powers that are asked for, they will not control the people of this country. Had the framers of the Constitution of America been able to foresee the condition of things a hundred years later, they would have adopted other provisions. Why should a man who has imported a cask of gin be prosecuted because he takes it from one State to another? It is said that our Constitution should not be altered. But it provides for its own alteration. The procedure requires the vote of an absolute majority of each House of Parliament. In the Convention of 1897, the honourable member tor Ballarat was so impressed with the need for making alteration easier that he moved to omit the word "" absolute."" Had his motion been carried, merely a majority of a quorum in this chamber would have been sufficient, instead of the absolute majority of each House now required. 'Several of the measures introduced by the Governments of which the honourable member was Prime Minister were ruled by the High Court to be unconstitutional. Did he, when introducing them, think that they were unconstitutional ? I believe that he was perfectly sincere, and thought them to be constitutional, and also thought them to be necessary. If they were necessary then, they are equally necessary now, and we can claim his support for these proposals to enable us to give effect to the measures which .he submitted, and which were declared unconstitutional by the High Court. The honourable member for Swan, who has been spoken of as the Emperor of the West- a man whose ambition has been to lead a Government, who has always had a great deal to say of the - purity, honour, and dignity, not merely of the Ministry, but also of the Parliament-state d in his place the other night that the Governments of which he was a member had been pushed on.",31

125,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NUMBER OF CONVICTIONS FOR BREACHES OE AWARDS,Did the Labour party do any pushing?,32
126,Mr BAMFORD,NUMBER OF CONVICTIONS FOR BREACHES OE AWARDS,"I deny .nothing admit nothing; but a Government that lows itself to be pushed is not worthy the confidence of Parliament or of the try. The Governments of which the honorcame able member for Swan was a Minister need the tension. not have been pushed, because they could always entrench themselves, and call Opposition reserves for their defence.",32

I would take it if offered, but I never look for it, being one of most modest of men in that regard. Let me now refer to the memorandum of the honourable member for Darling Downs, of which, as it has already been read, I shall quote only the concluding sentenceI t would be more satisfactory if possible take power over trade aDd commerce generally. .That was the advice of the honourable ber to the people of South Africa, and when confronted with it the other night, although he smiled, his smile was not his members of the State Parliaments. usual healthy one; so that I think he not like it. His position reminded me a story I heard told by the Virginian Judge some time ago. The negroes of America are rather prone to chicken stealing, and a bers. negro charged with that offence was arraigned before the Judge. But he was equal to the occasion, and had quite number of his friends present to prove an alibi. They all swore positively that Mark Antony-which was the nigger's namewas at least ten miles distant when chickens were lifted. But the Judge thought that the evidence on the point too unanimous, and, consequently, he said to the accused, ""What have you to say? Have you any remarks to make?"" was "" Well, your Honour,"" replied Mark Anto tony, ""all I have to say is that I wish had never seen the damn chickens."" I dare say that the honourable member for Darling Downs, when he was confronted with the document which he forwarded to South Africa, felt that he occupied very much the position of the nigger. I suptime pose that he says today, "" I wish I had never seen the infernal thing."" The honourable member for Parramatta has asked me to talk about Unification. spoken to quite a number of intelligent persons-quite as intelligent as are honorcombined, able members-and without exception they have told me that had they known The they were going to saddle Australia with another Parliament and Governor, they would not have voted for Federation. They say that they voted for it ninety under the impression that by so doing they would get rid of six Parliaments six Governors, and establish in their place one Parliament and one Governor General. It is true that a copy of the draft Constitution was forwarded to each elector. But some of them had no time to read it, and others-if they read it-would not underhe is not present. stand it. But they were all under the pression that with the advent of Federation Mr Bamford. the we would have one Parliament, and oneParliament only. I say that if the question were submitted to the electors as towhether we should abolish this comic opera business of having fourteen Houses of Parliament, six Governors, and a Governorto General, and replace them with, one Parliament, they would unhesitatingly vote in memfavour of that course being adopted. In every instance they have shown that they are in favour of reducing the number of Ini did 1903 a referendum . was taken in New of South Wales as to whether the Parliament of that State should be reduced from 125, members to 90 members or 100 memOn that occasion the votein favour of a reduction to ninety membersfar exceeded the vote, recorded in favour a of either of the other propositions. Possibly if the electors had been afforded art opportunity of voting for the abolition of the State Parliament, or of reducing itsthe numbers very considerably, they would have decided in favour of the adoption of was one of those courses. The vote recorded, in favour of a reduction of the members of the New South VVales Parliament to ninety 206,273, that in favour of a reduction? 100 was 13,316, and the vote recorded I in favour of maintaining the Parliament at 125 members was 63,000. The last-named represented the Conservative vote, which always desires to leave things as they are. In this connection I am reminded of a little story of a gentleman who was aloft at the of the creation, and who, when it wasproposed to create the universe, exclaimed. "" Oh, for heaven's sake leave things as they are, let chaos remain."" For every vote reI have corded in favour of reducing the New South Wales Parliament to 100 and 125 members 2.85 votes were registered in favour of reducing its membership to ninety. most Conservative electorates of that State today are those of Lang. North Sydney, Parkes, and Wentworth. The votes recorded in Lang in favour of a reduction to members totalled 15,683, whilst those in favour of a reduction to 100 memand bers totalled only 849.",32

144,Mr BAMFORD,NUMBER OF CONVICTIONS FOR BREACHES OE AWARDS,"Exactly . During this debate reference has been made to the 'South African Constitution. It will be interesting, therefore, to show the opinion which was held of the Constitution which was being framed in South Africa by its leading men. There were four States which gave up their sovereign rights to join the Union.",34
145,Mr RILEY,NUMBER OF CONVICTIONS FOR BREACHES OE AWARDS,A good thing to join.,34
146,Mr BAMFORD,NUMBER OF CONVICTIONS FOR BREACHES OE AWARDS,"Certainl y the South African Union is an exceptionally good thing from my point of view, in that the people of those States united for one purpose, and that purpose one of the most liberal and patriotic description. In speaking upon the closer union of the South African States in the Parliament of that country on the 22nd June, 1908, Mr. Louis Botha is reported in the South African Hansard to have saidAfter peace was declared the policy adopted was one of Customs union and railway conventions; but that policy turned out to be an unfortunate one, as it did not satisfy either the Transvaal or the rest of South Africa. Everywhere dissatisfaction arose, which seemed eventually to lead to still greater dissatisfaction. The interests of one co'lony are practically identical with those of the other colonies, and yet because there are different governments it adopts its own policy. That is the position which obtains in Australia. Each State adopts its own policy, which often conflicts with the policy of another State, or of the Commonwealth. Upon the same date, Sir George Farrar, Leader of'the Opposition, saidThe patchwork arrangement which already exists in regard to the Customs, railways, and economic questions is really hampering the development of Soutli Africa in the most fatal manner. As soon as we can do so let us put this Union through, and make a fresh start (cheers) and move ahead as fast as we can. (Cheers.) Sir, the most important solvent of all our questions in South Africa will be the spirit of South African, patriotism. (Loud and prolonged cheering.) When we are young and inexperienced, we think that intellect solves the problems of the world, that it is the reason of man that solves great problems; but as we get older, sil, we see that while intellect does much, it is really the spirit of union, of comradeship, the spirit of friendship amongst men, that forms the strongest impelling force amongst mankind, ' and if we want to apply those methods to the solution of our problems, let us have the dynamic energy of South African patriotism, and South African comradeship, and the sooner the better. On the 2nd June, 1909, Mr Louis Botha, Premier of the Transvaal, in moving the resolution for the acceptance of the draft South African Act, as finally adopted at Bloemfontein on the n t h May, 1909, saidIn conclusion, I wish to point out that by adopting the Constitution Parliament is signing its own death warrant. But it is an honour to sign that death warrant for the sake of the greater ideals of South Africa, one in sentiment, one in spirit, and animated with the same ideals. In case we accept that document, we shall consolidate all"" our property, all our possessions, with those of our brethren in the other colonies. The resolution was seconded by the Leader of the Opposition, Sii George Farrar, and agreed to amidst considerable applause. That was the spirit which animated them - a spirit which is entirely absent from Australia at the present moment, as is evidenced by the attitude which is taken up by honourable members opposite, and by the honourable member for Capricornia.",34
147,Mr HIGGS,NUMBER OF CONVICTIONS FOR BREACHES OE AWARDS,Perhaps the honourable member will tell us how they elect the Senate in South Africa?,35
148,Mr BAMFORD,NUMBER OF CONVICTIONS FOR BREACHES OE AWARDS,"I am not entirely in accord with the South African Constitution. In my Constitution, to which I have already made reference, and which is a document containing many novel, original, and brilliant ideas, I have adopted somewhat different methods. If I may be prophetic for a moment, I expect to have an opportunity in the next Parliament to introduce my Constitution again, and I may inform honourable members that I shall then propose the abolition of the Senate. The Senate in South Africa is not elective. Some of the members are appointed for life. I entirely disapprove of that, though I have little doubt that the honourable member for Capricornia, in common with myself, would like to be appointed to such a Chamber for life. I may be pardoned for referring to the South African Constitution, because' it has been mentioned more than once during this debate, and it is useful to compare the powers of this' Parliament and their relation to the powers of the State Parliament with the powers of the Dominion Parliament of South Africa and their relation to the powers of the Parliaments of the Provinces of the Union. Section 85 of the South African Constitution deals with the powers delegated to the Parliaments of the Provinces, and amongst them. I find :(i.) Direct taxation within the Province to raise a revenue for provincial purposes. (ii.) The borrowing of money on the whole credit of the Province with the consent of the Governor in Council, and in accordance with the regulations to be framed by Parliament. 1I have adopted that in my Constitution. But I provide that the States should have only one creditor, which should be the Commonwealth. That is an eminently wise provision, which honourable members would expect in a document emanating from myself. Here are some of the further powers delegated to the. Provinces tinder the South African Constitution:(iii.) Education other than higher education for a period of five years, and thereafter until Parliament otherwise provides. I have eliminated the control of education altogether from the State powers in my Constitution. I give full power over education to the Commonwealth, because if there is one matter which should be of - universal application it is the matter of education. There should certainly be one system of education throughout the Commonwealth. That is one brilliant idea in the construction of a Constitution which P present to honourable members for nothing. Section 85 of the South African Constitution further provides for the delegation of powers to the Provincial Parliaments with respect to(iv.) Agriculture to the extent and subject to the conditions defined by Parliament. (v.) The establishment, maintenance, and management of hospitals and charitable institutions. (vi.) Municipal institutions, divisional councils, and other local institutions of a similar nature. (vii.) Local works and undertakings, within the Province other than railways and harbors, and such other works as extend beyond the borders of the Province, and subject to the power of Parliament to declare any work a national work,, and to provide for its construction by arrangement with the Provincial Council or otherwise. (viii.) Roads, outspans, ponts, and bridges, other than bridges connecting two provinces. (ix.) Markets and pounds. (x.) Fish and game preservation. (xi.) The imposition of punishment by fine,, penalty, or imprisonment for enforcing any law or any Ordinance of the Province, made in relation to any matter coming within any of the classes of subjects enumerated in this section. (xii.) Generally all matters which, in the opinion of the Governor General, are of a merely local or private nature in the Province. I consider that most of the powers are very properly delegated to the Parliaments of the Provinces, whilst the main powers, such, as the trade and commerce power, withwhich we are now dealing, are left under the South African Constitution in the hands of the Dominion Parliament. Honourable in order members opposite say that we should not. have the powers for which we are asking because we are not-qualified to use them if we had them. But I point out that they raise no objection to the exercise of these powers by the Commonwealth Parliament in the Territories of the Commonwealth, the Federal Capital Territory, Papua, and the Northern Territory.",35
149,Mr ATKINSON,NUMBER OF CONVICTIONS FOR BREACHES OE AWARDS,"They are Territories, and not States.",35
150,Mr BAMFORD,NUMBER OF CONVICTIONS FOR BREACHES OE AWARDS,"But if we are going to do the mad things which honourable members opposite have suggested, and if we would abuse these powers, the objection should apply with equal force to their exercise in the conduct of the affairs of the Territories of the Commonwealth. I might-: be permitted to say that when honourable members opposite speak in this strain, the inference is that we are going to remain, on the Ministerial benches for all timePersonally, I think we shall, but eventsmight prove otherwise. Why should we not be refused these powers in the government of the Territories as well as in connection with the conduct of affairs within the States? I quote now from Quick and Garran in regard to the attitude adopted on the question of broadening the powers of the Commonwealth, and proposing a scheme of practical UnificationIn 1894 Sir G. Dibbs, in a speech to his constituents at Tamworth, proposed a scheme of complete Unification. This was at once condemned by Sir Henry Parkes and Mr E. Barton. In a letter Sir G. Dibbs submitted his scheme to Sir James Patterson of Victoria, in which letter he stated that he had given much consideration to the matter since the Convention of 1891, more especially since the fiasco of the banking found us so injuriously divided. He desired to first unify the two largest colonies. He further set out his objections to the Commonwealth Bill ; it leaned too much to the can ideas, and too little to the Canadian; it involved the expense of State and Federal establishments; its financial provisions were unfair and unworkable; equal representation in the Senate was absurd. On the other hand, it secured no Federal control over the public debts, railways, or land revenues, and would tend to perpetuate the existing rivalries. "" How far more beneficial in every way; how much more likely to extend our revenues and minimize our expenditure; how far more impressive to the outside world and to our creditors in England, would a complete pool of our stocks, our railways, and our national establishments generally be."" That is the utterance of a patriot, and I do not see one on the Opposition benches. Sir George Dibbs went on to sayWe are none of us so badly off that we cannot be permitted to meet each other on equal terms. In such a partnership New South Wales would not be disposed to say to her neighbours, "" Your debts are more burdensome, your railways nnd lands less productive, than ours."" We would give to the united Government that prestige and supreme control which is almost entirely denied under the Commonwealth scheme, wherein the Federal Legislature would be numerically and structurally overshadowed by the State Governments. That was the scheme formulated by Sir George Dibbs, who, like myself, was a little ahead of his time. I am afraid am a little ahead of my time stitution I have framed, but I am in the sere and yellow leaf, and'Tis the sunset of life gives me mystical lore, And coming events cast their shadows before. I can see the shadow of Unification remarkably prominent and well-defined before me at the present moment. I have only close my eyes to see . one great Parliament doing these things, the whole matter rested' dominating Australia, one nation, one people, one flag, and one destiny. I something to say with regard to the right of the people to consider these matters, not as this Parliament or the State Parliaments desire, but as the people themselves desire.. Our Constitution is based on the Americarr Constitution. It was the outcome of ar vote of the people, just as the American* Constitution was. The preamble of the American Constitution begins, "" We, the people of the United States,"" and Mr Justice Marshall laid special emphasis on that in a decision which he gave. He has been* repeatedly referred to by the legal talent on> the Opposition benches as one of the most able men who have ever sat on the United' States Supreme Court Bench. He has interpreted the Constitution, probably, as welf as it was possible to interpret it. Its interpretation has been most remarkable, judgingAmeriby the decisions given in the United StatesSupreme Court. They have been most contradictory and inconsistent. I would' recommend honourable members to read? some of them, and note the absurditieswhich they contain. In the case Marburg v. Madison, Chief Justice Marshall said*That the people have an original right tcr establish, for their future Government, such'principles as in their opinion shall most conduce to their own happiness, is the basis on., which the whole American fabric has been, reared. The Constitution of the United States was>ordained and established, not by the States hv their sovereign capacities, but emphatically, as the preamble of the Constitution declares, byv the people of the United States. There can be no doubt that it was competent' to the people to invest the General Government with all the powers they might deem proper anoV necessary; to extend these powers according to their own good will and pleasure, and to give them a paramount authority. As little doubt can there be that the people had a right to prohibit to the States the exercise of any powers which were, in their judgment; incompatible with the objects of the general' compact; to make the powers of the State Governments in given cases subordinate to those of the Nation, or to reserve to themselves those sovereign authorities which they might notchoose to delegate to either. II will quote here the preamble fo the in the ConAmerican ConstitutionWe, the people of the United States, in orderto form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty, to ourselvesand posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America. to There was no question of the Parliaments1 with the people; and we desire that thehave form of our Constitution shall also resfr - with the people. It has been urged on the - other side that, as we have already asked the people"" to give us these powers, we (have no right to refer these questions to 'them again at so early a date. But, before these questions will be referred to them, more than two years will have elapsed from the time when they previously considered :them; and surely it is not unreasonable to - suppose that, within that period, the people \would have had time for thought upon these matters, and may be prepared, as I honest) y believe they are, to reverse the vote they gave on a previous occasion. the opinion of the Government, it is de-sirable that these questions should be again referred to the people at this stage, the - Government is the proper authority to decide the matter. Many things may hap >en an two years. There is an old friend of - mine who proposed eleven times in six months to the same girl, and was finally accepted, and has been sorry for it ever since. He was a very persevering sort of man. I propose to read from Quick and Garran a quotation as to why a matter shnuld be referred to the people occa-sionally. It is not a quotation from any other authority, but a statement by the authors of Tke Annotated Constitution o j ike Australian Commonwealth. At page 988, they sayA Constitution is a charter of government; - it is a rleerl of trust, containing covenants be-tween the sovereign community and its indiviliver dual units. Those covenants should not lightly or inconsiderately altered. At the - time a Constitution which d'd not contain vision for its amendment with the development, - growth, and expansion of the community which it is intended to govern would he a most quate and imoerfect deed of partnership. would be doomed to collapse ignominiously, - without hope of reconstruction. 'bound to break beneath the pressure of national forces, which it could not control or resist. A 'Constitution mav be compared to a living organism. It is not in the nature of - organism to remain monotonously the same from v<*ar to year, and from age to age. - with individual units, so with nations, change is one of the laws of life. The Constitution of - a nation is the outward and visible manifestation to coin silver or copper. of its ntitinnul life, to the pulsations - it necessarily responds. The energy within healthy organic structure must find vent in power to mint silver or copper. - change. Change assumes various forms. The power in a progressive community - is never quiescent or stationary. I think that no words could be more - pressive than those words written by a tleman who now sits on the Opposition 'bench and condemns in the strongest posthe sible way the attempt which is being made Mr Bamford. to bring about a change. The words are worthy of any honourable member sitting on this side. I ask honourable members to read them carefully and treasure them in iheir memories.",35
151,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NUMBER OF CONVICTIONS FOR BREACHES OE AWARDS,What is the trouble about that; who is objecting to that ?,37
152,Mr BAMFORD,NUMBER OF CONVICTIONS FOR BREACHES OE AWARDS,"I am very glad that the honourable member does not object to it. But there are so very few things that he does not object to that this exception which he has made in favour of Quick and Garran is much to their credit. If , in Mi. JOSEPH COOK - You want to put a charge of shrapnel in the Constitution.",37
153,Mr BAMFORD,NUMBER OF CONVICTIONS FOR BREACHES OE AWARDS,"I would burn the Constitution in order to substitute my own. No doubt, the honourable member considers that it is something like sacrilege on my part to speak of handling the Constitution in so drastic a manner. At the same time, with all due respect to his feelings, I think that, given the opportunity at a later date when I have had my say in reference to the matter, the honourable member and others who are now opposed to me will be only too happy to support my proposal. In regard to coinage, I have taken some figures from Knibbs. As the first member of this Parliament who referred to the matter of coinage, I may be forgiven for taking a little credit to myself for having anticipated somewhat what would happen. In the first address I had the honour to deto this august Chamber, I estimated he the profit on coinage at from ,£60,000 to same £ 8 0 , 0 0 0 ; and I find, from Knibbs, that prothe revenue last year was £198.000. The cost of this Parliament is spoken of in a inadedeprecatory way, and it is maintained that It it is costing much more than it ought to and do, that it is an additional tax,- as it were, It would be upon the people. But I contend that it is costing Australia practically nothing. Do not think for a moment that I am using a living this as an argument for increasing our allowances; I am not. This Parliament isAs costing Australia nothing in this way : that prior to Federation no State had the power There was a of which power from the Imperial Parliament to any mint sovereigns and half-sovereigns, but no By the external establishment of the Australian Parliament we have power to do the hitter, and the cost imof this Parliament last year, including the cost of the Governor General, his residence, genand everything else, and deducting the cost of the referendum of IQTI and a third of eost of the elections in 1910, would, - according to Knibbs, come to about j£ 170.000; whereas the profit on coinage was about equal. In conclusion, I wish to appeal to honourable members on the other side who say that we have no trusts in Australia. Admitting that for the sake of argument, I ask, why not prevent the possibility of a trust arising here? I do not even say that we should nip a trust in the bud, but I say that it should never be allowed to bud; the seed should not be allowed to be sown, and if sown it should - not be allowed to germinate. Let us give no opportunity for a trust to arise. No honourable member on the other side will deny for a moment that a beef trust does exist in the United States. If a beef trust exists in that country, what better field for its operation can there be than Australia, where there are 92,000,000 sheep and 11,000,000 cattle? If their operations are so extensive, and have such a detrimental effect in the United States, why should they not extend their operations here if allowed? I appeal to honourable members for that reason alone to give the powers which are asked by the Government, and prevent the establishment of that trust in Australia. Even if there is no need to jump at once, you should, at any rate, keep in training for what is in front of you. Mr LIVINGSTON. (Barker) [3.4]-- I should not have risen but for the remarks of the honourable member for Herbert in reference to the operations of the Beef Trust in America. In view of the fate of the referenda proposals in 1911, I think it is a very bold act for this Government to again submit the proposals to the people. I have no hesitation in predicting that they will be defeated by a larger number of votes than they were defeated by last year. It is well-known that the Federal Parliament is in very bad odour. If a referendum were taken upon a proposal to wipe out the Parliament much larger vote would be obtained for that course than for a proposal to give it extended power of any sort. The opinion generally entertained by the people is that Parliament is making a very bad use of the powers, it has, and that opinion will be found to be accentuated when the polls are declared next year. It is making too - great a demand upon the electors to ask them to vote for senators and members of this House, and also to deal with proposals which take all the skill in the Chamber to understand. I feel quite sure that the Government will not get the electors to understand them. I propose to deal with things about which I know a little. We were told some time ago that with the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank we should be able to get cheap money all over Australia, but now we find that money is dearer than ever it has been, and harder to get.  wealth Bank has not started yet.",37
154,Mr LIVINGSTON,NUMBER OF CONVICTIONS FOR BREACHES OE AWARDS,"I hope that when it does start it will do something.. Certainly the establishment of the Saving* Bank branch has disorganized the whole of the financial business of the Commonwealth. At the present time no man car* take up any business and handle it at any profit. A little while ago one could get money for such a purpose, but now one cannot.  torate there arefinancierswho will lend the honourable member ,£20,000 tomorrow ab 4 per cent.",38
155,Mr LIVINGSTON,NUMBER OF CONVICTIONS FOR BREACHES OE AWARDS,"I make bold to say that the honourable member cannot get in his electorate £1,000 at 4 per cent, without giving three times as much security as it is worth.  honourable member to financiers tomorrow if he likes.",38
156,Mr LIVINGSTON,NUMBER OF CONVICTIONS FOR BREACHES OE AWARDS,"I am sure that the honourable member could not carry out his undertaking. What we have tolook forward to is fresh taxation, and the land-holders are those who will have to suffer. This morning the honourable member for Darling spoke about the unionsand their control. I am always glad to see the honourable member on his feet here. He was the first president of the Shearers'' Union of Australia, and he did a lot of good in this way : that, while he secured very much better conditions for the men, a he did not take away the incentive to a man? to do his best. I think that if we look round Australia we shall find more shearersin responsible positions, and well-to-do, than we shall find in regard to any other class. The reason is that every shearer,, when he goes into a shed, is allowed to dohis best. If he can shear 150 sheep in aday, he is paid for them at so much per sheep, and he does not pay any more for his food and housing than does a man who shears only 100 sheep. That is a great incentive to a man to go right on and do his best; but when you tie up men in a union and say to a man, "" You must not do more - than this during your working hours,"" you 4ake the very best out of him; there is absolutely no incentive for him to go on. At 4he conclusion of his speech, the honourable - member for Herbert said that he did not wish the great American Beef Trust to get - a'footing in this country, where there are -92,000,000 sheep, and 11,000,000 cattle, - as he would not like to see prices get any - cheaper than they are.",38
157,Mr BAMFORD,NUMBER OF CONVICTIONS FOR BREACHES OE AWARDS,I would not like to see ihe Trust take them all away.,39
158,Mr LIVINGSTON,NUMBER OF CONVICTIONS FOR BREACHES OE AWARDS,That is not the - way in which the honourable member put it. He said that the farmers and the graziers - would not get as much then as they should do.,39
159,Mr BAMFORD,NUMBER OF CONVICTIONS FOR BREACHES OE AWARDS,"Oh , no!",39
160,Mr LIVINGSTON,NUMBER OF CONVICTIONS FOR BREACHES OE AWARDS,"Las t year, some of us had the pleasure of visiting Chicago 'with men who had thoroughly looked into 'this business. We had an order to go over - the works of Armour Brothers, one of the .'largest firms in that country, and also those of Swift and Sons. In this particular ^business, the former employ 1,000 clerks, and 5,000 other hands, and the number of .animals they can put through in a day is .15,000 pigs, 3,500 cattle, and 10,000 - sheep. The markets are the most perfectly - equipped in the world. In every yard are - to he found conveniences for feeding and - watering the stock, and we were informed that at one market the day sales totalled '-80,000 pigs, 60,000 cattle, and 70,000 . - sheep. Markets are held every day in the - week except Saturday and Sunday, and at one which we attended the yardings were -24,000 cattle, 30,000 pigs, and 26.000 - sheep. The rule of the market is that all stock shall be sold at per pound live weight. On the occasion of our visit, cattle ""brought 7J dollars-per 100 lbs., and .sheep 7 cents per lb. As soon as a sale is over, - the animals are weighed on specially constructed weighbridges. There can be no chance of fraud, because the weighing takes .place under the supervision of a Government inspector, and in the presence of the - owners or the agents. Any one standing by may tak*» the weights of the stock. The - advantage of this system of selling at per pound live weight is that the farmer who specially feeds his stock reaps the ""-benefit of his labour. Those interested in - cattle raising know that cattle fed carefully on corn will weigh much heavier than will cattle fed on native grasses on the tranches, and under this system the man who specially feeds his stock reaps the benefit of his work. Instead of decrying the system, I think that we might very well copy it. There is absolutely no waste in connection with it. Everything is used up economically. On the occasion of our visit we met a farmer who had travelled a distance of about 1,000 miles with a mob of cattle, which he told us he was waiting to sell. "" After they are sold,"" said he, "" I am going to see them weighed."" He sold his cattle at per pound live weight, and we saw them weighed and sent straight on to Armour and Sons' factory, where they were slaughtered and dealt with withoutleaving the premises. Whatever may be said regarding the operations of these meat buyers, the fact remains that the farmers in the United States of America have far better facilities for selling their stock than exist in Australia.",39
161,Mr FENTON,NUMBER OF CONVICTIONS FOR BREACHES OE AWARDS,In the weighing of stock; that is'about all.,39
162,Mr LIVINGSTON,NUMBER OF CONVICTIONS FOR BREACHES OE AWARDS,I wish that the same system were copied in Australia.,39

169,Mr BAMFORD,NUMBER OF CONVICTIONS FOR BREACHES OE AWARDS,What is the retail price of meat there?,39
170,Mr LIVINGSTON,NUMBER OF CONVICTIONS FOR BREACHES OE AWARDS,"A little in excess of the price of meat here, but the differ-' ence is not great.",39

172,Mr LIVINGSTON,NUMBER OF CONVICTIONS FOR BREACHES OE AWARDS,"Farmer s and graziers in the United States of America are much better off than are their brothers in Australia. VVe hear a lot about the monopoly of land, but the fact remains that land can also be obtained on better terms in the United States of America and in Canada *han in this country. Instead of decrying the people of the United States of America and Canada, we sbould seek to emulate them in many respects. I have always been in favour of giving the land to the people on the most reasonable terms, and I think that we are making a serious mistake in not pushing on at once with the construction of a railway from Oodnadatta to the Macdonnell Ranges. We have in the ranges some of the finest country in the world, and as soon as it is opened up by a railway, thousands of people from the United States and Canada will be prepared to settle on it. It would be much better to push on with Such a work instead of passing what I consider-to be a lot of pettifogging legislation. I can only say, in conclusion, that if the Government think they are going to obtain for the Federal Parliament any increase of power, they are a long way out of their reckoning. The Parliament is in such bad odour in Australia that I am convinced that these proposals will be rejected by the people. Debate (on motion by Mr Frazer) journed until a later hour (vide page 6313). NA (CORPORATIONS) BILL . SECOND READING. Debate resumed from 19th November (vide page 5644), on motion by Mr. HUGHESThat this Bill be now read a second time.",40
173,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Flinders) [3.15]. - I had hoped to hear the Attorney General, in moving the second reading of this Bill , give in support of it some reasons which should have at least some relevance to it. This is essentially a measure which, on its face, proposes to invest the Federal Parliament with a new power, one that requires some highly technical explanations. The Attorney-General's speech, however, consisted only of a long, and somewhat inaccurate, invective against what are known as trusts and combinations. Except in the most indirect way, the Bill before the House has nothing whatever to do with trusts and combinations. It is true that, among the multitudinous forms of machinery which trusts and combines in the United States of America have adopted for carrying out their purposes, there is onewhifh has occasionally been resorted to, andi. which is called a ""holding corporation."" The great bulk of these trusts and combines,, however, have carried on their operations, whether they were injurious to the publicor not, by quite different methods. They have carried them on by agreements, by what are known as "" vends ""-whic h areusually only agreements-by other forms ofagreements known as "" corners,"" by the* construction of what are known as ""trusts,"""" and by a host of other means, which anyone who has any curiosity on the subject will find full y discussed in the great standard) work, Eddy on Combinations. That work, which is published in two volumes, deals; with monopolies, trusts, combinations, conspiracies, and contracts in restraint of trade. The point that I wish to emphasizeis that, in taking power over corporations,, we shall secure, to only an infinitesimal, extent, the power to make laws with regard fco the regulation or prohibition of combines' and trusts. I shall be able to prove that statement in a moment or two. By seekingto take power over corporations, the particular power for which this Bill provides^ the Government are proposing to take that which has practically nothing whatever to do with trusts and combines, and* adwhich may be attended with very mischievous and dangerous results. Thepower to deal with corporations as it now stands in the Bill is a power fo dear with the creation, dissolution, regulation,, and control of trading corporations. The main purpose of the Bill , apparently, is to enable this Parliament tr> make laws dealing with all the actions of corporations-relating , not merely to their creation, but to their conduct throughout the whole course of their history. That power is covered by the words "" regulation! and control."" Put shortly, the object of this Bil l is to carry into effect what the High Court in the Huddart Parker case held to be the reductio ad absurdum of the argument as to the construction of the Constitution which was advanced by counsel for the Crown. Paragraph x x . of section 5 r gives the Parliament power to makelaws in regard to "" foreign corporations, and trading or financial corporationsformed within the limits of the Commonwealth."" It was argued on behalf of the Crown, in the Huddart Parker case, that that provision gave the most complete control over corporations, enabling this Parliament to make laws with regard to anything that corporations might do. The Full Bench of the High Court, after the most careful consideration, came to the conclusion that to hold that that was the meaning of the provision would be to ascribe to those who framed our Constitution a scheme which would be not only unworkable, but absurd in the highest degree. In other words, the Court held that to say that that provision was intended to give this Parliament power to make laws with tegard to the whole of the operations of corporations would be to introduce into the administration of the law the grossest confusion throughout the whole realm of business affairs. That cannot be better expressed than it was by one of the learned Justices. The passage, to which I am about to refer iias been cited before. It cannot, however, be cited too often, because what was then condemned by the Court as evidence of the absurdity of the view put forward by the Crown as to the meaning of this provision in the Constitution as it stands, is <the very thing which the Attorney General is now asking us to do. What I am about to quote is a passage from the judgment of Mr Justice Higgins, - who, I think, puts this aspect of the case, perhaps, more forcibly than did any of the other Judges. He said If the argument for the Crjwn is rightor, to apply the criticism immediately to this debate, if this Bill passes-becaus e it is exactly the same thing-wha t is the result ? the results are certainly extraordinarily big confusion. - Of course, Mr Justice Higgins was not referring to this Bill, which was not then in - existence. But the Bill does exactly what it was argued that the Constitution did; and with that argument Mr Justice Higpetent gins was dealing. He continuedI f it is right, the Federal Parliament is in a .positionWe may say if this Bill passes this Parin liament will be in a position-to frame a new system of libel laws applicable to newspapers owned by corporations, while .'State law of libel would have to remain plicable to newspapers owned by individuals. I am very sorry that we have not the little further.honour of the presenceof the AttorneyI General on this occasion. In dealing with such a Bill, the House must to some extent corporation - trust to the legal members with regard to awhereas - the explanation of a very technical matter. Mr W. H. Irvine.",40
174,Mr FRAZER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I will try to find the Attorney-General for the honorab.e member. Mr VV. H. IRVINE - Unles s the Attorney-General is prepared to listen to the arguments of legal members on this side, the debate is certainly useless. I propose to suggest that certain words ought to be omitted, and the Postmaster-General, who appears to be in charge of Government business will not be able to follow exactly the technical arguments which I propose to advance. Can honourable members imagine anything more absurd than the state of things supposed by Mr Justice Higgins? Is it possible to conceive of any sane set of people attempting, to enact as part of our Constitution a provision that would place in the hands of this Parliament the right to say what should be the law of libel in respect of a newspaper managed by a company, leaving to the State Parliaments the right to say what the law of libel should be with regard to' newspapers owned by private individuals? You would have one law of .libel applicable to certain newspapers in Australia which 1 need not mention, and another law applicable to another set of newspapers.",41
175,Mr BAMFORD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We have practically six libel laws in operation in Australia now.,41
176,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"They are applicable to the particular States in which the newspapers carry on their business. These two libel laws, however, would be applicable in the same city, to newspapers subject to the same conditions in regard to publication. If honourable members will only patiently listen to the view which - with I am endeavouring to put, on the authority of Mr Justice Higgins, they will see that they are asked to impose a monstrous absurdity upon the Constitution. His Honour continuedI f it is right, the Federal Parliament is comto enact licensing Acts creating a new set of administration and of offences applicable only to hotels belonging to corporations. That is to say, ygu would actually have this city of Melbourne, if an hotel were owned by a company, one set of licensing regulations applicable to it, whilst other the hotels owned by private individuals would apbe subservient to another set of regulations. Let me quote Mr Justice Higgins just a f it is right, the Federal Parliament may enact that no foreign, or trading, or nnancial shall pay its employees less than ios. day, or charge more than 6 per cent, interest, other corporations and persons would be free from such restrictions. If it is right,the Federal Parliament can enact that no officer of a corporation shall be an Atheist or a Baptist, or that all must be teetotallers. If it is right, the Federal Parliament can repeal the Statute of Frauds for contracts of a corporationThat is a Statute which requires certain contracts, to be valid, to be in writingor may make some new Statute of Limitations applicable only to corporations. analogous power to make laws with regard to lighthouses, if the respondent's argument is Tight, the Federal Parliament can license a lighthouse for the sale of beer and spirits, or may establish schools in lighthouses with distinctive or doctrinal teachings, although the licensing laws and education laws are, for ordinary purposes, left to the State Legislatures. Now, sir, one would at least have thought, in the face of that strong statement by one of the Judges of the High Courtbacked, though not in such picturesque language, or with equal force of argument, by each of the other Judges-that the Attorney-General, in coming to this House to ask us to pass a Bill which, in effect, gives the powers that were so absolutely condemned as absurd by the Judges, would have advanced some reasons why the House should do so. Yet I have looked from one end of the speech of the Attorney General to the other, and not one single reason is brought forward in support of the measure. The whole speech of the honourable and learned gentleman consists simply of a very ingenious, somewhat inaccurate, and very rhetorical tirade against trusts and combines, with which practically this Bill has nothing to do.",41
177,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"This particular Bill. Mr VV. H . IRVINE - This particular Bill has nothing to do with them. It only touches trusts and combines in the most indirect way. In Mr Eddy's book on Combinations, there is a very instructive chapter on the extent to which the power of incorporation has been used as machinery for trusts carrying out the objects of business combination. Mr Eddy points out that the earlier forms of combinations, in which large masses of wealth were aggregated, and which conducted practices not considered for the benefit of the public, were usually carried out by a very simple agreement, or by the formation of a combine, or by other methods, all of which were merely machinery for attaining the main thing, and that was the actual combination itself. The trust, or whatever was the particular mode of carrying out what was desired, was only the machinery. Mr Eddy points out in this book that within a comparatively late period the trusts had found it necessary in a somewhat small number of cases, to give effect to their purposes in carrying out injurious combinations, to form what were called holding companies-that is to say, companies the main object of which was to obtain certain shares in other companies. ' It is to that extent, and that only, that this Bill is Taking the going to deal with trusts and combinations y and to show how very indirectly relevant it is to trusts and combinations, we may take the speech of the Attorney-General himself, in which he attacked first the Coal Vend, and then the Sugar Company. I think those were the only instances in Australia with which he dealt. I should like to ask the Attorney-General, was there a corporation of the kind which I have mentioned in connection with the Coal Vend? Had the Vend instance, which he cited, anything to do with the additional powerssought to be given to this Parliament to deal with corporations? Absolutely nothing ! I was not engaged in that case myself, and I am not familiar withall the details; but I think I amright in saying that the agreement in* the Coal Vend case, whether right, or wrong, was merely an agreement betweea a number of companies or persons carrying on their own businesses to carry on those businesses in a particular way; and there was no corporation or company formed for the purpose of carrying out the purposesof a trust. So that the illustration which' the Attorney-General gave from the Vend case had no bearing directly or indirectly upon the subject of the Bill which he was introducing. He also mentioned the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. That againhad nothing whatever to do with this matter. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company was originally, and has always been, an ordi-' nary company carrying on a commercialbusiness. It may have been very successful. Personally, I know nothing about its affairs. Probably it has been very successful. ' By that means it has created, possibly, a very large interest, or what may beordinarily called a monopoly. I do not. know whether that is so or not. But if you had had power to deal with corporations as this Bill proposes, you would not have had one ounce more power to deal with the Colonial Sugar Refining Company than you have now. Therefore, boththe illustrations upon which the Attorney General relied, I venture to submit, withall respect to him, had nothing to do with, the Bill before the House.",42
178,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,They had more to do with the platform outside.,43
179,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes ; and in that - connection I may be pardoned for reading - a passage from Mr Eddy's book dealing with this very subject of corporate combinations. Mr Eddy may be taken to be undoubtedly the greatest authority on combinations and trusts in the world. He deals - with the rights of individuals, the rights of partnerships, the righfs of corporations to conduct large businesses in the ordinary method, and at nage 604 he makes use of slanguage to which I wish to direct the attention of the Attorney-General. He says The mere size of the combination is immaterial. Whether a corporation be capitalized at a small amount or a large amount, is as immaterial as is the wealth of an individual or the - resources of a partnership. The extent of the .resourcesThis is what I commend to the Attorney{Jeneralis not evidence of either wrong doing or right - doing. The association of two insignificant .individuals commanding no capital and no resources may be an unlawful combination, whereas - a partnership, or a corporation, having millions - at its command, may be an entirely lawful combination. 'With so much I think the Attorney-General will agree, because he has expressed that - view in his own speech. It is not the mere - fact of a combination that is the evil. It is a combination which possesses certain characteristics which tend towards the detriment of the public that is evil. Mr. Eddy goes on to sayIt is so easy to obscure right notions by the snse of sounding phrases, such as '""gigantic - aggregation,"" "" enormous combinations,"" "" vast aggregations of capital,"" "" huge monopolies,"" '&cThese phrases have all a familiar sound to - us.many such phrases might be culled from decisions in this connection-that it would be a wise - tule to rigidly exclude all such terms from the - discussion of the subject, for they mean nothing, .and lead to nothing except erroneous conclusions. The legality of a combination is not determined iby the use of epithets; it is a matter for sober --and serious investigation; it is a question of fact to be determined by weighing a mass of - evidence; it is not a matter that can be successfully disposed of by rhetoric. ' - With every word of that I cordially agree. - In this connection I was surprised to find the Attorney-General, in his second-read.ing speech, make what I am afraid was only a slightly veiled attack on the decisions of the High Court of Australia. It is a. great pity that the Attorney-General <of the Commonwealth should be found attacking the authority of the highest Court, which it is a prime part of his functions as Attorney-General to maintain in the respect of the people. It will be within the memory of honourable members that, even before the commencement of the session, the Attorney-General, in connection with the Vend case, published in the newspapers certain extracts from the judgment of Mr Justice Isaacs in the Court below, and from the judgment of the Court of Appeal. It was fairly apparent, I think, that that publication was not entirely for the purpose of enlightening the public as to the true meaning of the judgments of either the Court below or the Court of Appeal. All the Attorney-General's utterances during the debate on this particular Bill tend to confirm the impression that he desired to show, in regard to the Vend case, that Mr Justice Isaacs was right and that the Court of Appeal was wrong. I submit to the House that that is not the attitude that he should take up. I have always understood that in the very high position he occupies we should expect, not only a fair and complete measure of-justice from him for all the tribunals within his Department, but that it should be his special function to maintain those tribunals in the respect of the whole people. If the Bill before us were one for the purpose of enabling this Parliament to make a uniform company law> I think it would mett with the approval of all sections of the community, and supply a very necessarywant. It happens that now there is a good deal of confusion - In this comparatively small community, with a. population of less than 5,000,000 scattered over Australia, if it is desired to form a company to carry on operations in the various States the promoters have to submit themselves to six separate laws, and obtain registration under six different sets of regulations. This, of course, leads to considerable expense and confusion. It is necessary to take the advice, it may be, of solicitors and counsel in each particular State in order to make sure that the regulations cf each State are complied with. Then, with regard to the winding-up of companies, a still more serious difficulty arises, which is felt almost every day in commercial circles. When a company is unable to carry on business, and its affairs have to be wound up, not only does confusion arise under the existing law, but very often there is loss and injustice. The assets of a company which is being wound up have to be, to a considerable extent, separately administered in the various States, with separate receivers and liquidators; and the creditors in the various States have more or less conflicting rights in regard to the assets. They may have to prove in each particular liquidation; and an immense amount of - confusion and trouble, with actual loss, has occurred in consequence. If the desire were to make a uniform company law, which really is the main purpose, I think, to which this Bill ought to be directed, it could be done by merely using the words ""the creation, winding-up, and dissolution "" of corporations. When we use the words "" regulation and control,"" we claim that this Parliament shall have the right to make a separate code of laws for all Ihe businesses which are carried on by companies-law s distinct and separate, and, probably, inconsistent with the code applying to the same businesses carried on by .private individuals. I cannot conceive that any one who has had experience in business, and in the practical application of - constitutional principles, would desire to bring about such a state of things; but that is what this Bill will do. The Bill deals withCorporations formed under the law of a including their dissolution, regulation, and trol ; but not including municipal or governmental corporations, or any corporation formed solely for religious, charitable, scientific, or artistic purposes, and not for the acquisition gain by the corporation or its members. 1 know that I am discussing a subject which, to most honourable members, is not only extremely technical, but very dry and uninteresting; but it is none the less of the vastest importance to the business community throughout Australia, and it is my duty, as it is the duty of every lawyer in the House, to endeavour to make it as clear as possible.",43
180,Mr HIGGS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Is not an individual able to protect himself and his business, while a company law is required to protect shareholders ? Mr W. H. IRVINE - Certainly ; that is what I am pleading for. should do is to take power to do everything that is ordinarily included in company law. There are codes of company law in Great Britain, New South Wales, Victoria, and in every one of the other States ; and we ought to have power to make :i uniform law, as very essential and desirable. That is, a power which regulates the Creation, winding-up, and dissolution of Companies, but not their control throughout the whole of their operations. Perhaps I may explain the position by a metaphor. The company law acts as the midwife and undertaker, for it does not control or deal with the operations of the creature, or the entity, once it goes forth into the world. It is a proper part of company law to say what kind of companies may be registered, what kind of powers they may possess, and under what conditions companies ought to be brought to an end; but it is not part of the law to follow a company into its business, and, in every step in its career, subject it to particular forms of regulation. Let us take the example which has been so often used, namely, that of the licensing law. A company law enables persons to form and incorporate, it may be, an hotel company, and once that company is incorporated and launched on the world, in every arena it enters it must obey the law applicable to that arena-it must obey the licensing laws of the particular State where it carries on business. If a' company desires to carry on, say, the business of a draper, it must do so subject to the laws applicable to that business wherever it may be carried on. For instance, there State, may be State laws as to the opening and conclosing hours; and I should imagine that it is highly desirable that all persons or companies who carry on the business of a of draper, or a grocer, ought to obey the same laws in this respect. So long as the local Parliament is left with the power of regulation in regard to, say, the hours of opening and closing, then every shopkeeper, whether a company or an individual, ought to comply with the law, for otherwise there must be infinite confusion. If there be two laws, or two law-making authorities, one set of persons carrying on a business will have to close at one hour, and another .set of persons, though carrying on the same business, and dealing with the same class of people, may have to close at another hour. That is another illustration, of which Mr Justice Higgins gave What we so many in the Huddart Parker case. The theory is that the power to make laws in regard to corporations is mei-cly a power to create and launch a kind of artificial person; and the company may be limited by the memorandum of association in the kind of business carried on. By legislation we may impose all kinds of conditions on the bringing of a company into existence, but, once it is in existence, and allowed to enter on manufacture, trade-,. or any other field of commerce, it ought to obey the State or local laws applicable to the business. A law dealing with corporations which would enable us to control the creation, winding-up, and dissolution of corporations-in other words, with everything included in what is known as company law-woul d be sufficient. It would enable us to meet the only evil that really exists, namely, the absence of uniformity. To add the words "" regulation and control "" enables this Parliament, not merely to deal with company law, but to make a separate code of laws for every kind of business which a company created by it , or which a company created under any of the State laws, may enter upon in any part of Australia.",44
181,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Mus t there not be some protection for those who invest their money in companies? Mr VV. H . IRVINE - What kind of protection can we give except that afforded by a proper company law ? power we should take is one to pass such a law ; in other words, speaking technically, to make laws as to the creation, windingup, and dissolution of companies.",45
182,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If we had power to pass a company law, could we not pass laws to regulate companies ? Mr VV. H . IRVINE - No .",45
183,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Unde r such a law, would not abuses creep in , as in the case of the trusts ?",45
184,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We could impose any conditions we chose on the registration; indeed, we might go so far as to say we would not allow any company at all to be registered. If we thought, for instance, that the power to form companies was used, not merely for ordinary trading and financial purposes, but was used, or was likely to be used, sometimes for the formation of illegal trusts and combinations, by creating companies with power to hold shares in other companies-the usual method in the United States-Parliament, if it possessed the power I suggest, might enact that no company should be incorporated, the memorandum of association of which permitted it to hold shares in that way.",45
185,Mr CARR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Coul d we discrirninate in that manner? Mr VV. H . IRVINE - Yes ; we could dictate the terms of registration, and, if we found that certain powers were being used in a certain way, we could determine that the company should not have those powers, though I do not say it would De wise for us to do so.",45
186,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That can be done under the present company laws of the States. Mr VV. H . IRVINE - Certainly . In taking power to regulate all the conditions attecting the creation of companies and the rights with which they are to be invested,, we shall do all that is necessary to effect our purpose; but to go beyond that, and empower this Parliament to regulate the business of companies as distinct from the business of individuals will lead to absurdity, and to mischievous and dangerousconditions, under which we are sure to haveconflicting codes of law applicable to the same business. It would be in the highest degree unwise to attempt to invest this Parliament with power to make separate codes of laws with regard to companies,, regulating every phase of the business they may be conducting. If you leave to the States the power to make general laws as The only to licensing, shop closing, sanitary conditions, and other matters with which they have now power to deal, every business,, whether carried on by an individual or a corporation, must obey those laws. Can it be said that this Parliament, when given power to legislate in a. particular way, will never exercise that power? If it does exercise it, its legislation will be sure to conflict with State legislation, and to lead to the confusion pointed to in the judgment to which I have referred. Honourable members should consider whether what we are asked to do is wise, and, above all, should disabuse their minds of the impression created by the speech of the Attorney-General, that the Bill is directly connected with trusts and combines. That is not so, though there is an indirect connection with certain classes of companies, which, so far as I have known, have never been formed in Australia, though they might be formed here-companie s formed for the purpose of holding shares in other companies. It is these companies that have been used as one of the numerous instruments for carrying into effect the powers of corporations. We can pass a corporation law, and limit in any way which we think fit the powers given to companies. But a great deal more than that is asked for. The Bill is intended to empower this Parliament to enter into the life of these companies, to regulate every act they do, and to substitute for the State law applicable to their transactions the law' of this Parliament, which ismot to be applied to all the other persons ^engaged in the same business. We might have had from the Attorney-General some - explanation of the legal aspects of the sure. He should not force it through the House, and through the country, as doubt he will attempt to do, as a measure which has something to do with trusts and combines, since it has only the most reof mote connection with them. You may have .all the power you need for dealing trusts and combines, if you choose to take it, without being required to take make a separate code for companies and another code for individuals. Mr. JOSEPH COOK [ 4 . 0 ] - I wish to correct one or two sions created by the Attorney-General's has kept back the facts. speech. It is apparent that his utterances ; have been delivered, not to elucidate - very abstruse. questions relating to trusts put of New South Wales. and combines and other matters, but to get these proposals accepted at the referendum as part of the political propaganda of the Labour party. In almost every speech 'has come back to the subject of trusts - combines, and particularly to the Vend case, which was recently dealt with in the - Courts, but he has hardly made a statement - regarding the operations of the Vend which is literally and strictly correct. For stance, he began by alleging that it sents an absolute control of the output - coal. Every one in New South VVales tible knows that that statement is entirely wide of the mark, and that it is hardly possible, under present circumstances, to have a coal - combine in that State. There are three coal mining districts in the State.",45
187,Mr CANN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,And a Vend for each distheir trict.,46
188,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Yes . Would the honourable member say that the Western trict Vend should be dissolved?,46
189,Mr CANN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,No .,46
190,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Would the honhas orable member say that it is not a good thing? One would imagine, from speech of the Attorney-General, that Coal Vends are abominable, and should be .abolished at the earliest possible moment. What are the facts? Each of the Vends years. has been forced into being by the miners' organizations. There was almost a strike at Newcastle in the effort to get a vend established there; and the reason why coal is not more than n s . 'a ton at the pit's mouth today is that the employers have realteration. sisted the efforts of the miners to put »he price. A conference was, I believe, a while ago with a view to compelling the masters to increase the price of coal, but they declared that the outside competition meawould not permit it to be done. The At torney-General would have it believed that no the Vends are purely a device of the employers for forcing up prices, when, as a matter of fact, they are due to the demands the miners for protection from the strife and competition which were leading to the with reduction of their wages.",46
191,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Why have we to pay 248. power to a ton for coal in Melbourne?,46
192,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I suppose the difference is made up in middleman's (Parramatta) charges and costs of transport' My present impresobject is to show that the Attorney-General I am not defending the present price of coal. the No one combine controls the coal outThe three coal-producing districts of the State are in competition, and, if it came to a pinch, the western and southern districts could probhe ably be sufficiently developed to meet the and trade demands of New South Wales within a short time. With these three districts in competition there can be no corner in coal. The bulk of the Newcastle coal is sent abroad to compete against the coal of other inparts of the world, and it is the same with repremuch of the southern coal. The coal inof dustry of New South Wales is not suscepto the influences which affect the oil industry and other industries in America. There is no trust in coal in New South Wales. All you have there are trade agreements between masters and men, so that the miners may get a fair remuneration for labour, and the masters a fair return for their capital. Not one representative of the coal districts would lay a finger on Disthe Vends, because they know that the miners would not permit that to be done. The object of the miners in recent years been to make the Vends increase the price of coal, because the hewing rate in the creases in accordance with a sliding scale these as the price of coal increases.",46
193,Mr CANN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is not so in the west. There they have a fixed rate for three Mr. JOSEPH COOK\- Have they altered the sliding scale recently?,46
194,Mr CANN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes , last January.",46
195,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I suppose that they have done better for themselves by the The miners have agreed with up the masters that after the increase in the held price of coal of recent years, rates shall. be fixed for three years, so that there is no hope of getting cheaper coal in that period. If the Vends in the Newcastle and southern districts said to the miners, "" Will you agree to take another 4d. per ton in wages, and allow us to fix the price of coal for tbree years at 12 s.?"" the miners - would jump at the proposal.",46
196,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Would the honourable member object to having £200 a year added to his salary?,47
197,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am not objecting to the vend arrangement, which is fair and business-like, and, so far as I know, speaking from a long experience, the only one that will guarantee to the miners fair remuneration for the hard work that they do. Honourable members should read the statements of the Attorney-General in the light of the facts which I have just related. His rhodomontade needs to be corrected before we can have any real debate on this question. What does the Attorney-General say of the Vend? He saysIt is not disputed that the Vend controlled oyer go per cent, of the trade, and that the ping Combine controlled over go per cent, of the carriage. It was proved in evidence the persons who controlled 90 per cent, of the bourne. coal trade agreed with those who controlled 90 per cent, of the carriage; that the coal companies agreed not to sell to any ping Combine, and the combine agreed not to carry any coal save that belonging to the Vend. That statement needs to be corrected, because it has nothing whatever to do with the oversea trade in coal, and relates only to the Inter-State portion of the Newcastle trade.",47
198,Mr CANN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,And to oversea trade as well.,47
199,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Does the honourable member say that the Inter-State shipping companies deal with all the coal that goes abroad ? Does he say that their vessels carry the coal which goes abroad? Why, half the coal from the north does not go near the Inter-State shipping companies, but goes direct to markets oversea. Therefore, there is competition even so far as the shipping of the coal is concerned.",47
200,Mr CANN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Northern Vend controls it all the same.,47
201,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"What I complain of is these half statements on the part of the Attorney-General, who would lead people to believe that the miners are under the heel of these Vends, when, as a matter of fact, they are the head and front of them, the foundation of them, the mo^ tive power which called them into existence. He saidThis, therefore, was an agreement which affected intimately the interests of the whole of the citizens in four of the States of the Commonwealth. That, again, is an absolute misrepresentation, for, as I have already shown, half the coal from the north goes oversea, nearly the whole of the coal from the south goes oversea, while the bulk of the coal fiom the west does not go near the sea at all. So that the Attorney-General's statement is an absolute misrepresentation of the facts of the case regarding this precious VendHe went on to sayOne of the consequences was that coal was raised from 14s. per ton to 24s. per ton. The agreement restrained trade to the uttermost point. I deny that absolutely, and there is not a mining member of this House* who will subscribe to the statement that it restrains trade to the uttermost point. Honourable members know that the very contrary is the case.",47
202,Mr CHARLTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The price of coal was increased by only 3s. per ton in NewShipcastle, but it was increased ios. per tonthat that is, from 14s. to 24s. per ton-in Mel",47
203,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That was nob but the Shipthe fault of the Coal Vend. The Attorney-General also saidTwo companies attempted to defy this combine; both went into liquidation. . . . It was not disputed that, when the South Australian Government grew restive under the monopoly, and attempted to start a coal mine of its own, the Vend took measures to prevent it doing so by influencing the Legislative Council. It was not denied that a sum of money was paid to get inserted in the press false information with that intent. . . . It was proved that no competition existed. That is an absolute misstatement again. There is competition of the keenest kind going on today-the competition of the world, as a matter of fact-as to half the coal from the north, and, as to the balance, there is the competition of the south and west with the north.",47
204,Mr RILEV,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,There is no competition in the south.,47
205,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Attorney General's statement is that there is no competition in the coal trade, and I am pointing out that that is an absolute misstatement of fact. There is competition, and there must always be competition between the north and the south and between the west and the south with the north. Here are the allegations of the Attorney-General concerning the Vend. Now listen to what he instructed Mr Wise to say in the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court. After having declared that the Vend controls 90 per cent, of the trade, that it has been bribing people, that it is a complete monopoly, and that it is the worse thing in the world, he instructed Mr Wise to say of itI t may be convenient here to say that this is not a prosecution against the Coal Vend. We are raising no question as to the legality or propriety of an arrangement between the colliery proprietors to regulate their trade by fixing a declared price. That is all they have ever done in the Newcastle district. The Attorney-General has given his best blessing to both the shipping combination and the Coal Vend. He has declared them both to be good combines necessary for the purpose of securing good conditions both for the men engaged on the sea and in the mines. What we say is that the Vend was formed in 1906. and is being attacked now for fixing excessive prices for coal. Will the honourable member for Newcastle say that ns. per ton is an excessive price for coal? I challenge him to say that it is, as was alleged by Mr Wise, instructed by the Attorney-General.",47
206,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,How does the honourable member connect the Attorney-General with Mr Wise's statements?,48
207,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"He instructed Mr Wise, and engaged him to appear for the Government.",48
208,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,And is he supposed to father every word that Mr Wise uttered ?,48
209,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"This Vend, in my opinion, is doing no harm today in Newcastle. It is doing a very reasonable thing by the public, and by all concerned. So fair and reasonable is it that the miners of Newcastle today, whose hewing rate is always based upon the selling price of coal, are receiving no higher rate than they received twenty-five years ago. has been lowered in the interim, and the miners had to threaten to strike to get the rate put up again. It was they who forced this combination on the part of the colliery proprietors in order that they might receive a fair and reasonable wage. Attorney-General made another statement which it is worthwhile to correct. After quoting Mr Deakin in connection with new Protection, he spoke in general terms, and [228] did not relate his comment to the set of circumstances which existed some years before. He saidTake the new Protection policy first. They do not propose to give a fair and reasonable wage to the workmen engaged in an unprotected industry, and, therefore, we shall not secure uniform industrial conditions. Nor do they propose to protect the consumer in an unprotected industry, consequently a fair and: reasonable price cannot be fixed for all things,, but only some. They do not propose to deal with trusts, combines, and monopolies in manufacture. Now what are the facts ? When the honourable member for Ballarat, prior to the last election, declared the policy of his Government, this is what he said I must now pass on to the great issues re« lating to the new Protection. These also depend very much upon our ascertainment of all the facts surrounding, our industries. New Protection, as you know, seeks to secure fair conditions to all those employed in industries which receive the care of the State. I now use the word "" care"" in a wider sense than "" protection,"" because we propose that the new Protection shall not be limited to ""protected"" iadustries. Yet the Attorney-General has represented that we proposed to limit the new Protection to protected industries, notwithstanding that the declaration of the policy of the late Government by the honourable member for Ballarat expressed the very contrary in the clearest possible terms.",48
210,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Attorney-General was dealing with the memorandum.,48
211,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member for Ballarat continuedWe desire to establish fair conditions in all industries in Australia, whether subject to fiscal Protection or not. Fair hours, fair wages, and fair conditions of employment are now seen to be matters of grave national concern. That is as far as I need quote at the present time, and it is a"" complete contradiction of the statement of the Attorney-General. He says that we do not propose to deal with trusts, combines, and monopolies, but when similar proposals were before the House two years ago, we made a proposition which, if it had been agreed It to by the other side, would have resulted in an effective proposal for dealing with trusts and combines being the law of the land today. It is only because of the obstinacy of honourable members opposite, and their refusal to accept the slightest Then the amendment of their proposals, that we are faced with the position confronting us today.",48
212,Mr MATHEWS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member must know that that is not correct.,48
213,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I know that it is correct.,49
214,Mr THOMAS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,If the Opposition had agreed with us we should now be able to settle the difficulty.,49
215,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We do not agree with my honourable friends. VVe cannot approve of a proposal to tear up the Constitution, and throw it into the cauldron, without knowing exactly how it is going to come out. As to many of these matters, we have all along expressed our intention to deal with them in some reasonable and business-like way. We say that we do ' not desire to make an ordinary, reasonable, beneficial corporation the football of party politics, as our honourable friends opposite desire to make it. The power they are asking for would enable them to deal with all sorts of innocent and beneficial combinations; it would enable them to deal with butter factories, than which I can conceive of no more reasonable form of combination from the point of view of the man on the land. The Government wish to ; be able to deal with all sorts of combinations, and to declare them monopolies - whether the facts fit the case or not. We say that we cannot follow them in the rabid, unreasoning course which they insist . upon taking. There are some further statements of the j Attorney-General to which I should like to refer if time permitted of my doing so. .There is a question which I wish to ask in this connection : The Attorney-General told us the other day, as he did a number of .times before, that he does not know the .extent of the powers he is asking for, what ,they will include, or what they will not include. Moreover, he saysWe come forward without a scheme or plan of any cut-and-dried - character. There is no such plan. The honourable gentleman has no plan defining the limitations of the power he seeks. He teils us very plainly that he does not .propose to limit the power he desires to take. He will take the lot. He says, further, that he does not know what he is going to do with it when he gets it. He says, in another place, that he does not know . whether he is proposing to fake too much or enough power, and there is no plan in his mind in asking for . these powers. He . is asking the people of Australia to put these proposals into the melting-pot, and how they will come out, and what powers they will confer upon the Government, he says plainly that he does not know. Is it not time that the honourable gentleman did know where he is trying to take this House and the country? The man who goes to the country and says, "" I have no plan for constitutional alteration,"" is asking the country to treat him with derision and ridicule. There must be a plan. The people will want to know what the Government are going to do with these powers, and how far they will take them, before they surrender the present Constitution, and permit it to be torn and mauled about in the way proposed by the Government. One thing the Attorney-General is clear about is that he is going to regulate prices and profits. Here, again, there are not two honourable members on the other side who tell anything like the same story. Senator E. J. Russell, talking the other night, said he had heard of no proposition for the regulation of retail prices : but I venture to say there is today as much controlling of retail prices as of wholesale prices throughout Australia. If the Government are not going to control retail prices how are they to guarantee that the consumer will get his goods at a fair price? How are they to guarantee when they have gone into the warehouse or the factory in which production begins, and arranged prices there, that the retailer will give the consumer the goods at a fair price unless they follow the goods through the operations of the retail market ?",49
216,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Knowin g the wholesale prices, people will know what the retail prices should be.",49
217,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Senato r Russell says that he does not know. Does the honourable member for Maribyrnong contend that we do not know wholesale prices today?,49
218,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The . great, bulk of the people do not.",49
219,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Will the honourable member tell me of any commodity the wholesale price of which is not known today? Will he tell me of a staple food of which the wholesale price is not published every day in the newspapers?,49
220,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The people take a lot of notice of the newspapers. I have known them to be shillings out in the price of a cwt. of butter.,49
221,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Will the honourable member, who knows so much about these things, tell me that the farmers and fruit-growers do not study the market prices every day and shape their actions according to the reports of those prices which they see in the newspapers ? I do not say that they do not obtain other information. They get information from their agents; but there is not one of them who does not study his newspaper day by day, note the record of wholesale prices, and shape his action accordingly. It is idle for the honourable member to say that wholesale prices are not known. They are known as well as are retail prices. But we do not know yet. what the Attorney-General has in his mind.",49
222,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Where will the honourable member find the wholesale prices for clothing and boots?,50
223,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"All I know about boots at the present time is that those concerned in their manufacture are telling us that they must have more Protection, and their prices must be much higher than they are now, if they are to pay the awards of 'the Arbitration Court. The honourable member for Cook knows that much about boots.",50
224,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable gentleman does not know the wholesale price of boots.,50
225,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I know that the retail price is higher than it was some time ago.,50
226,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,There is competition in retail prices.,50
227,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It is not just now bringing about any reduction in those prices. They are going steadily up the whole time, in spite of the competition. to vvhich the honourable member refers. It is one of the things which clearly disproves the contentions of honourable members opposite that our prices today are controlled by rings and combines.",50
228,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,So they are.,50
229,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Is the retail price of boots determined by rings and combines ? M.r. WEST - Everythin g in the building trade is controlled by combines.,50
230,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Does not the honourable member for East Sydney know that the price of three-fifths of everything we eat, drink, and wear at the present time is controlled by some sort of agreement? How could the retail business of Sydney today be carried on without some form of agreement? Does not the honourable menfber know that the retailers have their associations, rules, and regulations to guide them in the control of their businesses? As I say, they could not [228]- 2 get along without them. The same thing applies to every trade and business. Those engaged in the trade to which the honourable member for East Sydney belongs have an understanding, and regulate trade prices, to which they all subscribe. In this way the very details of almost every trade and business are regulated and controlled. I fail to' see how it could be otherwise. The conditions of trade and business today are so' complex, intricate, and interdependent that it is impossible to successfully carry on any enterprise without some understanding or agreement. Are we to say that all these understandings, agreements, trade regulations, conditions and customs are bad, and that they all represent so many conspiracies to put up the price of goods to the consumer?",50
231,Mr WEST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What else are they?,50
232,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Does the honorablo member suggest that they should all be abolished? All those who are associated with trade agreements may be said to represent corporations in broad outline, and do honourable members opposite propose to take power to interfere and tinker with all the details of retail as well as wholesale businesses? If they do, I wonder what a time they have before them, and who will have to suffer in consequence.",50
233,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Who will believe that sort of talk?,50
234,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It is up to the honourable member for Hindmarsh and the Attorney-General to tell us what they meanby the '' fixation'of prices.'' No one has told us, as yet, what they mean by that term. They have not told us, either, what they are going to do in the way of limiting profits. The Attorney-General says, "" We are going to fix wages and conditions, prices, and profits; but we have no plan.'' He offers the country a. blank cheque' to sign. He says to the electors, "" Fill it up and sign it. What we shall do with it i ' do not know, and cannot tell. I have nothing at the back of my mind at present that I care to reveal.""",50
235,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Attorney-General never said that.,50
236,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is the honourable gentleman's attitude. What he has said I will repeat for the information cf the honourable memberWe come forward with a scheme or plan of no cut and dried character. There is no such. plan. We say that, by the process of evolution, the people must come to their own. What that means I do not know. I want people to come to their own; every man has the right to the full amount of his own. ""But what is meant here exactly? The Attorney-General impliedly says that the only way in which the people can come to their own is through this amendment of the Constitution, and it is up to him therefore to detail the plan by which this coming to their own. is to take place per medium of the Constitution.",50
237,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,You want all the Bills in detail laid upon the table?,51
238,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I do not want anything of the sort. When the Attorney General tells the country that he is going to regulate prices he has the right to state in outline at any rate how it is to be done.,51
239,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"--Tak e the harvester industry. We regulated the prices, did we not?",51
240,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes , and my honourable friends did a fine thing about the harvesters altogether. If I belonged to the party opposite, I should not talk very much about that case. They were warned well what was likely to happen when the Bill was going through the House, but they laughed at the warning, and the sequel justified our prediction. It is by the regulation of profits lation of prices alone that we can hope for any solution of this problem. There is no other solution, therefore, to our labour and other problems. regulation that the Attorney-General wants why does he need six Bills? is talking of regulation here in his suave tones his colleagues go up to Newcastle and say that there is only one way out of the difficulty, and that is nationalization.",51
241,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,In some cases.,51
242,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is what the Minister of Defence said at Newcastle the other night.,51
243,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is what we all say.,51
244,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Do I understand that all honourable members on the other side say that there is no other solution to all these problems than nationalization?,51
245,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Nationalizatio n in some cases and regulation in others.,51
246,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Which , for instance, are my friends going to nationalize and which do they propose to regulate? Again, they do not tell us. They cannot give us a leading line at all. They say again that they have no plan. They talk in big, vague language. It is a very serious proposition for them to seek to undo the whole Constitution, to maul the whole document right out of its balance, when they cannot tell the public exactly what they want to do it for.",51
247,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,You want Legislative Councils.,51
248,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Do I?,51
249,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,You r statement on the South African Constitution shows that you do.,51
250,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member had better read what I did say.,51
251,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I did read the statement very carefully, and I cannot find anything else in it.",51
252,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member will find that I showed that in South Africa the States nominate the members of the Senate, and that our Senate, which he is going to put in control of these democratic proposals, is a more Conservative and less Democratic body in its constitution today than is any Upper House in Australia.",51
253,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes , there you are.",51
254,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,^-Our Senate is a more Conservative and less Democratic body in its constitution than is any Upper and the regu- House in Australia:,51
255,Mr RILEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Will you do away with the Senate? Mr. JOSEPH COOK;- I have already If it is only said that if these proposals are carried there will begin a demand for a modificaWhile he tion of the Senate. There' must be more democratic supervision of these things if they are to come from the control of the States into the control of the Federation.,51
256,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,If 'we had these powers without the same balance as there is in South Africa it would be wrong-is that the argument?,51
257,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member has not followed that speech of mine at all, I am afraid; in fact, he shows that he has not.",51
258,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It is a Conservative balance that you want.,51
259,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No , it is a Democratic balance that I want.",51
260,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Like that in South Africa.,51
261,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No , certainly hot. If my honourable friends *are going to unify these powers, then let them unify the control of the powers, and do not let the States retain control in the Senate on the present unequal basis. If they are going to unify the functions, then let them unify the powers. That is my position. It is an outrage on their Democratic principles for my honourable friends to put these national powers, so-called, taken from the States, into the hands of a State Rights Senate, where one man counts for as much as nine others. There is just one other point I wish to make. The. Attorney-General warned us that it is of no use to expect that they can do anything at all under the present Constitution, and with our existing powers. Let no one imagine for a moment that amendment of the Australian Anti-Trust Act to trusts. can affect the position. Was the honourable and learned member playing a part then, when, in 1910, he got the Parliament to amend the Anti-Trust Act ? - Was he indulging in a piece of sheer hypocrisy when he asked the House to give him further powers so as to deal with these trusts? Was he playing a part when he came down and got power to compel the trusts to prove that they were not acting detrimentally to the public? That was the power which he'sought in 1910. - Mr ARCHIBALD - He was making the best of a bad job. - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - The Attorneythere General does not know whether he was making the best of a bad job or a good he ...does not know anything about the matter, for the simple reason that he not tried to put the amending Act into operation. It is a dead letter statute-book so far, because the honourable and learned member has never pluck to put it into operation. Why should he not? That Act was passed long before the Vend case began.",51
262,Mr ROBERTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,No ; the proceedings had been started before we got into office.,52
263,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The proceedselling ings were not started.,52
264,Mr ROBERTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Now , do not contradict all the members on your side.",52
265,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The'firs t hearing in the case took place in Sydney 13th April, 1911, and the amending Act was passed in 1910, so that for half-a-year at the very least the Act had been on statute-book before the Attorney-General began the actual proceedings in connection with the trust.",52
266,Mr ROBERTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"All the members on your side have been claiming that the proceedtorney-General, ings were started before you left office. ' (Corporations) Bill. "" 6293 Mr. JOSEPH COOK. - I am talking abouta point from which the Attorney General could have got back. I submit that Up to the time the case came before the Court the Attorney-General could have wiped the whole proceedings out, and begun again under his own Act of 1910, but he chose to proceed under the old Act, with more limited power than the one which he passed through the House. Despite the fact that the amending Act has never been tested in any way, and having worked with more limited powers, the Attorne^ 1 General came down the other day and said that nobody imagined that we could do anyany thing under the powers we possess relating The Attorney-General and the Government aire playing a part, showing themselves to be insincere and hypocritical in their attitude to trusts and combines, or they would have strained every nerve to use the drastic powers which Parliament gave them in 1910. It is idle for the honourable and learned gentleman to say that he can do nothing before he has tried. He comes here and says, "" This Vend is a fearful thing. This Vendj in its relation to the Shipping Combine of Australia, is a monopoly. It is controlling, fleecing, bribing, doing everything which it ought to be stopped from doing."" My reply is that is not an honourable member that comes from the coal districts who would one; interfere with the prices fixed - by the Vend. On the contrary, there is not one has of those honourable gentlemen who would not support the Vend in putting the selling on the price up still further.",52
267,Mr RILEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Oh , nonsense ! Coal has had the never been dearer here.",52
268,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member says that my remark is nonsense, but I am getting back on facts, which he had better do, too. I repeat that the Newcastle miners have tried to force a higher price in order to get a higher hewing rate for themselves.",52
269,Mr RILEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,And you say that they would force the selling price still higher?,52
270,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"There is only on one way in which the miners can get a higher rate under the agreement they have with the proprietors. I am speaking all the the time of the sliding scale which has been in the Newcastle district almost from time immemorial. The miners cannot get any more unless the selling price of coal does go up; It is this Vend which the Atafter blessing it a year or so ago, now turns round to curse in the most unmeasured terms he can find. It is this Vend, too, and the Shipping Combine, and the agreement between the two bodies, that he today is leaving untouched rather than put the more drastic powers he possesses into active operation against them.",52
271,Mr RILEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"How is it that the Newcastle men voted for the last referendum to control these Vends which you say they want to back up now? Mr..JOSEPH COOK - For one reason alone, which the honourable member knows as well as I do, and that is with the view of nationalizing the coal and iron mines of Australia.",53
272,Mr RILEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes , and then there would be cheaper coal for everybody - Let",53
273,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member knows that?,53
274,Mr RILEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes , I do.",53
275,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The miners, therefore, did not vote against this Vend until such time as they could get a national vend of their own.",53
276,Mr RILEY,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,They know that they are on right ground.,53
277,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We are talking about controlling things. The proposal before the House at present is to control, and the nationalization proposal will come forward later. If the purpose of my honourable friends ultimately is to nationalize, they ought not to be hypocritical. They ought to have one Bill alone, and that is a Bill providing for the nationalization of large industrial enterprises. That would be straightforward. There is not one of them who will go into the country districts and tell the people that they want to shape their actions so as to nationalize the indus- presents tries which affect the people there, and as to which they stand related fer their living. They tell a different tale when they go to the country districts.",53
278,Mr CANN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Did you not advocate the nationalization of a coal mine?,53
279,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,No .,53
280,Mr CANN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,You did not?,53
281,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No ; the trouble with the honourable member, who is so aggressive in his attitude, is that he not been where he is now very long, and does not know anything about what I did or did not do.",53
282,Mr CANN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I know more about it than you do at present.,53
283,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The . honourable member keeps on saying that, but he only keeps on proving his ignorance by his interjections.",53
284,Mr CANN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,There is no sliding scale there now.,53
285,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It has been altered recently, then?",53
286,Mr CANN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,You did not know about that?,53
287,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It has been altered within the last twelve months?,53
288,Mr CANN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes , and you did not know about it .",53
289,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member knows all about it now, I am sure. me repeat my points. First, the facts alleged by the Attorney-General concerning the Vend are that a reasonable price is only now being paid for the hewing of this coal. But he is not putting into operation the powers which he has, nor has he tried to do so, because he says that it would be of no use. He asked the House to give him further power, but he has never once tried to use the power he has. He told us, further, that while he is asking for these large powers, which mean the destruction of the Federal idea in the Constitution, he has no plan or purpose in connection with what he is doing.",53
290,Mr CHARLTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What additional power has he that he should put in operation against the Vend?,53
291,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No matter what additional powers he obtains, if he is going to the Court he will have to get the Court to decide the facts of the case which be",53
292,Mr CHARLTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,But the honourable member says that the Attorney-General has now some power that he has not put in operation.,53
293,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I refer to the Act of 1910.,53
294,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,How much better off is he under that Act?,53
295,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not suppose that he would be in a much better position so far as the prosecution of the has Vend is concerned. The Attorney-General says, however, that there are thirty-three of these trusts. Is he going to balk at thirty-two others because the facts in connection with one are declared by the Court to be contrary to what he says they are?",53
296,Mr BENNETT,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It was the member for Angas who said that there were thirty-three trusts.,54
297,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I take it that the Attorney-General agreed with that statement, otherwise he would not have quoted it. The Attorney-General saidCompetition is dead or dying in more than half of the industrial and commercial field today. . . . Amongst the commodities which are subject to business arrangements are oilkerosene and all subsidiary oils-bricks , tobacco, confectionery, shoe machinery, manures, trucks, photographic materials, certain proprietary articlesI suppose that he is going to nationalize the little pill nextHour, meats, jams, wheat, certain lines of dairy produce, dried fruits, galvanized iron, and timber. It is not long since the honourable gentleman told a deputation of fruit-growers from Mildura that he thought their combine was an excellent one. He spoke in the same way of the Shipping Vend and of the Coal Vend. He bestows his blessings on these Vends in one breath, and in the next tells us of their sinister features, and asserts that they are acting as octopi upon the community, and must be curtailed or destroyed in some way. Which of these thirty-three Vends has he tried to attack since he has been in office?",54
298,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,He has no power to,54
299,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"How does he know until he has tried? If he has power, why did he pass the Bill of 1910? quite wrong. Was he simply playing a part when he said that he intended to put that Bill operation ?",54
300,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Something had to done to test our power.,54
301,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Why has he not tested our power under that Act? Although he has been in office for two and a half years he has tried it in only one case, though we are told that there are thirtyhim. three trusts.",54
302,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable ber for Angas says that they come only within the jurisdiction of the States.,54
303,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I was going to point out that as to twenty-nine of that is so, but the Attorney-General has deait with only one of the remaining four. We have had a Labour Government in New South Wales for two years. Why have they not investigated the doings of one the trusts coming within their jurisdiction? What is Mr Scaddan doing in Western (honourable Australia that he has not brought some of them before the Court? What did Mr. Verran do during all the years he was in office? If these trusts are menacing our social existence, why are the Labour Governments neglecting their duties to such an extent that they will not even try to prosecute them? If the Federal Labour Government had made an earnest effort to deal with these trusts, one could understand their appeal for these fresh powers. They would then be perfectly consistent; but until they have tried to put their existing powers into operation they have no right to say, "" We desire these fundamental alterations in the Constitution, although we have no plan in view; cannot tell what we are going to do, and do not even know how much power we are going to take. These are the powers we want; what we shall do with them hereafter must remain for this Government and this party to determine."" That is the attitude of the Government, but before these referenda proposals are disposed .of the people will want to know exactly what the Attorney General is going to do with these powers if he gets them. It will be no recommendation to his propaganda that he has to confess to the people that, although there have been four State Labour Governments in office almost ever since he has been in power, not one Government has tried to touch any trust; with the exception of the Coal Vend. no Mr ROBERTS - The honourable member is",54

308,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"In New South memWales the Labour Government are nationalizing all sorts of things, but instead of bringing down prices, they are putting them up. The efforts of my honourable friends them opposite are amusing in the extreme. "" Feebleness "" does not properly describe their attitude. This brave Government, which was going to do great deeds two and .1 half years ago, can point to the investiof gation of only one so-called Trust. The particulars relating to that case were prepared for them by their predecessors, aud three Justices of the High Court have said that the Vend is doing nothing unreasonable.",54
309,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That was the decision of two Justices. It was given as the judgment of the Court on the casting vote of the Chief Justice.,55
310,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"In other words, it was a majority decision. After all, it is only a majority that controls business in this Parliament; but they control it pretty effectively. I guess that as to some of the proposals that are brought forward here only a minority in the House as a whole believes in them. Here is a case in point. While they are legislating in this way from time to time to regulate and control industrial enterprises, they are going out and telling the world at large, "" There is no use legislating in regard to these monopolies. The only effectual action is to nationalize them.""",55
311,Mr LAIRD SMITH,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Hear , hear !",55
312,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am glad to hear those "" Hear, hears !"" They show that honourable members opposite do not expect very much from this proposition. Therefore, until they say what plan of action they intend to follow when these powers are secured-ho w they are going to shape them, and the extent to which they intend to go-the people of this country will answer, as they did before- "" Use the powers you have. Bring into operation the Act that you have never tried at all. Use that Act which you have placed on the statute-book, and never once tried to put into operation. When you have made the best use of the powers that you possess, you can come to us for others, and we shall clothe the National Parliament with attributes of efficiency such as . will enable it to curb and control all these vast, sinister organizations which you say are menacing the people of Australia, as they have menaced the people of other parts of the world.""",55
313,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Cook) [5.5] Those who have had the advantage, or disadvantage, of listening to the honourable member for Parramatta oyer nny period of time become familiar with the lines upon which he bases his criticism. I venture to say that every speecli which he has made while sitting in Opposition has been constructed upon the same plan. He begins with endless quibbling, and then proceeds to strain the language of his opponent until it has all the effect of deliberate misrepresentation.",55
314,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I rise to order. The honourable member is now alleging that I always engage in deliberate misrepresentation. Those words are very offensive.,55
315,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"If the honourable member used the words "" deliberate misiepresentation,"" he must withdraw them.",55
316,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,What I said was that the honourable member so strained the language of his opponents that his action had all the effect of deliberate misrepresentation.,55
317,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Then the honourable member was not out of order. Mr. JOSEPH ""COOK - Cit e a fact which I have deliberately strained.",55
318,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We can take every speech that the honourable member makes in opposition and find in it a straining of the language of his opponents which has all the effect of deliberate misrepresentation.,55
319,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Giv e us a case in point.,55
320,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Does the honourable member wish me to deal with the miles of ranting in which he indulges in this House? It would be impossible for me to do so within the time limit imposed on our speeches. One would need to start on the ist January, and even then he would not finish before the 31st December. Another feature of the honourable member's speeches in Opposition is that his criticism is entirely destructive, and that he has not a constructive idea of any description. According to him, everything - is right with the world. There are no wrongs to be redressed. Then again, when one directs attention to the character of the speech he has delivered, the honourable member uniformly denies either what he said, or the effect of his statement. A careful examination of the honourable, member's speeches will show that they come within these cardinal headings. Let me summarize them. The speeches of the* honourable member for Parramatta are constructed on the following plan :. 1. Endless quibbling. 2. Straining the language of his opponents until the effect of deliberate misrepresentation is produced. . 3. Destructiveness-n o helpful suggestions to meet existing evils. 4. A denial of the existence of public disabilities 5. Should a need for remedial legislation be pressed home, objection to the manner in which the difficulty is to be met. 6. When faced with the plain meaning and logic of his position, a general denial of his own utterances. The honourable member referred to the oalanceof power in the South African Constitution. It had been said in this House that the power of the National Parliament of South Africa was much larger and wider than is the power with which this Parliament is vested. No one reading the honourable member's speech, in which he sought to point out the difference between the two, could come to any other conclusion than that he was showing that, owing to the balance of power in the South African Constitution, there was a justification for the wide powers allotted to the National Parliament, whereas the balance of power in the case of the Federal Constitution of Australia did not warrant a wider control being given to this Legislature. 1I have read the honourable member's speech very carefully, and, for the benefit' of those who desire to test my statements by reference to Hansard, I will give the page upon which it is reported. It is page 5878, and the speech was delivered on the 22nd November, on the motion for the second reading of one of these Constitution Alteration Bills.",55
321,Mr RYRIE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I should like to know whether the honourable member is in order in quoting from the Hansard report of a debate during the present session?,56
322,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Is the - honourable member quoting from a debate on one of the Bills now under consideration ?,56
323,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I have not quoted from the debate ; I simply have a copy of .Hansard in my hand.,56
324,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member will not be in order in so - doing.,56
325,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am very much - disappointed, because the honourable member for Parramatta has challenged me on this point, and now I find that one of his ' bosom comrades raises a point of order to prevent me from quoting what was said. If it is not convenient for honourable members opposite to hear a speech of their Deputy Leader quoted, I suppose I must abide by the Standing Orders. But I can, at all events, direct attention to the speecli, and mention the page on which it is to be '.found. I particularly direct attention to the portion devoted to the South African Constitution, where he argued, in effect, that if there were in the Commonwealth the same balance of powers as is the case in South Africa-that is fo say, if there were in this country a Conservative Upper Chamber, that would prevent the exercise of these wider powers by a democratically constituted House-thes e enlarged powers might be safely granted. No other inference can be drawn from the speech.",56
326,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is an absolute misrepresentation. The honourable member knows it, too.",56
327,Mr ROBERTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member's previous speech contained an attack on adult suffrage.,56
328,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,On e could not help feeling that.,56
329,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Considerin g that my argument was a claim for adult suffrage, that is very funny.",56
330,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have pointed out that one of the characteristics by which the honourable member's speeches may always be known is that, whenever a point is pressed home, he tries to wriggle out by denying the plain words and inferences of his own statements.",56
331,Mr RYRIE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member is getting away from the ruling of the Chair by reading from Hansard. ' Mr JH CATTS - I have not read a single sentence.,56
332,Mr RYRIE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member is looking at Hansard.,56
333,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not know that there is any standing order that prevents' me from looking at Hansard. I have a copy in my hand, and I wish to keep close to the facts of the case. If I cannot quote, I like to look at the copy, so as to refresh my memory. I know that these debates will be largely read. I am compelled by the Standing Orders to limit my references to the speech of the honourable member for Parramatta to directing the attention of readers to the speech and to the principles which are at the basis of his remarks. I am sure that reference to the report will bear out what I have said - . I might refer again to one of the cardinal principles of the honourable member that if it is proposed to attack an evil, he always says that it ought to be done in some other way than that proposed. Very seldom do we hear the honourable member stand up and say, ""Here is a! thing which is wrong, a grievance under which the community is suffering, and there should be some redress."" If the position is «escapable, what he always says is, "" I admit that there ought to be redress, but the way you are proposing to remedy the evil is the wrong way.""",56
334,Mr ROBERTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"He said that about old age pensions, the maternity allowance, the land tax. and the Commonwealth Bank.",57
335,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"-The honourable member said, in regard to old-age pensions, that the surplus revenue ought to be paid to the States",57
336,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member must connect his remarks with the question before the Chair.,57
337,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Besides , I never said anvthing of the kind.",57
338,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"-The honourable member knows perfectly well that he voted against the Surplus Revenue Bill, which was to provide the money for old-age pensions. Mr JosErH COOK - The honourable member has not made a correct statement yet.",57
339,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Order !,57
340,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member's denials compel me to go a little bit further than I intended. He is qsibbling again.,57
341,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"He is discussing me, not the Bill.",57
342,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member is a very entertaining subject. One never needs be at a loss for a text while he is above the earth. I also 'find that the honourable member for Ballarat made a reference to the balance of powers under the Constitution. I am not allowed to quote from Hansard, but the passage to which I refer is to be found on page 5619, in the second column. He said that if these wide powers were given to the Australian Parliament, there ought to be a readjustment; that the balance of power ought to be altered. Then we had the honourable member for Echuca stating that the powers for which we are asking are much safer in the' hands of the States, because of the existence of the Legislative Councils. He did not believe that such powers would be safe in the hands of the National Parliament, elected - by the suffrage of the whole adult people of Australia. What was the point of objection of th* honourable member for Flinders? In the year before last the honourable member gave an unqualified support to the Constitution alterations as. regards trade and commerce and corporations then proposed. But what does he say today? He says, "" I was in favour of the alterations then, but I am not in favour of them now."" Why? Because there is a'Labour party on the Ministerial side of the House, and because he believes that after the next election the Labour party will still be here. That also was an attack cn adult suffrage. Does the honourable member for Flinders think that he is to be a dictator in this country, and that if the people choose to place on the Treasury bench a Government supported by a majority who will bring forward progressive legislation they should not have the legislation which they desire? Was not that the effect of his argument? It was absolutely so. Likewise also, it was the tionerable member for Ballarat who suggested that probably this party would come back with a majority after the general election, and that he was not prepared to trust us to exercise these extended powers under the Constitution. Can the honourable member for Wimmera, who sits facing me, deny that that is the reason why he is voting against the proposed Constitution amendments ? Is it not because he does not want the Labour .party to exercise these powers? If he thought there was a hope of his own party coming back to office, he would be prepared to give them such extended powers. The honourable member for Darling Downs, who was Attorney-General in the Fusion Government, sent the memorandum to South Africa, advising the people of that country to put in their Constitution the very powers for which we are asking.",57
343,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The powers are not the same.,57
344,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is a good lawyer's answer.,57
345,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Perfectl y true.,57
346,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Does the honourable member deny that the South African Constitution gives an unlimited power over trade and commerce? He is silent. Does he deny that he advised the South African Convention to give the National Parliament such powers? He is dumb again. He advised that those powers should be given into the hands of people who, a few years ago, were alien to the British Empire. They are new-comers to the Kingdom. Yet he does not think that the same powers can safely be granted to a Parliament elected to represent a British community whose history, traditions, and forefathers are and were entirely British. Honourable members opposite cannot deny that they have turned turtle on their previous utterances because of the temporary 'exigencies of party politics, when they are not prepared to allow a majority of the electors of Australia to govern themselves according to what they chink best, and under a majority of representatives elected by the people themselves. I find that the honourable member for Bendigo, who is also now sitting on the front bench opposite, said much the same thing on the 20th November, as recorded in Hansard, page 5726.",57
347,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Has the honourable member any objection to the honourable member for Bendigo sitting on this bench?,58
348,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I should be pleased if the honourable member for Parramatta would get off the political earth altogether.,58
349,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,A number people would be just the same as to the honourable member.,58
350,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I believe they would ; and so we must tolerate each other.,58
351,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It is hard work, I admit, to tolerate the honourable member !",58
352,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I can assure the honourable member that if he contested an electorate where there was a chance of anything like a fair fight, many people would find it hard to tolerate him. He takes good, care, however, to choose an electorate so extremely Conservative that there is no sporting chance of success.",58
353,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I am sure it would be bitter.,58
354,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"And strong, too. The honourable member for Bendigo objects to the trade and commerce power, but is in favour of an extended power in regard to corporations. I - have no doubt, ever, that the honourable member will, all the same, vote against the power in regard to corporations when the division bells ring. Prior to the last referenda honourable members opposite contended that it was absolutely unfair to bunch the five or six questions together on one 'ballot-paper, and compel the people to accept or reject the lot; but we find them objecting with just as much warmth now that the questions .are separated. Another reason offered by anti-Labour gentlemen for objecting to this legislation is that, while they may believe in handing over the powers to the Commonwealth Government, they do not care about them being exercised by a Labour Government. This would seem to indicate that they have rather a forlorn hope, and are starting the electoral battle with their flag half-mast high. I have no doubt that, if they had the slightest hope of finding their way to the Treasury benches, they would be whole-hearted supporters of these additional powers. We are told that these powers would not be safe in the hands of a Labour Government ; and yet we have the honourable member for Parramatta asking why precisely similar powers are not exercised by the Labour Government of New South Wales. What logic is there in such a position as that? The honourable member, as a politician from New South Wales, knows that every time the State Labour Government have attempted to pass any advanced Democratic measures the Legislative Council of has voted solidly against it.",58
355,Mr SINCLAIR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Nam e one measure.,58
356,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"A measure was introduced to regulate the price of gas, and the Legislative Council so emasculated it that it is now hardly worth the paper on which it is written.",58
357,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Not with the help of Labour nominees?,58
358,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I was waiting for chat interjection - The honourable member knows perfectly well that the State Government are limited in the number of nominees they may send to the Upper House.,58
359,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I do not know.,58
360,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Legislative Council has been kept at a certain strength over a long period of years .; and it is not possible to get the assent of the Governor to the appointment of enough Labour hownominees to give the Labour party a majority in that Chamber.,58
361,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Has the honourable member never heard of a Government going to the country on a question like that?,58
362,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes , I have.",58
363,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Not the New South Wales Labour Government, though.",58
364,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"-The Labour Government of New South Wales will go to the country when they are ready, and not when the honourable member for Parramatta thinks they ought to go. Mr GROOM.^-This. is. an attack on the adult, franchise Mr.,J. H , CATTS - No , it is not; it is ;an attack, on the legislative fossils who aresupported' by the Opposition in this Chamber. -.The argument of honourable members opposite .is to the effect that this National Parliament, elected on the broadest franchise, must not be intrusted with powers equal to those exercised, for instance, by the Government of New South Wales. I have just been looking through t'ie New South Wales Constitution, and I find that the State Parliament has power to legislate for the peace, order, and good government of the State without limit or qualification, except, of course, the limit imposed by the Commonwealth Constitution in regard to the present limited powers of the Federal Parliament. The State Parliament has full: legislative control over, amongst other things, the following :1. Care and rearing of infants and children. 2. Education(a) Primary; \b) Secondary; (e) University; {d) Technical; (e) Domestic economy. 3. Health. 4. Land tenure and Settlement. 5. Private Property. 6. Conduct and morals and offences against society. 7. Transport of persons and commerce. 8. Municipal and local government. 9. Industrial and factory regulation. 10. All the exisiting concurrent powers of the Bill? Commonwealth and State, except where on a Federal matter a Federal law conflicts with a State law. In such case the Federal law vails. It will be observed that, even where there is a Labour majority, State per Parliaments do not seek to exercise them. such powers in any undue or unreasonable way, though honourable members opposite contend that, if the Bills before us passed, all sorts of dreadful things will happen. Jt might, just as well be argued that, because the New South Wales Parcitizens, liament has unlimited power over children, they will, when the children reach a tain age,, take them from their parents and monwealth Government the extended remove them to industrial centres for purpose which the State may think goodfor socialistic enterprises, and so forth. What an absolutely ridiculous thing it is to say that any Parliament, elected as Parliaments are, would exercise its powers in such a way ! If the Parliaments were elected for ten or twelve years, there might, perhaps, be a temptation to an unreasonable use of power; but the fact is that in three yeais every member of Parliament has to face the electors. This is a kind of sword of terror hanging over every representative's head; and he knows that his conduct, not only as a legislator, but as a private individual, must be such as will commend itself to the electors. In the first place, a member must be a perfectly sane and reasonable person to get here at all ; and then his conduct is kept in check, if any check be necessary, by the fact that he must face his constituents at the enu of three years. Parliament moves slowlyaltogether too slowly for me-n o matter how we seek to hasten its work. After all, what is it possible for a Parliament to do irt three years? It would be impossible for a Parliament to do in that time such things as some of our opponents would have us believe are probable. We know how quick the people are to visit punishment on a party in whom confidence has been forfeited. Previous to the last election, two diametrically opposite parties fell into each other's arms, and went on to the platform together; but the electors, regarded this as a kind of immoral combination, and gave the Fusion very shortshrift. It was a Fusion of persons with no other object than to advance their owni personal interests.",58
365,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Will the honourable member confine his lemarks to,59

We are told that the .Labour party is a party of great nationalizing schemes, for which millions of money aie required; and we have to reflect that, with the unlimited power of taxation, the vernment could confiscate private wealth such an extent as to make i l impossible for any one to hold more than ^10,000.

It shows that the people hav« a proper check upon the powers which Parliament may exerwhen cise. Then, again, the Commonwealth Parliawill ment has power to borrow money on the public credit of the Commonwealth. What an awful thing it is for a Labour Governare ment to be in power' with a right to go the London money market and borrow as much as they like. According to our ponents, it might be thought that portunity to do ill deeds would make deeds done-that the Federal Government would go to the money lenders of the kind? world and pawn everything within the concrush trol of the Commonwealth in order create nice conditions, and make all sorts of presents to their party supporters. argument of honourable members opposite, if it means anything, means that we will exercise the powers we have unreasonably; and yet there has been a Labour Government in power for nearly three years, with a majority in both Houses, and nothing answer it? dreadful has happened. The fact that our opponents are afraid that we shall be office after the next election to exercise extended powers for which we are asking is evidence that they feel that the people are satisfied with the manner in which have exercised the constitutional powers now intrusted to us.",60

382,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It provides for the extension of a supplementary power to be used in connection with the trade and commerce power. There should be an affirmative vote in regard to both p'oposals. But the honourable member for Wimmera, who, twelve or eighteen months ago, thought that the trade and commerce power of the Commonwealth should be extended, has since found excuses for doubling back on his tracks.",61
383,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member must not refer to a speech made in another debate.,61
384,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I understood that on this Bill some latitude was to be allowed.,61
385,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I told the House that in the debate on the Trade and Commerce Bill I would allow the discussion of the proposals contained in the six measures for the alteration of the Constitution, but that on the second reading of the remaining five I would limit the discussion to the measure immediately before us. If that is not done, we may have a general discussion on every Bill.",61
386,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have no desire to follow the honourable member any further in his winding ways, and can say what I wish to say on the various Bills as they come before us. It must be assumed that the extended power for which we are asking will be reasonably exercised as we have reasonably exercised the large powers that we already possess. For instance, we have power to deal with currency, coinage, and legal tender. We might, therefore, enact that all the business of the community must be transacted with a currency of farthings. But we are not a set of lunatics, and do not do what is unreasonable. We have exercised this power to provide for the minting of our own silver, and to establish a Government note issue, and it cannot be said that any great calamity has followed in consequence. Our future must be judged by our past and present deeds. Then we have power to legislate in respect to marriage, divorce, and matrimonial causes. We . could, therefore, legalize polygamy. Our opponents have charged us with disregarding the sanctity of the marriage tie, and with having no concern for home life, wishing to introduce free love.",61
387,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,This has nothing to do with the Bill.,61
388,Mr JH CATTS,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am showing that we have not exercised unreasonably the constitutional powers which we already possess, and that, therefore, we may be trusted with the extended powers for which we ask. The evidence which the electors have of the fact that.they may with safety put extended powers into our hands is that we have not used our present powers unreasonably. The power to legislate in respect to marriage, divorce, and matrimonial causes is one which might be used to do incalculable harm to.the community. No power could be misused to give more lamentable results; but this power has not been used fo inflict disaster on the community, nor have the other powers of the Constitution been used in that way. They have been used only to further the best interests of the people. Besides, there is a check upon the exercise of our powers. The electors return by a majority those whom they desire to frame laws for the Commonwealth. The party in power must be supported by a majority of the electors, and cannot pass its proposals into law without the consent of majorities in. each House of the Parliament. If we get the extended corporation power we shall be able to regulate the conduct of certain monopolies, and thus give effect to part of the new Protection policy. When the honourable member for Ballarat was in power, his Government submitted a Tariff, and lie promised members like myself that if we would support his proposals he would give us new Protection, providing for failwages and reasonable selling prices. When doubts were raised as to the possibilities of new Protection under the Constitution, he said in this chamber that if effect coul.d not be given to it we should have an opportunity to reconsider our Tariff votes. On that distinct understanding a number of us voted for certain items of the Tariff. Subsequently the honourable gentleman refused to allow the Tariff to be reconsidered, although he had got it through on the promise to which I have referred. Now he goes still further, and tries to prevent this Parliament from securing power to give effect to the new Protection policy, which he said was complementary to his Tariff proposals. Tariff was got through under false pretences. The honourable member could not have passed it but for the statement that he would stand by the new Protection policy. Then it has been said that the Labour party have no mandate to re-submit these proposals to the people. elected on a distinct platform which provides for1. Nationalization of monopolies, amendment of Constitution to provide for same. 2. New Protection, amendment of Constitucised. tion to provide for same. 3. Effective Arbitration, amendment stitution to provide for same. 4. Inclusion of State Railwaj' employees witliin the Federal arbitration power, amendment of Constitution to provide for same. Honourable members opposite say that we this National Parliament. have already referred these proposals to electors once, and that they were But - I conceive it to be my duty to embrace every opportunity which offers to enable to give effect to the platform upon which was elected, and to provide opportunities to the electors to clothe their own National Parliament with sufficient power to carry out the programme they have endorsed. Suppose that we had faced our conbecome stituents without again submitting these proposals to the people, what would the have been said of us? Would it not have been said, "" These men are arshall prevail. rant cowards. The moment there is a little breeze in opposition to them they abandon the pledges which they made to their stituents."" After all, what are we do in this National Parliament unless are granted extended powers? Are come here simply to do something which position can have no effect on the people? Shall this Parliament be maintained with all costly paraphernalia when we have no askedpower to deal with matters which are crywhether ing out for treatment all over Australia?

In an interview with the Prime its Minister in Sydney some time ago, he was the referendum on the next occasion would be a purely party issue? that one The report saysMr Fisher answered, without hesitation, At the last Hobart Labour Conference, in January of this year, whatever chance there may have been that this will Bill would be considered from a non-party stand-point was entirely destroyed by the fact that plank No. 3 of the fighting platform was made "" Effective Federation,"" and the general platform provides forEffective Federation - The inclusion in the Constitution of the powers asked for on 26th A p r i l , 1911. That being so, it is clear that at least one section of the House must view this Bill from a party stand-point. Coming to the measure itself, I wish to state exactly what are our powers with respect to corporations. Section 51 of the Constitution provides, inter aliaThe Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to(xx.) Foreign corporations, and trading or financial corporations formed within the limits of (he Commonwealth. That is the extent of our present power, which is fully set out in the case of Huddart Parker v. Moorehead, in which the Chief Justice and Mr Justice Barton agree with that. laid it downSection 51 (xx.) of the Constitution upon the Commonwealth Parliament prohibit foreign corporations and trading and financial corporations formed under State laws from engaging in trade and commerce within a State, as distinguished from trade and commerce between States or foreign countries, or to impose conditions subject to which they may engage in such trade and commerce, but does not confer upon the Commonwealth Parliament power to control the operations of such corporations which lawfully engage in such trade and commerce. Mr Justice O'Connor laid it downThe power conferred by section 51 (xx.) of the Constitution is limited to the making of laws with respect to the recognition of corporations as legal entities within the Commonwealth, and does not include a power to make laws for regulating and controlling the business of corporations when once they have been so recognised, and are exercising their corporate functions by carrying on business in the Commonwealth. Mr Justice Higgins, upon being faced with the scope of the power conferred upon this Parliament, is reported upon page 412 of the Commonwealth Law Reports, volume 8, to have said I think it is my duty to face this question, but I do not wish to be taken as giving any final or exhaustive definition. In the first place, this sub-section (xx.) does not give any power to incorporate companies. Such power of incorporation as the Federal Parliament has is implied, not express, not direct and independent, but ancillary, incidental to its other powers. This sub-section applies only to corporations which have been formed abroad, or trading or financial) by the States. Mr Groom. there is ample scope provided for the Federal Parliament by this sub-section. It can regulate such companies as co their status, and as to the powers which they may exercise within Australia., and as to ' the conditions under which they shall be permitted to carry on. business. It is well established that each country has a right to prevent a foreign corporation from nariying on business within its limits, either absolutely, OT except under certain conditions-Hooper v. California (r)-and this principle seems to be at the base of sub-section (xx.). The Federal Parliament can, in my opinion, prescribe what capital must be put up, probably even how it must have been paid up (in cash or fnr value, and how the value is to be ascertained), what returns must be made, what publicity must be given, what auditing must be done, what securities must be deposited. The Federal Parliament controls, as it were, the entrance gates, the tickets of admission,'the right to do business, and to continue to do business in Australia; the State Parliaments dictate what acts may be done or may not be done, within the enclosure, prescribe laws with respect to the contracts and business within the scope of the permitted powers.",62
394,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Cza r Griffith does not Mr GRO.OM - This is a case in which confers four of the Justices of the High Court power to were in agreement. The Federal Parliament has no power, in' regulating the actors, to regulate, in whole or in part, transactions which do not belong to Inter-State or foreign trade. It can confer on a corporation power* to hold lands as a matter of corporate capacity; but the State Legislature, having the control of the lands within the State, can forbid such lands to the corporation, can prescribe laws in the nature of mortmain : Colonial Building and Investment Association v. The Attorney-General of Quebec (1). The Federal Parliament can, as it were, regulate the terms of admission into a field and of remaining therein, but it cannot make a law imposing a penalty for picking a turnip. The distinction may be fine, but it is clear, and necessarily incidental to the fine distribution of powers and . subjects between Federal and State Legislatures in a complex society. The Federal Parliament can regulate corporations as to status, capacity, and the conditions on which business is permitted. But it is for the State Parliament to regulate what contracts or combinations a corporation may make in the course of the permitted business. The principle on which the distinction is based is not peculiar to federations, or novel to British law; for, according to the Privy Council, the status of a person in a colony (e.g., as alien or subject) may hare to be determined by the law of England, while the law of the Colony decides what rights and liabilities are attached to the status thus ascertained : Donegani v. Donegani (2); In re Adam (3). In fine, if the Statute of Limitations or the Statute of Frauds, or the common law as to contracts, is to be altered or repealed, even as to corporations, it must be altered or repealed by the State Parliament, which can deal with private persons as well as with corporaBut tions, and secure uniform treatment. In that statement, Mr Justice Higgins sets out what he believes are the powers which this Parliament at present possesses. I should like to see those powers go further. When I was Attorney-General I gave instructions for the preparation of a Companies Bill , which was to include the general powers which are generally provided for in such measures in regard to the ordinary principles of companies law. After we had got our rough draft of the measure ready, and entered upon the consideration of its principles and details, we - came to the conclusion that it was doubtful whether, with our present powers under the Constitution, it was possible for us to frame a satisfactory legislative measure dealing with the subject which would be of uniform application to the whole of Australia. We had not any legal decision at the time to inform us as to the exact powers we possessed. Ultimately, the case to which I have referred came before the High Court, and there was then for the first time an interpretation of this particular section. There had been previously to this a ruling of the High Court in the Jumbunna case, declaring that incidental to the other powers we possessed under the Constitution we had the power to create corporations. I refer honourable members to the report of the Jumbunna case at page 309 of the Commonwealth Law Reports, from which I make the following quotationThe provisions of the Commonwealth Conciliation ancl Arbitration Act 1904 in respect of the registration of associations as organizations, particularly in so far as they permit the registration of an association of employers or employees in an industry in one State only,, and provide for the incorporation of organizations when registered, are valid as being incidental to the power conferred on the Commonwealth Parliament by section 51, paragraph XXXV., of the Constitution. That is to say, it was held that, so far as our general powers of control are concerned, this Parliament has unlimited discretion in the selection of the proper agencies and instrumentalities to give them effect. It was ruled that as regards our power with respect to conciliation and arbitration for the prevention and settlement of disputes extending beyond the boundaries of a State we had the ancillary power to create agencies and instrumentalities in the shape of industrial corporations to secure our end. Incidental to each of our express powers under section 51 of the Constitution there is the incidental power of incorporation. But that is quite distinct and different from the power we are considering in connection with the present Bill . The attitude I have always assumed in this connection is that I desire to see the Commonwealth Parliament given the power necessary tp enable it to pass an ordinary Companies* Bill which shall be of uniform application throughout Australia. It might not be necessary for us to exercise such a power to the full , but I think this Parliament should have the power to deal with the creation and incorporation of companies, their dissolution, and winding-up - When a corporation is once created and endowed with power to act as' an artificial entity, it should have the same liberty and freedom that an individual has to move from State to State, and engage under the laws of the States in the ordinary operations of trade, commerce, and industry. In other words, if a business firm desire to carry on operations in three or in six of the States, once the firm is created a corporation it should be able to engage in business in each of the States as freely as the circumstances would permit. We do not want, six systems of registration for the six States, or six sets of returns furnished in connection with every little operation. Our corporations should be, so far as we can make them so, Australian corporations, and our legislation should deal with the' question of their dissolution and windingup. When a company is dissolved, its creditors, wherever they reside, should be regarded as Australian creditors, each entitled to a share according to fixed terms and conditions in the assets of the liquidating company. This has appeared to me to be a highly desirable object to attain.",63
395,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Then the honourable gentleman will vote for this Bill ?,64
396,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No ; the honourable member fails to understand the point. If this Bil l sought only to bring that about, there would be no objection to it. The Government have somewhat modified the terms of the resolutions previously submitted. It was not the intention of the Government in introducing this Bill merely to bring about what I have suggested. The object of this measure is to go further, and the Government have inserted the words "" regulation and control."" That is the point. I have dealt with the power we now possess, and the necessity for an amendment of that power. I wish now to deal with the third point. How do the Government in this instance propose to legislate? Bill deals wifchCorporations; including(a) the creation, dissolution, regulation, control of corporations; (£) corporations formed State, including their dissolution, regulation, and control; but not including municipal or governmental corporabiased. tions, or any corporations formed solely for religious, charitable, tific, or artistic purposes, and not for the acquisition or gain by the corporation or its members; and (c) foreign corporations, including their gulation and control. When a similar Bill was before this House on a previous occasion this provision peared in a different form, and read i-s followsCorporations including(a) the creation, dissolution, regulation, control of corporations; (i) corporations formed under the law State, except any corporation formed solely for religious, tific, or artistic purposes, and not for the acquisition of gain by the corporation or its members, including their dissolution, regulation, and control; and (c) foreign corporations, including their regulation and control. That provision of the previous measure was subjected to a good deal of criticism, and the point was taken that the Attorney General, and those ' associated with him, when they draftedthat provision, hardly realized its full extent. Competent lawyers outside, analyzing it in a perfectly impartial way, saw the extent to which it would go, and warned the Government of the position. I am very glad to say that at least on one point the Government have benefited by the criticism, as by this new Bill and the alteration in the form of the preceding measure they have practically admitted that they realise the value of the criticism and the accuracy of the lawyer who expressed an opinion on the subject. I propose to quote now from an opinion given by Mr Mitchell, in a letter which he wrote to the Argus on the 28th February, 1911.",64
397,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable gentleman does not mean to say that the present Government were influenced in any wav by Mr Mitchell?,65
398,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I take it that the Government should be influenced by correct criticism, no matter from what source it comes. In view of the high standing of Mr Mitchell at the Bar, his well known The integrity, and proved ability, I should say that, no matter how much we may personally differ from the views he expresses, and when he deals with a bare question of scientific criticism his opinion is well worth under the law of a listening to.",65
399,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Onl y that he is politically,65
400,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,He never has a brief scienbut from the honourable gentleman's side.,65
401,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not think that that is a fair thing to say of Mr Mitchell. I rethink that honourable members should leave the personal element out of the question, and confine themselves to the principles of apthe measures before them. In dealing with these Bills, I have tried to keep to the principles they contain, and I ask honourable members opposite to do the same. and Referring to the provision with respect to corporations embodied in the proposals of of a 1910, submitted to the electors in 1911, charitable, scien Mr Mitchell says The effect of the proposed law would be that, as regards every corporation (except those "" formed solely for religious, charitable, scientific, or artistic purposes, and not for the acquisition of gain by the corporation or its members""), the Federal Parliament could pass any law it pleased. That is to say, any corporation or company formed under the laws of a Stale, even though not engaged in trade and commerce, and including' as I read the words of the amendment, the city of Melbourne and all other city corporations throughout the States, would be entirely subject to the regulation and control of the Federal Parliament, which could pass laws directing them to carry on their business in an entirely different manner to that in which their competitors were to carry on theirs under the laws of the State, and could direct them to do, or restrain them from doing, any particular act or class of acts.",65
402,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"He gave a similar opinion against the land tax, did he not?",65
403,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,No ; how could he give an opinion like that on the land tax?,65
404,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,He said it was unconstitutional .,65
405,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I need only refer honourable members to the answer which the Government have given to the criticism I have quoted from Mr Mitchell's letter. They have now proposed to exempt municipal or governmental corporations. Mr. Mitchell pointed out what might happen under the original Bill, which included them, and the Government are to-dav submitting a Bill from which they are exempted. Seeing that they have paid so much respect to Mr Mitchell's opinion, I think it is a pity they did not pay more respect to it. Mr Mitchell went on to sayLeaving out the very serious matter of the control of municipal and similar corporations, hut having regard to the place that companies now occupy in the development of the' community, such a position of affairs would surely be too intolerable to be endured. any business carried on by a company might have to be carried on under one set of conditions under the Federal law, while in a neighbouring street a rival business could be carried on by a firm under the different conditions of State law. He is not singular in that opinion, as the honourable member for Angas ""has expressed a similar opinion during this deba.e. The honourable member for Flinders has expressed a similar opinion, and, lest there should be any doubt upon the matter, we have had a judicial determination by Mr. Justice Higgins, who, in his judgment, pointed out what would be the effect of fully granting the contention of the Crown then submitted, which amounts to what is being asked for under this Bill. The passage from Mr Justice Higgins' judgment has been read several times during the debate, and, as I wish to take up time or space in Hansard by again repeating it, I refer honourable members to the extract quoted by the honfterm orable member for Angas and by myself at an earlier stage from the judgment in the Huddart Parker case, which will found at page 409 of the Commonwealth Law Reports. Mr Justice Higgins points the previous Bill. s I pointed out pre, out in that judgment that the results of - the full acceptance of the conwas tention of the Crown at that time would be "" b i g with confusion,"" and that there would be two different sets of laws prevailing in the same community. There would be a Federal law applicable Mates. to corporations, and a State law on the same subject applicable to persons. point I want to make is that as regards creating a legal entity, and allowing that entity to engage in its operations throughearned at the referenda; we out Australia as a trading corporation, is desirable. But once a corporation is amendment. created, let it go into the different States and carry on its operations uncler the ordinary conditions of the State law, the same way as persons with whom the corporation itself would have to come into competition. It is too ludicrous imagine that a business man who privately owns a trading concern should be sublaws. ject to one set of State laws, and that corporation - the Federal institution 3 9r2 6307 should be put under an entirely different set ot laws as regards its operations in business, trade, and commerce, the carrying on of its duties, its liability for negligence, the making of its contracts, and its liability for its financial dealings For instance generally. They ought, as far as possible, LVT ^ 1 0 n P n e f 0 0 t in S' A * regards J the dissolutton of a private firm, when the Bankruptcy Bill I S passed, we shall have an Australian law. What we desire to see to is that if an Australian corporation goes insolvent, and has to be dissolved or wound up, it, too, shall be subject to a Federal law. I have come now to the point raised by the honourable member for Hindmarsh as to how far that position car1 W ° U l d d T a w h is attention to the fact that the phrase ""regulation and control of corporations"" occurs in paragraphs a, b, and c of clause 2 of this Silting suspended from 6.2 to 8 p.m. 7",65
406,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The question to be considered m connection with these amenddo not ments-w,t h the amendment now before the House particularly-is the phrase "" re^ r l which l - ^ uhas been l ' ' introduced« into a new t l 0 d CO n To 1 That the S i I ' H A 1 8 b / C ? US e of it s introduction be that the effect of the amendment becomes so far-reaching. The same words were in A vjously m the opinion of the counsel who quoted here, the effect of the words regulatjon and control "" amount to the conferring of a power that would enable the Federal Parliament to deal with matters which are at present confined to the I was pointing out before the dinner adjournment that according to that The opinion we should have an unfortunate Position. I am assuming, of course, that this is the only amendment which will be are dealing; that with it now as a distinct and substantial As the learned counsel pointed out, wo should have in the one street those corporations which are incorin porated under the Commonwealth subject to one set of laws, and those persons in a neighbouring street who were carryto ing on the same calling as the corporaions subject to a different set of I notice that in the case of Huda dart Parhcr Limited v. Moorehead, Mr Justice O Connor used the expression to which I have drawn attention. After agreeing with the judgment by the Chief Justice, he gave the reasons why he came to his conclusion. He saidFor these reasons, I am of opinion that the power conferred by sub-section xx. must be fusion enough? ronstrued as being limited to the making of laws with respect to the recognition of corporations as legal entities within the Commonwealth, and that its provisions do not the making of laws for regulating and trolling the business of a corporation coming within the section when once the corporation has been recognised as a legal entity within Commonwealth, and is exercising its corporate functions in carrying on its business within tralia. There he used the same words as we find in this phrase "" regulation and control,"" although he used the present participle "" regulating and controlling."" I do know whether that is the source from which the draftsman got the idea of using the phrase. But there it was used by Mr. Justice O'Gonnor apparently in a wide sense. The objection taken to this ment is that it goes far beyond the sities of the case. It is not limited simply to creating general companies so as to enposition now? able legal entities to carry on their business throughout Australia in the same way as private persons can do at the present time; but it will set up an anomaly, as pointed out by Mr Justice Higgins so forcibly in same. "" his judgment. It will create the anomaly of having in one district dealing with the tions. one subject, two sets of laws prevailing, which, as His Honour says, is ""big with confusion.""",66
407,Mr CHANTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Will not the Commonprivate wealth law override the State law?,67
408,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No , because the Comand commerce?"" monwealth law will apply only to corporations, while the State law will apply persons.",67

This is what Mr Justice Highis gins says, and this is what effect of the amendmentI f the argument for the Crown is right, the results are certainly extraordinary, big with confusion. If it is right, the Federal Parlialicense ment is in a position to frame a new system of libel laws applicable to newspapers owned by corporations, while the State law of libel wou'd have to remain applicable to newspapers owned by individuals. It is not a case of a Federal law overriding a State law, but a case of a Federal law applying to one set of persons organtoria ized as a corporation and a State law, identically the same subject-matter, applying to another set of persons in the same place, and under the same conditions.",67

If the they are going to have in the States one law of libel, let there be one law of Auslibel j but do not let there be one law of libel for a number of persons if they start a company, and an entirely different law of libel for an individual who is running a newspaper in competition not with the newspaper of that company. That is where the trouble will come in. That is why Mr Justice Higgins saysthat if we do this thing the whole subject will be "" b i g with confusion."" That is amendwhy it is highly undesirable that we necesshould take that particular action.",67

420,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member to is now asking me for another definition. I dealt with another question as he re We might have different laws of negligence, liabilities for torts, and That is what Mr Justice Higgins pointed out in judgment. He referred to the case of will he the the licensing law- . Taking the analogous power to make laws with regard to lighthouses, if the respondent's argument is right, the Federal Parliament can a lighthouse for the sale of beer and spirits, or may establish schools in lighthouses with distinctly doctrinal teaching, although the licensing laws and the education laws are, for ordinary purposes, left to the State Legislatures.",67

I am pointing out what the effect will be if the amendment is carried.",67
423,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,You can reduce the thing almost to an absurdity if you like to go far enough.,68
424,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Is it desirable that a number of persons who are organized as a company should have one set of libel law applying to them, and that one individual, who - is publishing the same matter, should have another set applying to him; that it should be a crime for a corporation, but not for a private person, to do something ?",68
425,Mr SCULLIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is an argument for Unificatioti.,68
426,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No ; in a particular State area it is an argument that the State or the Federal law should prevail there. The honourable .member may put it that way if he likes. What I am pointing-out is that he will not do that by this amendment, but will bring about the very confusion which he says he does not want to exist. That is the position very clearly as pointed out by the eminent counsel, Mr. Mitchell, the honourable member for Angas, the honourable member for Flinders, and the judgment of Mr Justice Higgins.",68
427,Mr FENTON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Were there not dissenting Judges in that case?,68
428,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The only dissenting judgment was that of Mr Justice Isaacs, The Chief Justice, Mr Justice Barton, Mr Justice O'Connor, and Mr Justice Higgins were the other four Judges in the case; but Mr Justice Isaacs gave a dissenting judgment, in which he dealt with the question of the powers under the Australian Industries Preservation Act, holding that certain sections were constitutional. I do not wish to go into the details of the judgment. I desire to .say a few words now in reference to trusts and combines.",68
429,Mr CHANTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"What does the phrase ""regulation and control"" mean?",68
430,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is what I am asking. We have not had an explanation from the other side yet.,68
431,Mr CHANTER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"In Committee, can we not make it more evident what it does mean ?",68
432,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is for the Attorney-General to say. At present very eminent counsel say that it will produce the result here stated; whether that is desired or not, I cannot say. I can only point to the very pungent criticism which (has been given. I desire now to refer to the corporations which it is said are great trusts and combines. I would, first of all, emphasize the point that we have complete plenary power to pass laws to deal with combines and monopolies engaged in the lnter-Sfcate trade. If there is any trouble at present, and there can be devised any remedy by way of Act of Parliament, thai the present Government are to blame for having failed to provide that remedy. I can understand the argument of those honourable members opposite who say, in support of the amendments of the Constitution now sought, that legislation will never effectually cope with monopolies and combinations, and that the only remedy is nationalization. That is a logical position to take up; whether it is a wise one is quite another matter. It is illogical to ask for powers to deal with legislation, and then assert you can never devise legislation to suppress trusts. My own view is that the aim of honourable members opposite is, if they obtain these powers, to deal with trusts and combines in only one way, and that is by their nationalization. This proposed power, in conjunction with that which they seek to nationalize monopolies, would enable the Commonwealth Government to acquire all the property used in connection with an industry or business said to be a monopoly. For instance, in the case of a large dairying association registered as a corporation, and having associated with it a co-operative concern holding large areas of land, there would be power to nationalize, not only the corporation itself, but all the property used in connection with it. So far as monopolies and combines engaged in Inter-State trade are concerned, it is idle for honourable members opposite to say that but for the wording of the Constitution as it stands at present a form of legislation could be devised which has not yet been devised. As a matter of fact, the Government may devise any legislative remedy they think fit to deal with Inter-State monopolies and combines, so long as that remedy comes within our power to legislate in respect to Inter-State trade and commerce. Mr Frank B. Kellogg, special counsel for the United States of America in the Standard Oil cases, has written an article dealing with that prosecution, in which he points out that it has had three good results. He writes in the American Review of Reviews that, in the first place, it has caused the discontinuance of the unfair practices to which I have already ferred in a previous debate. He goes on to sayAnother thing which has been accomplished that the Government has demonstrated that bigger than any corporation, and can legally in Canada. control aggregations of capital organized under State authority. That should apply to our position in tralia. He points out that, as the result of the prosecutions, the Federal authoIV., rity was established by the Court. Then he addsI have often said that Congress in the light of these decisions, establish a Commission something like the Inter-State Commerce Commission, and license corporations and large aggregations of capital under strict supervision and control. In another part of his article he deals with the question of so improving the legislation with respect to trusts and combines as to make the Federal power over them more effectual. He writesThe fault is that the Government never had adequate supervision or control over large tions. aggregations of capital, with the proper publicity which follows such control. gress should now provide for is system of Federal incorporation, and a compulsory system of Federal licence of large corporations engaged in Inter-State business. licence could be issued upon condition that corporation comply with the terms and condicombines tions of the Act of Congress providing there for, and the first and most essential of conditions would be proper publicity of the ness and affairs of - such corporations. would' work for the benefit of the stock-holders as well as the general public. He is dealing there with the present stitution of the United States of America, which confers upon Congress the same forIn this powers that we possess in this regard, and abolish he points out a further remedy that might be provided. He goes on to sayIt is sufficient here to say that such a licence law should make clear just what corporations shall be permitted to engage in Inter-State commerce, and under what conditions. When licensed, so long as they comply wilh the terms of the licence and the Acts of Congress, they should be protected in their right to do business, so that there may be security and certainty in the right to engage in commerce. should also provide th?t, if such corporations engage in unfair methods of competition for the purpose of obtaining a monopoly, their charter or licence shall be forfeited. - object, of course, should be to regulate and prevent the abuses of large aggregations of capital, keeping open the opportunity for all men fairly and with equal right to engage in commerce. That is the opinion, not of an amateur, but of a man who went through all the Mr Groom. reStandard Oil prosecutions, and who occupies a position of considerable eminence at the United States Bar. He holds exactly is the same view as was expressed by Mr. it is Mackenzie King, when Minister of Labour In the Dominion Parliament in 1910' there was introduced a Bill giving further power with respect to large Auscombines. At page 6838 of the debates of the Canadian House of Commons, Vol. Session 1909-10, Mr King, in discussing that measure, and dealing with the operations of the combines in Canada, should now, is reported to have said If I have made myself clear, I shall have shown, in regard to the attitude of the Government in this matter, that it is not assumed that combines are wholly responsible for the increase of prices; that combines, in other words, may be one cause, in some cases they may not be a cause; but there is a strong reason for believing that in certain cases combines have contributed to the enhancing of prices unduly. For' that reason it becomes necessary to has pass laws to try to control their opera",68
433,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,He was a very clever What Cona voluntary fellow to find that out!,69
434,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Mr King knew what Such a he was talking about. When we hear an the honourable member saying that trusts and in Australia are responsible for these the industrial unrest existing in the Combusimonwealth it seems wise to bring forward This this corrective even if it may appear that the authority quoted was merely indulging in platitudes. Mr King went on to Consay, as reported at page 6859conclusion, let me say that it is not claimed measure that it will by nny means all the evils which are claimed to be the result of combines and trusts in this country. The most that can be hoped for any such legislation is that it may be a step in the right direction. Broadly viewed, it is in the machinery for investigation, and for the framing and shaping of an intelligent public opinion, which the measure provides, that its main features consist. It aims to get at the truth, and to have the truth, when ascertained, so presented that the remedy for a wrong disclosed will be self-evident. It is framed in the belief that, The ""law once in possession of the facts, which are of first importance to itself, the public will find a way of seeing that any evil under which it may be wrongfully suffering will be removed, The ana that no situation, however complicated, will prove too intricate for a satisfactory solution, but to ascertain the facts, to get at the truth, is the first of all essentials. That applies equally to the position ih Australia. We desire to get at the truth, to find out where these trusts are, and to ascertain what is the character of their operations and their effect upon the community as a whole. He continuesI t relics on the moral sense of the community as a ""compelling force"" when concentrated intelligently on a business wrong. public opinion will protect honest business and condemn unfair practices. Mr King takes the same view regarding the importance of publicity as does Mr. Kellogg. He said In the publicity, therefore, which this measure secures, not to private affairs of honest business men, as may be urged by those who are interested in thwarting legislation of this kind, but to the wrongful acts of mean men, lies its strength in securing the well-being of the people, which it is its purpose to maintain. honest endeavour to grapple, in a fearless, practical, and thorough manner with what is, undoubtedly, the most complicated, intricate, and far-reaching of those problems to which our present social, industrial, and commercial l if e has given rise; and which presents, I believe, more difficulties than any single problem in the world today. If it does nothing more than restrain to some extent the aggressive tendencies of large aggregations of wealth, and to secure, as respects those powerful interests, some measure of that social control which is essential to the protection of the well-being of the many, it will prove not only a benefit to this nation, but I believe, an onward step in the march of social progress. This shows that the Dominion Parliament is prepared to take action to investigate trusts, and that the Government there are devising remedies that have not hitherto been tried in Australia. have to consider whether it may not be wise for those who are going to legislate to study the operation of this law in Canada and to determine the advisableness of adopting some of the suggestions which have been made for the amendment of the law in the United States of America. During the last three years we have heard many speeches regarding our defective powers under the Constitution, and yet we have the undoubted fact that during the whole of that period honourable members opposite have not brought to light the legislative remedies of which they have talked. We are told that it will be necessary to regulate the prices that corporations charge for their products. Judging by the wording of the proposed amendment of the Constitution, I presume that the control and regulation of prices is what is in the mind of the Government. We hear honourable members opposite speak as if the recent increases in prices and in the cost of living throughout the world were due only to the existence of trusts and combines. The question has been full y and completely investigated by Commissions, and whilst it may be perfectly true that Intelligent trusts and combines constitute one of the causes for this increase they represent by no means the only cause.",69
435,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,How does the honourable member account for the rise in prices all over the world ?,70
436,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The causes are divisible into three classes. There are first of all the causes that are world-wide-cause s that seem to be operating in every country; It is an then there are causes which operate in a particular country; - and finally there are those which operate in a particular city such as Melbourne or Sydney. A world-wide cause is discussed f u l ly by Layton in his Introduction to the Study of Prices, and is also mentioned by Mr . MCKenzie King, who refers in his speech to several economists. It is mentioned in the report of the Massachusetts Commission, and by the Committee of the Senate of the United States of America. That cause is the increase in the production of gold throughout the world.",70
437,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"-Is the honourable member going to connect these remarks with the subject? . Mr GROOM - Yes . Honourable memWe bers opposite say that corporations are lesponsible for the rise in prices. I am showing that corporations are not solely responsible, but that other causes also have to be taken into consideration, one of them being the increase in the production of gold.",70
438,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I thought the honourable member was going to argue for bi metallism.,70
439,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I am giving the opinion of a few experts.,70
440,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,A few cranks.,70
441,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Thes e so-called cranks consist, in the first place, of Mr MCKenzie King, the Minister for Labour in Canada, v/ho gives the names of several leading professors. We also have the opinion of the Committee presided over by Senator Lodge, who is, I suppose, one of the most capable men in the United States.",70
442,Mr ARCHIBALD,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is doubtful.,70
443,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Unfortunately , any man. who differs from the honourable member for Hindmarsh is, in his opinion, a crank. J. should not like to call the honourable member a crank simply because he holds different opinions from a man like Senator Lodge, and from Mr Layton, the author of a recently published work on prices.

445,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Othe r .causes alleged contribute to the advance in prices the United States are stated to the increased cost of production of products by reason of higher land, values and higher wages; increased demand tor farm products and food; the shifting population from food-producing to foodParliament. consuming occupations and localities; immigration to food-consuming localities; reduced fertility of land resulting in lower average production or in increased expendifor other communities. tures for fertilization; increased banking facilities in agricultural localities enable farmers to hold their crops market to the best advantage; reduced ply convenient to transportation facilities of such commodities as timber; cold storpower age plants, which result in preventing tremefluctuationsof prices of certain comQueensland. modities with the seasons; increased cost of distribution; industrial combinations; organizations of producers or of dealers;, advertising; increased money supply; capitalization and higher standard of ing. These are a few referred to in the report and there discussed. If honorprohibition able members will look through the report of the Committee of the Senate, they will see that the increased cost vertisements of living, and the increased standard life set up by virtue of the progress cation and civilization throughout the Telegraph lately. world, are given as causes. When we commence to regulate prices, however, we to deal with an exceedingly complicated land has done. and delicate problem. All sorts of causes have to be investigated. Some of causes of increased prices are found to be world-wide; others extend over the whole operations of a nation; others are purely local. For instance, the Royal Commissented sion that inquired into the fish supply of Sydney found that the increased cost of months. fish was not due to a combine, but to steadily increasing demand due to invernment creasing prosperity and changes in dolast referendum vote. mestic conditions. They reported : "" the most careful inquiry we have been mark. unable to discover any trace of the existence of any combine among the persons engaged in the distribution of fish."" There are some of the causes for the increase of prices which I do not want to see removed. For instance, I do not want to see. the standard of living lowered in any the way; but I do wish to see, as the result lose of increased efficiency and augmented power of production, the output of industry increased, so as to enable a higher to standard of living to prevail. I wish to in make one other point, in conclusion. be Honourable members opposite run away farm with the idea that the Commonwealth is the only reforming power in Australia, and that it is not possible to accomplish any of thing by anybody outside the walls of this In justice to the Parliament of Queensland, I want t tell the House that an Amending Health Act 1911 has 0 been passed in that State which is a model The amending Act alone consists of ninety-six sections. which The Queensland Parliament have tried to and bring the Health Act up to the highest supmodern standard. They have dealt with patent medicines, and have taken complete to prohibit the advertising and sale exof harmful productions of the kind in Further than that, they have taken power to deal with those appliances or apparatus which we sometimes see advertised as being capable of curing overeverything. I need only refer honourable livmembers to section 18 of the Queensland Health Act of 19n, which deals with the of sale of injurious articles.",71

450,Mr FINLAYSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member cannot deny it. Mr GROOM. I do deny it.

458,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [8.39] - The measure before the House has served as a means for the expression of opinions upon the whole of the proposed amendments of the Constitution now before the House. When these measures were submitted, I ventured to ask that they should be dealt with on their merits. The warmest supporters of honourable members opposite cannot say that they have been so considered. The general character of the criticisms has varied frcm vague generalities to efforts calculated to mislead the people as to the true issues before them. The criticism of the honourable member for Ballarat typifies admirably one conkind of treatment to which these proposals have been subjected. His metier is vague criticism, that safe and profitable line of generalities, in which there is so much scope and so little danger. A subject difficult in itself has been rendered, in the honourable member's case, ten times more difficult by reason of those pale and unhappy ghosts of his former self which rise sadly up to rebuke and contradict him. The honourable gentleman-wh o is able to throw the glamour of his eloquence over the stalest platitudes, and to weave around the most prosaic utterances that veil of romance and poetry which has been so happily satirized, but not silenced, by his colleague, the . honourable member for Flinders-len t to the discussion of this measure that attraction which I was unable to supply myself. I , stumbling and halting amongst facts, endeavoured to deal with the matter from the stand-point of a dweller upon earth; he soared amongst the clouds. I tried to present to the people facts relevant to the discussion, to review the Constitution, and the circumstances under which it had evolved, and to ask one or two pertinent questions as to the necessity for its amendment. The honourable member dwelt with rapt fervour on its esoteric beauties. Quotations from those memoranda which - the honourable member for Ballarat, in a moment which he now, I am sure, regards .as inexcusably weak, drew up and laid on the table of the House, were freely made; but they left him unmoved. I quoted also from that admirably compiled memorandum which the honourable gentieman himself sent, under his hand, to South Africa, to advise our fellow colonists there how best to build a new nation. Drawn up by Mr Garran, joint author withfchehonorable member for Bendigo of the chief text-book for students of our Constitution, it embodied the fruits of actual experience of the working of our Constitution. Mr Garran, differing widely from his collaborator, said in the most unambiguous way that the one blot on the otherwise spotless surface of the Constitution was the fact that the trade and commerce power is divided. The honourable member for Darling Downs, whose perspicacity in seeing the truth and noting it is becoming more and more evident as the days go on, endorsed that memorandum. He wrote, "" I have perused this, and I entirely agree with it , "" and with the additional endorsement of the honourable member for Ballarat, the document went its way. Yet, when I quoted from this memorandum, the honourable member for Ballarat sat unmoved. Nay, he smiied. When I quoted from that other admirable memorandum by his colleague, the honourable' member for Angas, who, after marshalling the facts, declared in the most unmistakable way that the Commonwealth was helpless to deal with trusts, and that what was wanted was an amendment of ithe Constitution, to give power to deal with "" Trusts and combines in restraint of trade in any State or part of the Commonwealth,"" this tco, left him unmoved; he merely muttered something about State rights. There is something very curious about this memorandum, and, indeed, about all cf them. I never heard from the honourable member for Bendigo, or the honourable member for Ballarat, that the proposal of the honourable member for Angas was an invasion of State rights; and yet, if anything is, that is, declaring, as does, the right of the Commonwealth to deal with trusts and combines wherever they may be found. The honourable member for Ballarat heard it, and sat there, and he sits there still, unabashed. His sole answer to all this heaped-up evidence of Ms own attitude and that of his followers is mere vague generalities. ' When we tell him that the reign of competition is so far impaired as to practically destroy those safeguards to the consumer that the science of economics, based and built up in relation to competition, had i-elied on. and that we must have new powers to meet new conditions, he says that he doubts if there is another Consti, : tution in the world so truly Federal in spirit, in the greatest part of its form, as the Federal Constitution of Australia!"" When we tell him that the people of this Mr Hughes. country, in common with the people of other countries, are exploited by combines who fix prices to suit themselves, and not to suit the public, and that there is no power to deal with those combines, he says that the word "" Federal "" never occurs in the United States Constitution, and only once in tlic Constitution of Canada; while it occurs fifteen times in the Constitution of the Commonwealth ! Consider, Mr. Speaker, what a happy fate is that of the electors of this Commonwealth ! It is true that the Coal Vend, the Shipping Combine, and the Sugar Trust are here; that the Beef Trust is starting operations; that we have cardboard soles to our boots; and that there are various other kindred blessings to be had for the asking or without in this happy country of ours; but, as a set-off to all tbese things, let us never fail to thank Heaven that the word "" Federal"" occurs fifteen times in our Constitution, while it appears only once in the Constitution of Canada. As for the United States of America, that unhappy country has been pottering along for over a century and a quarter in benighted darkness, for the blessed word ""Federal"" is not once mentioned in its Constitution. We tell him that we have no power to put in force the new Protection upon which he contested three elections-o r was it two? --let us give' him the benefit of the doubton each occasion holding this up as the one thing necessary to consummate the salvation and happiness of the people of this country. We remind him that he admits that the new Protection cannot be secured without an amendment of the Constitution. We place the facts before him, and it he says that "" If we throw away the priceless possession of a truly Federal system, capable of allowing endless development, it may be long before our posterity will recover it . "" That is, indeed, a happy saying, fit to be gibbetted along with the ""gelatinous compound,"" as the honourable member for Flinders so finely described his "" national policy of bold contour,"" though, since so describing it, he has imbibed its characteristics so as to himself present the consistency of a "" gelatinous compound."" This is the helpful contribution of the honourable member for Ballarat to the discussion of this great question. We tell him that trusts and combines are here, and point out that his lieutenants on either side have strongly urged that the necessary power shall be given to deal with them; that the honourable member for Angas has said that the Constitution ought to be amended so as to give power to deal with trusts and combines in restraint of trade wherever we find them; and he replies that the word "" Federal "" occurs in the Constitution fifteen times. We remind him that the honourable member for Flinders stated that the necessary powers cannot be exercised by the States-that trusts and combines are growing and developing, and eating like a canker into the heart ot governmental institutions-and he.' replies that if we are not careful we shall lose the "" priceless possession of the Federal spirit, and that posterity can hardly recover from the loss."" I leave the honourable member with the consolation that the beatific contemplation of the word "" Federal "" occurring fifteen times in the Constitution can give to such a gentleman as himself. I come now to the honourable member for Bendigo, who ventured from that safe - I was going to say "" and profitable,"" but if has hardly proved so in his case-lin e of generalities in which his chief indulged, and reverted to details. I wish to give the honourable member for Bendigo every credit for an attempt to deal with this matter from the only stand-point from which it ought to be dealt, namely, the stand-point of facts-h e is the only honourable member on that side who made the remotest attempt to grapple with the question in detail. He has furnished the country ancl the House with a list of the powers that the Commonwealth will be able to exercise if the trade and commerce amendment be made. The list is rather an imposing one. The honourable member for Ballarat has said that this list has been put forward, and that no one has contradicted it . I do not know whether honourable members have read the list; but I think that the people of the country will be inclined to regard it as too long to read. however, they will net therefore accept it . If the list is examined, it will be seen that the honourable member for Bendigo has contrived this imposing array of subjects over which the Commonwealth will have power in a very simple, yet most effective, way. He does it by repetition. He, first of all, states a thing generally, and then states it in particular; in this way he swells n meagre list to four or five times its length. I invite honourable members to look at the items. Some of them have their amusing side, and shew to what straits the honourable member has been driven to swell its proportions. In the list of subjects on which, according to the honourable member, the States, if the Bills before us be carried, will not be able to legislate exclusively are "" The regulation of traction engines."" It is seriously contended that the States' position in regard to traction engines will be impaired. This is intolerable. Then we are told that the control of marine stores and old metals, which represent, I suppose, an industry as old as the world itself, will pass from the States, which will no. longer be able to deal with people who ' go round purchasing odds and ends, and endeavour to make an honest, and sometimes lucrative, living. Such a' thing is an outrage. Then in regard to Sundays and holidays the States will not be able to legislate- I do not knew why. but the honourable member has s^id so. Then we are told that the States will lose their rights over local option, the licensing laws, and the regulation and sale of intoxicants and other goods. It is very sad. But we must bear up. Things are really not so bad as they appear. The States will be able to deal with many of these matters under their police powers, even if the Commonwealth acquires the powers asked for and exercises tbem. Some of the items on his list will clearly remain to the States. Let me give an instance. According to him, the State legislation regarding poisons and explosives, chemists and druggists, will be interfered with. He seriously suggests that this Parliament may legislate for the regulation of every retail chemist's and druggist's shop throughout the Commonwealth. I do not agree with him. If the power asked is given to us, we shall not have authority to deal with such matters. The opinion of the honourable member for Flinders, expressed very full y when this measure was before the I hope, Parliament in 1910, shows this. The interpretation of the Canadian Constitution given in Parsons v. Citizens Insurance Company shows clearly that the Canadian commerce power, which goes further than this proposal, does not preclude the State from making laws for the local regulation of commerce within its borders. That is retained under its police powers. It will be retained by the States here. The same thing applies to most of the other items on his list. The honourable member has enumerated many kinds of the shopkeepers over whom the States w i . l lose control. This is not so. The States would retain power to deal with them. So much for the honourable member's list. Let me now show the other side. Here are some - of the matters which will be left to the ' States when the constitutional amendments have been carriedLand and settlement, agriculture, &c. Development and protection of natural resources-roads , forests, fisheries, game, mines, water conservation and irrigation, &c. Education-primary , secondary, and higher. Public health and morals. Social relations. Manufacture, except as to combinations and monopolies. Industrial law generally, except as regards labour and employment.' Criminal law generally. Civil law generally-contracts, torts, real and personal property, inheritance, &c. Liquor and Licensing. State Constitution and Government! Municipal and local government. State Railways (except arbitration or industrial disputes). State works and undertakings. State monopolies. State taxation. State insurance within the State. State banking within the State. State Public Service. Administration of justice and legal procedure. Police. Intra-State Commerce on State Railways. In addition to the exclusive powers over all - these vitally important matters, the State .Parliaments will be able to legislate in regard to trade and commerce, corporations, labour and employment, combinations and monopolies, and all other matters not exclusively vested in the Federal Parliament. None of the proposed amendments does vest exclusive powers in this Parliament, therefore, so far as the field is not covered by Federal laws, the States can legislate freely. This list has not been lengthened by putting down things generally and then again in detail. It is a plain statement of the wide general powers of legislation remaining to the States. It shows how unfounded is the contention that the carrying of these amendments will mean Unification and the emasculation of the powers of the States. I come now to another point dealt with by the honourable member. The honourable 'member admits that trusts and combines may be bad, but he says that the law as it Stands is sufficient to deal with them. I quote from his speechI give the Ministry credit for their amendments of last session, and I think that that piece of anti-trust legislation may be regarded as one of the world's masterpieces of anti-trust and anti-combine legislation. TJnder due administration it would be found to be more destructive of trusts, combines, and monopolies than either the Sherman Act or any other legislation of the United States. He thinks that it is easier to secure a conviction against trusts under our laws than Mr Htighes. in America under the Sherman Act, but the exact opposite is the truth. According to the honourable member, we have only to prove that a combinationis in restraint of trade. That is not so. Before a prosecution can be instituted, the Attorney General must be satisfied that there has been restraint of trade, that it .was unreasonable, and that it was to the detriment of the public. And all these must be proved before a prosecution can succeed. The High Court has held that it is not sufficient to prove restraint of trade; the restraint must be unreasonable and detrimental to the public - That is made clear from the judgment in the Vend appeal case. In order to make the position quite clear I asked the Crown Solicitor whether the statement of the honourable member was correct. He has supplied me with a memorandum in which he says that it was not. In regard to the Sherman Act, the section requires proof only of restraint of trade. There is nothing in that Act about the restraint being unreasonable or detrimental to the public, but the Supreme Court of the United States of America in the Standard Oil case, and afterwards in the Tobacco Trust case, held that the word "" unreasonable "" must be read into the Act. Therefore, although the language of the Act is as I have said, yet two things must be proved to secure a conviction under the Sherman Act-that there was restraint of trade and that it was unreasonable. Here, as I have shown, three things have to be proved. The word "" unreasonable "" was read into the Sherman Act by the Supreme Court of the United States of America, and into our Act by the High Court. The honourable member for Bendigo says that our Act is the most efficient legislation in the world for dealing with trusts and combines. If he means that it is as efficient as the Sherman Act, I shall not contradict his statement, because that Act has been proved, by a series of lamentable and pathetic failures, extending over a period of twenty years, to be the most inept and inefficient piece of legislation for its purpose ever drafted. Not one trust has been crushed by it, the trusts prosecuted being all stronger after conviction than before. The honourable member contends that we have power now to deal with all trusts, and that we did not succeed in the Vend appeal case because we failed in our facts. Let us look at the matter a little closely. If we failed to justify our contention that there was such restraint of trade as was in fact detrimental to the pubhc we cannot. complain, and it may be, as he says, not necessary to amend the law. But the facts are strongly against such a contention. Here I feel constrained to point out thab the Vend appeal case had no relation to what is known as the Vend agreement. By misrepresenting the position the honourable members for Hunter and Newcastle and myself have been unfairly attacked. The agreement, attacked was not the Vend agreement nor the Shipping Combine agreement, .but that between the Combine and the Vend. As to the insufficiency of our facts to justify conviction, I say that, in proportion tb the trade dealt with, they proved the existence of a greater and more complete monopoly than the Standard Oil Trust or the Tobacco Trust in America, both of which were convicted under the Sherman Act. Mr Justice Isaacs, speaking of certain acts by members of the Vend, saidThe condition "" all or none"" was in the circumstances a powerful, ancl, indeed, a resistless, weapon. Summing up this transaction, the combination enlisted in their service both force and fraud. I have already mentioned the extent to which prices were raised. Mr Justice Isaacs saidNo one acquainted with the facts, and who thought for an instant, could have any doubt that the result of the combination and its operations would in all probability be to bring about the detrimental consequences which I have narrated. The conclusion to be drawn from these and similar instances is that the defendant collieries intended, with regard to the competitive conditions in the Inter-State and Newcastle coal trade, there should, as far as possible, be a clean slate. For the plain guiding principle of the combination was to sweep away by artificial arrangements whatever protection the public might have against the terms of price, choice, and other ditions of supply, which the will of the tion might at any moment think opportune to dictate I have no doubt, and I cannot imagine any doubt, existing, that the intention of the defendants was to monopolize, in the sense in which I have explained that term. They intended to efface competition in every form-competitio n of production, which is only material as bearing on the Inter-State trade in the article when produced-and competition of carriage. They intended to grasp into one huge hand the whole Inter-State supply of Newcastle coal. I have no hesitation in concluding that the elimination of competition was the main and central object of the whole combination complained of. To these excerpts from the Judge's own words two facts only need be added: first, that the operations of the agreement extended over the whole of the four States, Queensland, Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia; that it raised the price of coal and carriage 30, 40, and even 50 per cent.; and, secondly, that it was a combination between persons who owned 90 per cent, of the coal and persons who owned 90 per cent, of the carriage. In other words, it was virtually a monopoly- a complete one-of a vital necessity of modern civilized life! We proved all these things, yet the Court says they did ' not constitute detriment to the public. The honourable member says that these facts were not sufficient to secure a conviction. If that be so, we shall never get a conviction against any trust in this country He says, in the face of these facts, that the law is sufficient, without amendment, to deal with trusts and combines. He asks, "" Why do you not prosecute other trusts? What about the Tobacco Trust? What about the Sugar Trust?"" He declares that we have plenty of power to prosecute them. I will deal with these statements. In the first place I would like to say, both in regard to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company and the Tobacco Company, that these companies are concerned in manufacturing as well as in distributing. As the honourable member knows, the case of the United States v. E. C. Knight and Company laid down .that the power to deal with trade and commerce does not include the power to deal with manufactures. That case has settled the law on that point, and it shows clearly that, although, as in this case, combinations may exist which control the whole of the refineries, and therefore the whole of the sugar output, yet the Sherman Act could not deal with them because those combinations were only in relaitdon to manufacture, con- and not in relation to Inter-State commerce; combina- and the same thing applies here.",72
459,Mr GLYNN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The company was convicted ten years afterwards.,76
460,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I am rather glad of it. But I do not think that affects the question. The law is as I have said. If the corripany was convicted ten years afterwards, it was not convicted because it was monopolizing the manufacture of sugar.",76
461,Mr GLYNN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Because it suppressed the manufacture of that article. - Mr HUGHES - I submitted this matter to the Crown Solicitor. The honourable member says, "" Why do you not prosecute the Tobacco Trust?"" Now, the operafions of that Trust were inquired into by a Royal Commission, which took evidence and submitted a report. That report states that it would be idle to endeavour to deal with the Trust by means of a manipulation of the Tariff, and that it would be useless attempting to dissolve it into its constituent elements. That is to say, that no remedy under the Anti-Trust Act would touch it. It points out that the only effectual remedy is to be found in the nationalization of the industry. The 'report stated' that there was no evidence to show that any control was exercised over the retail trade, owing to which the retailers were excluded from buying tobacco elsewhere. that fact was established in the Vend case. There was no means of getting coal except through the Vend, there was no"" means of getting carriage except through the Combine. Those who tried to do it were crushed. Yet we were unable to get a conviction in the Vend case. But the honourable member says that we could get a conviction against the Tobacco Trust, although the evidence taken by the Royal Commission showed that no attempt was made by the Trust to compel retailers to deal only with it. And the Royal Commission expressly stated that such aotion was useless. I have here a departmental report dealing with this subject. On 28th December, 1907, when honourable members opposite were in office, the Crown Solicitor was asked whether there was sufficient evidence to justify a prosecution of the Tobacco Trust. That was asked after the operations of the Trust had been investigated by a Royal Commission. In replyhe wroteI have already advised that the papers previously submitted do not contain evidence of any unlawful combination, or any breach of the provisions of the Australian Industries Preservashown tion Act 1906. . . . There is no evidence to show that in Australia the combine has up to the present time endeavoured to force a policy of exclusive dealing in their goods on the retailers. I am of opinion that the evidence submitted is not sufficient to justify proceedings against the combination known as the Tobacco Combine for entering into or continuing in a combination in contravention of the Australian Industries Preservation Act. That is the answer to the honourable member's inquiry as to why we do not prosecute the Tobacco Trust. It is an answer which has been in the Department, and at the disposal of honourable members opposite who have been asking this question, for years. It is they who asked fer this advice, it is they who acted upon it, and it is they who evidently did not care to prosecute the Mr Hughes. Trust. Then we are asked, "" Why do you not prosecute the Sugar Trust?""",76
462,Mr DEAKIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,You altered the law.,77
463,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The policy of - honourable members opposite has always been to do nothing. The Crown Solicitor, to whom I have referred this matter, writesI t would be madness to prosecute, in the light of the Ful l Court judgment in the Vend case. The Sugar Commission attempted to make inquiry, and were blocked by the Full . Court. Although Sir John Quick says they are engaged in Inter-State trade, the Ful l Court held that the Commonwealth had no power to inquire into the domestic affairs of the company. That is reserved to the State. But Yet the honourable member for Bendigo says that we can prosecute the Sugar Trust. The Crown Solicitor, who is as good an authority in this matter as is the honourable member, affirms that it would be madness to do so. He declares that when we were endeavouring to get the materials to prosecute them we were blocked on every hand, and that we could not inquire into their domestic affairs, because that power is reserved to the States. The company have refineries in four States. Theirs is largely an Intrastate trade. They refine in Sydney, presumably for New South Wales; they refine in Melbourne for Victoria; they refine in Adelaide for South Australia and Western Australia, and they refine in Brisbane for Queensland. The greater part of their trade is therefore Intra-State, and not Inter-State, and in any case they are engaged in manufacture, and not in trade. These are the reasons why we have not prosecuted the Sugar Trust or the Tobacco Trust. The reasons why we have not prosecuted other trusts have been supplied by the honourable member for Angas. He declared it to be useless. The Vend case has it to be so. The Opposition slept peacefully on this question for years, and never attempted to wake up until ten days before we took office. The dead could not have slept more peacefully than they did all' that time. They did nothing except write memoranda, urging an amendment of the Constitution to deal with combines. Now they say : Why clo you not prosecute without amending the Constitution ? The Anti-Trust Act is not sufficient. It is quite futile. We cannot prosecute the Sugar Trust, or the Tobacco Trust, or any other trust. We are powerless. These gentlemen who crv out now, "" Why do not you prosecute more trusts?"" when they were in office for eight years, prosecuted none. I turn now to the honourable member for Flinders, whose attitude is most remarkable. He quoted from a speech which I delivered at a railway union social in Melbourne, at which it was asserted that I said, "" We must bring clown prices, profits, and rents, and then everything else would come down."" Upon that statement he built his elaborate edifice. He said, "" That shows what the Labour party are doing."" I wish to say that if the honourable member will look at the statement attributed to me he will see that it is downright nonsense. What I said was that unless we regulate prices the regulation of wages is futile. What I said was that unless we bring down prices and profits, which are another form of prices, everything which we are endeavouring to lift up will come down. That is, unless we bring down prices ancl profits, wages must come down. That is my position. The other is just nonsense. Unless we regulate prices, what is the use of putting up wages, for, as fast as we raise them, prices are increased, so that the whole business has to be gone over again? What I said on the occasion referred to is what I am saying now, and any man who reads the report of my speech will see it . Then the honourable member ridiculed my statement that prices could be regulated. He said in effect, "" How futile and absurd it is to tell people that we can regulate prices."" He then gave an illustration of what would happen if we attempted to regulate the - price of bread. He said that we should then have to regulate the price of flour, the price of wheat, the price of labour, and the price of machinery to the farmer. He declared that it was absurd to attempt to regulate prices, and that I knew it to be absurd. It appears that I am protean in his eyes. At one time he alludes to my cynical frankness, and at another I appear to him as a sort of Mollah, whose followers gyrate about him, regarding his every action with a slavish devotion usually reserved to the gods. But there was nothing subtle or ambiguous about my statement. What I said was what I meant. What I said then I say now. In that I have the advantage over the honourable member. I said it then, and I say it now. without any hesitation at all, that unless we can regulate prices and profits all our laborious efforts to preserve industrial peace by substituting arbitration for strikes must be futile. If it is right to regulate .wages, how can it be wrong to regulate prices ? We ought to recognise . itI believe that the honourable member for Flinders, in his heart, does recognise it, and is opposed to both. He says,, indeed, .plainly, that all this business of Wages Boards and Arbitration Courts is wrong, - but honourable members opposite- I do not know whether they are his colleagues, his followers, or his leaders - d o not say this. They say that Wages Boards are good things, and that the regulation of wages is a good thing. I say that the regulation of wages is as much fixed by the natural law of supply and demand as is the regulation of prices. What applies to one applies to the other. What does a union do, and what does a Wages Board do? A union corners the supply of labour and says, "" You cannot have labour excepting at a certain price."" and if the corner is effective, the union gets, within reason, what it asks for. If a. Wages Board says that the wages of such and such a man shall be so much, what is that but a corner in labour? The law says ynu cannot get a plumber unless you pay him 12s. a day, and straight away the price of the labour of a plumber for one dav is T.2S. There is no natural law of supply and demand in such a case, but we hear no complaint about the invasion and the terrible consequences that follow from the invasion of the natural law of supply and demand. But when we attempt to deal with prices it is a different matter. The honourable member for Flinders says that prices cannot be fixed. I say, on the other hand, that not only can prices be fixed, but that prices are fixed every day. The honourable gentleman, in support of his contention, referred generally to the teachings of the economists. When I made the speech referred to, the Age, in criticising my remarks, said that I knew very well that this was heresy, that John M ill , Ricardo, and Adam Smith liad said so-and-so. When I found the Protectionist Age quoting M ill , Ricardo, and Adam Smith, I was amazed, and said, "" Can the prophets of Baal have come to worship and f all down at the then altars of Jehovah "" ? However, it was so. The honourable member for Flinders says that economists declare that prices cannot be fixed; that the natural law of supply I say, and demand must operate. I propose to make a few quotations to show what modern economists do say. I should premise by saying that some gentlemen have never 'read political economy since the revolution in production which necessitated a revolution in political economy. Henry R. Seager, Professor of Political Economy of the Columbia University, quoted in the Annals of the American Acadetny of Political and Social Science for July, .1912, saysI am quite prepared, however, for the discovery that under a rigime of free combination the giant producer will, in certain industries, have such great advantages that competition will cease to be an active force, as it has so largely in the railroad industry. In this event, I should feel constrained to advocate Government regulation of prices, just as most of us now advocate Government regulation of railroad rates. I should feel that the choice between Government' regulation of prices and Government ownership and operation could not be fairly based on the ground that one policy is more dangerously socialistic than the other. Government ownership and operation of railways is accepted as a matter of course in Germany, and Germans even believe that they can prove that their system is better than ours of private ownership and operation. Germany has also gone a good wav towards actually controlling, if not completely owning and operating, some of the trusts, like the Potash Trust. I come now to W. H . Dawson's The Evolution of Modern Germany. At page 171 I find the following"" Never before,"" wrote the Austrian Consul in Berlin to his Government in 1906, "" was economic Germany so entirely under the absolute rule of a group of men, barely fifty in number; in no former period of industrial expansion was the old formula of 'the free play of forces' abandoned to such a degree as in 1906, when the momentous decisions as to the extent of production, sales abroad, prices, the granting of credit, the raising of.new capital, and the fixing of wages and rates of interest, lay in the hands of a few persons found at the head of the large banks, mammoth industrial undertakings, and great cartels."" At page 199 of the same work I find a statement made by Professor Gustav Schmoller, a distinguished political economist of Germany, not a Socialist, who was at one time bitterly opposed to Government interference with the object of fixing prices. Speaking of a cartel,, which is a form of trust, he says The gentlemen of the cartels say, "" Do leave us alone, and do not disturb our circle."" That is exactly what Mr Knox saysWe should be glad enough to do that, if only the cartels and syndicates would leave us alone. The syndicates have, however, enormously increased the price of coal, and colliery shares have, as a result, increased from 40 or 50 to 300 and 400 per cent. Formerly, placed in the foreground the principle, "" all economic development depends on free competition,"" and now suddenly the contrary holds good, for the cartels destroy all competition and set up monopolies in its place. . . . I am no friend of nationalization, but I.have no doubt that if we had a Minister of the strength Mr Hughes. r (Trade and Commerce) Bill. and decision of Prince Bismarck, the collieries in the Ruhr district, at least, would have been nationalized. In any event, it is necessary that the State should acquire an influence on the syndicates. A mere veto on an increase of prices, however, is not enough; the State must use its influence to secure a reduction of prices. Now I come to J. A. Hobson, one of the most noted of modern economists, who, at page 156 in his work on The Evolution of Modem Capitalism, saysIt is all-important to an understanding of the subject to recognise that a monopoly price and a competitive price are determined by the operation of an entirely different set of economic forces. The loose opinion that it must be to the interests of the trust or other monopoly to sell at the same price as would be fixed by competition is quite groundless. . . . These considerations show that the power of a trust or other monopoly over prices is determined by a number of intricate forces which react upon one another with varying degrees of pressure, according as the quantity of supply is increased or diminished. But a trust is always able to charge prices in excess of competitive prices, and it is generally its interest to do so. It will commonly be to the interest of a trust or other monopoly to maintain a lower scale of prices in those commodities which are luxuries, or satisfy some less urgent and more capricious taste, and to maintain . high prices where the article of monopoly is a common comfort or a prime necessary of life, for which there is no easily available substitute. It is the poor who are always most easily and shamefully exploited. In the face of these statements, wili honourable members opposite continue to say that economists deny that prices can and ought to befixed? Will they say so in the face of the fact that the evidence shows that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company fixes prices for sugar in Australia? There is, in fact, no other seller of sugar except the Millaquin Company, and, as they have admitted in evidence, they fix their pr.ce by arrangement, and whatever the Colonial Sugar Refining Company say the price shall be, the Millaquin Company sell at the same price. Will honourable members now say that the price of sugar is not fixed in Australia ?",77
464,Mr GLYNN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Coul d we not fix prices now in relation to Inter-State commerce? It is said that they can in America, and the Commission recommended it.",79
465,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The honourable member for Angas is not a humourist, of course. He asks me whether we could legislation not fix prices in Inter-State commerce, and not in Intra-State commerce. What is the use of such a power, even if we had it? Would that satisfy any one? Would it help any one? We have a sugar refinery at Yarraville, and the sugar refined there is sold in Melbourne. We cannot fix the price of that because it is .not Inter-State commerce. This applies to nearly all the States. Cannot' the honourable gentleman see that if we could fix the price of some sugar, and not of all sugar, we should not be able really to fix the. price of any, because the price of the sugar over which we should have no control would determine the market? It is a well known principle that unless you can control the whole market, or a certain proportion, at all events, you cannot fix prices in that market at all. But the practice of fixing prices is general. I have here a copy of the rules of the Victorian Mill-owners' Association. This is an association to fix the minimum prices respectively at which members of the association may sell roller flour, sharps, pollard, bran, and wheaten meal respectively in any locality in the State of Victoria. They manage to fix prices in this wayThe Committee may offer and pay a reward not exceeding ^50 to any person, including a traveller, but not being a member, giving such information with respect to a breach of this agreement as shall lead to a member being proved to have committed such breach, and the Committee may also pay to any such informer, including a traveller, not being a member, the whole or any part of any fine paid by a member committing a breach. That is a quotation from a copy of their agreement. They are prepared to pay a reward of ^ 5 0 for proof that any member of the association has dared to charge any less than the minimum price fixed. I find, again, that the New Zealand Commission that inquired into the cost of living decided that the Merchants' Association of New Zealand constituted a monopoly, that they fix prices, and that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company fix prices. They reportThe Commission has definite proof that the members of this association have banded together for the purpose of restraining trade in their own interests, and boycotting independent traders. .Where they have succeeded in securing control of imported and locally-produced commodities their operations have been followed by increased prices. My time is up, or I could multiply cases where prices are fixed almost indefinitely. I cannot follow it out as I could wish, but I say that the instances which could be cited to show that prices are fixed are so numerous and so wide in their application that any man who would deny that prices are fixed today must go about the world with his eyes [229] shut. Prices are fixed, and by persons outside the scope of the Jaw. We demand that prices shall be fixed by persons under the law. One more point, and a most vital one. I did not recommend any such absurdity as our fixing the retail prices of goods. No such absurd suggestion was ever put forward by this side. The honourable gentleman talked about difficulty with the baker, butcher, and retailers generally. That is an objection which must be brushed aside.",79
466,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Oh , j-ou stop with the miller, do you?",80
467,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I shall tell the honourable member in two words where we stop, but not in his words. There is one broad principle to be applied in this matter. Where there is competition it is'not necessary to regulate prices-the y regulate themselves ; but where there is no competition it is necessary to regulate prices. On that broad principle we stand. Where there is competition there is no necessity to regulate prices: we are entirely with the honourable gentleman and. his laisscz faire school on this point.",80
468,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"And now you are speaking for the Government, I take it ?",80
469,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I am speaking for myself.,80
470,Mr ATKINSON,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"You said "" we.""",80
471,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,If the honourable member for Flinders wishes to set himself up as a questioner of the Opposition,80
472,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,No .,80
473,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I ask him if he is authorized to put that question? I ask him which were his true sentiments-thos e expressed in 1910, or those expressed today ?",80
474,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Bot h the same.,80
475,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I ask the honourable member whether, in 19.10, when he said that this ought to be done, he was speaking then as he felt? How have things altered in the meantime? T know how they have altered.",80
476,Mr WH IRVINE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We have had two years' experience of you.,80
477,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"They have altered because when the honourable gentleman ventured to assert his independence there were ominous crackings, there were leading articles, minatory and unmistakable, stating that this was not the time nor the manner to show independence, that there were various methods in which it could be shown, and that his were most undesirable. Then the honourable member who stigmatized the ""policy of bold contour"" as ""a gelatinous compound "" got up here and said, "" It is true, I believe, that trade and merce ought to be handed over to the Commonwealth ; it is true, I believe, that industrial powers ought to be handed over the Commonwealth; it is true, I think, that trusts and combines are the greatest danger of modern civilization; but I am going to vote against these very necessary measures, although I said in 1910 they were necessary, and if they were put singly I would vote for them. I am going to vote against every one of them because Labour is in office."" What does that mean-""becaus e Labour is in office?"" Is it not a fatal admission of impending defeat at the hands of the people? For what is the position? Before we can have one of those powers to exercise, the people must have returned us to power, and given us the required majority in approval of these measures at the referenda. Here, then, is a revelation, unconscious, but complete, of the honourable member's real opinions. It is not, as he and they say, that they are going to the country to sweep the polls. If they were they would say, "" Give the powers to us who will use them wisely, not to those men who will use them as spendthrifts and prodigals."" We shall not be here, to the vociferous Greek chorus opposite. From that side we shall see these honourable gentlemen on the Treasury Bench, clothed with ample powers-to do what? To do nothing. The honourable member for Flinders said that we want those powers-that Parliament ought to have them. He will be on this side, according to his boast, next time; what will he do ? He is going out to tell the people not to give those powers to the Labour Archibald, party. Why ? If we are on the other side, Bennett, B. H . what will it matter if the Parliament has Brennan, F . the powers? We shall not be able to use Brown, Thomas them unless we have a majority. What Cann, they fear, then, is that they are going out, Catts, J. H . not to victory, but to defeat. Is not this a recognition that the real Fenton, j . E. nature of the crime we have committed is Finlayson, W. F . lhat we are where we are. They fear the Foster, people will again return us because we have Frazer, C. E. done what we said we would do. The Higgs, W. G. people believe in us and intend to support Howe, R. us. The Opposition charge us with a Jensen, hundred and one offences, but the greatest Johnson, W. J. offence of all is that we are here, and have Mahon, H . Mr Hughet. been true to our pledges. We are going to the country now, and the honourable member says that we are.going to do this and htat comfoolish, or wrong thing, if these powers are granted. But it is not what he says, but what our party manifesto to will say, before the election, that matters to the electors. There will be set down in black and white the uses to which we propose to put the new powers if we get them. By that we shall stand or fall, and none of the misrepresentations, none of the efforts of the other side, which misrepresent us, will avail. The people willlook at our record; they will say, "" These men said last time that they would do so-and-so, and they did it. They said that they would not do so-and-so, and they did not do it. They are men of their word; their manifesto says ' If you will give us so-and-so, we shall only do so-and-so; then we shall come back to you, and if we want to use the power any more we shall tell you the extent*to whirh we will use it.'

I appeal to the Leader of the Opposition to, if possible, arrange a time when we may conclude the debate on the second reading of the five other Constitution Alteration Bills which have been discussed, practically, on the Bill, the third reading of which has just been agreed to. I am in hopes that a time tomorrow might be fixed, but if that is not possible, we shall endeavour, of course, to meet the convenience of honourable members. It would, I think, be more convenient to most of us if the debate on the whole of the five Bills were concluded before we take a vote, and on this point we may arrive at an understanding tomorrow. We desire to conserve, as far as possible, the time at our disposal, without, of course, unduly restricting any honourable member. It was understood that the principle of all the Bills would be discussed in the debate which has just closed.",82

We on this side are merely desirous to emphasize some of the features of the measures by criticism which we think is due, especially in regard to labour and employment. That embodies proposals of the widest character. I venture to believe that there will be no undue protraction of the debate, either by individual speeches, or in the whole time occupied. The stage of the session at which we have arrived makes us the more anxious to co-operate in the most effective way consistent with the full and free expression of opinion on all important questions involved.",83

I stated that the Government of Queensland had not done so, and I made the statement on the authority of a report of a deputation which waited on Mr Denham, the Premier.",83
486,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Is the Minister making a personal explanation?,83
487,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes . The honourable member for Darling Downs has shown me a copy of the Queensland Act, in which there is a section prohibiting the sale of footwear containing material other than leather; but, according to the report of the deputation in the Brisbane Courier of 22nd August last, the Government have suspended the operation of that section for twelve months. Mr Denham, in reply to the deputation, said he understood that their request did not involve any deceitful representation to the public as to the goods in question. He also said that ""the deputation had impressed him with the reasonableness of their views, and he would undertake to extend the suspension until 3Tst December, 1913.""",83

491,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I understand that the honourable member rose to a point of order, but I have yet to learn what that point of order is.",83

493,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I asked the Ministei whether he was making a personal explanation, but I think he went a bit further. I may point out, however, that on the adjournment of the House the Minister could have brought the matter up independently of any personal explanation; and, under the circumstances, he is in order.",83

496,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I did not rule in that direction.,83
497,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"In Queensland there is a complete and more up-to-date Health Act than, I suppose, in any other State in the Commonwealth, as I think the Minister of Trade and Customs will admit. Mr TUDOR. - I believe it to be one of the best; but, of course, it depends entirely on the administration.",83
498,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"All Acts depend on the .administration, but the real question raised was as to the existence of such State Acts. The Queensland Amending Act 1911, which is very lengthy, is based, on the latest legislation in the United States of America, and some of the sections bring it into line with - the corresponding New South Wales and Victorian Acts. It deals withadulteration - of foods, false description of goods, advertised articles, disinfectants, bread, short weights, and, indeed, all that is necessary : in an Act of the kind. My point is that' the Queensland Government have done as much as the Commonwealth could do if it were given complete power.",84
499,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We should make the Act operative and not suspend it. "" Mr GROOM - It was stated that the whole of the Queensland Act had been suspended, but as a matter of fact only one or two sections have not been put into operation for the time being, and for good - reasons, which are shown in the following - extract from the report of the .deputation already referred to:Mr J. Gray (President), W. Robertson, Lade, W. Read, and J. S. Heathwood, members of the Boot and Shoe Retailers Association of Queensland, with the Secretary (Mr S. Earle), were introduced to the Chief Secretary yesterday by Mr Jas. Allan, M . L . A . , and a case was mitted for certain alterations in the Health Act. The deputation pointed out"" that the Act prohibited the sale of footwear containing material other than leather. No objection was offered to this in respect to the strbnger classes of footwear for ordinary rough and wet 'weather wear, but - there were other 'classes of goods, such as dancing shoes, fancy shoes, and certain classes - of slippers, which people insisted upon having, and which could not be made wholly of leather - to suit public requirements. Are not some of these being admitted, under the Customs Act?",84
500,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Provide d that they are branded ; but they can be made in Queens- - the land without being branded.,84
501,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"There is a Queensland . section-sectio n 31-dealin g with the advised question of their manufacture and To continue the quotation-As a matter of fact one of the greatest difficulties in the construction of footwear had overcome by the invention of a material known public health. as leatherboard, the use of which would not allowed under the Act. It was pointed out the Commonwealth laws allowed the importation of goods such as the public wanted, and the tion of the Queensland Act would simply drive admits. the trade to southern firms, who were enabled - to post their goods to any part of Queensland. The Government had suspended the operations bf this particular section for twelve months;.hut the dealers wished to have some, finality, in .the matter. A letter was read from, a firm of English manufacturers, stating that under"" the hew conditions it would be impossible - to 'manufacture goods for the Queensland market, ,as no English goods of any quality were manufactured entirely of leather. The deputation objected farther to the provision of section 32 of the Act;.''which compelled the stamping of the manufacturer's name on the sole of all footwear. They - were uite prepared to stamp the names of their, own rms as retailers, and to stand behind their own reputations. The deputation submitted a draft of the Bill which they held would meet their .requirements, and which was said to be similar to an Act of South Australia. Mr Denham, in reply, pointed out that the : Commission on Uniform Standards would shortly be sitting in Brisbane, and he suggested that those interested in the trade should give evidence before the Commissionupon this subject. He understood from their request that it did not involve any injury to public health, nor any deceitful representation to the public as to the goods in question.",84
502,Mr TXJDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,It does.,84
503,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"They say not. There is no prohibition against these goods being admitted into the Commonwealth if they are branded. The Queensland authorities are blamed for permitting what the ComJ. L . monwealth does not prohibit. Further, they had said that if the provision became operative it would simply meanthe trade going from the Queensland firms to the sub- southern houses, who could supply the demand through the post. He did . not know that he could introduce any legislation on the subject this year; the Government programme for the season was so extremely full that he doubted that they could get through all that was now included. He would like also to await the results of the sitting of the Royal Commission in Brisbane. Meanwhile, they had impressed him with the reasonableness of their views, and he would undertake the suspension of these particular sections until .31st December, 1913. .Only particular sections, not the whole Act, as was suggestedThe provisions in question had emanated from Commissioner of Public Health, and there must be some reason behind them. He. was full y seized with the unwisdom of embarrassing trade, and would endeavour to relieve their difficulties as he had said. Meanwhile, he strongly them to submit any evidence they had to sale. adduce to Dr Ashburton Thomson. We are all agreed as to the importance of been, legislation for the preservation of the The Minister now admits be that we have the most up-to-date legislathat tion in Queensland, and Queensland only operaallows the sale of what the Commonwealth",84
504,Mr TUDOR,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"But the Commonwealth requires the articles to be branded to show what they are made of, whereas the Queensland authorities permit them to be sold without any such brand.",84
505,Mr SCULLIN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,That is the whole point.,85
506,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No , the vital point was the existence of the Act. We were told that the Queensland Government ought to prohibit the sale of certain goods, but we find that the Commonwealth does not absolutely prohibit their importation. I admit, and have always contended, that the public ought to know what they are buying.",85
