2,Mr SPEAKER,MEMBER SWORN,"I have received a return to the writ which I issued on 3 March 1995 for the election of a member to serve for the electoral division of Wentworth, in the state of New South Wales, to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Dr John Hewson. By the endorsement on the writ, it is certified that Andrew Peter Thomson has been elected. Mr Andrew Peter Thomson made and subscribed the oath of allegiance.",11
3,Mr HOWARD,MEMBER SWORN," Mr Speaker, with indulgence, on behalf of the federal coalition I would like right! to welcome Andrew Thomson as the new member for Wentworth. He follows a very distinguished line of previous members, including a former federal Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson; a former federal Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, Sir Eric Harrison, who held the seat until 1956; a former federal Treasurer, Mr Leslie Bury; and a former Commonwealth Attorney-General, Mr Bob Ellicott. NA Hansard 1995 (SEVENTH PERIOD) 1995, pursuant to resolution, adjourned to to that resolution the House of Representatives The House will understand my recording my pleasure in the fact that Mr Thomson won the seat of Wentworth with an 11 per cent two-party preferred swing, which was a very conspicuous result, despite the fact that the by-election was held in an unconscionably and unreasonably short period of time, deliberately designed to make things uncomfortable for those who decided to enter the list. I also record the fact that the Australian Labor Party did not even have the guts to run a candidate. On a personal note, I also say that the new member for Wentworth is probably the first person elected as a member of the national parliament of Australia who is fluent in the Mandarin and Japanese languages as well as, of course, English. I think it is very significant given the emphasis on these things on both sides of politics.",11

7,Mr KEATING,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,"Blaxland-Prime Minister) Mr Speaker, with your indulgence, I join the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) in welcoming the new member. It is a seat which the Liberal Party has held certainly in all the time that I have been here, probably since Federation. It is changing, of course. Mr Moore--You are going to live there.",11
8,Mr KEATING,PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES,"The fact that I will live there makes it even more important than it is today. The one thing members of the Liberal Party can be reasonably assured about, particularly after the last election, is that at least Bradfield and Wentworth will remain two seats that they can hold in New South Wales. At least they can hang onto two. But there are not many more than that, Mr Speaker. That said, it is always a great moment in anybody's life to be elected to the House of Representatives. It is an occasion each of us who has come here remembers, and I am sure all of us would like our new honourable friend to remember it as well as we were given the grace to remember it ourselves. NA Bunting, Sir Edward John",12
9,Mr SPEAKER,CONDOLENCES,"I inform the House of the death on Tuesday, 2 May 1995, of Sir John Bunting, AC, KBE.",12
10,Mr KEATING,CONDOLENCES," Mr Speaker, I seek your indulgence to say a couple of words about Sir John Bunting. One would need to have been around here quite a long time to have known Sir John Bunting when he was an official. A number of members here, including the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), would have known him as an official. I think the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) may have. Some other people in the bureaucracy would have known him. Some members who have been here a long time would have known him. It is with sadness, certainly on behalf of the government and, I am sure, of the opposition, that I record the death of Sir John Bunting in Sydney on Tuesday, 2 May 1995 at the age of 76. Sir John Bunting was born in Ballarat, Victoria, in 1918. He was educated at Trinity Grammar School and later at Melbourne University, where he graduated in 1938 with a Bachelor of Arts, Honours. Sir John began his Public Service career in 1940 and served in successive positions with the Department of Trade and Customs and the Department of Post-war Reconstruction. He demonstrated a keen and meticulous approach to public service that gained him an envied reputation with superiors and colleagues alike. In 1950 Sir John was appointed to the Prime Minister's Department as assistant secretary. In a distinguished career he was made secretary to that department in 1959, a position he continued to hold until 1968. That is, he served Prime Minister Menzies for six years of the period of his prime ministership. From 1968 to 1971 Sir John served as Secretary to the Cabinet Office. From 1971 to January 1975 he again served as Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. He served successive Prime Ministers: Sir Robert Menzies, Harold Holt, John MCEwen and, finally, Gough Whitlam. In 1975 Sir John left the Prime Minister's Department after being appointed to serve as High Commissioner in London. His service during his time there, until 1977, made him many friends and further established the high regard with which he was held in many quarters. Sir John was also Chairman of the Official Establishments Trust from 1983 to 1992, a position he held with great distinction, and National Coordinator of the Sir Robert Menzies Memorial Foundation from 1978. For his distinguished service to the nation, Sir John was created a Knight Bachelor in 1964, a Knight of the Order of the British Empire in 1977 and he was made a Companion of the Order of Australia in 1982. Sir John will long be remembered for his professionalism, diligence and dedication to public service administration and for the impartiality that enabled him to serve successive governments with distinction, and, I might add, for his warmth and charm. Anybody who knew him liked him and respected him. He was one of those people in the Public Service who was well regarded and whose advice was often sought by people on both side of politics. He was always ready to give advice, even in later years. On behalf of the government, I extend to Lady Bunting and his sons, John, Peter and Richard, the government's most sincere sympathy in their bereavement.",12
11,Mr HOWARD,CONDOLENCES,"On indulgence, Mr Speaker, I thank the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for the opportunity he has given the House to say something briefly about the death of one of Australia's greatest public servants. Sir John Bunting was, in every sense of the word, a pillar of the old Public Service. He was, as the Prime Minister said, an immensely charming and courteous man. I first met him before I entered federal parliament when, for a brief period when I was active in the Liberal Party organisation, I worked in the office of former Prime Minister MCMahon at a time when Sir John Bunting was the permanent head of his department. In the eight weeks before the 1972 election I had the opportunity to observe the extraordiBut nary professionalism of this man and also his remarkable respect for the division that used to exist between the political arm and the professional public service arm of government. The meticulous way I heard him on occasions point out where it was proper for the Public Service to be involved in the leadup to an election campaign and where it was not proper for the Public Service to be involved was a very early lesson to me of the old divisions that used to exist. The purpose of this very brief speech is not to talk about the rights and the wrongs of that but simply to observe that Sir John Bunting was a very eloquent exponent of the traditional approach-an approach which served both sides of politics. On the night of the 1972 election I had occasion to witness, as I was amongst the group that was with the then Prime Minister who was defeated in that election, a telephone call made by Sir John Bunting to offer his commiserations professionally for the defeat in the 1972 election. Immediately after that Sir Bunting said, 'I will now be ringing Mr Whitlam, the Leader of the Opposition, to facilitate the transfer of government.' To me, that was a perfect demonstration of how the system ought to work. He played that out to the very end. Sir John Bunting was in the eyes of many people, and properly so, deeply associated with Sir Robert Menzies. He would have been regarded by many people in the Labor Party as being the epitome of a conservative bureaucrat who served through the long years of the coalition. But that did not blind him to the fact that he was, above all, a servant of Australia and that he served the will of the Australian people. He did that in a profoundly professional manner. Sir John Bunting survived a few personal setbacks. When the now Sir John Gorton became Prime Minister in 1968, he brought about a significant rearrangement of the upper echelon of the Public Service, and Sir Lenox Hewitt effectively became the head of the Prime Minister's Department. In the eyes of many, Sir John Bunting was shunted sideways to head a newly created cabinet secretariat he continued to serve the government, the elected government of the people of Australia, and he did it with great professionalism. He returned to the position of head of the Prime Minister's Department after a change of leadership in the parliamentary Liberal Party. He wrote a well researched and well reviewed little book regarding Sir Robert Menzies. He debunked a few of the myths that had surrounded the Menzies period of government. Nobody was better able to talk of that period than Sir John Bunting. Nobody was a more impartial observer, yet an intimate detailed observer, of the techniques of cabinet government under Menzies than was Sir John Bunting. Sir John, in that little monograph, did much to demolish the view that cabinet meetings presided over by Menzies were a monologue and debunked the view that Menzies imposed his view without let, hindrance, objection or obstruction from any of his colleagues. He did, as the Prime Minister said, take over as High Commissioner to London after serving the Whitlam government in its early period in office with utter professionalism and commitment. I was pleased to note in several of the obituaries written about Sir John Bunting the warm fashion in which the former Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, spoke of Sir John and the way in which Sir John gave him honest advice of great integrity. If our public institutions mean anything, it is worth recording on occasions such as this the giants of the Public Service who serve both sides of politics so that whenever one thinks of the Public Service one instinctively, in this and the preceding generations, will think of Sir John Bunting and people like the late Sir Frederick Wheeler, Arthur Tange, Henry Bland, Roland Wilson and Sir James Plimsoll as being a unique band. Mr Barry Jones-And Nugget Coombs.",13
12,Mr HOWARD,CONDOLENCES,"--And Nugget Coombs. I am grateful, as always, to the national president for his intervention. I do not wish to inject a note of discord. Nugget Coombs certainly held many positions-and I acknowledge that. If my friend will allow me to say so, there was a degree of public partisanship about Nugget Coombs that we might not have found to the same degree with Sir John Bunting. I do not deny Coombs his right-but I think that is the difference, and any professional observer would have to acknowledge that. Finally, I extend my condolenc,es to his family: his wife and three sons. On a personal note, my wife and I had the great privilege of getting to know one of his sons and that son's children. His grandson played in the same cricket team as my own son at Sydney Church of England Grammar School and we got to know that branch of the Bunting family very well. They are a fine family and they have every reason to be immensely proud of a great Australian.",14
13,Mr TIM FISCHER,CONDOLENCES,"I welcome this opportunity to speak in support of the condolence motion for Sir John Bunting, the former head of the Prime Minister's Department, a very senior federal public servant and a great Australian who had a particular and professional relationship with the late Sir John MCEwen. There is a widespread disposition for public servants to be lampooned and categorised as being in some ways dull and lacking in ability. In many cases, this criticism is truly misplaced; in fact, unwarranted. Sir John Bunting was a good example of the quality that our public sector can aspire to. The work for which he was responsible required considerable skills in leadership, judgment and tact, and a large measure of discretion and dedication. Sir John belonged quite unmistakably to a particular era in public administration in Australia and no doubt gained from his rural upbringing his pragmatic approach to the important role he would take on in his later life. He was the quintessential public servant, but not in a Sir Humphrey sense. In his book on Menzies, referred to by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and published in 1988, his deep respect for Prime Minister Menzies was apparent. At the same time, he did not allow his personal feelings to influence him. Rather, he was a true reflection of an AustralianlWestminster public servant, neutral in his politics but with complete loyalty to the government of the day. As cabinet secretary during a period of great sensitivity and volatility, political as well as emotional in terms of Australia's . involvement in the Vietnam conflict, Sir John had the complete confidence and trust of the cabinet. It is interesting that when Sir Lenox Hewitt became the head of the Prime Minister's Department, Sir John continued for a period as secretary to the cabinet. It is also interesting that Sir John Bunting worked for six Prime Ministers; from Sir Robert Menzies through to Gough Whitlam. Rather than seeing himself as an extension of the Prime Minister, he saw himself as serving the cabinet as a whole and being the interpreter of collective executive government. He had many ideas as to how the cabinet government and the form and modus operandi of cabinet government might further evolve and be modernised. The death of Sir John is a sad passing. Together with the recent death of Sir Geoffrey ,Yeend and others, it brings to an end a particular era of truly professional administrators, not bound by personal or political considerations but representing the traditional values of a non-partisan public service. When he was packing up his house, he chose to make one more gesture to the community and gave many of his books over to a school here in Canberra. Some of them had inscriptions of quite a valuable nature from senior US administration officials and others. It was part of his common touch. Whilst he knew from his work so many important people around the world and here in Australia, he was nevertheless unaffected and determined to continue to make a contribution in his retirement. I extend to Lady Bunting and members of the Bunting family the sympathy of members of the parliamentary National Party.",14
14,Mr SINCLAIR,CONDOLENCES," Mr Speaker, on indulgence, I would like to extend my thanks to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), as did the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), for making this condolence motion possible. In today's age, there are few like the late Sir John Bunting. He was remarkable in the ways that have been described and in a number of respects. Like most members of the House, I sat at many cabinet meetings with Sir John Bunting there. He was wise in his counsel, solicitous in his advice and always spoke from a perspective which made you think the arguments you presented were correct. Whether or not the point of view that he presented was one you endorsed, being questioned about the reasons that you put in matters of high policy is the essence good government. Sir John Bunting was a great public servant, as he has been described. He was a great individual in many ways, and the contribution he made towards the reputation of the Australian civil service is something that should also be mentioned. There was a generation that certainly set a standard which all those who became servants of the state in this country could well have aspired to emulate. I do not think any set a higher standard than Sir John. To his wife and family, Rosemary and I would also like to extend our sympathy.",15
15,Mr DOBIE,CONDOLENCES," Mr Speaker, on indulgence, I would like to speak for a moment in a personal na.ture. It was my good fortune to serve with Sir John for a period of years while we were both in Canberra. When he went to London as High Commissioner, it was my good fortune to renew a personal association which lasted till very recently. One thing that has not been mentioned by any of the speakers to date is the fact that in his latter years he had very bad health. He had voice trouble, which he overcame with great difficulty and great determination. All the wonderful things that have been said about him have been great, but he was a very personal man and a very concerned man. People have talked about what he said. The night that we lost government he asked whether he could come to the dinner that MCMahon was putting on for his staff and spouses. Sir John mentioned at that dinner that history would show Mr MCMahon to be one of the most Australian of Prime Ministers we had ever had, certainly up until that date. I think it is wonderful that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and you, Mr Speaker, have allowed us to pay tribute to him. His wife is a charming and wonderful person. We share a number of personal friends. So I stand today, in my last year in this parliament, with great feeling for Lady Bunting and with great regard for what John Bunting did for everybody else.",15
16,Mr BEAZLEY,CONDOLENCES," Mr Speaker, with your indulgence, I would like to join with those who have spoken so far in paying tribute to the life of of Sir John Bunting. Perhaps in some of the remarks thus far made there is a slight tinge of pessimism about whether or not the standards that were set in place by some of the great creators of the Australian Public Service, of which Sir John was one, are perhaps now honoured more in the breach than in the observance. I do not think that is actually true. I think the position established for the Australian Public Service in the times in which Sir John was such a prominent member by and large remain to be the circumstances today. That is not necessarily so of state administrations, but I think it is so of the national government. That it is so of the national government is in no small measure due to the effectiveness with which Sir John and others organised the Australian state. We are a creation of the period Sir John was in the Australian Public Service-the period from the 1940s onwards in which the modern Australian state was established. The relationships between government and the Australian Public Service were established at that point of time. It was also coincidental with the development of the city of Canberra and the gradual centralisation of administration in city. Sir John presided over a great deal of that, and he did so in a way that belies the traditional image presented in the media and comedy shows, the more formal media presentation of the traditional public servant or mandarin. He had a great deal of human sympathy and warmth, and a great deal of integrity. There was nothing underhand in the positions that he adopted and his presentation of the issues to government that I have ever heard. My father knew him well too. On a personal note, it is with great sadness that I read of his death. He and Lady Peggy were enormously kind to me when I was a student in England. I have many fond memories of those occasions and subsequent to my being in parliament and my election to parliament. In particular, I want to extend my sympathies to Lady Peggy, John,Peter and Richard, his sons, and their families. I know the enormous affection in which he was held by them. The loss to them over the next week or two will be so very extreme. I think of them very much at this time. I believe his reputation will stand for a very long period because of what he and others who have been mentioned here created. I also draw attention to one other matter. Despite the fact that those proper relationships were established between the political and administrative side of government, it is important to note the extent to which he developed a personal, not a clinical, affection for the ministers and prime ministers with whom he dealt. Gough Whitlam has already attested to that, as mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) in what he has had to say. Nothing could be more evident of that fact than the reminiscences of Sir John himself about Sir Robert Menzies, who was Prime Minister for the greater bulk of the period that he himself was a senior public servant. While the relationships were always proper, you could not read that book and assume that there was not being extended to the political class as well as the administrative class a very substantial degree of the warmth and sympathy of which he was capable. He this will be a much missed person by his family and a much missed person by this nation.",15
17,Mr DOWNER,CONDOLENCES,"I join others in supporting the condolences for Sir John Bunting, who, as has been said, was a truly great Australian public servant. I knew him through my father, who had a very close relationship with him and a great respect for him. My father was a minister in the Menzies government which Sir John served as a distinguished public servant. As others have said-this is worth repeating and repeating a lot-he was a public servant in the great traditions of an impartial public servant. I think the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) made an interesting point. Despite that, he was able to form very close personal relationships with many of the ministers no doubt on both sides of politics. Certainly, that was the experience of my own father. I agree with the Leader of the House that there are still public servants who have carried on that great tradition. Tony Cole is certainly a recent example of that. I also note something that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) said, that Sir John Bunting did have a very difficult time on occasions as a senior public servant. I can remember my father being absolutely outraged when Sir John Bunting was removed from the position of Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to become the Secretary to the Cabinet and replaced in his previous position by Sir Lenox Hewitt. This was no reflection on Sir Lenox Hewitt in particular-I choose my words carefully here-but certainly the notion of Sir John Bunting being perceived to be inadequ-te for the task was regarded by many who had worked close to him as simply extraordinary. I also had a bit to do with Sir John Bunting during his time as High Commissioner in London. He had some health problems during that time but, despite that, served in that role with great distinction and, I think, held the name of Australia with great dignity. There was in Sir John Bunting none of the Anglophobe that we might find in some parts of our country but there was no tugging of the forelock either. I thought he handled that job with great distinction. I, too, find his book on Sir Robert Menzies an important contribution. I think he did a lot to change altogether the perception that was once around that Menzies was some sort of dictatorial tyrant in his cabinet, that his government was a one-man government. The book was one of several contributions which have finally dispelled that view and brought the truth closer to what Australia now understands to be the case. In conclusion, I extend my sympathy to Lady Bunting and their three children. Honourable members having stood in their places",16

20,Ms CRAWFORD,HOUSING LEGISLATION,"Forde-Parliamentary Bill Secretary to the Minister for Housing and Regional Development) (1.04 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Housing Legislation Amendment Bill Education 1995 will amend: - the Housing Assistance Act 1989; and - the First Home Owners Act 1983 and related legislation (the Home Deposit Assistance Act 1982, the Homes Savings Grant Act 1964, the Homes Savings Grant Act 1976). First, I would like to explain the provisions of the bill in relation to the Housing Assistance Act 1989. The government is unequivocally committed to the principle that housing is a basic human right and that all governments have a responsibility to ensure the housing needs of all Australians are met. As part of this commitment the Commonwealth provides untied financial assistance to the states under the· Housing Assistance Act 1989 to deliver housing assistance, predominantly for building or purchase of public rental housing stock but also for home purchase, in accordance with the terms of the Commonwealth-state housing agreement. The current CSHA is at schedule 1 of the existing act; the CSHA is up for renegotiation with the aim of having a new agreement in place by 1 July 1996. The CSHA requires states to match Commonwealth untied assistance on a dollar for dollar basis, with at least half of the matching provided through state grants and the balance through the value of loans made under home purchase assistance schemes. Difficulties with matching have arisen in recent years for states as a result of increased attractiveness of commercially available loans in the current economic climate and a poor public image for some state products, leading most states to reduce their home lending activities. The affected states have been unable to provide additional grant funding to meet their matching obligations. Prior to amendments made to the act last year, the Commonwealth was required to recover financial assistance provided in earlier years from states that did not undertake sufficient lending under their home purchase assistance-HPA-schemes. Similarly, where some states indicated that they were unlikely to be able to meet their matching requirements, the act, prior to amendment, required that the minister not provide unmatched funds, reducing untied grants to the level that would be matched. The government considered that either to recover financial assistance already provided or to reduce funding to be provided was undesirable. It would reduce funds for public housing and disadvantage those most in need of assistance. It would also be undesirable to pursue such action where states are genuinely unable to meet such requirements because of changed market conditions. It was for these reasons that the amendments to section 15 of the act which allowed the minister to waive these provisions were made last year. It was not expected at the time of the previous amendments that states would continue to have matching difficulties. The amendments outlined in this bill extend these waiving provisions for what is expected to be the final and seventh year of the current Commonwealth-state housing agreement: The amendment to subsection 15(2A) of the act extends its application to the seventh grant year (1995-96) in addition to the sixth grant year (1994-95) of the Commonwealthstate housing agreement. - Subsection 15(2A) of the act enables the Commonwealth minister to authorise the full level of untied grants to a particular state, even if the minister cannot ensure that the state can meet the balance of its matching obligation from the value of home loans provided through its home purchase assistance programs in accordance with paragraph 13 (2)(b ) of the Commonwealth-state housing agreement. The amendment to subsection 15A(2) of the act extends section 15A to the seventh grant . year (1995-96) in addition to the fifth (1993-94) and sixth grant years (1994-95) of the Commonwealth-state housing agreement. - Section 15A enables the minister to make a determination to effectively waive or reduce a state or territory's obligation to match the balance of untied assistance, provided by the Commonwealth to a state, from the value of home loans provided through home purchase assistance programs in a grant year where that state has not been able to meet the level required. Any decision to waive or reduce the home purchase assistance matching requirement will be taken after careful consideration of the circumstances leading to the need for such a course of action and determined on a case by case basis. The longer term issue of matching will be addressed in the process of renegotiating a new Commonwealth-state housing· agreement. The amendments will not result in any additional Commonwealth outlays. I would now like to turn to the provisions of the bill relevant to the First Home Owners Act 1983 and related legislation. In the budget speech of 21 August 1990, the government announced its decision to terminate the first home owners scheme as part of its plan to restructure Commonwealth home ownership assistance arrangements. Legislation was introduced amending the First Home Owners Act 1983 so that it would not have effect in respect of homes acquired after that date. That legislation also fixed 30 June 1991 as the last date for applications for assistance under the act. However, applicants coming within those deadlines remained eligible for a stream of monthly assistance payments over five years from the date of acquiring their home. Amendments in 1994 to th- first home owners regulations allowed final payments to remaining eligible clients to be aggregated and brought forward. The bulk of these payments were dispatched in November 1994, and after 30 June 1995 there will be ongoing administrative activity only of a minor nature. Accordingly, this bill amends the reporting requirements of the act to provide that no annual report on its administration and operation will be required after the 1994-95 report. Presently, no time limit is prescribed in the act for appeals from decisions made under it. To assist in winding up the scheme's administration, this bill sets 30 June 1995-but we will have a government amendment to move the date to 31 August 1995-as the cut-off date for such appeals. For the few appealable decisions which may be made close to that date or thereafter, a period of 28 days from the date the decision is furnished to the applicant is proposed. Further, the bill curtails the power of the secretary to the department to reopen applications for reconsideration after that date. Notifications of decisions under the First Home Owners Act have always been required to include an explanation of the client's right to seek review, including by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Few decisions have been made since the two years after the cutoff date for applications. With few exceptions, applicants now have had a number of years to consider decisions affecting them and to lodge an appeal. It is now time to draw this scheme to a close. However, any decisions still to b- made will be subject to the proposed 28-day limit to seek departmental review; the existing right and time limit will continue to apply for appeals to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal from decisions of the department. Similarly, the legislation does not affect the review procedures available to individuals under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. I should also add that the government will undertake appropriate action to notify clients of the time lines for the revised review procedures. This will involve .advertisements in national newspapers over a two-week period. Earlier first home ownership assistance schemes are governed by the 1964 and 1976 Home Savings Grants Acts and the Home Deposit Assistance Act 1982. These, too, contain no time limits for appeals from decisions made under them. Accordingly, to assist in winding up their administration, the bill proposes arrangements similar to those proposed for the First Home Owners Act 1983. The bill also incorporates machinery amendments to the provisions of the earlier acts relating to making and notification of decisions under them. Aside from modest costs associated with the campaign to publicise the cut-off date for appeals, the amendments to the first home owners assistance legislation have no identifiable financial impact. I commend this bill to the House.  Housing Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 is a result of a budget decision made by the Hawke Labor government in its 1990 budget where it decided to abolish the first home owners scheme. The bill amends the First Home Owners Act 1983 and related legislation and the Housing Assistance Act 1989. The amendments to the First Home Owners Act remove the requirement in the First Home Owners Act 1983 to report to parliament beyond the 1994-95 annual report. The bill also has provisions related to the setting of cut-off dates for consideration of, and appeal from, decisions made under the act. The formal cut-off date is set for 30 June 1995. The bill also incorporates equivalent amendments to the earlier first home owners assistance legislation being the Home Savings Grants Act 1964, the Home Savings Grants Act 1976 and the Home Deposit Assistance Act 1982. The bill then amends the Housing Assistance Act 1989 to permit the Commonwealth minister to authorise and provide up to the full level of Commonwealth funding in the seventh and expected fmal grant year of 199596 of the current Commonwealth-state housing agreement in circumstances where a state has been, or will be, unable to meet its obligations under that agreementto match up to half of the untied grants from the value of home loans made under home purchase assistance programs. The coalition will not be opposing the bill as we have consistently believed that the principle behind the devolution of the first home owners scheme to the states is correct and that these amendments are only to finalise a process begun by the First Home Owners Amendment Act 1990, which we did not oppose at that time. It is perhaps opportune on this budget day that we do, however, take the time to reflect on this government's callous disregard for those Australians who are trying to own their own home. The hypocrisy of Labor and its approach to housing is measured by contrasting its policy position with reality .. The Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Housing and Regional Development (Mr Howe), has sought to develop a set of policies around the national housing strategy albeit without any great success. Hal Bisset, a director of the Ecumenical Housing Unit, commented recently: It is impossible to achieve the national strategy's overall objectives of affordable and appropriate housing if the economy is not managed so as to reinforce these outcomes. He went on to say: On the other hand, the impact of the housing market on the broader economy has not been given adequate attention either. The minister's response to the housing objectives has always been to have yet another inquiry or propose another strategy. The response, of course, of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to the needs and aims of those in this country who are purchasing their first home or who are saving, I might add, for their first home has been to create an economy. whereby his wilful disregard of sound economic judgment has resulted in an interest rate spiral. By failing to implement policies that could have reigned in our burgeoning current account deficit, this Prime Minister has directly caused an entire industry to go into a downward spiral of growing proportions. In the period from March 1994 to March 1995 the number of dwelling units approved monthly fell from 15,636 per month in March 1994 to 12,830 in the month of March 1995 in seasonally adjusted terms. Likewise, the value of building approvals fell from $2,163 million in March 1994 to $2,124 million in March 1995. Building commencements in the March quarter 1994 in seasonally adjusted terms were 44,887, a figure which has fallen in the December quarter of 1994 to 44,236. Perhaps where we can see most directly the impact of the patchwork policies of this government is in the dramatic fall in secured housing finance commitments. In seasonally adjusted terms the value of secured finance commitments has fallen from the sum of $4.291 billion in February 1994 to $3.165 billion in February 1995. This fall of over $1 billion in secured housing finance commitments is a direct reflection of the disastrous interest rate policies of this government. The effect on the housing and construction industry is yet to be fully felt, but when this pain spreads throughout the economy we will see the reflection of this Prime Minister's callous policies and of the lack of ability of the Deputy Prime Minister to properly argue housing his portfolio in cabinet. This government was and is unable to keep the lid on interest rates so as to enable the housing industry to continue to grow at the same rate as the rest of the economy. It is only with the steady and sustained growth of this industry that the economy will be able to provide affordable housing to those in the community that still require housing. The coalition under the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) is committed to the establishment of a flexible, balanced and responsive housing sector which can deliver home ownership as a real choice and provide alternative options for those who choose not to own or whose circumstances prevent them from owning their own home. The policies of this government are strangling the housing industry, as the figures I have just quoted amply illustrate. The coalition is committed to providing home ownership as a real choice for all Australians. This government seems committed to pursuing policies that disadvantage low and middle income earners from achieving the goal of industry owning their own home. The coalition will develop innovative reforms of financial arrangements in partnerincome ship with financial and industry groups in order to assist home buyers and not leave first home buyer and those in the community that wish to move up the scale in their choice of a home, or those who because of circumwill stances have to move location, to the vagaries of the financial market-a market that is directly affected by this government's reckless high interest rate policies. It would be derelict of me in the context this debate if I did not refer to the govtheir ernment's overall economic strategy-I can dream. loosely refer to it as that-and the outlook for those who wish to own their own first home but who by employment circumstances are forced to move locations and thus purchase another home. This Labor government has failed a of tests. One test we all know it has failed that of truth. Remember the tax cuts that were l-a-w that turned out to be l-i-e-s. No doubt this government's credibility will take another nosedive when the Treasurer (Mr Willis) puffs out some more smoke, the Prime tricks. Minister adjusts the mirrors and the acolytes preach to all and sundry what a great show was. Mr Deputy Speaker, you and the Australian people know that what is being perpetrated this government is a series of clever little con tricks. Remember the admission of former Treasurer Dawkins that he fudged the figures and the startling revelations made last night by the former head of Treasury on the Four Corners program that One Nation, the first key financial initiative of this Prime Minister, was patched together with deception. That is the mark of his politically and morally bankrupt party. It can no longer look the people of Australia in the eye and deliver a policy. All it can do is try to deceive the people. This cheap and tawdry little group will tonight drag out smart lines and try to deceive the people of this great country once again. When we consider that we have some 800,000 people unemployed and a housing that is in decline as a direct result of the high interest rate policies of this government, all we can say about this government's approach to those at the lower end of the scale is that it is consistent in its callous disregard for those unemployed who· the may own their own home but are forced to sell either by virtue of the lack of income or the burden of increased interest rates. What happen in the future? The only certainty that the Labor government offers the community is that there will be more pain. The Labor boom-bust policies are a recipe for high unemployment and the type of environof ment that robs those who are seeking to own own home the chance of achieving that Whilst the coalition does not oppose this legislation, it reminds the people of Australia that this government failed to keep its 1993 election promise of keeping home purchases within the reach of those who want to buy number their own homes and keeping mortgage is payments at affordable levels. This is just another example of deception from a government that can no longer distinguish truth from fiction-a fact that no doubt we will see again tonight in the government's 13th box of",17
21,Mr OCONNOR,HOUSING LEGISLATION,"--I it rise to support the Housing Legislation Amendment Bill 1995. The bill is straightforward and makes minor amendments to two by acts-the First Home Owners Act 1983 and other related legislation and the Housing Assistance Act 1989. The amendments to the First Home Owners Act 1983 are designed, firstly, to remove the statutory reporting requirements once the scheme is terminatedthis has already been referred to by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing and Regional Development (Ms Crawford)-and, secondly, to ensure that the possibility for review of the decisions made under this act does not continue beyond the life of the scheme. From a historical point of view, the first home owners scheme has had a great degree of success in putting Australians into their first homes. It was first established under the First Home Owners Act 1983. There were several forerunner schemes that were similar in intent to that of the First Home Owners Act 1983. I am referring here to the schemes established under the Homes Savings Act 1964, the Home Savings Grant Act 1976 and the Home Deposit Assistance Act 1982. These schemes, along with the first home owners scheme, were important vehicles for channelling assistance to low and middle income earners in the market to enable them to buy their first homes. These schemes that operated in the 1970s and 1980s not ,only had an important social purpose but also had an economic focus. They were aimed at stimulating dwelling construction in the building industry and creatingjobs. The schemes were very important to the creation of employment in regional areas. The housing market-as well as the economic circumstances-has changed and that has challenged the relevancy of the schemes in today's economic and social environment. These changes have necessitated the redirection of housing policy that was enunciated by the government in 1990 and that has led to a substantial restructuring of the home ownership assistance arrangements and a termination of the first home ownership scheme. The statistics relating to the first home ownership scheme, for the period of its operation from 1983-84 to 1993-94, show that some 369,400 applications were approved and some $1.5 billion paid out in assistance. The long and short of it is that many Australians have been assisted into their first homes by these types of schemes. But circumstance has changed and with it the delivery of housing assistance to Australians. The second part of this legislation relates to changes in the Housing Assistance Act of 1989. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Housing and Regional Development canvassed some of those changes in her address. The Housing Assistance Act of 1989 outlined the Commonwealth's financial assistance to the states for housing. In the 1992-93 budget, the government announced an extension of the guaranteed funding under the Commonwealth-state housing agreement. The amendments in this bill will release the states from the requirement to match half the Commonwealth's untied grants. With interest rates at low levels, the states have found it difficult to maintain their levels of spending on housing programs and the Commonwealth does not wish to penalise the states for factors beyond their control. The changes to the Commonwealth-state housing agreement and the first home owners scheme are expected to be close to revenue neutral with only minor financial outlays involved in these amendments. The previous speaker in this debate, the  reference to the government's housing policies and rather denigrated the government's achievements of the past decade. For the benefit of the House, and to set the record straight, I ought to canvass some of the philosophical underpinning of the government's housing policy and outline the successes that the government has achieved over the past decade. The government is committed to the provision of affordable housing. That is at the core of this government's social justice agenda. Social justice is a term with which the opposition has some trouble coming to grips. It is not part of the opposition's policy apparati. It is not a focus of its policies. Certainly, many of the opposition's policies have an economic focus but do not have a social one. The provision of affordable housing to Australians is at the core of the Labor Party government's social justice agenda and social policies. This government is unequivocally committed to the principle that housing basic human right and that all governments have a responsibility to ensure that the ing needs of all Australians are met. The government is committed to ensuring that Australians have the right of access to secure, good quality housing that is appropriate their needs, that is well located for employment opportunities and that is obtainable at an affordable price. This particular philosophical position contrasts markedly with that of the coalition, which seems to have the rather naive view the world that the marketplace can address diverse housing needs of the Australian people. The simple fact is that the market cannot by itself deliver the economic and social outcomes necessary in this area of social policy. As far as Labor's housing record is concerned, I can stand here with a great deal of pride in the achievements of this government. It is interesting to hear members of the opposition talk about the affordability housing in Australia. At present we have place a low interest rate regime compared with that which we have seen historically. also have the lowest level of inflation in Western world. Those two elements have put housing affordability within the reach many ordinary Australians. It is particularly galling that members of the opposition talk this place about the government limiting the opportunities of Australians to gain access affordable housing. They must have short memories or some of them must not have been around this place for too long. I have not been around this place for too long but I have a long memory. I can rememgeneral ber the stewardship of the Australian economy by the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), and the impact that had on the affordability of housing Australians. In 1982, the honourable member for Bennelong presided over mortgage interest rates in the region of 13.5 per cent and inflation rate which was crippling the building industry, amongst others. The building industhis try price index rose traditionally above consumer price index. I note that when the honourable member for Bennelong, the is a Leader of the Opposition, left office the inflation rate was in the region of 11.5 per houscent. Try affording a house in a private marketplace with interest rates at 13.5 per cent and an inflation rate of 11.5 per cent. That was Honest John's contribution to the to Australian economy and to housing affordcurrent ability for the Australian people. Over the last decade we have seen, as a consequence of the deregulation of the home finance market, a broadening of the range of institutions that are providing housing fmance. of We have also seen the presentation of a the greater diversity of housing products to consumers. The end result has been clear: housing affordability has improved; there is greater consumer choice in the marketplace; and a broader range of financial institutions are providing housing finance to consumers. The Labor Party, which is in government, has always had a very strong commitment to public housing. The previous speaker in this of debate, the honourable member for Forrest, in ought to reflect on the record of previous Liberal governments and their weak and We insipid commitments to public housing in this the country. We have a traditional, very proud and honourable commitment to public housing of in this country. Under the Commonwealthstate housing agreement, the government is in providing over $3 billion to the states for public housing. This amount will be provided to over three years to June 1996. By 1996 this investment will help increase total public housing units to an estimated 400,000 units. What did the opposition promise when it went before the Australian population at the election in 1993? Those opposite had a very powerful commitment to public housing in this country. They wanted to slash $400 million off it. Not only did those opposfor ite want to suck that important amount of money out of the Australian economy at a time when it was cranking into gear, but the an implications of their policy were also such that the level of public housing constructed in country would have been reduced. We the know the weak-kneed commitment of those opposite to public housing. They have articulated it at elections and in this House. I am merely pointing out to members of the opposition that we have a proud record of achievement in the public housing area. Honourable members will be aware that the Commonwealth-state housing agreement is currently being renegotiated with the states. I am hopeful that that renegotiation will bring reforms, even reforms which will be accepted by conservative state governments, which will improve the efficiency of resource allocation in the housing area. I commend the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Housing and Regional Development (Mr Howe) for his deep commitment to the social objectives of the Labor Party in government and for the manner in which he has handled his portfolio. One honourable member opposite criticised Labor Party ministers, and in particular the Deputy Prime Minister. I have not heard any program for housing and regional development articulated by those opposite. I have not seen a genuine reform agenda that is going to expand the options for public housing and the private rental market. That is the problem with the opposition. Those opposite have no vision of what governments can achieve. They have this rather pathetic attachment to an ideological position that attempts to reduce government involvement in these very important areas. Apart from the health of Australians, housing is the most critical area for governments to address. I refer to the government's record in the public housing area. The government's funding for public housing has enabled the number of new tenants houses to increase from 35,000 in 1982-83 to over 54,000 in 1993-94. The government has been addressing the issue of homeless people in this society. Since we came to power we have seen a 300 per cent increase in investment in accommodation and related support services for homeless Australians. Every night over 7,000 homeless Australians are accommodated in premises which have been provided under a Labor government program-the supported accommodation assistance program. In 1995 the Keating government built on this strong record with the introduction of a new piece of social justice legislation in the area of homeless ness-the Supported Accommodation Assistance Act 1995. The government provided $20 million in the 1994-95 budget to implement the new SAAP agreements. This funding will ensure that case management has been introduced into SAAP, that better services are provided to homeless people with mental illness, that better national data is collected to measure the performance of the program, and that a national community awareness campaign will be launched to highlight the problems associated with homelessness. I refer to other elements of Labor's housing agenda. We have provided significant funding-in the region of $1.73 billion-for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander accommodation. In the area of women escaping domestic violence, we have provided some $50 million under SAAP and we have funded 380 services in this area. We have introduced a strategy to provide new homes for the young and the old. This is all part of a broad agenda which this Labor government addresses through the budgetary mechanism. The housing industry is extremely important to regional economies such as Geelong. Over the past few years, housing in Geelong has remained affordable, prices have remained low, and there is a steady increase in the availability of public and low cost housing to low income people. However, we have problems with public housing waiting lists. There is a serious shortage of crisis accommodation for homeless men. Housing statistics for Geelong show that housing prices have remained static for almost six years but that rental prices are also static or falling. Figures released earlier this year showed that Geelong had the greatest number of rental properties in regional Victoria and that the cost of renting a house in Geelong had fallen some 3.7 per cent. In a recent survey undertaken by Personal Investment magazine, these figures placed Geelong fourth among the top 20 capital and regional cities for affordable and low cost housing. Public housing stock in Geelong is steadily increasing. One of the more successful projects was the public housing development in Norlane, which received $5.3 million through the government's better cities funding. This was the first project of its type in the state and was a joint development with the private sector. The project saw the removal of oldstyle cement sheet public housing for an equivalent number of modern public housing dwellings and the same number again of modern units for private sale aimed at the lower end of the market. The major housing market problem in Geelong at this point in time is the lack of adequate shelter for homeless men. I am pleased to say that a working group has been established in Geelong to tackle the problem, which was exacerbated nearly a year ago by the closure of the St Vincent shelter for homeless men. The Barwon Region Housing Council today launched a homeless males fund to help tackle the problem and local hotels and caravan parks have agreed to assist the fund, which will operate on a voucher system. Regional areas, such as the one I represent, are not immune from the problems that face ordinary Australians across the length and breadth of this country as far as access to affordable and decent housing is concerned. But there is one thing they can be assured of: Labor members, when they come to this House, are committed to the great principles that underpin and have driven the policies of this government over the past decade and that will underpin the budget commitment which the government will make later on this evening to public housing and the broader housing agenda in this country. We have a record that the opposition cannot hope to match in its wildest dreams:. it cannot hope to match it as it does not have a vision of the industry and where it ought to go; it cannot hope to match it if it does not have an articulated deep concern that all Australians should have access to affordable and decent housing; and it will never have the same commitment as that of the Labor Party in government as long as it puts before the Australian people a housing policy program that sees enormous chunks being clawed out of the public housing resource provision that is made available under the federal budget.

22,Mr LATHAM,HOUSING LEGISLATION,"I have great pleasure in joining with my colleague the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) in not only supporting the provisions_ of this legislation but also strongly supporting the record and agenda of our Minister for Housing and Regional Development (Mr Howe). He is an effective politician and minister because he not only looks at the short-term agenda but also takes a longer view of changes in the housing market, changes in demographics and changes in the responsibilities of the federal government. Under this government he, along with his parliamentary secretary, is developing a very effective agenda for private and public housing. The Housing Legislation Amendment Bill is part of that agenda. The first of its primary provisions is to assist in winding up the first home owners scheme. That scheme was established in 1983 and its abolition was announced in the 1990 budget. The final entitlements for that scheme are due for payment in July 1995. The second provision in this legislation is to change the methods of payment to the states for public housing under the Commonwealth-state housing agreement. These two provisions--one relating to the private housing sector, the other relating to the public housing sector-raise the whole question of Minister Howe's very broad agenda for housing reform throughout the country. It is an agenda that essentially relates to three questions. The first is affordability; that is, rent assistance--establishing a benchmark for rent assistance in Australia that provides all Australians, no matter their location or income, with affordable housing. The second part of the agenda involves renewing public housing capital stock; this relates to livability and the way in which public housing has been allowed to run down for. many years under state authorities. Quality of life can be enhanced by sensible capital renewal programs. The third item on the agenda is establishing a more efficient housing and urban form and more efficient cities in Australia. The best known area-based urban intervention sponsored by the minister is the Building Better Cities Program. I have nothing but praise for the minister, his active agenda and broad conceptual approach to housing in Australia. Urban planning and housing, which are among the disciplines of public policy in the 1990s, fall into one of the most dynamic areas of study and policy formulation. There is a challenge on both sides of the House to stay ahead of the development of academic work, changes in urban form and changes in economic developmentthat drive urban form and how that relates to the key objectives of affordability and liveability in housing AustralianS throughout the nation. These questions have at their heart key planning issues that are now more than ever coming on to the agenda. I was recently pleased that one of the state members of parliament within my electorateCraig Knowles, the member for Moorebankwas appointed by the new Carr Labor government in New South Wales as the Minister for Housing and Urban Affairs. He has an opportunity-I have discussed this with the new minister-to transform the way in which planning and housing settlement have been looked at and developed in New South Wales. The traditional method of planning-this is reflected in the former govern,ment's metropolitan planning strategy-is to start .with a population settlement target. One starts with a number of people that are projected to move into an area such as Sydney over the next decade or so. Land use plans are developed in response to this population settlement target. Out of that, transport corridors are developed. Employment zones are a third order consideration. Retail and industrial colours are drawn in on the planning map. This approach enables governments to muddle through in a closed economy. Methods of protection and industry subsidisation offer a guide to investment patterns. Btlt it is much harder to sustain the traditional method of planning in an effective fashion under an internationally exposed trading environment. Our economy is currently subjected to two layers of restructuring. The first one is opening up the economy and working out the things we do well. We identify the industries that are competitive shake out the industries that are not so com7 petitive. The second layer is moving progressively to knowledge based industries and forms of employment. Restructuring the economy relates very much to these questions of urban planning. It is turning on its head the way in which plans should be addressing these disciplines. It is very hard to knock the market out of the ring. Under an open economy, market forces and investment forces in a regional or metropolitan economy, such as Sydney's, are driving the urban form. Planners should adjust and no longer use long lag time policy instruments. They are not suitable when investment is changing so rapidly. They should try to restructure the way in which urban planning is undertaken. That means working out the likely scenarios for investment movements. The internationalised economy-the global village-and improvements in communications and transport are rapidly changing the sort of urban form and planning imperatives that we face in Australia. The need for planners is to now reverse the methodology. They should no longer start with population and then move to transport and employment considerations. They should start with projections about patterns of employment and industry investment. Around them, they should then build the land use and transport planning imperatives. That is very important. If we do not do that, we get inefficient results at the urban level. This can result in a dislocation between population and employment opportunities, long commuter travelling times, high costs of infrastructure, urban sprawl and a run-down in environmental standards. So there is a need for planners to get the efficiency right-to get the planning imperatives right in the first instance-and make sure that the inefficiencies do not translate into poor outcomes that have adverse results in social justice terms. In this regard, I will quote from a document prepared by Mark Spiller from the Queensland Department of Housing, Local Government and Planning. It was presented to the Better Cities seminar on urban change in action, in Parliament House on 27 March. I and know that these matters are of great interest to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister felr Housing and Regional Development (Ms Cr-wford), who is at the table, because they relate to the very interesting things being done by the Queensland government in better planning and housing settlement in south-east Queensland. I will quote from Mr Spiller's paper: Other things equal, those economies with better structured cities will be more competitive. The most obvious reason for this is that a range of production costs will be lower for a given level of output. Because of the incremental nature of urban growth and the slow ratcheting up of associated costs, this seemingly obvious point is not always well understood by policy makers. Exercises which project key costs over a relatively long period can be instructive in this context. The South East Queensland 200 I regional planning process compared a ""trend"" development scenario at the end of a 20 year period with a ""preferred"" scenario. The analysis showed the regional economy would, each year, carry additional ""overheads"" of $1 billion in vehicle operating costs alone under the no change management strategy. Average journey to work times would be almost 50% greater and vehicle emissions would be 37% higher. Scaling up such costs to the national level suggests that the returns from improved management of the urban settlement pattern would easily be of the same order as those flowing from full implementation of the Hilmer reforms in the electricity, water, transport and other utility sectors. It is quiet interesting that the Queensland government is undertaking that planning strategy. It is not being caught in shorttermism but is replicating the model promoted by the minister in this place and taking a long-term perspective. It understands that a more efficient and consolidated urban form has a range of economic as well as social benefits through all parts of the community. If there is a close correlation between employment opportunities and housing locations, obviously there are huge social benefits. If there is a reduction in commuter travelling times, there are financial, social and environmental benefits, because lengthy commuter travelling time in Australia is usually reflected in unsatisfactory air emissions and other forms of pollution. This is the agenda that is being developed by the Queensland government, and I congratulate it for its long-term planning and its appreciation of the very important link between employment, urban form land use and transport needs. It is projected that in south-east Queensland there will be a three per cent infrastructure cost saving, compared to conventional low density sprawl and inefficient models of urban development. If the savings from urban efficiency from better pricing signals, innovative land and housing development and better planning all round were captured nationwide, savings in the low hundreds of millions of dollars per annum could be realised. This is not something just for social planners, community workers or environmentalists to be interested in; it is for finance ministers as well. This more efficient form of urban planning and urban form has benefits across a range of government and social responsibilities. Cost pricing of infrastructure and services associated with land and housing development are a very useful location signal to the market. Adjustments to pricing policies-such as taxation reform-represent an electorally sensitive exercise. The anguish of those disaffected by reform always seems to outweigh the support of the beneficiaries. Longterm planning and more efficient pricing of urban outcomes is not an easy task. Taking a long-term view in politics often means that short-term political imperatives can cause difficulties, but the long-term issues are fundamental to a successful outcome. Planning strategies need to confirm the benefits of full cost recovery on land development. There is no stronger mechanism than pricing to slow the rate of unsatisfactory urban sprawl. In this regard, the 1992 New South Wales Treasury research paper on public authority pricing in New South Wales set out the correct principles for pricing construction and the use of physical infrastructure. There is a lot of debate on these questions at the current time because of the COAG agenda on competition. This paper that was produced three years ago is a very useful document. I think it provides a guide for all governments and all agencies within government on the sorts of pricing policies that should be adopted on urban form. New South Wales Treasury said that prices should generally have an access and usage component reflecting the nature of the cost borne by agencies. They should be sufficiently high to anow rate of return targets to be met. Price reform should desirably be part of the productivity - orhpac.t with the service agencies so there IS a qUId pro quo between the pace of price reform-:-which helps agencies on the revenue side-and their requirements to minimise costs to home buyers, consumers and businesses. Importantly, many customers-including future generations and taxpayers generallywill be better off as a result of price reform. That is reflected in the large savings on infrastructure costs that can be made from more efficient urban form. The gains are apparent, both financially and in terms of the quality of service and environmental amenIties. . Where there are genuine hardship cases, which will depend on the pace of reform, the extent cif such an impact needs to be quantIfied and assessed in terms of the need of compensatory measures-that is, in Australia's case, arranging explicit comm--ity service obligation payments on those pncIng policies. Under Australia's federal system of government it is very difficult to manage the compensatory arrangements they. hav€? in - eZealand, for instance, where social secunty IS part of the national government, as are the urban agencies. In Australia we have federal responsibilities for social security - h-re compensation could be made for pncIng policies at full cost while the states are in control of the key urban agencies. This is another vital issue for the COAG agenda. It is very important to understand how the equity arguments about full cost re-ov-ry extend beyond a narrow focus on prIce Increases. The report of the human services working group to the Sydney Metropolitan Strategy Review Task Force-and this goes back to August 1992-made a crucial point. It states: New estates are no longer predominantly accommodating first home buyers. Ther- i- now no justi-ca­ tion on equity grounds to subsldls-human services provision at the expense of other higher need Second home buyers in new estates are now doubly subsidised, having profited from selling houses in more established areas where the value of intrastructure and locational amenity are containe-/ in the selling price, they are moving to new e-t-tes where they pay less than half the cost of provldmg the infrastructure. That is a very important point that needs to be appreCiated. In Australia, in the 1990s, first home buyers are not necessari!y located predominantly on the urban fnnge. The pattern is moving from established suburbs, where they had their first home, to a be-er house on the urban fringe. So the pohcy makers who in previous decades assumed that housing policy needed to be geared arou-d the great Australian dream of hom- owner-hip on the urban fringe need to rethInk the Imperatives and the market realities of housing settlement patterns in Australia at the m?ment. This is a reason why the government In 1990 announced the end of that first home buyers subsidised scheme. We need to adapt to a whole range of new planning realities. There is talk of the information superhighway. The advent of telecommuting, home shopping and other home based services will change the nature of the transport task. If people work out of home using advanced information tec-ology, then we will have the great potential for more efficient urban form and housing settlement, lower cost to government and less environmental decay. The argument in a service based economy is that the transport infrastructure is not as important as it was. This is the difference between the information revolution, where information and advanced information technology carries the work material, and the Industrial Revolution, out of which arose the method of a production based economy. I now turn to some of the more specific details of Brian Howe's reform agenda. I support each of them in turn and, firstly, accept the recommendation of the Industry Commission report on public housing that state authorities need to separate tenancy and asset management functions. There has be-n a run-down in capital renewal of pubhc housing in Australia-$31 billion of public areas. housing assets-especially compared to the rate of private housing investment and .renovation. This run-down has been a functIOn of state authorities more concerned about their tenancy responsibilities than picking up asset management investments that have a long term significance. I have relayed to the House previously the sort of public housing renewal programs I am supporting-and which I hope the government can sponsor-in the Campbelltown local government area of my electorate which take those large broad acre public housing estates that have not received a great deal of asset upgrading in recent years and give them the sort of treatment that has worked so successfully under the Better Cities Program at Elizabeth and under Defence Housing Authority programs at Holsworthy in Sydney. The second initiative I support is the estabhousing lishment of the affordability benchmark in housing. The 1992-93 housing budget statement announced that people on low incomes paying more than 20 per cent of their income on rent will be assisted by the Government towards meeting those costs. We have seen that through the rent assistance payment out of Social Security. The government, under the leadership of the Minister for Housing and Regional Development in this portfolio, is now developing a much more sophisticated benchmark such that no Australian should pay more than 30 per cent of income on rent, be they public or private renters. The minister is working with the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) to meet these targets of a rent assistance benchmark in Australia based on that fundamental social equity principle that Australians should pay no more than 30 per cent of their income on rent. The significance, of course, is that no distinction was made in that policy between public and private housing. The policy is ownership neutral. This approach-you would appreciate this, Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - was endorsed by the 1994 ALP national conference establishing a social policy basis for benchmarking. There are variations in the way in which this policy can be implemented. I will be interested to see later this evening what the budget papers show in relation to this matter. In New Zealand, for instance, rent assistance cuts in at 25 per cent of income. The government in New Zealand pays 65 per cent of the surplus and the tenant pays 35 per cent. The reason is that there needs to be a fear of perverse incentives in the housing market. If the government were to pay 100 per cent of the amount beyond the benchmark, there would be an incentive for tenants to locate themselves in high-cost suburbs, well beyond their income scope. We need to guard against perverse incentives. Personally, I think the New Zealand model-perhaps not as low as 65 per cent of government commitmentoffers a lot of guidance in this regard. Importantly, the rent assistance affordability initiatives address a basic problem in the sector. This relates more broadly to social inequity in Australia. Australia's housing system and the appearance of a housing shortage is evidence enough of how subsidies are not always transferred to those most in need. In cities such as Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide there are nearly as many bedrooms as there are people. That is probably not the case in the Hunter Valley, but in Sydney it is definitely true that there are as many bedrooms as there are people. I will not speculate at this stage on the ratios in the Hunter. The housing crisis is actually a question of distribution and the way government subsidies have traditionally overlooked the needs of private rental households. The 1992 National Housing Strategy documented how private rental housing receives the smallest amount of government support per household, even though this sector is made up of the greatest number of households in poverty. The housing strategy found that, on the annual value of housing subsidies and tax concessions in Australia, home owners received $1,200 per household, home purchasers received about $1,300, public tenants received $1,800 and private tenants received just $300. The affordability initiatives likely to be presented in the budget tonight redress that imbalance. I support the bill. (Time expired) Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

24,Mr DUNCAN,DAIRY PRODUCE AMENDMENT,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill and the associated dairy produce levy No. 1 and No.2 bills is to implement replacement domestic market support arrangements for the Australian dairy industry to operate from 1 July 1995. The passage of these bills will fulfil the government's commitment to the Australian dairy industry that it will deliver the same levels of support or as near as possible to that which would have been delivered under the 1992 dairy plan, had it continued, including the phased reductions of levels of support, to the year 2000. The need to change the domestic support arrangements is a direct and unavoidable consequence of obligations incurred as a result of the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations. The current mechanism involves an 'all .. milk levy' on the production of all milk which in turn is paid as a 'market support payment' on exports. This has the effect of raising domestic prices and therefore facilitating a consumer transfer to producers of manufacturing milk. The 'market support payment' has been deemed an export subsidy under the Uruguay Round. Under the new World Trade Organisation agreement, Australia is obliged to reduce its export subsidies in terms of both the volume receiving the subsidy and the total amount paid in dollar terms. The existing mechanism does not allow for practical or acceptable reductions of volumes of exports receiving subsidies. Consequently, it has been necessary to change the policy to meet our World Trade Organisation membership commitments. This new plan will eliminate export subsidies completely. Because of executive council conventions, we have already amended the 1992 dairy plan to terminate market support payments by 1 July 1995. This was achieved with the passage of the Dairy Produce (World Trade Organisation Amendments) Act 1994 last December. This bill provides for the implementation of a replacement mechanism of domestic support to producers of manufacturing milk, making it clearly a domestic support arrangement under the Uruguay Round commitments. In continuing the phase out of the previously agreed levels of legislated domestic support, the bill provides a secure framework for further dairy industry adjustment, investment and rationalisation. To date, the industry has responded positively to the process of deregulation and lowering levels of support. By any reckoning, the 1986 and 1992 schemes have been extremely successful in assisting with the improvement of the competitive capability of the Australian dairy industry. Government dairy policy has facilitated, and will continue to facilitate, adjustments at the farm level as well as improvement to the competitive operations of manufacturers and processing facilities. This is a strongly performing and competitive industry. It has recovered from the depressed years of the 1970s but it is now enjoying strong growth as one of our top performing rural industries. The industry is achieving improved economies of scale at the farming and manufacturing level. There is also a very important improvement in the level of research and innovation utilised. These factors taken together are producing an unprecedented level of industry efficiency, product diversification and a period of substantial investment in new plant and equipment. The industry is now very well positioned to continue to expand and to capture an increased share of the growing Asian markets. Exports of dairy products have set new records of about $1.3 billion in both 1992-93 and 1993-94. Under the new domestic support mechanism this process of restructuring and industry growth will continue, and it will place the industry in a very sound position by the year 2000. The new mechanism and arrangements covered by the bill have industry approval and I commend industry for joining, in close consultation with the government, in developing them. The main features of the new policy are as follows. The current levy imposed on market milk will continue and provide an intra-industry transfer from the market milk sector to manufacturing milk producers. It will be paid by producers but collected by manufacturers. An additional levy will be imposed on milk manufacturers on the. milk used in the manufacture of dairy products other than market milk. This levy will be paid by manufacturers and will subsequently be either reimbursed by a rebate of the levy component of the export or passed on to domestic consumers through the pricing mechanism on the domestic market. In effect, the manufacturers, by passing on the levy component to consumers, will achieve the same level of consumer transfer-and no more-than would have resulted had the arrangements negotiated in 1992 been able to follow their course to the year 2000. The imposition of the levies is addressed in the accompanying levy bills and the respective second reading speeches. All dairy levies will be changed to a milk fat and protein basis consistent with the basis for payment by manufacturers for milk received from producers. The consumer transfer is limited by the maximum levels specified under the 1992 plan which phases down to the year 2000. Our preliminary estimates, and these will most probably be revised, indicate that the level of consumer transfer and the intraindustry transfer together will total around $140 million for 1995-96. To ensure the cost to manufacturers of running this new scheme is minimised, manufacturers will be able to offset their levy rebate entitlements for exports in any given month against the levy liability for that month. In the case of downstream manufacturers who do not pay levy, but who export dairy produce on which levy has been paid, a rebate will be paid by the Australian Dairy Corporation. These downstream manufacturers are responsible for about five to 10 per cent of exports. There are no resultant costs to other sectors of society as a result. It is important to note that these rebates of the levy component in exports, whether offset against levy liability or paid direct, will not exceed the levy that would be imposed. In other words, as there is no net benefit to exporters, there is no export subsidy. The administration of import offsets will be improved by moving to a milk fat and protein basis consistent with the basis of levies and support payments. Receipts from the manufacturing and market milk levies over and above the amount needed to reimburse for export sales and administration costs will be paid directly to manufacturing milk producers by the Australian Dairy Corporation. The Governor General will prescribe the rate for the manufacturing levy after taking into consideration a recommendation made to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics after the bureau has consulted the Australian Dairy Corporation. The level of support and thus the manufacturing levy rate will be calculated on an annual basis for the life of this new plan. As mentioned earlier, the level of support under the new mechanism will be unchanged from that which would have been provided under the 1992 dairy plan had it continued. The impact on domestic prices will be unchanged. The new policy will, in fact, be an improvement on the 1992 dairy plan as it will be clearly identifiable as a solely domestic support scheme and not. an export subsidy which delivers a domestic support scheme. After 30 June 1995 manufacturers will not be able to claim an export support payment on any of the 30 June 1995 stock on hand which might be exported. Industry practice has been to prepay the expected consumer transfer resulting from the market support payment in the price paid to the producers of milk on delivery. As market support payments are not paid until produce is exported, manufacturers stand to be disadvantaged. To avoid any disruption to the mar-et and allow manufacturers to recoup this prepayment, stocks on hand at 30 June 1995 will attract an export rebate at the manufacturers levy rate applicable when exported or the consumer transfer when sold on the domestic market. The export rebate on these stocks will create a debt to the domestic market support fund which will be fmanced by borrowings by the Australian Dairy Corporation and be repaid by producers of manufactured milk over the life of the scheme, through a reduction in support payments. The Australian Dairy Corporation will be charged with administering the market support fund. Manufacturers will be allowed an additional one-month grace in the deadline for payment of the manufacturing levy so as to offset the increased inventory cost associated with moving to the new scheme. These costs would otherwise have been incurred because manufacturers would have had to pay the levy well in advance of receiving the rebate of the levy on exports. For administrative reasons the lagging will have to apply to all the industry levies, including the market milk, corporation, research and development, and promotion levies. This will not mean a loss of one month's receipts from these levies, simply a delay in payment. To wind up the scheme, the levy component within all stocks on hand as at 30 June 2000 will be paid out by the fund managed by the Australian Dairy Corporation. In the event of a positive balance in the domestic market support fund, after payment for stocks, the remaining funds will be distributed to the promotion or corporation administration funds to be used in the interests of the industry. In the event of a deficit balance, the Australian Dairy Corporation will draw on the corporation's promotion or administration funds or borrow against those funds to extinguish the debt. Any borrowings will be repaid by an increase in the corporation and/or promotion levy. Either way, there will be no cost or liability to the Commonwealth arising from the completion of the scheme. The new bill before the House further amends the Dairy Produce Act 1986 as amended and related acts to institute new arrangements which will continue to provide a framework for dairy industry adjustment and a phasing down of support to 30 June in the year 2000 when legislated support terminates. As a result of this bill, the capacity to expand and develop the industry will continue and it will be well placed to capture market opportunities as they become available. The Australian dairy industry should then have a competitive edge on all its competitors and be well placed as the natural supplier of dairy product to the expanding markets of Asia, the Pacific rim in particular. This bill also demonstrates Australia's firm commitment to both the letter and spirit of the World Trade Organisation agreement, its obligation and the global benefits of trade liberalisation. I commend the bill to honourable members. DAIRY PRODUCE LEVY (No.1) AMENDMENT BILL 1995 This bill gives effect to the levy aspects of new dairy market support arrangements beginning on 1 July 1995. These arrangements were outlined in the second reading to the Dairy Produce Amendment Bill 1995. From 1 July 1995 all dairy industry levies will be based on the milk fat content and on the protein content of milk consistent with basis on which manufacturers pay producers for milk supplied. The current all milk levy will be replaced by two separate levies: one imposed on market milk and the other on manufacturing milk. The market milk levy will be imposed on milk received by a manufacturer, as defined in the bill, for processing for consumption as liquid milk in Australia and paid by the producer. This will provide a continuation of the intra-industry transfer from market milk producers to manufacturing milk producers which is inherent in the present scheme. The manufacturing milk levy will be imposed on all other milk received by manufacturers and will be paid by those manufacturers. This levy is the cornerstone of the new support arrangements whereby manufacturers effectively prepay a consumer transfer, through the Australian Dairy Corporation, to producers of manufacturing milk and recoup it from consumers in the price of dairy products. Both the market milk and manufacturing milk levies will be appropriated to the Australian Dairy Corporation for payment to manufacturing milk producers after allowance for various payments described in the Dairy Produce Amendment Bill 1995. Producers will continue to pay the corporation, promotion, and research and development levies which are imposed on all milk received by manufacturers. Manufacturers will be able to obtain rebate of the manufacturing levy paid on exported dairy products. Under the new arrangements manufacturers will be able to offset their monthly gross manufacturing levy liability by the milk fat and protein rate of levy applied to the respecAmendment tive components of the dairy produce that they exported in that month. This will reduce the potential amount of funds flowing through the system thereby reducing the financial and administration costs for the majority of manufacturers. Rebates to downstream manufacturers are addressed under the Dairy Produce Amendment Bill 1995. Where the rebate offset results in a negative levy payment, there is no contingent liability the on the Commonwealth to pay the negative amount. The Dairy Produce Amendment Bill 1995 provides for the Australian Dairy Corporation to pay any negative amount from the domestic market support fund. A system of import offsets is currently applied to like products imported and exported to avoid businesses importing dairy produce simply to exploit the scheme and obtain the market support payment upon export of the same or like product. The bill provides for the continuation of an import offset scheme whereby the amount of levy on a milk fat and protein basis of produce imported in a month, which would have been paid had the produce been produced locally, will be deducted from any rebate on exports or levy liability export reduction in that month. If the imports in a month are greater than exports the excess will be carried forward until it is fully offset against exports. The system is also improved under this bill by moving to a milk. fat and protein basis consistent with levy imposition, export rebate and domestic market support payments. The bill also specifies maximum rates for the milk fat and protein components of the levies. Operational rates will be prescribed in regulations. Other levy rates will be recommended by the Australian Dairy Industry Council. This bill also repeals part (iii) of the Dairy Produce Levy (No.1) Act 1986 which relates to the supplementary market support payments scheme, which was operated from 1986 to 1989 and has since been wound up. I commend the bill to honourable members. DAIRY PRODUCE LEVY (No.2) AMENDMENT BILL 1995 This bill complements the Dairy Produce Bill Levy (No.1) Bill 1995 and the Dairy Produce Amendment Bill 1995. The purpose of this bill is to prevent re-imported Australian dairy produce, for which a levy rebate or levy liability offset has been allowed upon export, from receiving the consumer transfer when sold on the domestic market. Accordingly, the bill provides for a levy to be imposed on the milk fat and protein content of the imports at the manufacturing levy rate applying at the time of import. The levy is payable by the importer. Part (ii) of the Dairy Produce Levy (No.2) Act 1986 relates to the supplementary market support payment scheme, which - has been wound up and is repealed by this bill. I commend the bill to honourable members.",30
25,Mr ANDERSON,DAIRY PRODUCE AMENDMENT,"Gwydir-Deputy Leader farmers of the National Party of Australia) (2.23 p.m.)-This legislation, as put before the House, replaces the old dairy legislation that price. was found to be GATT illegal. It is a pity it was found to be GATT illegal. I hope our people argued the case as effectively as they could have for a continuation of a scheme which was in the end not funded by taxpayers but funded by the industry and which was being phased out anyway. However, the agreement was found to be GATT illegal and the industry, to its great credit, indicated to the government that it would allow that agreement to be phased out ahead of the announcement of any replacement arrangement. The coalition agreed that it would support any package which gave the dairy industry same advantages, which impacted in the same way on consumers and on manufactUrers and which was GATT legal. In essence, we have a package before us now which matches what was known as the Crean plan. The all milk levy, which was the centrepiece of the Crean plan, is before us. We support it. The legislation that the dairy industry was operating under, which phases its assistance Crean plan. down to the equivalent of a five per cent tariff by the year 2000, was considered GATT illegal because it was seen as a subsidy to exports. As I have said, the industry, the government and the coalition agreed that this legislation should be removed. What needs to be said about the old arrangement is that worked on a levy paid by dairy farmers on milk. The money was pooled and then used to assist export returns; and it was on a sliding scale, whereby it was to be phased by the year 2000. This assistance to exports came, I suppose you could say, in the face of difficult circumstances confronting the industry in this country in years gone by. It was a progressive and very appropriate strategy, which encouraged an outward looking export oriented approach by the dairy industry, to which the industry has responded very positively. It built export performance. It acted as an incentive for dairy companies to continue to maintain and build that export performance and it provided mechanisms and incentives by which dairy and the dairy industry were encouraged not to dump their product on the home market, thus having a deflating effect on the The new legislation sets a levy on market milk-as opposed to all milk-which will amount to no more than the current all milk levy and which will based on protein and fat rather than just fat content. This levy will be paid by farmers supplying market milk. It is GATT legal because market milk, as a general principle, is not seen as an export oriented product. Under the new arrangement, instead of farmers paying a levy on the milk being used for manufacture, as they now do, there will be a levy on domestic manufactured products the paid by manufacturers. These funds will be redistributed to farmers based on the amount of manufactured milk, as opposed to market milk, they have supplied. It means that the assistance will now be clearly identified as a domestic market support scheme rather than an export subsidy scheme. This makes it GATT legal and the effective phase down in the rate o(assistance will continue at the same rate as the old legislation under the so-called The new scheme will terminate on 30 June 2000. Any surplus funds left over at that time will go to the Australian Dairy Corporation. It ought to be noted that there will be no reason for the price of dairy products on the it domestic market to rise, because the new all arrangements will simply take the levy that was previously paid on all milk and place it on market milk and product. It should also be out noted that, because the levy is now to be levied on the basis of protein and fat, there may be some minor adjustments in the level of payments that individual farmers do receive. At this time, it is worth making the point tnat there is no great cause for concern in that. If it runs as well as it ought, those variations will be minor in the extreme. Under the new arrangement, ABARE, in conjunction with the ADC, the Australian Dairy Corporation, will estimate the annual level of support that would have been provided under the 1992 plan and the government will then set an appropriate rate for the levy by regulation, having had regard to ABARE's advice. The government's further amendments before us today, which we heard of only in the last few hours",34
26,Mr LLOYD,DAIRY PRODUCE AMENDMENT,There were five pages. I hope they have got it right.,35
27,Mr ANDERSON,DAIRY PRODUCE AMENDMENT,"I hope they got it right. They should have got it right before; nonetheless, we have them before us and we trust that they are properly drafted. They deal with the import provisions and ensure their legality in terms of the obligations that we have taken on under GATT. The import offset provisions are designed to protect the amount of dairy market support flowing to manufacturing milk producers. Without these provisions being put in place, anyone prepared to manipulate the system could have obtained an unfair fmancial advantage or gain by exporting dairy produce that had been imported or displaced from the domestic market by imports and then have claimed an export rebate without paying any manufacturing levy, which would, obviously, have been a distortion and would have allowed people to profit inappropriately. Accordingly, and in response to this, an import offset levy payable by direct importers and an acquisition offset levy payable by a manufacturer who acquires product from an importer who has not paid import offset levy will be imposed on an annual assessment basis. These levies are not a surrogate import levy as the levies are only applied against export rebate. This is done on the GATT-legal principle that indirect taxation costs on production can be legally rebated. This is an important principle for Australian agriculture. The government has refused absolutely even to sincerely acknowledge it exists, though a previous minister for primary industry in this place did once concede across the table that indirect costs to agriculture arising out of the government's wholesale sales tax mess are costing primary industry in this country a fortune. The government's own Treasury estimates some years ago indicated the figure was well in excess of $1 billion. Nothing is being done about it. We hear much from the government about the money that it has been providing for· drought relief in the current disastrous circumstances, but that money pales into insignificance by contrast with the money that flows into Treasury from the farm sector regardless of whether the farm sector, or any part of it, is making money or going broke. It is an absurdity. No other sophisticated Western economy allows such an absurd imposition on its farmers-against its farm sector. This government ought not to either. I want to say a few words about the dairy industry. It is unquestionably one of Australia's great success stories. Only some 10 years or so ago the government was concerned that if the industry produced more than six billion litres of milk per year we would have a glut, the product would become unsaleable, prices would crash and we would have massive and widespread poverty and hardship not just among dairy farmers but across the communities in which they live. As a result of the very forward looking actions of the industry and its great push to value add product and to export value added product, this year there is likely to be a production well in excess of eight billion litres of milk. It will all be sold. Export income is expected to top $1.4 billion and, as a general principle, dairy farmers are doing very nicely. That is to be welcomed. The industry is to be commended. These things do not come about by accident, of course. It ought to be noted that the the industry has been at the forefront of quality assurance. For many years it has controlled very well the quality of the product as it goes from the cow in the paddock through to the plate in the house. Australia has developed a worldwide reputation for dairy products of extremely high quality. The industry has taken us from, not so terribly many decades ago, having to deliver milk daily, because its keeping qualities are not particularly good, to a situation where today Australian dairy product has use-by dates that are the envy of the world. Those who understand the food processing sector will know that the only way to achieve those sorts of results is to ensure that quality, particularly in relation to hygiene and cleanliness, is the principal concern at every stage of production. It virtually starts with the selection of the cow, where performance measurement has been in place for decades. What the cow eats is extremely important. Australian farmers are at the top end of the world's technology and production capability in terms of pasture management. It is also extremely important to pay strict attention to details such as the withholding of milk from cows treated with medications and the whole question of hygiene and refrigeration standards on the farm, in transport, in the factory and subsequently in the distribution chain. Farmers in this country have embraced a technology of bulk milk cell counts to ensure that they are not contaminating milk because they kl).ow that only the best milk should be put into cheese and other dairy products which are also produced at very high standards. Dairying is an industry that has proven that growers can value add and look after their industry past the farm gate. Around 70 per cent of all milk produced in this country is handled by dairy farmer cooperatives. Unless things have changed, it is my understanding that Australia's dairy industry is the world's second most efficient. We are matched, or indeed outdone, only by the New Zealanders, and there are some very good reasons for the slight competitive advantage they add. Some of those reasons ought to be addressed by those opposite because they are not industry constraints so much as government imposed constraints. However, it is a great tribute to the industry that it is able to perform so well in current day Australia. In the past, the industry faced the problem of undercapitalisation. That particularly applied to the cooperative ventures that are a hallmark of the industry. That too is changing. As the industry has aggressively developed branded products, particularly specialised products for the niche markets and so forth, the profitability of the industry has improved. It has become a great place for investment, and that investment has grown. Finally, you really cannot talk about the dairy industry today without paying tribute in general terms to the industry's leadership. Today I would like to place on record the great respect that I and other members of the coalition have-and I am sure the government has-for its current leader, Pat Rowley. Pat Rowley has led the industry through difficult times, including the lead-up to this legislation where dairy farmers were left in limbo in a situation where they had to trust the government-always a brave undertaking-to deliver on its verbal commitment, if you like, to replace the all milk levy with something that had the same positive effects for the industry and the Australian economy. During his term in leadership, he has also managed to keep the dairy industry well informed and united. He has played a great role in getting the industry to formulate its own policies, its own changes and its own approaches to the future without having them imposed on the industry by government. That means, or has meant, that change has been achieved without political intervention and without squabbling amongst the different sectors within the industry. To a large extent, the secret to Mr Rowley's large success is that he works away in the background quietly, efficiently .and persuasively. He does not play it out in the media; he prefers instead to get everybody focused on the best way forward, the best way to reach agreement and the best way to then turn to the government and convince it of the case's value. Having finished with that tribute to the industry's leadership in general but to its current leader in particular, I do commend this legislation to the House. We join with the government in supporting it. I wish the dairy industry well.",35
28,Mr HARRY WOODS,DAIRY PRODUCE AMENDMENT,"Let me first of all support the comments made by the member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) regarding the leadership of the dairy industry, particularly that of Pat Rowley. Over a number of years he has shown very good and strong leadership, which is one of the important ingredients of the dairy industry's success as a whole over the last 10 or 15 years. A lot of other industries could look to the dairy industry as an example of good leadership and see what an important ingredient that is in the ultimate success of an industry. Of course there are other ingredients that make it a success, not least the dairy farmers themselves. As the dairy farmers have gone towards greater efficiency and productivity over the years, they have displayed a great ability to change. The ingredients of a good dairy farmer are present in the majority of dairy farmers-that is, pasture quality, stock quality and good management practices on the farm. All dairy farmers, or certainly the vast majority of them, are showing such ingredients, particularly good management. They are planning and setting goals for the years ahead and are aiming for those goals. In seeking and getting the knowledge to assist reaching those goals, they are producing quality cows on quality pastures reSUlting in a quality product. Those ingredients along with the manufacturers, the processors and the cooperatives have been instrumental in the success of the dairy industry. The Australian dairy industry is assured of continuing support to the year 2000 through the existing marketing arrangements for manufacturing milk. Under the current arrangements, a producer levy on all milk is used to make support payments on exported dairy products, effectively raising the price received for exports. As a result, supplies are diverted away from the domestic market and the domestic price rises to be equivalent to the world price plus the export support 'payment. Thus support for the dairy industry is derived from higher domestic prices resulting in a transfer from Australian consumers to the dairy industry. However, the export support payments made under the current plan are considered to be an export subsidy under GA TT, even though they are not directly funded from government revenue, which is the case in the United States and the European Union. The new arrangements, due to come into effect soon, are to provide the same level of support as would have been afforded under the 1992 plan, but are to be consistent with the GATT agreement. The level of support under the new GATT arrangements is also due to phase down over the period in line with the schedule of reduction in support under the old arrangements. The Dairy Produce Amendment Bill 1995, the Dairy Produce Levy (No.1) Amendment Bill 1995 and the Dairy Produce Levy (No. 2) Amendment Bill 1995 give effect to the government's commitment to provide a support mechanism which will deliver the same level of support as that which would have been delivered under the 1992 dairy plan had the current scheme continued to its scheduled termination on 30 June 2000. As such the bills continue the secure framework for further adjustment, investment and rationalisation provided under the 1986 Kerin plan and the 1992 Crean plan, which have been extremely successful in assisting with the improvement of the competitive capability of the Australian dairy industry. Extensive consultation has taken place among the Australian Dairy Corporation, which will administer the scheme, the Australian Dairy Industry Council and the Department of Primary Industries and Energy in refining the operation and the administration of the new arrangements which are embodied in the legislation. The new scheme is supported by the dairy industry and the Australian Dairy Corporation. The scheme will terminate on 30 June 2000, after which there will be no further legislative support to the dairy industry, which can then expect to be treated, within the Australian economy, in the same manner as other rural industries. Over the medium term-that is, to around the year 2000-Australian manufacturing milk prices are projected to rise by about 11 per cent in real terms and average about 28.4c litre in 1999-2000. The projected increase manufacturing milk returns reflects the optiIt mistic outlook for the world dairy market. That optimism is shared by the industry the government. Market milk prices are projected to increase by around three per cent in real terms tween 1994-95 and 1999-2000 and average before: around 49.3c a litre in 1999-2000. The foredairy cast rise in market milk prices is based on assumption that state dairy authorities concooperate, tinue to administer prices based production. Whilst all state dairy authorities will have deregulated post farm gate margins by 1999, there is as yet no provision deregulating the price producers r,eceive market milk. . Australian milk production is projected rise by around 16 per cent over the medium term reaching 9- million litresby 1999-2000. Production increases, projected to be about three per cent each year, are likely to reflect increasing cow numbers, as well as improved pasture and livestock management techniques and increased capital investment. The outlook for the dairy industry is mistic, but this will not be achieved without more of the ingredients I mentioned earlier. I do not know how resourceful dairy farmers are. I know quite a few of them up my way are. I Jhink it is ageneral trait of dairy mers that they strive for productivity, efficiency,good pastures and a good quality product. bills. If that is the case, it will be a stronger and stronger industry in Australia It will put more into the export markets than it does at present. The Asia-Japan area presents a large opporenormous tunity over the next five years, and I have doubt that the dairy industry will take a large slice of that. In my own area, the Norco Cooperative' is a major employer on the north coast of New South Wales. It is one of the largest-if not the largest-single employer on the north coast of New South Wales. It is the second largest dairy cooperative in New South Wales. At present it sells mainly on the domestic market, but it is increasing its push into export markets. It markets Dairy Farmers milk, Norco butter and ice-cream, and Danone a and Spring Grove cheese. It has been an in integral part of Norco's life for many years. is a part of the Australian dairy industry that is looking ahead. Over the past 10 years and it has taken enormous steps forward. I am sure that over the next five years it will take further steps forward. This will be achieved beif it maintains the ingredients I mentioned strong leadership in the industry; good farmers; a good processing industry; and the an ability, as industry leaders have shown, to put strongly their views to governon cost of ment and get good outcomes. The main features of the amendments to the three bills include the annual assessment of for the levy payable on milk fat and protein for content of· imports against export credits, either as a levy liability reduction or export to rebate; the import offset levy up to the level of export credit of importers, which is covered by the Dairy Produce Levy (No.2) Amendment Bill; the acquisition offset levy up to the level of export credit where imported product is acquired from an importer, which is covered by the Dairy Produce Levy (No.1) Amendment Bill; related companies being treated as a unit to prevent internal optimanipulation within the group by one company importing but not exporting and by another exporting but not importing, thereby avoiding levy; and the avoidance of double payment. These issues have also been disfarcussed with the industry, which is satisfied with the approach reflected in the amending Over the coming years I look forward to a stronger and stronger dairy industry. It has an 'potential. This type of legislation no which has been formulated in cooperation with industry is certainly worthy of support. I appreciate the fact that the government and the opposition support it.",37
29,Mr LLOYD,DAIRY PRODUCE AMENDMENT,"This legislation is just in time for the commencement of the next dairy season. It is also just in time for the commencement of the Uruguay Round of the GATT which requires this legislation. I commend the government for delivering the legislation in time. I agree with the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia and shadow minister, the member for Gwydir e Mr Anderson), when he referred to the uncertainty that was created in the industry by the old legislation being terminated ahead of the new legislation. I know the dairy industry leaders trusted the government and that trust was repaid. I want to congratulate the leaders of the dairy industry. Reference has been made to Pat Rowley, and I support that. I would also include other people from the ADIC and the ADFF, such as Peter Gallagher and John MCQueen, and John Watson from the UDV. I also congratulate the dairy farmers of Australia. They have shown, I think, more than members of any other industry in Australia-primary, secondary or service-a positive attitude to change and to difficulties confronting them in the export market. If one looks at the average age of dairy farmers, I think it is the best-that is, the youngestaverage age of any form of farmer. They have a high capacity to accept new technology and management. That is why annual productivity increase at the dairy farm level in this indusIt try consistently, over a number of years, has been higher than for any other industry in Australia, primary or secondary. I also commend the Deputy Leader of the National Party for the very positive and bipartisan approach that he has continued to adopt to ensure that these dairy bills are progressed as quickly as possible. However, he did recognise, as have we on the coalition side for a number of years, that input costs are a very important determinant in the profitability of dairy farmers. That is why the dairy industry, to its credit, openly supported the GST proposal, which was fundamental to our policy in the last election-it would have reduced input costs. With the GST, the average cost per dairy farmer per year would have fallen by quite a few thousand dollars. However, there is another factor to why input costs are important to dairy farmersthat is, the international dairy market is the most corrupt of any international trade. Agricultural trade is generally more corrupt; hence the importance of progress with the Uruguay Round of the GATT. For example, the average export subsidy on dairy product from the European Union or European Community is about twice the price the Australia dairy farmer receives. Compared with wheat, the trade in which is also corrupt, the export subsidy that the Americans or Europeans would give would be about half the export price of the product. You can see the greater degree of difficulty the dairy farmers of Australia have had to face; they have had to face it for a longer period of time than has any other agricultural exporter. As a result of that, the rationalisation has been greater and there has been a lot of pain. So in the dairy industry of Australia now we do have a very lean and efficient industry. This new mechanism that we are talking about in this legislation will overcome that technical GATT problem. It will not cover all milk; it will be just domestic milk. It will be levied on both protein and butterfat. In fact, there is quite a swing here. It is important because that is where the price is for dairy product now-with protein more than milk. will be levied on 65 per cent protein to 35 per cent butterfat, whereas the old all milk levy was purely on butterfat. I understand the payment-or the repayment, if you like-will be shown separately on the dairy farmer's statement. That is important because it is what is called 'transparency'-that is, dairy farmers are aware of that element. Because this level of support is declining, they are more aware of what the future may hold for them after the year 2000. We are told that there will be a delay in the mechanism, a lag time in the levy being returned to those who are exporting. Thatwill mean that there could be some confusion in the early days or weeks of the new scheme. But I am confident, and hope, that it will settle down and that dairy farmers will be able to budget quite confidently once they can see what is happening with the new system. In my electorate of Murray, the dairy industry is the largest primary and secondary-or, if you like, manufacturingindustry. After the electorate of Murray in northern Victoria has been enlarged for the next election to once again include the Cobram area, it will be easily the most significant dairy area of Australia with almost 30 per cent of total production-and I do acknowledge the other significant dairy areas of Australia, such as Gippsland and the Western District, and parts of New South Wales, Queensland and Tasmania. There are 10 very large dairy factories in the electorate, including the two largest dairy companies in Australia, the two big cooperatives of Bonlac and Murray-Goulburn. Tatura is another cooperative. The two giant multinational diary companies, Kraft and Nestle, are basing their Australian production more and more on factories in the electorate. Then we have Yoplait and Snow Brand. Snow Brand is a very large Japanese dairy company, one of the largest dairy companies in the world. . It has recognised that this part of Australia, the Murray electorate, the northern irrigation area of Victoria, is where much of the future expansion of the dairy industry will take place. I indicated that, in general, the industry Australia has had amazing productivity. In my electorate, the growth in productivity is about 10 per cent per year. Exports of dairy products from the Murray electorate are about $700 million per year or about half the total dairy exports from Australia. By the year 2000, I believe the electorate will produce more than a billion dollars worth of exports, unless something unforeseen happens. I calculate that in Victoria, which is the major dairy state in Australia, dairy exports this will be about $1.2 billion. The dairy industry is the largest manufacturing export industry·in Victoria, but it is generally not recognised because the media and other people usually concentrate on the industry involving the manufacture of non-farm processed goods. The dairy industry is our most significant manufacturing export. There are some restrictions on the future growth of this industry. The first restriction is the capital requirement. This is a particular problem with cooperatives. Naturally, farmer members want to retain control, but there is a limit on the profits that can be retained by the factory for expansion, because the farmers themselves are engaged in a high degree of capital expansion and refmement on their own farms. The second restriction is that these days capital is not just needed for the initial processing. It is also needed for the second round, if you like, which is value adding. There is increasingly a third element of capital required for the environment, that is, water quality. There are World Health Organisation standards on the water quality into the factories and increasing restrictions-and I do not knock this-{)n effluent from the factories, which means additional costs. As many people would recognise, my electorate has a problem with salinity because of irrigation. I do not think salinity is an immediate problem to the future expansion of the dairy industry as is the ability to handle the increasing effluent in an environmentally acceptable way. At the moment, the calculation is that about $100 million needs to be spent by the local water authorities in the area to bring the quality of water into the factory in and the effluent control out of the factory to international standards. The third restriction on the future growth of this industry could be government policies, a very important element. There needs to be cost restraints so that there is a profit for those who are involved in this very demanding industry. A part of this involves infrastructure efficiency, otherwise known as micro-economic reform or, as it is now known, Hilmer reform. Again, I think of year water but, in particular, of electricity. One of the biggest problems facing dairy factories in my electorate-therefore, this is an important element of total dairy production in Australia-is the lack of electricity capacity. This results in an unstable supply and power surges, which creates a loss of millions and millions of dollars a year. Both the efficient distribution of electricity and its cost--electricity is one of the major costs confronting dairy farmers and factories-will be very significant to the profitability of dairying in the future. Another infrastructure element is transport. Our containers should be 40 tonnes rather than 20 tonnes as they are at the moment. There needs to be a dramatic improvement in the efficiency of the port of Melbourne, from which most of our product is exported. It is unfortunate that, after some initial improvement, the port of Melbourne appears to be slipping again into a high cost port. Dairy farmers are experiencing some shortterm difficulties. At the moment they are facing a significant profit squeeze. This is obvious in the drought areas because of the reduced pasture and the very high price of grain and hay. In the irrigation areas, there are water restrictions. In spite of comments about firming international prices, the price the dairy farmer has been receiving so far has n-t been nearly as good as many people thmk. The world price is firming. Russia is back in the dairy market as a commercial buyer. The Europeans are reducing the export subsidies, and the higher currency level of the European countries is adding to that as well.",38
30,Mr SPEAKER,DAIRY PRODUCE AMENDMENT,Order! It b-ing 3.00 p.m.; the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order lOlA. The debate may be resumed at a later hour. The honourable member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. QUESTION TIME: ROSTER OF NA,41
31,Mr BEAZLEY,MINISTERS," Mr Speaker, I present the question time roster as at today. NA Budget 1995-96",41
32,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Finance and Leader of the House. Is it not a fact that before families watch the budget tonight on television they first have to decide whether they can trust what the government is saying? Is it not also a .fact th-t the government has promised it Will not mcrease the Medicare levy and has promised to give families the l-a-w tax cuts? If those two promises on tax and health are broken tonight, why should families t-r-u-s-t anything the government says about anything else in the budget?",41
33,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I would have thought with your record on the budget you would be shamefaced asking a question like thatabsolutely shamefaced! .,41
34,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You are an absolute liar.,41
35,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You call me an absolute liar,41
36,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, I do.",41
37,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The Leader of the House knows better, as does the Leader of the Opposition. Let us just get back to what is acceptable parliamentary language.",41
38,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have long since ceased t? expect tha- from the Leader of the Opposition. Let me Just go to his record on that. He is the fellow who, within eight months of an election, got up before this House and said 'Because it is not possible for us to makbudget cuts, because the pain that would be inflicted upon society would be too great if we did, we are going to withdraw the taxation promises that we made at the last election.' He said that eight months afterwards! The simple fact of the matter is that the l-a-w tax cuts had their first tranche implemented three years ago. The first tranche for the lower !nco.me earners, implemented three years ago, - s still there. As for the rest of the predictions m the budget, of course you will have to wait to see what the budget outcome is.",41
39,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,They are going! They are gone! Mr Downer-We heard this two years ago.,41
40,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,":-The minister, will just wait - or a moment. Both the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Mayo will cease interjecting while. the minister is responding to a question asked by the Leader of the Oppositiori. MrBEAZLEY-:-As far as this budget is concerned, we are totally convinced that what will come forward from this budget will conform with the requirements we set ourselves back when we put those tax cuts into l-a-w and is exactly what the nation needs now. We are certainly not wandering around the place making the ludicrous sorts of commitments made by your spokesman in response to your unguarded comments on the GST that never in hUinan history will he contemplate ever raising a tax in the entire life of himself and any future Liberal government. Such a promise could only be implemented through time by being paid for by the ordinary citizen through interest rates. . Multimedia Industry",41
41,Mr LES SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Communications and the Arts. Will the minister advise the House of the Commonwealth support for the multimedia industry? What are the implications of that support for the future of the industry?,42
42,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The production of programming material using new forms of communications technology is something that has tremendous potential to create a lot of jobs and export earnings for Australia for many years to come. One way to demonstrate the importance of this new technology is the simple fact that Warner Bros, one of the major players in this industry, is expecting to produce over 25,000 CD-ROM titles in the next five years. It is vital that we have the Australian content creation industry working to make sure it is staking a part in this important industry. I know that in the honourable member's electorate, particularly in Ipswich, there great deal of interest in information superhighways and the opportunities that can create for people in rural and provincial Australia, in cities such as Ipswich. But the government believes that one way we can seek to ensure that we build up partnerships in this industry is to have the government playing a very active role. In Creative Nation we announced that we would b- putting up $84 million to encourage private sector investment and partnerships between the government and the private sector in multimedia. To give people some example of what this means, I am sure many honourable members or their children at least are aware of a CDROM which is out at the moment called Encarta, produced by Microsoft. It provides a little bit of information about Australia's Aborigines and Aboriginal culture. It is only when you turn to the CD-ROM which has been produced by the Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies that you a much more detailed picture of Aboriginal culture. Not only can you get the text, the diagrams and the photographs that are in the book form of the Aboriginal encyclopedia, but you can get photographs, the audio tracks of oral histories and you can even get some quite rare archival footage which is also restored on the CD-ROM. The way that Australian culture can be presented using new forms of communications technology is really quite interesting. The important thing is that in using these new forms of technology we are making sure that Australians and Australian kids in particular are not deluged with foreign content, are not deluged with content which is produced in North America in particular. We have to understand that kids will absorb the values in the American content as quickly as they will absorb the spelling in the American content. So that is one reason why the government has put $84 million into stimulating the industry; $45 million into a new joint venture capital company called Australian Multimedia Enterprise, which had its first meeting a week ago yesterday; and money into Australia on CD to make sure that quality Australian content such as this is available is a around the country. I am pleased that the government has already received 159 different proposals for ways that we can develop new Australian content that can be presented on CDs. It is interesting to contrast the government's efforts to develop partnerships with the private sector in developing this new content industry with the view of the opposition. The official spokesman for the opposition on communications has said that this is money down the drain-it is money down the drain to let kids learn about Aboriginal culture on CD-ROMs; it is money down the drain to have Australian industry being at the leading edge of the development of this new content creation industry-in the same way that you would say it is money down the drain to put anything into our cultural industries. The contrast is that we believe the most important decision that we have made to encourage the content creators in Australia is get our decision and determination to make sure there is open access on the cable-a decision we took last November, despite condemnation from the opposition which believed we were wrong to insist on open content on the cable. That is the decision that is going to make sure the Australian content creators can get to their customers out there around Australia by providing this material that might today be on CD-ROM but one day will come down that cable into your home. That is why it was so important that we have open access on that cable. That is why it is so hard to understand that the opposition preached support for Hilmer but was against open access on the cable last year. For these and other reasons, we will make sure that this industry continues to thrive with the stimulation the government is giving it. We want to develop these partnerships between government and industry to produce quality content such as this. Medicare Levy",42
43,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Human Services and Health. Minister, on 17 June last year you said, 'There is no proposal to increase the Medicare levy and there won't be. Both the Prime Minister and myself have repeatedly ruled out any increase.' If tonight's budget, predicted, increases the Medicare levy, will this be yet another warning to Australians that they cannot take you at your word?",43
44,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I think it is very clear just how desperate the opposition is to get into this budget because it cannot fault it on content.,43
45,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,43
46,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on my left!,43
47,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That press release and the statement. I made at the time were very clearly associated with a scare tactic which I think came from the opposition about the likely increase in the Medicare levy stemming from an ACTU caucus working group. I wanted to make it very clear that our private health insurance reforms would not be accompanied by an increase in the Medicare levynot only did I say so; the Prime Minister said so. Having said that, I add that you will have to wait until 7.30 tonight. Copyright Reform Program",43
48,Mr DODD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Justice. I refer to the government's copyright reform program. Will the minister advise whether there has been any international developments in this area that will definitely benefit Australia?,43
49,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. The strength of Australia's copyright laws has for a long time been recognised internationally, but there have been some areas of difficulty. Last week it was very pleasing to learn that the United States government has dropped Australia off a watch list of countries which it had deemed to have inadequate intellectual property laws. The list of offending countries appeared under a special section 301 of the United States trade act. Keeping Australia company on that list were countries such as Thailand, Taiwan, Singapore, China, the Philippines and Indonesia. We had long argued that the listing of Australia under section 301 was unjustified. That argument was made through diplomatic and trade channels but, until now, with no success. I understand that the dropping of Australia from the list was due to the continuas ing efforts made by our embassy in Washington and our continuing domestic copyright reforms. I am very happy to say that at long last the message has got through to the United States that Australia's intellectual property environment is world class and that its laws will continue to be so. The United States decision to drop Australia from that watch list was taken independently of Australia's decision on parallel importation of sound recordings, but that decision will certainly reduce the likelihood that Australia will be put back on the watch list. There has been some criticism of our decision on parallel importation. That decision was borne of our determination to make Australian industry world competitive whilst maintaining strong copyright protection. One of the reasons that the government could not stand by its 1992 decision on parallel importation of sound recordings was that it was inconsistent with our international obligations under GATT. The government's recent decision on this issue is consistent with our international obligations. The critics should also recognise that Australia is not on its own in restricting parallel importation. Quite to the contrary: we could not find a single country that allowed parallel importation, enjoyed low music prices, had an internationally competitive music industry and had low levels of piracy. In fact, we found that 10 countries in the last two years have introduced restrictions on parallel importations of sound recordings. I join with the comments that my colleague the Minister for Communications and the Arts has made today about the importance of growing a strong domestic content industry. We have a competitive advantage in our intellectual property area. It is an area we continue to support to grow and to advance the interests of all Australians. I reject the contemptuous attitude of the opposition towards that sector of intellectual endeavour in the arts, which is obviously manifested by the contempt it has shown in Flinders! relation to these issues. Budget 1995-96",43
50,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Finance. On 17 August 1992 dousTreasury I wrote to the former Treasury secretary, Mr 83 budget. Cole, seeking his assurance that the economic forecasts in the 1992 budget had subject to political interference. The then Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, replied that all related economic forecasts in the budget 'would be were prepared on 'as realistic a basis as possible'. Yet Mr Dawkins subsequently confessed in that the Australian on 9 February 1995 forecasts in his 1993 budget deliberately understated revenue forecasts. In light of this admitted deceit, why should anyone believe the figures in tonight's budget?",44
51,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As the honourable memwas? ber well knows-or he probably does not know-the forecasts which are produced in each budget are a product of discussion amongst government departments, and they are based on the best advice that is available at the time. The fact of the matter is that, you actually look at the forecasts we made the last budget-there is no particular magic about these figures: forecasts sometimes come through; sometimes they do not-you will see that we underestimated growth in GDP, we underestimated the improvement in employment, we overestimated the inflation we underestimated the growth in business investment. What political motive would there be in deliberately underestimating the rate of GDP growth and the rate of improvement in the employment position, in overestimating the rate of inflation and in underestimating the improvement in business investment? What particular merit would there be for a governus ment to wander around the place producing those sorts of underestimates? As you well know from your own experience, forecasts are will from time to time likely, as events transpire, to be more or less proved as the practical entirely impact of the economy comes on them. Mr Reith-But we are talking about cookgrowth and ing figures.",44
52,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for,44
53,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We have, for example, your experience. John Hewson said about your last budget: The in advising Mr Howard made horrenforecast errors on unemployment in the 1982not been John Hewson went on to say: Undoubtedly, part of the error in those forecasts to the fact that some of the powers that in Treasury at the time were not prepared to admit the possibility of a substantial rise in unemployment to a disturbed Malcolm Fraser for fear he might seek to blowout the budget deficit that announced in the 1982-83 budget. This was your budget. What did your wonderful budget estimate produce? You said in your budget that the forecast unemployment level would be 395,000. Do you recollect what it It was 540,000.. Were you lying?",44
54,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, your lies.",44
55,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the House will resume his seat. I have already remarked to both the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the House about if parliamentary language this afternoon. I do in not want to have to continue to do so.,44
56,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You have been given assurance from the Secretary to the Treasury as ,far as the budget figuring is concerned.",44
57,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Secretary to the Treasrate and ury has fingered you.,44
58,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You would have got this assurance from the secretary since we have been in office.,45
59,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the House will resume his seat. The Leader of the Opposition is given some discretion in this place by virtue of his position. That does not go to constantly talking across the chamber when a minister is being asked to respond to a question.,45
60,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You have the assurance of the Secretary to the Treasury-and you would have had this assurance from any Secretary to the Treasury since we have been in office-that he has no hesitation in providing the assurance that the forecasts prepared for the budget have not been subject to political interference. I would say any reasonable addressing of the record would suggest that that has been the case since we have been in office. Mr Reith-You are embarrassed that he has fingered you.,45
61,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Flinders! If you want to be here for the MPI, just relax.",45
62,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"However, as you well know, that is something that the last Secretary to the Treasury under your government could not say about the accuracy of your forecasts when he described the chap who wrote this article, your former leader, as a meretricious player. HMAS Voyager",45
63,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Attorney-General. What steps has the government taken to resolve outstanding claims for compensation from the former crew of the HMAS Voyager?,45
64,Mr LAV ARCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Members will recall that in May 1993 the government decided to settle something like 100 Voyager claims which were on foot at that time. That particular settlement scheme proceeded without an admission of liability on the part of the Commonwealth, but proceeded on the assumption that the Commonwealth was liable, and on a fair assessment of the lossphysical, emotional or mental-suffered by the particular survivors. The scheme decided by the government in 1993 was limited to claims that had been commenced against the Commonwealth prior to the enactment of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act in 1988. That legislation replaced common law actions against the Commonwealth and replaced them with the compensation scheme which we now know as Com care. It was thought at that time that that scheme would be sufficient to handle any further Voyager claims. As events have unturned, something like another 100 claims have been made since that cabinet decision. There has also been some judicial decisions on particular provisions of the Comcare legislation. In light of those decisions, though a number of legal issues are still outstanding, it was considered by the cabinet on 24 April that Voyager cases were not ones which should be used as test cases, as it were, for the settling of these issues, and the government agreed that all future claims regarding the Voyager would be settled in a· scheme similar to that which applied in May 1993. That means that the Commonwealth will enter into a process of mediation with the claimants. Already preliminary conferences have been held with the solicitors acting for the majority of the Voyager claimants. I expect that over the next number of months those mediations will proceed to an outcome. I should note that, of all the claims which were on foot at the time of the previous scheme, all were successfully negotiated and settled. It is my desire that that will be the outcome with all of these claims. It is my view that the cases involving the Voyager incident have unfortunately taken far too long to get to a settlement. I am pleased that the scheme now in place will hopefully speedily resolve all outstanding claims. Budget 1995-96",45
65,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again directed to the Minister for Finance and this time has a second example of where the government has clearly set out to mislead in a major economic statement. On this occasion I refer the minister to the example set out on the Four Corners program last night, where former Treasury Secretary Cole told of the political interference by the Prime Minister in drafting the 1992 One Nation package. I refer the minister to these words of Mr Cole: There was a committee that included Treasury representatives on it and our representatives gled to try to make sure that those projections retained credibility but in the final analysis they strained credibility . . . They were predominantly influenced by people in the Prime Minister's office. My question to the Minister for Finance is a very simple one: in the light of this admitted deceit, why should anyone believe the veracity of the figures in tonight's budget?",45
66,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"For the answer to this one honourable members can read the answer I gave to the last question, but I will add to it. The simple fact of the matter is that forecasts are prepared on the basis that there is consultation between the Treasury and between the other departments of government, the figures go through the ministers' offices and they are discussed through the ministers' offices. So far as this particular set of figures is concerned, the forecasts that were in the One Nation statement have more or less come through slightly underestimated.",46
67,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,46
68,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,They have. That is all there is to it.,46
69,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Oh, lies, lies. Hopeless. Mr Downer-That is pathetic.",46
70,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,46
71,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister has sat down. It is over. Coal Prices,46
72,Mr HARRY WOODS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Resources. Can the minister inform the House of the outlook for commodity prices? How do recent coal price settlements fit into that outlook?,46
73,Mr BEDDALL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Page for his question and his continued interest in the Australian resources sector. As the House would be aware, the resources sector accounts for 62 per cent of Australia's commodity exports and some 36 per cent of our total exports. The forecasts are, indeed, good because of the upturn in the world economic' situation. In fact, mineral commodity resource exports will be some $30.8 billion for 1994-95 and will rise to $34.2 billion in 1995-96. There are a number of good stories in this, strug- particularly in the aluminium-alumina sector where the rise this year will be 11 per cent and 14 per cent in 1995-96, to some $5.2 billion. Gold, while experiencing a fall this year of five per cent, will rise by 7.4 per cent in 1995-96, to bring in $5.4 billion. Iron ore, which has had a difficult time in recent years, will fall by six per cent this year but will grow by 8.6 per cent in 1995-96, to $2.83 billion. Even better news for our base metals is that the rises in base metal prices will be some 29 per cent this year and up to a further 21 per cent in 1995-96, giving us $3.86 billion worth of exports. The honourable member for Page referred in his question to the outcome on coal prices. Since this parliament last met, coal prices have been settled with Japan, which remains our largest market. The price rises were quite significant. For the first time this year, our coal exports will exceed $8 billion-by far our largest single export. Whilst the Australian negotiators took a very hard line and achieved notable price rises, they were, in some ways, punished for their persistence. Earlier settlements made by other countries meant that only some tonnages were left for Australia. The converse of that is that there is now a shortage of coal in other areas and the Australian mining community is very confident that it will pick up those extra markets. As the coal industry continues to grow, we are looking for additional markets. At the end of this week, I will be taking a coal mission to southern China and India, which are emerging markets for us and markets of great significance for the future. Budget 1995-96",46
74,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Finance. I refer the minister to his long explanations of how the government massages the budget figures. In light of that, I refer him to his interview with The World Today on 3 November 1994 in which he said: Evasion and fudging as opposed to downright lying is a reasonable way to operate. Is this the principle that you have applied to this year's budget, just as you have on previous occasions?",46
75,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I tell you what that was in response to. That was in response to: what are the responsibilities of ministers when they are invited to speculate on particular matters relating to government policy in the media? What I was discussing at that point of time, as I recollect, was how defence ministers, for example, handle sets of questions that go to national security or where there may be, as ministers will often have to confrontOpposition members-No, no, no!",47
76,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! Members on my left! Mr MCGauran-No, that was not what it was about.",47
77,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Gippsland!,47

79,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Berowra!,47
80,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"and national security--or a plethora of reasons that a government might have for not doing that-a particular set of propositions. What I was saying in those circumstances was that a minister should not lie. Ministers should not stand up in the chamber or anywhere else and utter a barefaced lie about what it is that have before them. This is a totally different situation, as opposed to the barefaced lie that was contained in the 1982-83 budget when it suggested that the unemployment figures for the year would be 390,000 when they knew they would be 540,000. Why was it a barefaced lie then? It was for the simple reason that Malcolm Fraser wanted to go to an election immediately after the budget. Mr Ho-ard-Got you! We have got you!",47
81,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Unfortunately for him, he had to hang around, because of the incompetence of his Treasurer in handling tax evasion issues-talking about evasion-and the bottom of the harbour schemes, until March when his and his Treasurer's lies were exposed. Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The particular quote and the remarks of the minister had nothing to do with defence or security matters. He is obviously evading the question.",47
82,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order. The honourable member will resume his seat. Biological Warfare,47
83,Mr HAVILAND,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel. I refer to reports that the Defence Science and Technology Organisation is conducting research into defence against biological warfare. Can the minister inform the House why this work was authorised?  member for Macarthur for his question. As honourable members would know, for quite some time-in fact for several decades-the Department of Defence, through DSTO, has conducted research into defence against chemical weapons. In this regard our support of the United Nations' position against aspects of chemical warfare in the Middle East and our contribution toward putting together the chemical warfare convention are well known. In that context, Defence has reviewed the case for research into defence against biological warfare and the government has endorsed a modest program to do exactly that. There are three basic reasons for doing this. First of all, advances in biological sciences and biotechnology have somewhat blurred what was already a confused relationship between chemical and biological agents. There is very clearly a need for our scientists to investigate the implications of these rapid advances for our national security. Secondly, it is possible that the government, as it does from time to time, would deploy ADF personnel in support of UN operations-for example, to areas where there may be risk of exposure to biological weapons. Thirdly, of course, such research contributes directly to our ability to help in arms control verification, a measure that is not of inconsequence for our credibility in a range of fields. In that context it also serves to facilitate access by us to related defensive research which is conducted by our allies. There will, of course, be limits to this research. It will not include, for instance, work on live-that is, reproducingorganisms that are pathogenic to humans, animals or plants. This is what is commonly meant by biological warfare or germ warfare. It will be allowed to include work on nonpathogenic substances such as toxins and bioregulators. This, of course, is similar to the present work of Defence on defence against chemical warfare. Other work might include theoretical or computer simulation studies of biological war hazards and methods of detection of biological warfare agents.",47
84,Mr CADMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Where are they doing it?  stress that this review of policy does not mark a sudden increase in the threat to Australia from biological weapons. It reflects the general concerns I have outlined rather than any particular threat or need to respond to any perceived threat. Of course, I cannot comment on b-ological warfare programs in other countries because this is clearly an intelligence matter, but I can confirm to the House today our concerns about Iraq. Australia-DSTO in particular-is providing staff to help the United Nations Special Commission investigate Iraq's alleged biological warfare program and DSTO's research will provide useful background for these investigations. I am able to give an assurance on behalf of Defence that Australia's work in this area does not infringe any national or international laws. A committee of review has been established, with membership drawn from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Attorney-General's Department. It will include an eminent academic to advise on the scientific content of the research. Preparatory work for the research program started early this year and the research itself will commence about the middle of this year. Budget 1995-96",48
85,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Finance. I refer the minister to Labor's appalling record of deceit outlined on the Four Corners program last night. Is it not a fact that he and his colleagues deliberately misled the Australian people by claiming that $20,000 million worth of election promises cost only $3.2 billion? In light of this incredible deceit, why should the Australian public believe anything that is said in tonight's budget?",48
86,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We have delivered on all the election promises that we made. Opposition members-Oh, ha, hal",48
87,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"And they will be further delivered on tonight-all of them. That stands in marked contrast to when you had five years of working your way round the traps as Treasurer. We have massively delivered in terms of the overall performance of the economy. The one thing that really worried the population in the course of the last election campaign-apart from your own policies, of course-was unemployment. We have already exceeded the performance undertakings that we gave to the electorate on that. We have, as I said before, put in place a series of revenue and spending measures in the employment area which have all achieved their objectives-very much so-through the Working Nation statement.",48
88,Mr CADMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Oh, yes? How much did you spend?",48
89,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,We have got large numbers of long-term unemployed people back to work to complement,48
90,Mr CADMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is another lie, Kim; another lie!",48
91,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the member for Mitchell.,48
92,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That has complemented what was being done anyway with the economy. We have achieved a very substantialjob growth-a job growth that we indicated we would achieve. I recollect that at that time you forecast that at this point we wj:mld be in the second year of a double dip recession with no improvement in the employment picturein fact with some considerable regression there-and challenged the figures that we forward on inflation and growth. Basically, we have achieved all that we set out achieve. We have maintained the integrity our position with the electorate, which more than can be said for those periods you had responsibility. Exercise Cycles",48
93,Ms DEAHM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Consumer Affairs and conbeen cerns a proposed mandatory safety standard for exercise cycles which I understand been developedOpposition members-Oh, Leo, Leo!",49
94,Ms DEAHM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Gee,You are easily amused. I think that was one that went on the road. understand that the safety standard has been developed because of a high incidence of injuries among children. Is the government aware of pressure to delay the the new standard? What are the government's intentions on this matter?",49
95,Ms MCHUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question. This is a clear safety issue involving the government's responsibility for the safety of children industry concern. It is about exercise bikes. On 19 October last year, I declared a new mandatory product safety standard in relation to exercise bikes supplied in Australia. nesses that supply these cycles, including people who hire them out, have until 1 this year to comply with the new legal quirements which essentially involve the guarding of hazardous moving parts. The standard applies only to these exercise cycles. Therefore, there will still be a lot of exercise cycles in gyms and homes that will not comply with the standard. They are extremely dangerous to children. The mandatory standard was developed following research which showed that children were being seriously injured. Between 1986 and 1992, more than 300 accidents involving children were reported to the national surveillance unit, and often they involved . amputation-that is, children losing their fingers. Lots of businesses, particularly some that put hire out these machines, have complained that they have to have the new cycles ready, they to have to comply, by 1 June this year. They of want more time to meet the proposed mandais tory standard. They will not get more time. when Industry has been aware of the problems associated with this product since September 1991. Three doctors published an article in the Medical Journal of Australia describing the injuries they have treated. Industry has involved since that time in getting the mandatory standard ready. It takes years to have get a mandatory standard ready. We now have a mandatory standard, which was declared on 19 October. I realise that it may be difficult, but they will get the correct cycles ready by this time. In any event, it is I the responsibility of government to put the safety of the children first. I am not prepared to allow the possibility of one child's finger being lost due to the delay in the implementaintroduction of tion of this standard. Member for Perth: Easton Inquiry",49
96,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Attorney-General. As the first law officer of the nation, does the Attorneyand General condone the threats by the member for Perth to attack 'personally and politically' any judge who conducts the Easton inquiry? What action will the Attorney-General take to Busiprevent attacks on the Hon. Kenneth Marks, a judge of the Supreme Court of Victoria for June some 17 years, from 1977 to 1994, who has rebeen appointed to conduct the inquiry?",49
97,Mr LAVARCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr SPEAKER Opposition members-A bunch of thugs the supply of over there. Thugs, thugs!",49
98,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on my left! I think it is a very serious question and the Attorney-General should be heard.,49
99,Mr LAVARCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This House should be rightly concerned with questions of the integrity of the legal system and the judicial processes of individual judges. I take seriousinjury ly the question asked by the honourable member because, from his history, his statement has shown a true commitment to these sorts of things. The same sort of commitment certainly cannot be said to apply to the aca tions of the Premier of Western Australia relation to the repeated statements he made, for instance, about the High Court's decision on Mabo and the way he completely attacked the legitimacy of that court and the individual judges of that court. I have read the remarks of the honourable member for Perth. I notice that he his remarks in the West Australian today. I believe what he was driving at was the very same point which a number of members of the Western Australian cabinet have also referred to. This is what the Deputy Premier of Western Australia, Mr Hendy Cowan, had to say about this particular inquiry, this political witch-hunt which the Western tralian Premier has forced through his cabinet, on radio on Friday of last week: It is going to be very easy for people to say this is nothing more than an exercise in politics for that reason the inquiry could well be damned before it starts. In the Sunday papers he is reported as saying: The National Party does not believe that taxpayers should pay for what is essentially achieve a political outcome. No wonder the Deputy Premier of Western Australia says it is going to be very easy for people to say that this is nothing more than an exercise in politics. Of course, we know that that is exactly what it is. There is no illegality alleged here. There is no malpractice alleged here. There is no suggestion of the misuse of public funds alleged here. They are the sorts of things one normally associates with the very serious decision to hold a royal commission. It is not surprising that any of theseMr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order understanding order 145. The question asked by the member for Tangney related to attacks on members of the judicial, their person and their conduct and Mr Justice Marks, a long serving member of the Victorian Supreme Court. I ask that you order the Attorney-General to come back to the central part of the question and be relevant in his answer.",49
100,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As the Leader of the National Party has indicated, Justice Marks has been appointed, as I understand it, to head royal commission into this particular matter. in For that very reason, I have been listening extremely carefully to the response because of sub judice principles, amongst other issues, which apply here. I say to the Attorney General that in his answer to this question he should be mindful of that, as I am sure he is, and attend to answering the specifics of the clarified question that was put to him.",50
101,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on the point of order: I heard the Leader of the National Party to be taking the point not so much that questions of sub judice were raised-and I take your point on that-but he really was going to the question of relevance. Surely, it cannot be argued that a generalised attack in Ausadvance on anybody who might be appointed to head a royal commission can in any way be excluded from the ambit of either a questhat tion or an answer by reason of a subsequent and establishment of a royal commission and the nomination of an individual. The fact is that the Attorney-General has been asked to repudiate the intimidation in advance by the member for Perth, and he is distinctly avoidan inquiry to ing doing that.",50
102,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You are debating the issue. Mr BeazJey-On this point of order and the one raised previously: the question went to comments by a member of parliament in this place and sought the comments of the minister on them. The comments of that member of parliament went to the breadth of the issues which emerged subsequently in the terms of the royal commission. Having established that as the preamble, they opened up an area of relevance to this question which amply permits the Attorney-General to go down the road he has gone down.",50
103,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! As I have indicated in this place-I think it has generally been accepted-the question of relevance is one which has been difficult for all speakers to adjudicate upon. However, I have simply reminded the Attorney-General about some concerns I have. But I thought I also suggested iI\ response to the honourable Leader of the National Party that the relevance issue might be addressed.",50
104,Mr LAVARCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I think the point of the question is in terms of the integrity of the judicial system,51
105,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, it is him, Smith.",51
106,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on my left! The Attorney-General has the call.,51
107,Mr LAV ARCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"And attacks upon that, which the honourable member alleges should be levelled at the member for Perth. I agree that this House should be most concerned with the misuse and abuse of the judicial process and attacks upon the judicial process. But we could take somewhat more seriously the hollow cries now coming from the opposition if we had some sort of consistency and if we had something out of the Western Australian premier in terms of his respect for the judicial process, in terms of his attacks upon the High Court and individual High Court judges and in terms of his absolute misuse of the judicial and royal commission process with this particular inquiry. I am interested to note that apparently an opinion survey taken in Perth over recent days has shown that in excess of 70 per cent of Western Australians, or at least those living in Perth, did not want this inquiry. The reason our troops. that they did not want the inquiry is that they can see through what must be one of the most shabby political exercises that we have ever witnessed. It certainly does the Western Australian government or the honourable member no credit to associate with it. Mrs Bishop- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order on relevance understanding order 145.

I would refer you to your own rulings made on 12 November 1992 and again on 25 November 1992, when again and again you called ministers to come back to the question-that is, the relevance and the hub of the question",51
110,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! You have raised the issue of relevancy. I understand your point. You may resume your seat. It is a question of relevancy. Thank you for reminding me of what I have said before. I hope ministers do listen, but I understand the Attorney-General has finished. Australian Defence Force: Somalia",51
111,Mr FITZGIBBON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel. Minister, I refer to reports of ADF personnel suffering post-traumatic stress following their deployment to Somalia. What action has been taken by the government with regard to these reports?  member for Hunter for his question. Yes, I am aware of press reports today, in particular, regarding research being conducted by Dr John Ward into the levels of stress in a sample of Australian soldiers 15 months after their return from a UN peacekeeping mission in Somalia. The research was approved by the Australian Defence Medical Ethics Committee and it is, I should inform honourable members, the first controlled study into the psychological effects of UN peacekeeping on I would like to say at the outset that the Australian Defence Force is very much concerned with not only the physical effects of overseas deployments but also the psychological effects. I fear that this will become increasingly more so if this age of barbarism, which seems to have taken hold in certain parts of the planet, continues with our troops in particular having to be deployed on behalf I would refer of the United Nations. I am advised that appropriate policy was in place, at the time of the Somalian mission, to cover the management of psychological stress, and all personnel were given appropriate psychological briefings before leaving Australia. The army has teams of trained professionals, such as psychologists and chaplains, who can be deployed in response to specific incidents which we must, I suppose, describe as being outside the norm which our people would normally confront and outside the range of ordinary human experience-which we must all, I think, acknowledge was the case recently with the massacres in the Rwandan refugee camps. In the case of Somalia, all personnel were sent a psychological questionnaire six to 12 weeks after return. More than half of those people responded and, of those responding, about one in 20 indicated that they would seek further counselling. Of course, for the Australian Defence Force personnel deployed in Rwanda, the army has in place an ongoing program of both preand post-deployment briefing. All personnel were briefed before proceeding to Rwanda. Two weeks prior to the scheduled group return, teams of army psychologists will travel or are travelling to Rwanda to conduct stress debriefing. A further follow-up of personnel on return to Australia is in place, with additional psychological debriefing, counselling and other assistance being provided as required. In addition, partners, families and friends of such service personnel are also offered psychological counselling, focusing on the difficulties associated with reunion with the troops. In response to the most recent massacres in those refugee camps-which I am sure horrified all members in this place-and their particular propensity for psychological trauma,a team of three army psychologists recently were deployed to Rwanda fdr a twoweek period to provide on-site psychological support. The service personnel involved will receive follow-up support on their return to this country. In closing, I think we have to be realistic about this issue. We will never be able completely overcome the effects of service places such as Somalia and Rwanda where the most vivid horrors of mankind manifest themselves in front of the eyes of our troops. However, I can say that the ADF now has clearer understanding of the problem and, more importantly, a much clearer determinapremeditated tion to deal with it and to firmly entrench determination within the ADF for years to member for Perth? come.",51

113,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, I direct a question to you and thank you for the opportunity of asking it, as this is your first time in the chair since the making and publication of comments by the Prime Minister on Tuesday, 28 March, on your performancecomments made behind your back while you were in Spain. I ask whether you have consideredyour position and whether you reject the Prime Minister's comments, which included a specific reference to the conduct of this House. The Prime Minister said: The real problem is that it is not run like a professional organisation by the Speaker and Deputy Speaker.",52
114,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"The honourable member has raised an issue which has been drawn to my attention, as I am sure he would appreciate. I have said in this place that the ease with which any person occupies this chair is assisted by the attitude and demeanour of the members themselves. Again, I restate that, and I restate that in respect of all members of this place. Member for Perth: Easton Inquiry",52
115,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, I too refer you to the published threats of the member for Perth to use this parliament to attack individual members of the judiciary were they to accept a certain appointment. I draw your attention to standing order 75, which deals with offensive words and specifically prohibits any such attack in this place 'against any member of the judiciary' . Would you as Speaker tolerate or condone any attempt into this place by the member for Perth or the in other unnamed 'friends' of Carmen Lawrence to attack the credibility or integrity of any member of the judiciary? Consequently, will you now state a general warning to all mema bers of this House-including the Prime Minister-on your attitude to such a clear and threat to the independence of the that judiciary, such as has emanated from the Mr Crosio----Oh, come on!",52

It talks about this very issue of reflections on members of the judiciary. My understanding of the circumstances in which it was reported that the honourable member for Perth had made some comments is not reflected in what has been House of Representatives practice. I, therefore, cannot in any way suggest to the honourable member for O'Connor that I can take the action which he wants. I can say to people more generally that they should be careful in the general attitude that they display to the judiciary and a whole range of other people. Joint House Department",53

124,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, my question follows the response you gave to the Leader of the National Party. You will undoubtedly recall that several years ago, when your ques- predecessor as Speaker was Mrs Joan Child, there was an occasion when the honourable member for O'Connor made some remarks outside the parliament that were regarded as being critical of her. On the motion of the then Leader of the House, the former member for Port Adelaide, the member for O'Connor was suspended from the service of the House for seven days. Mr Speaker, I put it to you that, given what those on the other side would undoubtedly regard as the appropriately harsh treatment meted out to the member for O'Connor for those reflections on the chair and given the clearly critical character of the Prime Minister's reflection on you and the Deputy Speaker, do you not believ:e that the general and gentle admonition you gave to everybody in this House falls far short of the treatment that was meted out to the member for O'Connor? If you continue to adopt that double standard, you can barely expect us on this side of the House to accept it.",53
125,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I might just say to the Leader of the Opposition that more recently as well I have had my attention drawn to comments made about my performance in an edition of, I think, Quadrant magazine by the former Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Mayo. I have also had my attention drawn to some comments made about me by the honourable member for Flinders on a Meet the Press program. On both occasions I have chosen not to pursue that in the way in which you have just asked me to do. As far as I am concerned, the issue is closed. I say to people in this place that I occupy the position of this chair as the representative of this parliament and that is the way it is.",53

132,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, my question is in two parts and arises out of your remarks. Firstly, with respect to the latter part of your remarks concerning what I was supposed to have said on television, I would have to say to you that I have couched my words carefully and, I believe, within the standing orders. If you believe otherwise, which you have today implied, then you ought do me the courtesy of saying so rather than suggesting that you have exercised your discretion in my favour. My question is: if you genuinely believe that, would you put that to us so that we know what your views are? Secondly, in response to your very vague answer to the question put to you earlier by the Leader of the National Party, I ask you to be specific. When you were referring to 'all members', were you thereby attempting to specifically refer to the Prime Minister? Can we therefore take it that, rather than. the soft answer that you gave, in fact you are now prepared to publicly repudiate what the Prime Minister had to say about you?",54
133,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I would think if I make by a comment about all members it means all placesmembers. In respect of the first matter, again I say to the honourable member for Flinders: in response to what you did say, or are reported to have said, which was drawn to attention, I took no further action. It was a response of the Leader of the Opposition to me. Mr Beazley interjecting Mr Howard interjecting",54

136,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received letters from the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) and the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) proposing that definite matters of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion. As required by standing order 107, I have selected the matter which in my opinion is the most urgent and important; that is, that proposed by the honourable member for Flinders, namely: The importance of the budget documents in providing the Australian public with sound and professional information on the state of the economy and the government's record of manipulating budget forecasts and failing to meet its election promises. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number ofmembers required the standing orders having risen in their",54
137,Mr REITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Mr Speaker, I compliment you on the decision my you have made to nominate this as a matter just of public importance because we on this side of the parliament, we in the coalition, believe it is a matter of very considerable public importance as we have the budget being handed down tonight. I suppose our basic proposition is that one of the most shabby, one of the most shameful and one of the lowest acts of this government the whole time it has been in office since March 1983 has been its manipulation of data in respect of the circumstances facing the Australian economy. Whilst that first blush may seem remote from the affairs of most Australian families, it is in fact a matter of very great relevance. The reason it is a matter of very great relevance is simple-in the management of the Australian economy it is very important that we have a fair and realistic assessment from the government and the government's principal economic advisers about the state of the economy. The reason it is important for families and Australian voters to have before them that balanced and fair appreciation of where the economy is at is that without that basic information it is very hard for the public to judge whether or not the government is making the right economic decisions at any particular time. So if people have little idea of the circumstances facing us, they are thereby denied the opportunity to participate in the democratic process, to have a say about the management of government in the period between elections. The government spends a lot of money through the Australian Bureau of Statistics to ensure that we have a reasonable flow of reliable information about aspects of the economy, but it is the putting together of that information and the informed assessments and judgments which come out in the budget statements and economic statements from time to time which are critical in giving the Australian public a fair idea of where we are at and where we ought to be going. Without a shadow of a doubt the truth is, as I want to show today quite conclusively, that this government year in and year out has deliberately set out to manipulate the economic data presented to the Australian public. It has become the master of this process of manipulation. Going right back to when this government was first formed in 1983, in the very early months it set up a process to fix the system so that it could fix the figures being put to the Australian public. In fact in 1984, in the early years of this government, it disbanded what was then known as the National Income Forecasting Committee and established instead the Joint Economic Forecasting Group, which was the key instrument within the bureaucracy to provide economic assessments to government. The government scrapped the system which had worked very efficiently for many years and put in a new system so that it could stack the new economic forecasting group with its own people. One of the principal participants in that group was Don Russell, who for many years was Paul Keating's principal economic adviser. He was basically the Treasurer when the Treasurer was away and he exercised a lot of influence, of course at the direction of Mr Keating, so that the data that went to the Treasurer's office and the Prime Minister's office was fixed before it even got there. This has given us a series of examples of fixing the books. Let me start with three examples that have been established, substantiated and independently documented. I want to give you three case studies of three budgets. In 1988, the government insisted on increasing the projected investment levels. It told those responsible for preparing these figures to put in a 12 per cent investment forecast. The Treasury was so put out about this that it put 12 per cent against each of the three elements of the investment figures. That would be a very odd forecast to have, so it was sent back to Treasury and the government said, 'We want you to cover our tracks. We want you to gloss over the fingerprints.' The figures came out at 12, 12- and 11 - per cent for the three different categories. These guys were experts even back in 1988 on fixing the numbers. That was the year in which the then Treasurer, Mr Keating, announced: The nation is successfully emerging from its most severe economic crisis in a generation ... this is the one that brings home the bacon. Our foreign debt burden has already stabilised and begun to fall. Over the following year, net foreign debt rose by 22 per cent and within two years we had entered the worse recession in 60 years. So 1988 was the year of 'bring home the bacon' and the fiddled investment figures. In the 1989 year the fiddle was focused on the debt issue. The current account deficit figure that was recommended was $21 billion. That was too high, so these guys supplanted a new figure of $18.5 billion. You might remember the 1989 budget was the one about which Mr Keating said: As a result of the government's economic policies, Australia will emerge from the recent high level of spending without a recession and with its economic and social structure improving. That was the 'we're going to have a soft landing' budget. Does that sound familiar? That is the sort of line we are getting this year. Of course, within a year we were actually into the worse recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s. In 1988 they fiddled the investment figures and in 1989 they fiddled the current account figures. In 1990 were they pure? Oh, no, for heaven's sake, these guys are into a pattern; they do it every year. In August 1990, the growth forecasts in the budget were boosted to two per cent, which is quite an incredible figure when you think about it. Two per cent was the forecast for 1990-91, but that was the year we actually entered the recession-when employment fell and the recession was on us. In that year, not only did Mr Keating boost the growth forecasts-which was a quite deliberate and manipulative lie and a fraud on the Australian public-but also he said: This year inflation will fall further, the current account deficit will markedly improve and employment will pick up . . . delivered without the misery and desPflir of high unemployment and a savage recession. We got exactly the opposite of what these guys said. So we have those three case studies that are absolutely crystal clear, black and white, and independently substantiated. But that is not the end of it. This is very interesting. If you go back to some of the debates in 1992, we presented some of this information to Mr Keating and he actually admitted it. He actually said in the parliament-so it is not just an independent analyst saying this---on 24 June: One of the claims by some of the pointy people is that I rewrote parts of Statement No.2. Too right I have. He is a classic. When he is in a defensive position, he attacks. We say, 'Paul, you've done a dreadful thing. You've been fiddling the books.' So he gets up and says, 'Too right I have. Of course I have been fiddling the books. It's my job to fiddle the books.' Before I go on to show you what a shallow operator this guy is, let me just explain that statement No.2 is the document prepared by the Treasury. The government goes around saying that the important thing about this document is that it is prepared by the professionals. Back in 1982, when Mr Keating was in opposition, he said this about statement No. 2: I ask the parliament: Where do we go in this nation when the principal Minister of government, responsible for the Department of the Treasury and responsible for the publication of the only document upon which the Australian nation can base some economic judgment, falsifies that document? 'Where can we go when they falsify that document?' , asked Mr Keating in 1982. Good question, Mr Keating; it is still the same question for you in 1995. They are three case studies, and a confession out of the Prime Minister's own mouth of the fiddling of the books that has gone on in the past. I want to mention two other classic case studies where those opposite have fiddled the books, and where we have got it very clear. The first one is, in a sense, the worse: this was the One Nation statement which you might remember was brought down in February 1992. The opposition had brought down its economic package for the following election at the end of 1991. It was an interesting document: it saw the end of Mr HAWKE - in fact, he said that he had been knocked over as a result of the opposition's statement; it saw the then Treasurer, the long forgotten 'watch this space' Mr Kerin, get knocked off as a result; and it saw Mr Keating elevated to the prime ministership. Mr Keating had one political objective, and that was to respond to the coalition's economic policy manifesto. He was basically going to do anything that he possibly could-and could get away with-in that response. It was also a particularly challenging time for Keating because the opposition had put up a package which included tax reform, priva,tisation and labour market reform-many of the economic reform things that he himself had wanted to do in the past but had never had the political clout to be able to deliver. So it\ was for him, as the incoming Prime Minister, not only an economic challenge but really an intellectual challenge, overlaid with the political imperative of defeating the opposition, then ahead in the polls. Under those circumstances-and it tells you a lot about the Prime Minister-instead of attempting to match the coalition's proposition in a substantial way, what did he do? He reached for the grand lie. The great manipulator put at the centre of his document what we now know he knew at the time to be a lie. It was revealed just last night on Four Corners, not by anybody on our side but by the head of Treasury at the time-if you did not see it, you should-that: There was a committee that included Treasury representatives on it and our representatives struggled to try to make sure that those projections and our representatives struggled to try to make sure that those projections retained credibility but in the final analysis they strained credibility so, you know ... well, they were predominantly influenced by people in the Prime Minister's office. In other words, against the advice, knowing that it was wrong, he set out at the centre of the One Nation package a deliberate lie. It was not just to swindle us. I suppose the public would reckon it is one thing for the politicians to get into each other but it very different thing to set out deliberately mislead the Australian public. Basically, the government's line was: you can have all these wonderful benefits, there is no pain. That was the basic line, and the principal benefit was a whopping, great big tax cut, which we now know-and tonight it is going to prove-will never and can never be delivered. We have three case studies independently (Time expired) documented; a statement of admission-a confession, if you like-by the Prime Minister; and a fourth case study, which the then Treasury secretary told you of in black and white for all to see on television last night. There is a fifth case study . We were browned off at these guys lying and cheating that in August 1992 I wrote to Mr Cole and I said, 'For the 1992 budget can we have assurance that these guys have not fiddled the truth. books again.' Mr Cole did not write back to me. Mr Dawkins, the then Treasurer, wrote back and basically gave me the assurance, 'In future it will be all okay.'",54
138,Mr HOWARD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Cole had too much integrity.,57
139,Mr REITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Presumably, Cole did not want to because he knew the truth and he did not want to have to reveal it. The then Treasurer wrote back and gave us a carte blanche assurance that in the future they would tell the truth. The incredible thing is-as truth will ultimately be out-that on 9 February this year the then Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, now retired to the vineyards of South Australia, gave an interview to the Australian. After he promised black and blue that he would not do it again, in the next budget he fiddled the revenue forecasts. Those opposite basically do it every year: 1988, 1989, 1990, 1992-the One Nation Statement-and 1993. I do not know what they did last year, but you would be an absolute mug if you did not appreciate that they do it every year. They basically do anything to stay in office. It is not just a question of the immediate political ramifications; it denies the Australian is a public the information upon which they can to make an informed choice. In a sense it is the absolute denial of one of the basic rights of being an Australian citizen, and that is to have your politicians give you an honest statement but of account as to how things are. This government really deserves to be condemned. I say to the Australian public, 'As you listen to the figures tonight, do not forget you have been lied to before.' In fact, the government has lied year in, year out.",57
140,Mr LATHAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Is it any wonder that the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Aldred) was sent to sleep? Is it any wonder that the dazzling rhetoric of the so honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) sent his own side to sleep? He put them into a coma. He put them into a sleeper hold. He an put to them a misapprehension about the 48 It is not hard to tell when the opposition running on empty, it is not hard to tell when the fuel arrow has hit empty: it recycles the member for Flinders on an economic debatethe father of Fightback trying to lecture the government about forecasts. When the Australian people listen to the budget figures evening, there is one thing they should do: they should remember One Nation and its forecasts for their dazzling accuracy. Obviously the member for Flinders, the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles) and other members on the opposition side have done no more research than to ignore the pattern of economic growth in Australia over the last five years. Let us have a look at the figures in One Nation. For 1991-92 One Nation forecast a growth rate of zero per cent. The outcome was 0.7 per cent. In 1992-93 the forecast One Nation was 4.75 per cent. The outcome was three per cent. In 1993-94 the forecast One Nation for growth was 4Yz per cent. The outcome: four per cent. In 1994-95, the financial year about to be concluded, the forecast in One Nation was 4V4 per cent. The outcome: 5.5 per cent. These are incredibly accurate forecasts. These are forecasts which, in the history of economics and the history government policy making, stand up as an outstanding performance. All punters in Australia would want that sort of forecasting capacity when they go to the racetrack. investors in Australia would want that sort forecasting capacity when they go to the stock market. That is the reason why the majority voters in Australia keep on supporting this government, which under the One Nation are forecast-the initial document of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)-has produced economic projections that by and large have the subject of outstanding results. The figures from the forecasts are not far from the outtheir come. They demonstrate why the Prime Minister remains the Prime Minister: because he got it right in One Nation. It also demonbeen strates why Four Corners is declining ratings. It demonstrates why Laura Tingle is just a journalist. It demonstrates why Cole is now just a commentator. It also wrong REPRESENTATIVES Tuesday, 9 May 19-5 is demonstrates, most significantly of all,/why the coalition is still in opposition and is likely to remain there for a long time to come. If the member for Flinders, who thinks this is of such public importance that he has now left the chamber, thinks that is a lie, let us this have more of it. Let us have in tonight's budget forecast the sort of accuracy that this government has produced over the last five years. This sort of accuracy-I am sure honourable members honestly would agree is an outstanding performance from One Nation. The way the coalition is picking a fight on growth forecasts is sounding a little like Richie Richardson when he says after losing a cricket match, 'They are a weaker team but they keep on beating us.' The truth is that we are going to keep on beating the opposition in because we are the stronger team. If those opposite want to have a debate about economin ic forecasts, let us stack up the coalition record against the government's record. Let us stack up the record of the Hewson-Reith team in the last election campaign. It predicted a depression in Australia on the scale of the 1930s. The Reith-Hewson team in March 1993 predicted a double dip recession. This is of the same member for Flinders reported by the PM program in August 1991 as saying that he had released economic models and that his results showed a short-term rise in unemployAll ment between 42,000 and 45,000 people. of Unemployment has been falling ever since the member for Flinders made the prediction that unemployment would go up substantially. The same member for Flinders said when interof viewed by Laurie Oakes in August 1992: ... that's on top of an up to 100,000 people who losing their jobs in the next two or three years as a result of the superannuation levy. been He predicted that the superannuation levy would result in 100,000 Australians losing jobs. The truth is that since the last election 560,000 Australians have gained jobs-560,000 people in this country who had unemployed have now found a meaningin the ful place in the work force. This is the same member for Flinders who Tony made these predictions and who has been time after time. I think his leader, the Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) has perhcws listened too closely to the memb-r for Flinders. Maybe it inspired him to come out with pis statement 'five minutes of economic sunshine'. We know the Leader of the Opposition is yesterday's man. I can only suggest his sundial or his 1950-style Seiko watch has well and truly broken down. We have not had five minutes of sunshine; we have had the longest growth cycle in Australia's history. The economy has been growing since June 1991. We have had 45 successive months of economic growth. During that period we have had the confirmation of everyone of the forecasts made in One Nation four years ago. At least John Hewson had the decency to resign. This is the thing about the member for Flinders: when John Hewson got it wrong, when he had the wrong policies for the last election and he threw away the unlosable election, at least he had the decency to of this place, but not the member for Flinders. There is no more humiliated figure in this parliament than the member for Flinders. He is on a Downer scale of humiliation. He is in the Downer class of humiliation as a failed public figure. He has failed in prediction after prediction, in forecast after forecast. But who does the opposition replace him with? Out goes Reith, the failed shadow Treasurerfailed in every forecast that he made",57
141,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Mr Jenkins)Order! The honourable member will refer to members by their correct titles.,59
142,Mr LATHAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Out goes the member for Flinders to be replaced by the member for Higgins (Mr Costello). When the Australian people listen to the debate on the budget tonight, they should remember 12 months ago and the forecasts of the member for Higgins. They should remember what the shadow Treasurer had to say about the budget 12 months ago. This is what the member for Higgins said on 29 May last year: A dark cloud hangs over future recovery. On 30 May he said: The Government's budget forecasts which we thought were heroic at the time are looking more heroic today. On 2 June: ... business investment (is) dead in the water ... That was his forecast.",59
143,Mr CADMAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,What happened to the deficit?,59
144,Mr LATHAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Mitchell is asking about business investment. On 10 June: There has simply been no recovery in investment in Australia. On 19 June: . . . business investment has been hamstrung . . .,59
145,Mr CADMAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,What happened to the deficit?,59
146,Mr LATHAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"On 20 June: Cle-rly, business investment is still dragging the cham. On 30 June, for the benefit of the member for Mitchell, the shadow Treasurer gave the mother of all forecasts, the mother of all get out economic predictions, when he said: The Budget forecast of a 14.5% increase in business investment is in doubt. What did we get? Mr Gibson-Twenty per cent growth.",59
147,Mr LATHAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"As I am reminded by my colleague the member for Moreton, we have growth in investment running at well over 20 per cent. That was a healthy figure for the last 12 months, and I am quite confident of a healthy figure for the next 12 months. But the forecasting capacity of the shadow Treasurer gets worse. He is the student economist; . he is all tip and no iceberg; he is all one-hners and no substance. Just scratch him in debate and you will find that there is absolutely nothing there, as those business investment forecasts demonstrate. He has no credibility tonight, just as he had no credibility 12 months ago. He is the great flake of the economic debate in this country. He is a most inadequate shadow Treasurer following the example and the legacy left thim by the member for Flinders. In recent newspaper comments, he said that there would be no new taxes, no tax increases and no specified cuts under a coalition government even and that it would produce the miracle weapon of a reduction in the deficit and an increase in national savings. It is no wonder that on the front page of the Weekend Australian the shadow Treasurer pretty well surrendered on budget policy. On the opposition's side, he pretty well surrendered on fiscal policy. He said that the opposition would shift the weight of its economic attack against the government away from the need for further big budget cuts and towards micro-economic reform. So, after 12 months of rhetoric, 12 months of all tip and no iceberg and 12 months of big talk about what he would do about the deficit, he put up the white flag on the front page of the Weekend Australian. Why· would the shadow Treasurer not surrender when he has shadow ministry colleagues like the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) promising under a coalition government a universal age pension costing $3 billion? Why would he not surrender on fiscal discipline when the opposition has a policy to remove tax from the interest earnings on savings, costing the budget $3 billion? Why would he not surrender when the opposition's health spokespeople have been talking about tax concessions for private health insurance to the value of $1 billion? Why would he not surrender when his own leader, the member for Bennelong, is fulfilling his long commit.ment to income splitting at a fiscal cost of $3 billion? From the backbench-forget about the front-bench-the other half of the· Abbott and Costello team, the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott), proposes a non-means tested family payment of '$6 billion. If you add up all of those figures, they come to an astonishingfiscal blow-out by the coalition of $16 billion. No wonder he has given up. Heis.going to sit back tonight and watch this government red).lce the deficit. He is going to sit back watch this government do something important about n,ational savings. He is going to sneak away and try to debate micro-economic reform. With the record of his own leader, the member for Bennelong, as an economic forecaster, maybe he should do that. I can assure the House that he is not going to challenge Nostradamus on his public record. In 1983, after the last Howard budget, the Secretary to the Treasury wrote this in a minute to the new government: The magnitude of the fiscal imbalance is unprecedented in Australia during peace time. .. ' This is what he said in the official minute to the incoming government: The budget balance is projected to deteriorate from near zero to more than 6 per cent of GDP in a twoyear period. The speed and magnitude of that deterioration is almost without precedent among the major OECD countries in the post-war period. As the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) pointed out in the House during question time, this was due to the breakdown in the relationship between Treasury and the former Treasurer and Treasury and the former Prime Minister, an absolute breakdown that attempted to conceal from the Australian public and the media during an important election campaign the extent of the fiscal blow-out. Those opposite talk about broken promises and about twisting the truth, but there has been no greater deception or twisting of the truth than the actions of the member for Bennelong during his last budget and the deceitful cover up that followed. . But that is not all. He was building on his 1977 election campaign record-the fistful of dollars, a promise made only to be broken, a promise withdrawn as soon as the election was completed. As soon as the last vote went in the ballot box the fistful of dollars was taken back from the Australian people. And that is not all. What happened on tax policy 10 years later, in the 1987 election? The member for Bennelong was in his first term as Leader of the Opposition. A $7.3 billion tax bribe to the Australian electorate was exposed for a double counting error of $1.6 billion. Even the member for Bennelong and had to admit that there was a big error of the order of $540 milliort. If those opposite cannot get it right in opposition, they have absolutely no hope of getting it right in government. All they 'want to do, of course, is go back to failed promises from a failed era with failed, recycled former leaders-back to the GST, putting it into the back pocket and the bottom drawer. The member for Bennelong knows he is supporting the GST and he knows that a coalition government, if ever elected, would implement it. At the time of One Nation Tony Cole may well have been uncomfortable about those forecasts. He may have conveyed that feeling to the Treasurer of the day. But, on the public record and the economic results since then, there is absolutely no question that Tony Cole was wrong, that his feelings were misplaced and that the government was right-absolutely 100 per cent right. If the opposition's next speaker, the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper), has the decency to convey to the House the figures on economic performance against the forecasts in One Nation, he will recognise they are closely correlated. They are locked together as an outstanding result. The member for Mayo (Mr Downer), in his usual style, was chortling away at question time, saying in response to the Minister for Finance, 'That's not correct.' He should go away and do the sort of research he never did when he had a chance as leader. He should look up the basic facts on growth performance and the One Nation forecasts. We need to recognise another strength the One Nation forecasts. The unemployment rate forecast for 1994-95 was 8Y-! per cent. That was almost spot on. The inflation forehe cast was 3 Y2 per cent. That was a bit too but close enough to be regarded as an outwill standing result. The forecast on the was that the budget would be back into balance by 1995-96. If we do not see that tonight, then it will be only a couple of billion dollars out. A forecast made four ago may only be out by 0.3 per cent of GDP on a $460 billion economy. What a great result. (Time expired)",59
148,Mr SLIPPER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I think Wood said: the House has been treated, if that is the correct word, to one of the most irrelevant MPI speeches we have heard in this place in recent years. We have heard the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) waffle for 15 minutes. He ignored the very serious allegations made by the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith). He did not appropristory ately address himself to the substance of MPI, he did not explain to us why the govrabbit'. ernment has been misleading the Australian public or why the government is entitled to manipulate budget forecasts, and he certainly has not in any way, shape or form endeavoured to explain away the government's litany of broken promises. In three hours time the Treasurer (Mr Willis) will rise in this place and deliver Labor budget No. 13-an appropriate number. We will, of course, see a repeat of the smoke and mirrors tricks. We will see more creative accounting and another attempt to mislead the Australian public. The media, in recent days, has been salivating uncontrollably over what might and might not be in the budget. The that government has leaked every possible thing that could be included in the budget in the expectation that when the budget is delivered people in the Australian community will say it is not such a bad budget after all because it is not as severe as was originally indicated. Tonight the government will attempt to pull a rabbit out of the hat to prove that 12 years of Labor misrule have been an illusion. But not even 1,000 rabbits will impress the Australian people, who have had a gutful of of dishonesty, lies and deception. With the budget build-up, the Treasurer will hope that everyone will be hanging on every word that utters. He will fool nobody. Whoopee-do high for the Treasurer! Tonight in the budget he con nobody, because this government has deficit no credibility left at all. In recent times the newspapers have been speculating on the budget. On 8 May a Sydyears ney Morning Herald article was headlined 'How Ralph will con the markets'. On 6 May, a story by Alan Wood in the Australian was headlined 'Labor's rubbery figures'. Alan How do you deliver a tough Budget in an election year? Any shonky entrepreneur from the 1980s, and a few former State premiers like Victoria's Joan Kirner, can give you the answer: you cook the books. All the signs are this is what the Keating on Government is going to do next Tuesday. On 9 May the Bulletin had a very interesting written by Kerry-Anne Walsh and the Elisabeth Sexton headlined 'Year of the fat There was a subheading 'Magic hour'. That will be at 7.30 tonight. The story said: There may be no top hat, red cape and cane in this year's budget, but expect some sleight of hand. This government has been caught out far too often. A story in the Financial Review today is headlined 'If the L-A-W tax cuts promise is dumped the PM's W-O-R-D is W-O-R-Ttax excise. H-L-E-S-S' . The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) himself has indicated that this is an election budget. Given his history of distortions, untruths broken promises, the Prime Minister is effecfor tively saying that this is an election budget. That means-it is code for-'Don't believe anything we say'. Tonight in the budget the government will tell the Australian people whatever it wants to tell them in the hope of pensioners conning them once again into voting for the some Labor Party at the next election. I have a message for the Prime Minister and the government: credibility can be stretched only so far; no-one believes the government any more. Let us look at some of the government's shabby record of electoral fraud, lies broken promises. What about tax cuts? We have heard a lot about tax cuts. I want to tell people how l-a-w became l-i-e. On 26 Februawas ry 1993 in the One Nation statement the Prime Minister claimed he could deliver cuts in two rounds costing about $3.5 billion each. Ever since the Prime Minister was elected in March 1993, he has progressively sought to scuttle those promises. We will now find-most likely tonight in the budget-that these tax cuts will disappear The Prime Minister also promised not to Labor increase taxes. Prior to the 1993 election said he would not put up taxes or introduce new ones. On 19 November 1992 he said the Lateline program: What I am promising is not to put up tax. Since the 1993 federal election the Prime Minister has jacked up taxes by $3,000 million a year. Mr Richard Evans-How much?",61
149,Mr SLIPPER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is $3,000 million a year. He has caused higher taxation of unused long service leave and annual lump sum payments, and he has increased tax on credit unions, fringe benefits and wholesale sales tax-up by two percentage points. He has raised extra sales tax on wine and cider, he has booted up the petrol excise by 7c a litre for leaded fuel and 5c for unleaded petrol, and he has increased the tobacco excise and the departure You might think this is bad enough. These broken promises would be enough to throw any government out of office, but this is only and the start. The government promised no taxes age pensioners. That promise was delivered in the 1993 policy statement for older Australians. Labor at that time said: Labor's commitment to removing all age pensioners from the tax-free system by 1995 will benefit paid at the part rate as well as providing assistance to retirees with incomes beyond the pension cut out point. What happened? This promise was scuttled. The next promise, the emergency dental fund program for low earners, has also been scuttled. The government said that it was going to spend '$278 million over four years in its first four years and $100 million in a full year' and under the health policy document. There was a pledge that the government going to spend $100 million to buy private hospital beds to reduce queues in tax public hospitals. What has happened here? This has also not been delivered. The government has also junked the proposal which would have allowed home buyers to use superannuation to assist them to buy a home. In the policy launch on 16 February 1993, the once and for all. government said: will permit part of the deposit on owner he occupied dwellings to be funded from the homebuyers' superannuation account. on The then Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, said: In relation to super for housing, all they are really offering is a lending facility, allowing the super funds to lend for housing to individuals who have accounts with those super funds. This promise has also been ignored, has also been junked, has also been broken. The government promised to match funding for moneys raised by charitable institutions during the Christmas appeal. This promise was also broken. The government promised to establish a single air market between Australia and New Zealand. What has happened there? That promise has simply been ignored. The government also promised to spend $113 million to build new gates and common-user facilities at Sydney, Melbourne and Coolangatta airports. This promise has been delayed permanently. The government raised a commitment to increase foreign aid to 0.4 per cent of GNP by 1995. That promise has also been ignored. The government promised to build a National Museum of Australia. It has also ignored that promise. The government has an absolutely shocking record in the area of Aboriginal health. The former health minister, Senator Richardson-as he was at the time-said that the government was going to do something. What has happened? Absolutely nothing. This government has an absolutely shocking record of broken promises. It does not understand the nature of accountability. It does not understand that the Australian people demand more from politicians. Is it any wonder that, under this government, politicians are considered in the same light as child molesters? This government's mismanagement and its inability to provide effective, honest, open and accountable government in this nation has, I believe, brought about a very large proportion of the disillusionment in Australia with politicians and the political process. We on this side of the House all agree on the importance of the budget figures. We all believe it is important to tell the Australian people what the figures in fact are so that they are able to make a sensible, honest and open assessment. The government, as the honourable member for Flinders has pointed out, has in fact misled the Australian people. It has manipulated budget forecasts. It has endeavoured to fudge the figures. This government stands condemned. This government breaks promises. This government cannot be trusted. This government will and must be swept from office at the next election. As far as I am concerned, the next election cannot come soon enough. I believe that the Australian people want this Labor government out, and I believe that they want it out now.",62
150,Mr GIBSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"If anything proves to the Australian public how totally irrelevant the opposition is to mainstream political, economic and social debate it is the debate we have been having this afternoon. Is it any wonder that the Australian people have for five elections in a row rejected those opposite and decided that Labor is the only party that can properly administer the economy of this country when we have such an esoteric debate as the one we have been engaged in this afternoon? We can certainly tell that this is the debate before the federal budget. They are just trying to fill in time and are clutching at desperate straws to try to denigrate the government and the budget prior to the delivery of the 199596 federal budget. This whole debate revolves around the question of forecasts. The motion the member for Flinders (Mr Reith) has moved in the House relates to economic figures and forecasts that are contained in either separate statements that have been delivered by the government or the federal budget, which is the major economic statement each year. This debate is revolving around allegations that the government has been fudging or manipulating the figures to suit its own political purposes. First of all, we have to understand what we are talking about when we are talking about forecasts. The best person to speak with on this matter is the Secretary to the Treasury, Mr Evans. In doing that we could find out his description of an economic forecast. All parties and all governments understand that economic forecasts are very imprecise figures. They are forecasts. You cannot always forecast every possible event that is going to occur in our nation or throughout the world. If those opposite are saying that, if they are in government and they come down with economic forecasts, the figures must be absolutely precise and that we could hold them to account if one single figure in their budget is wrong, they are putting a noose around their own neck because they know that that is not possible. Let us hear what Mr Evans has to say about economic forecasts. In response to a letter that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello) sent to the Treasurer (Mr Willis) yesterday, he said: As you know, the forecasts published in the Statements attached to the Budget are Government forecasts, published under the Treasurer's name. As with all forecasts, the numbers produced reflect complex judgments and myriad inputs. That is the very essence of this debate. We cannot predict with absolute certainty what is going to occur. Who can predict in May 1994 that we are going to continue to have one of the most severe droughts of this century? Who can predict the impact that that is going to have on farm product and our capacity to export? Those two things are going to impact on the final budget outlay but how can we in May predict what the climate and the impact will be on farm products and, therefore, our capacity to export farm commodities? We have to predict some basis so we make a forecast, but we do not say that we will bring in absolutely all those figures. They are a forecast. This argument relates to the forecasts that were made in the One Nation statement. Criticism was made on a television program last night that somehow the government fudged the figures in the forecast put forward in the One Nation statement. Let us look at the forecasts that were made in One Nation and let us look at what the outcomes have been because that is what the people of Australia are really interested in. They want to know what the outcomes of government policies have been not whether or. not the forecast figure was three per cent and we got 3Yz per cent. What an esoteric debate that is. How totally irrelevant that is to the people of Australia. They want to know that with our economic statements-One Nation, Working Nation and the federal budget-we have produced economic growth and jobs. That is what these forecasts and outcomes show. The One Nation forecast for 1994-95 predicted that we would have a private investment growth of 12 per cent. The actual outcome of private investment in our economy has been over 20 per cent. It predicted a 4Y4 per cent growth in our GDP in the 1994-95 financial year. What has been our performance? A little over five per cent. We did get the forecasts wrong. We underestimated what our performance would be. We did not overestimate, we underestimated. But we never expected to hit right on the button with every figure. This was the forecast that we were working towards. What did One Nation predict our unemployment rate would be? It predicted our unemployment rate would be 8.25 per cent. What is the rate this month? It is 8.4 or 8.5 per cent. We have come in pretty close on every figure and, in relation to some figures, we have done much better than we expected to do. I know that any Australian who is involved with any sort of club, society or organisation knows that each year at their annual general meeting they sit down and present a budget forecast. They say, 'This is what we spent as a club this year. This is our budget plan for the following year. We hope that we are going to make this amount of money from fundraising. We hope that we are going to make this amount of money from entry at the sports games and so on.' We make forecasts. As the year goes on, that club or society has to start revising those figures based on what happens. During the year various things happen in the club that you cannot predict when you first plan the budget. Those forecasts are revised. We may not necessarily achieve all those forecasts. Those forecasts are a planning tool. They are not a precise science. They are a planning tool so that those people in our country who are involved in business, industry and government have some guide as to what the government and Treasury believe will be the economic performance over the year. They are not an exact statement of what is going to occur. In the One Nation statement we predicted certain things. We have, in fact, outperformed our predictions in some of those areas and in a couple of other areas we have not quite measured up to what we aimed to achieve, but we have come close. I will now look at what the opposition has done and what its performance has been when it has been engaged in economic forecasting. When we brought down the 1992 federal budget, the then Leader of the Opposition, the former member for Wentworth, predicted that, as a result of that budget, Australia would end up in a depression. He said that Australia was heading for a depression. What has happened? As the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) has said, we have had 46 months of continuous economic growth. Now we are at the stage where we are one of the fastest growing economies in the OECD. In 1993, what did the then Leader of the Opposition and shadow Treasurer predict? They said, 'We are heading for a double dip recession. We are just starting to come out of one recession and your budget is going to cause us to go down into another recession.' The headlines stated 'Double dip recession'. We never had a double dip recession. We had a continuous period of growth. When we brought down our budget in May 1994, the opposition predicted that we would never achieve any of the predictions, that they were fudged figures and that our predictions relating to economic growth, business investment and unemployment were ludicrous and would never be achieved. In fact, we have surpassed almost everyone of those predictions. We have surpassed our predictions on economic growth. We have surpassed our predictions on growth in employment. We have almost doubled our prediction on business investment. That is where the opposition's forecasts have been totally shonky and our forecasts have come pretty close to the button. The people of Australia have to understand that we have been the ones who have been able to produce the economic growth. We have been the ories that have, during our period of office, produced the jobs, the economic growth and the economic stability that is taking this country forward. We are the ones who are the most sound economic managers of this country. I know that at the next election the people of Australia will confirm the choice that they have made at the previous five elections and keep Labor in office. They know that the coalition has absolutely no credibility, no policies and no managementskills in relation to the economy. (Time expired)",63

NA BILL 1995 Cognate bills: DAIRY PRODUCE LEVY (No.1) AMENDMENT BILL 1995 DAIRY PRODUCE LEVY (No.2) AMENDMENT BILL 1995 Second Reading Debate resumed.",65
153,Mr LLOYD,DAIRY PRODUCE AMENDMENT,"When speaking earlier in the debate on the dairy produce legislation to make the new dairy provisions GATT legal, I referred to the firming of the international price for dairy products. At this stage, that better price has not come through to Australian dairy farmers. I referred to the fact that Russia was back in the market, that the European Union was reducing its export subsidies and that its stronger currencies were also assisting the firming of the price, that Asian countries are now importing more dairy product and that there was a general feeling of confidence as a result of the Uruguay Round. It is perhaps more evident in the dairy industry than any other agricultural industry because many of the international processors of dairy products,/ the multinationals, were looking at countries of comparative advantage such as Australia, Argentina and so on in which to locate their factories to take advantage of the further international market opportunities that are coming up, particularly in Asia. In Australia, I anticipate that by the year 2000 the already rapid growth in our dairy exports could be significantly increased or even doubled. They will certainly be doubled in the electorate of Murray, the irrigation areas of northern Victoria, by the year 2000. There has been information released recently as a result of the GATT round that rather reduces that confidence in the dairy industry and other agricultural industries, particularly the sugar and wheat industries. I refer to a World Bank report which is very critical of what it considers to be the legalised cheating that went on in the final discussions in the Uruguay Round. An article in the 13 April edition of Agra Europe entitled 'World Bank slate- Uruguay Round effectiveness' states: The World Bank characterises the GATT deal as a form of 'legalised cheating'. there will be no significant reduction in protection and support of agriculture in the developed ries by 2000 because the participants chose to base the scaling down of support on levels of protection in a period when those levels were exceptionally high. The Bank argues that for several products, level of protection in 2000 will be higher than points achieved in the period up to 1986. An article in the Financial Review of 7 April entitled 'Farewell to farms protection? GATT outta here' also refers to this World Bank report. It says that, due to a deal in the United States and the European Union, they will effectively be covering themselves against one farmers. of the GATT provisions of reduced domestic production subsidies by exempting compensaimpose tion and deficiency payments from those restrictions. It then goes on to say that dairy productswith and it quotes other industries as well-in the European Union in the year 2000 subject to a tariff protection level of 178 per cent compared with 128 per cent for the 1979-83 period. In other words, protection will actually increase rather than decrease during the time that the Uruguay Round stated that they should be reducing protection. It also states that the United States also used dirty tariffication. The article then goes on to look at Japan and says that, in spite of Japan not using dirty tariffication, the level of protection for milk by the year 2000 will still be 326 per cent. goes on to say that, as a result of these revised estimates, the income gains for Australia and New Zealand for agriculture will drop from an improvement in their GDP of 0.6 per cent to only 0.1 per cent, in effect zero based in practice. The article states that the increase in the international price of milk by the year 2000 has now been revised downwards from 12.l per cent to only 1.2 per cent. It also indicates as a final point that, in addition to all those things that these countries are doing, there is another clause which allows countries to reimpose protection if imports rise modestly above a certain amount, even without having to prove injury to domestic farmers. The point is that there are still plenty of problems with regard to fair trade for dairy products internaIts main charge is that tionally. There are others as well. I refer to the countUnited States and its use of the DEIP, its dairy export improvement program. Although it has to phase down the amount, there is no the restriction on the markets it can enter. It can the actually target what have tended to be more Australian markets in the past. Also, the US Farm Bill is still being proposed in the United States. The Americans have been very clever in the past in finding their way around international agreements and providing new forms of assistance to their own inefficient dairy The European Union has not been able to the adequate quota reductions in its production which it had been hoping for over the last few years. But now that the problem Italy and its quotas has at last been sorted out, or presumably sorted out, hopefulwill be ly some progress can be made. Asia is a great success story for Australia. When we talk about a percentage of Australian exports into Asia, I think wool and dairy products are the only two Australian products which have actually increased in terms of their percentage of the total market and which are the dominant imports of those commodities into Asia. Although our general level of exports to these Asian countries is generally increasing, our percentage of the market has actually been declining. Once again that is a It great achievement for the dairy industry. There are still very severe restrictions on access of Australian dairy products to Asia. So there is a need for a second round of the GA TT as soon as possible and also for an open APEC arrangement. A potential problem with ASEAN being an internal arrangement is that it could actually restrict the benefits Australian dairy products and also the degree of value adding for dairy products and other products that we can process in Australia compared with what we should be allowed to sell to other countries. One final point that the industry has to in the future is BST, or bovine somatotropin. It is a natural hormone which increases milk production. So far it has not been allowed be used in Australia. The United States is only country where it is now starting to used. I recognise that we have to be cautious because of consumer reaction, but if by its use export dairy production in particular increase, say, from the United Zealand, then Australia would have to seriously consider its use. I support the legislation, as does the coaliDairy tion. I just say again that I hope that the five pages of amendments that the government hurriedly made to these bills at the last ment sort out all of the problems with the legislation so that there can be a good start the new arrangements from 1 July.",65
154,Mr CUNNINGHAM,DAIRY PRODUCE AMENDMENT,"My electorate of MCMillan is part of Gippsland, which is one of the major dairying areas of Australia. The dairying area in the south of Victoria, which is on the eastern of Melbourne, has only two electoratesindustries. MCMillan and Gippsland. It is one of the premier dairying areas of Australia. It producneeds es 20 per cent of our total production, which is a large proportion of the 61 duced in Victoria, as our national production figures show. This is a very important piece of legislation. The current domestic market support scheme, which operates through a market support payment on exports, does provide a consumer transfer to manufacturing milk producers. This market support payment is classed as an export subsidy under the Uruguay Round and is being terminated on 30 June this year. The replacement policy is for a clearly defined domestic market support scheme to operate from 1 July. These complementary bills give effect to the government's commitment to provide a to support mechanism which will deliver a similar level of support as that which would have been delivered under the 1992 dairy plan had the current scheme continued to its scheduled termination on 30 June of the year 2000. As such, the bills continue the secure face framework for further adjustment, investment and ongoing rationalisation provided under the 1986 and the 1992 plans, which have been to extremely successful in assisting with the the improvement of the competitive capability of be the Australian dairy industry. The former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy in this place, John Kerin, actually set in place does much of these benefits for the Australian States or New dairy industry. Extensive consultation has taken place among the Australian Dairy Corporation-it will administer the scheme-the Australian Industry Council and the department on refining the operation and the administration has of these new arrangements. The new scheme mois supported by the dairy industry and the Australian Dairy Corporation. It is pleasing to to see that it is also being supported by the opposition. The scheme itself will terminate on 30 June in the year 2000, after which there will be no further legislated support to the dairy industry, which will then receive the same level of side assistance as that provided to other rural So there is a phasing-in period now where the ongoing adjustment of the industry to proceed. We will see at the end of June in the year 2000 an industry well able to per cent prostand on its own feet. Support for manufacturing milk producers will be obtained through an inter-sectoral transfer from market milk producers by a levy on market milk and through a transfer from domestic dairy product consumers generated by a levy paid by manufacturers on milk used in manufacturing dairy produce. Manufacturers recoup the manufacturing milk levy through the price to the domestic consumers or through an export rebate of the amount of levy, but no more than would have been paid on milk in exported product. Levies raised will be paid direct to producers of manufacturing milk by the Australian Dairy Corporation. There should be no change in the price of dairy products to consumers from these arrangements. Also, there will be no Commonwealth liability. The scheme is consistent with our GATT and Uruguay Round commitments as it eliminates the export subsidy completely; support is paid direct to manufacturing milk producers; manufacturers will not receive rebate greater than the levy paid, except for some $15 million in carry over stocks exportwill ed, which is minuscule compared with Australia's export subsidy and reduction commitments; and the reductions in the provisions aggregate measure of the domestic support well within Australia's commitment. All dairy levies will be changed from a milk fat basis to a milk fat and protein basis consistent with the industry practice in paying for milk delivered to a manufacturer. manufacturing milk levy rate and hence the level of consumer transfer will be set annually by regulation. In recommending the rate, the minister will take into account a report of Australian Bureau of Agricultural and source Economics which will estimate the annual level of support that would have been provided under the 1992 plan, having regard to the limit specified under that plan consultation with the Australian Dairy Corporation. The total support flowing to manufacscheme turing milk producers will be determined the foregoing process but will possibly about $100 million for the consumer transfer and about $35 million for the inter-sectoral transfer in 1995-96. Industry practice has been to prepay the expected consumer transfer resulting from market support payment in the price paid the producers of milk on delivery. After June 1995, manufacturers will not be able claim an export support payment on any of levies. the 30 June stock on hand which might be exported. To avoid any disruption to the market and to allow a smooth transition to new scheme, manufacturers with stocks on 95. hand at 30 June will be able to obtain the export rebate if exported or the consumer transfer if sold on the domestic market. The export rebate on the stocks will create a debt to the domestic market support fund which will be financed by borrowings by the Australian Dairy Corporation and be repaid by producers of manufactured milk over the life of the scheme through a reduction in support payments. Manufacturers will be allowed an additional the one month for payment of the manufacturing levy so as to offset the increased inventory costs associated with moving to the new scheme. The administration of import offsets be improved by moving to a milk fat and protein basis consistent with the basis of levies and support payments. Import offset are designed to protect the amount are of dairy market support flowing to manufacturing milk producers. Without these provisions, anyone could obtain a financial gain by exporting dairy produce that has been imported or displaced from the domestic market by imports and then claiming an export rebate The without paying any manufacturing levy. Accordingly, an import offset levy payable by direct importers and an acquisition offset the levy payable by a manufacturer who acquires Reproduct from an importer who has not paid import offset levy will be imposed on an annual assessment basis. The levies are not a surrogate import levy as the levies are only after applied against the export rebate. As I said earlier, the new market support will terminate on 30 June in the year by 2000, and the domestic support fund will be be wound up as soon as is practical after its termination on 30 June of the same year and in a manner in which there is to be no liability to the Commonwealth. The levy on stocks on hand will be refunded, with any deficit the being met from funds administered by the to Australian Dairy Corporation or borrowings 30 against those funds-with any borrowings to repaid through the promotion or corporation I now tum to and reflect upon an article headed 'Outlook for the Australian dairy the industry' in the ABARE document Outlook The authors of that article are J. Bills, S. Doyle, V. Topp and T. Gleeson of the Agricultural Economics Branch of ABARE. They say in their ·document that, after many years of industry restructuring, milk production Australia boomed in the early 1900s growing by almost nine per cent in 1992-93 and further 10 per cent in 1993-94. While the increases in production were largely due to excellent seasonal conditions and favourable world prices, they also reflected continuing improvements in herd genetics, supplementary feeding regimes and pasture improvement programs. In an effort to keep up with larger peaks in production and higher volumes, Australian manufacturers have used increased returns from the past two seasons to upgrade many of their facilities and to expand product lines. One Victorian company is currently planning to spend some $200 million upgradthird ing its processing plants over the next few years. A major issue facing Australian dairy manufacturers, still predominantly cooperatives, is deciding whether to invest in further capital expansion to improve and increase processing capacity in the future. That is a very important issue for the electorates of MCMillan and, in particular, Gippsland, as their two major companies are both cooperatives-Bonlac and Murray Goulburn. At the present time those cooperatives are really starting to put economic pressure on some of the farmers to get them to halt production in order to allow them time to develop greater capacity in factory investment to enable the handling of the great demand that is coming for their products. There are real problems in relation to that and to the fact that the cooperative system is not moving quickly enough in today's modern world with the raising of capital. I have been approached by many farmers in my electorate who are not terribly pleased at the moment with the fact that they wish to expand and cannot, with the fact that the cooperatives holding back funds that would normally btl paid to them and returning about half of those funds in the way of a so-called upgrade of the payment by Christmas time and then sending over some share documents saying, 'The other half of your money is going into a fund with which we will build a factory in the future.' That is a very out-of-date way of raising in funds. It is not good for the industry at the present time, particularly in Gippsland where a it is absolutely imperative that the area's resources, farmers, infrastructure that governments have put into roads and everything else that is available there should not be used in the development of a new factory. There needs to be a new process put into place immediately to get that new factory built. We have been doing some local work in relation to it. I am sure that if everybody puts a shoulder to the wheel it can happen. But I have grave doubts that it will happen while we still have just the two cooperative operations. I am a strong believer that we need a player in the Gippsland area. I believe that we need another factory which will look at the situation centrally in GippslandMr Andrew-Competition.",67
155,Mr CUNNINGHAM,DAIRY PRODUCE AMENDMENT,"which will produce competition, by all means, but also make good use of the natural resource of the area. There is little point in restraining farmers from making the correct decisions which need to be made by holding their money in a fund to build a factory. Their responsibility is to produce the product. It is the role of the managers of the factories and the directors of those companies to make the decisions on raising their finance to enable the building of new factories for the market. If they do not move to start to do that very quickly, they will be deliberately holding back and missing a real and golden opportunity for Gippsland to expand in the areas of production, employment and meeting the world markets. World markets at the moment are out there for the taking. For example, Australia developed a product-infant milk powder-many years ago. We had the capacity with that product to take lactose out of milk. The tragedy of the old system, prior to the Kerin are days, was that none of the factories was prepared to invest in that new technology simply because any investor would have had to share his profits with everybody else. So no-one would take the lead, and we ended up selling that process to the Japanese. It is a bit of a tragedy for Australia today to have to ask the Japanese to bring that technology back to and invest in Australia in order that we might produce a product which we already should have had going out from our ports to the rest of the world. Not everybody can handle the milk powders that we normally make. One of the tragedies I know of in Gippsland at the moment is that factories have been reopened which are producing product which is not what the consumer wants. That will be a burden on the industry for a considerable time if it does not move quickly to change it. I have been approached by a number of farmers in my electorate-some of the bigger players in the game, in particular-who are keen to get to work on a new factory. Many of them have seen what is coming in the world markets, and have moved and gone from the old herringbone style operations. They have made large investments in the new rotary dairies where 120 cows can be put through, per person, per hour, without too much difficulty. I have even played golf with some of these young farmers. Come 4 o'clock I have said, 'Gee, you'll be a bit late today getting home to milk.' They have said, 'No problem.' I have asked, 'How many are you milking?' and they have said, 'Four hundred.' I have then asked 'How long will it take you to milk them?' and they have replied, 'An hour and 15 minutes.' With the latest technology available, that now is their capacity. The whole industry needs to move at this rate. We will have jobs in the offing if people will make those sorts of decisions. I am afraid that the old cooperative days need to be revamped completely and brought up to modern day standards. Another challenge facing the Australian dairy industry is to maintain its price competitiveness in export markets as production continues to expand. In the past, manufacturers have been particularly successful in gaining access to new and expanding export markets in the growing Asian economies. It seems likely that the Asian region will remain the focus for future export opportunities-and Gippsland must take part in that. I am pleased to see that at least in northern Victoria some of these things are taking place. The share of Australian exports destined for South-East Asian markets and Japan has grown from 39 per cent back in 1971-72 to 62 per cent in 1993-94. With a growing share of future production likely to be exported, access to new and existing markets is an important issue for Australian exporters. The GATT outcome should and could be a positive one for the world dairy markets because of increased market access provisions and reductions in subsidised exports-although, from what the member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) said and other information that is available, we are starting to have some grave doubts as to whether some players in GATT are playing according to the rules as they originally said they would. However, the extent to which world dairy markets benefit from trade liberalisation wi11largely depend on the way GA TT commitments are met-in particular, by the European Union and the United States. In the last few minutes I will talk about the current outlook for Australia. The Australian in manufacturing milk prices are forecast to rise to average about 25.6c a litre this year, reflecting expected improvement in world dairy product prices, and the value of Australian dairy exports is forecast to rise by almost 12 per cent to $1,406 million-a very significant exporter for Australia. The growth largely reflects a significant increase in returns from skim milk powder exports, with both prices and quantities of skim milk powder exported expected to rise substantially in 1993-94. Australia's milk production is forecast to rise by almost two per cent to 8,200 million litres this year. The moderate increase expected this year comes after two years of relatively large increases, reflecting both an increase in cow numbers and more favourable seasonal conditions. However, of course, we know of the limits and restrictions in growth that the drought imposed this year in New South Wales and Queensland. Our current farm performances are excellent. Australia's farm cash income for the last year averaged $57,210, which was an eight per cent increase on the 1992.,.93 figures. Average incomes were relatively stable during 1993-94, with production increases largely offsetting the effects of lower manufactured milk prices. At the state level, as I have said, New South Wales and Queensland have been affected by the drought. It is expected that their levels will remain very similar in 199495, bearing in mind that much of their production still goes towards milk consumption for city people. New South Wales and Queensland dairy farmers certainly have the capacity to keep their production up by importing grain, which is an extra cost on them this year. An important detail is capital investment in the future. Farmers need to invest in capital items. Some of them need additional land to restructure their farms, some need to build new dairies, and some need to buy new plant and equipment. This appears to occur when we have positive trends in farm cash income, as we have at the present time. The results from the ABARE studies on farm management practices also indicate the sorts of productivity gains that result from investment in new milking equipment. For example, the older style walk-through shed averaged 32 cows milked per hour per person. Herringbone sheds average 54 cows, and these new rotary sheds average 124 cows. It is certainly an enormous increase in productivity. A survey produced three years ago showed that herringbone sheds were used on 76 per cent of the surveyed farms and rotary sheds were used on just two per cent of those farms. We can see that the scope for improvement and investment is there. I am sure, from what I am seeing in Gippsland, and, in particular, MCMillan, that investment in this new equipment will continue. In closing, I make a plea to those who are involved in decision making processes in the dairy industry and, in particular, the factory production area: these people need to look at the old ways and the new ways of doing things, and perhaps put aside some of the old ways. They have served their purpose by allowing farmers to have a say at all levels production, but there comes a time when expertise is required-particularly in world markets where farmers can be quite busy producing the product. Farmers are quite good at that and they should stick to that. Their expertise is required in factory management and factory investment, because this expertise cannot always be found in the cooperatives. In supporting this legislation, I am sure that our dairy industry will continue to prosper. Having been a member of this parliament since 1980 and having worked with John Kerin for so long on the adjustments of the dairy industry, it gives me great pride to see the industry still prospering. I wish those working in it all the best for the future.",69
156,Mr ANDREW,DAIRY PRODUCE AMENDMENT,"I welcome the opportunity to participate in the debate on the three dairy industry bills which are being dealt with cognately. I recognise the involvement of the member for MCMillan (Mr Cunningham) in the dairy industry, not only in current times but also when he was a dairy farmer prior to entering parliament. I recognise, too, the role of the member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), who is similarly familiar with the dairy industry. Unfortunately, I cannot stand here this evening with the same level of hands-on experience in the dairy industry, having had my experience restricted to the one house cow that was kept on our property when I was a boy. For that reason, I do not intend to go through this legislation in the same detail as did the member for Murray and the member for MCMillan. As a South Australian, I acknowledge that South Australia plays a relatively small role in the Australian dairy industry. The industry tends to be concentrated on the east coast of Australia and in Tasmania. Nonetheless, there are significant players in this industry in South Australia Those South Australians have been affected, as have their eastern state counterparts, by this move to deregulation. They have not always welcomed it. While the member for MCMillan has every reason to be proud of the government's role in this dairy industry legislation, he should also acknowledge-as should every governof ment member and the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker)-thatpart of the process that has occurred in the dairy industry has occurred because the opposition has been prepared to acknowledge the right things that the government has done and, therefore, not to frustrate the government. I sometimes find that part of the problem of being a participant in these debates is that it is easy for the opposition to say, 'We are not opposing this legislation,' and it is easy for the government to say, 'We are pleased that the opposition is not opposing this legislation.' But rarely has the government acknowledged the fact that the legislation has progressed through this House and through the Senate as a result of opposition support. Without that support-particularly in the other place-it might have been difficult for the government to have delivered what it wanted. All of those involved in the Australian dairy industry have, as others have said, been involved over the last decade in extensive restructuring and, as a result, have seen real gains for the dairy industry. But these gains have not been without significant pain. As we look at this legislation, we would do well to remember those dairy farmers who were formerly successful-protected but, nonetheless, successful-and who have seen the dairy farm disappear because of these necessary but uncomfortable changes. Those who have succeeded have succeeded only in the face of pain, as they have had to go to their bank managers and enter into new borrowing agreements in order to extend their modern dairying facilities-be they herringbone or rotary, as mentioned by the member for MCMillan. Loan repayments have had to be met and this has caused a great deal of angst, as farmers undertook these borrowing ventures not knowing precisely whether the government legislation would be to their advantage or not. It has been a success and, as a result, we now have an industry that can proudly claim to be making a contribution in excess of $1 billion per annum to our export economy. It is an industry that, as the member for Murray said, can claim to be the second most efficient dairy industry in the world, matched only by our New Zealand counterparts across the Tasman. The legislation before the House proposes to change the way in which support for the dairy industry is collected in Australia. It proposes effectively to make that support GATT legal. The current levy on all milk is GATT illegal, because it is seen effectively as being a support for export milk products as well as domestic milk products. This legislation changes the focus. Instead of the focus being on an all milk levy, it is on a levy on market milk-which previously did not carry this levy-and there is an additional levy paid by manufacturers on domestically manufactured milk products. This legislation allows us to have domestic support rather than export support for the industry, so it allows the industry to meet the requirements under the Uruguay Round of GATT. I want to focus the attention of members on this popular view of the GATT round, and I want to return to the remarks I made when I first rose to participate in this debate. I think the government's action under GATT is a good illustration of both sides of parliament acting responsibly in the national interest. I find that the popular view in my rural electorate-and I am sure it is even more marked in urban electorates-is that both the government and the opposition are somehow GATT gUllible. It is a view that has been exacerbated by the Democrats in the other place, because they have run around painting both the government and the opposition as grossly irresponsible for the stance we have taken under GATT. It is a view that is further exacerbated by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), because he has never come into this place and acknowledged that the opposition's support of the government's role under GATT has come at a great deal of personal cost to opposition members. It would have been much easier for the opposition to have simply opposed the government's action under GATT. After all, the proposal to build a Fortress Australia, to put more bricks in the tariff wall and to supposedly protect Australian industry was much easier to sell in the electorate than the option we have chosen, which is to lower the tariff walls and expose the nation to the cold winds of international trade. The government has taken that action and has been supported by the opposition, but it would , have been enQrmQusly easier fQr the QPPQsitiQn nQt to. have supPQrted the gQvernment. The PQPular view that we are all GATT gullible WQuid have been in SQme way watered dQwn if the Prime Minister had been prepared to. CQme in here and acknQwledge that the passage Qf the world trade legislatiQn had been easier because Qf the QPPQsitiQn's stance and because Qf the integrity the QPPQsitiQn had brQught to. this debate. Mr Deputy Speaker, as yQU knQw-every member Qf this HQuse knQws-this parliament is nQt made up Qf GATT junkies. The reality is that fQr the parliament, gQvernment and QPPQsitiQn, the, stance Qn GATT has been damnably uncQmfQrtable but essential. Only a parliament taking a lQng-term view Qf WQrld trade, rather than a shQrt-term view to. the next PQll, CQuid in fact take this stance. Much Qf what has been dQne has been initially unpQPular. There is a view in the cQmmunity at large that the parliament, bQth gQvernment and QPPQsitiQn, is Qbsessed with a level playing field, that all that gQverns and mQtivates us is this QbsessiQn we have with a level playing field and that we as a parliament have been quite prepared to. sacrifice the sugar industry, the citrus industry, the PQrk industry and the dairy industry Qn the altar Qf a level playing field. That, frankly, is nQt SQ. I have a background, as everYQne knQWS, in the citrus industry. Citrus grQwers are anything but happy with Qur attitude to' GATT and with Qur desire to' in fact take SQme Qf the bend Qut Qf the present WQrld trade playing field and make it a little mQre level. That dQes nQt mean we believe there will ever be a level playing field and it dQes nQt mean the gQvernment dQes either. I think gQvernment and QPPQsitiQn bQth accept that the playing field will always be tilted. The GATT legislatiQn has allQwed us to. take a little Qf the Qut Qf the playing field. I maintain that WQrld trade has always been, and will always be, a dirty card game, but the simple reality is that staying Qut Qf the GATT negQtiatiQns, building a FQrtress Australia, was sQmething the natiQn CQuid nQt affQrd. The member fQr MCMillan made the PQint that, in industry transfer alQne, it CQuid be calculated that the cQmbinatiQn' Qf the levy being paid by CQnsumers as a result Qf this legislatiQn, calculated to. be abQut $100 milliQn, and the levy being paid as a result Qf intersectQr transfer, abQut $35 milliQn, results in abQut $135 milliQn WQrth of SJ.1PPQrt that t4e dairy industry will receive. CQmpare that with the European dairy industry, the mQst prQtected Qf all Qf the primary industries in Europe. Primary industry prQductiQn in Europe is calculated to. CQst EurQpean taxpayers sQmething like $55 billiQn per year. The Parliamentary Secretary to. the Treasurer (Mr ElliQtt) WQuid knQW better than I, but they scrape that SQrt Qf SUPPQrtQut Qf Qver 200 milliQn taxpayers., What are we gQing to. do. with a mere 10 milliQn taxpayers? We cannQt match thi!? no. lQnger level playing field simply by entering into. SQme SQrt Qf trade war. That is why as a parliament we agreed to. GATT: That is why as a parliament we are entertaining this legislatiQn. We hQpe to. take the tilted playing field-we knQW it will never be level-':""and take SQme Qf the tilt QUt. "" In this dirty card game that we play, we as a parliament recQgnise that wQrld, trad- will go. Qn being dirty. That is inevitable. But as a result Qf being signatQries t'o GATT, as a result Qf agreeing to. this WQrld trade arrangement, we haVe at le'ast ensured that' fQr the first time in Qur trading history all thQse who. wanttQ play arQund GA1T nQW p.ave to. play the dirty card game with t4eir hands Qn tQP' Qf the table instead of underneath. So. at least we can see what they are dQing in the way of supPQrting their industries, in a legal Qr illegal manner. This legislatiQn is designed to. ensure that the SUPPQrt that gQes to. the Australian 'dairy industry is in fact GATT legal, that Qur hand Qf cards can be seen by everybQdy else. The tilt QbligatiQn we have as a parliament is to. ensure that the Qther players, thQse Qther traders who. are signatQries to. GATT, are also. Qbliged to. shQW what their hand Qf cards indicates they are Qffering their dairy farmers. There is a lQt Qf evidence to. suggest that it is still much easier to. be a dairy farmer, a citrus fanner Qr a sugar farmer in any Qther part Qf the glQbe' than in Australia because Qf the level of support received. We cannot match that in dollar terms, so we are endeavouring to match it in agreement terms. Take, for example, my own experience of the difficulties with world trade in the citrus industry, which can be paralleled with the dairy industry. I have citrus growers bemoaning the fact that while citrus growers and dairy farmers in Australia head towards a five per cent residual tariff by the year 2000 the Israelis currently still enjoy tariff protection of 140 per cent. I know that. The parliamentary secretary by his assent indicates that he is conscious of it. What my growers tend to lose sight of-so do the dairy farmers-is that the Israelis have come off a tariff of over 170 per cent. They have forfeited more than we have, even though their residual tariff is larger. The level playing field is not and never will be level, but part of the difficulty, part of disadvantage, we faced is ironed out by GATT. That is why we support this legislation. That is why we believe this legislation, while it means further adjustments in the dairy industry, is in the long-term interest not only of the dairy industry but also of all Australian exporters. We have an obligation to ensure that all other nations-in the case of this legislation, all other dairying nationsalso comply with their agreements under GATT. While I do not wish to introduce an acid note into this debate, the particular obligation the government has, and the particular obligation the Minister for Trade (Senator MCMullan) has, is to ensure that we are not so GATT gullible that we think everyone else is playing with a clean hand of cards. The one criticism the dairy farmers, sugar farmers and citrus farmers have of the arrangements we have under GATT is that it seems we have given away too much too early. Whether the criticism is fair or not, the simple reality is that we can be sure our trading competitors will do all they can to maximise the advantage to their farmers under the GATT arrangements. We need to ensure that we do the same. This legislation does allow us to ensure that the impact of GATT is cushioned in the dairy industry. Consistent with our support for GATT and with our support for the dairy industry, we, the opposition, are pleased to support the bills before the House.",71
157,Mr MCARTHUR,DAIRY PRODUCE AMENDMENT,"I am delighted to participate in this debate and to follow the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew), who has provided an erudite insight into the problems of GATT with his particular background in the dried fruit industry, the politics associated with that industry and the international trade pressures on a number of producers in his electorate. I also acknowledge the depth of experience of the member for MCMillan (Mr Cunningham) of the dairy industry and his contribution to this debate and the previous debates through still the 1980s. Likewise, I acknowledge the member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), who, again, has participated in these ongoing debates the about the changing face of the dairy industry and I note his contribution here this afternoon. A recent announcement by the Bonlac company is significant. It announced that it will be investing $11 million worth of capital in its new Melbourne plant and relocating its South-East Asian operations from Singapore back to Melbourne because of the competitive pressures the Singapore economy is now placing on that processing plant. That particular company is now internationally competitive both in terms of the processing and in terms of its ability to sell product in Asia and in north Africa. In my own electorate, $30 million has been spent at Cobden on a processing plant with the latest technology for the drying of milk powder. That shows the confidence that Bonlac has in new technology and the export opportunities in the South-East Asian region. Bonlac has sales of some $600 million, employs 2,400 people and 40 per cent of its product is sold, as I say, in the South-East Asian region and in the north African markets. Bonlac is concentrated in Colac, Camperdown and Cobden and through the Hawkesbury scheme and some parts of its operations are in Gippsland and in northern Victoria. It brings, in the processing sense, an added value to the dairy farmers who are now highly productive and highly efficient in terms of their ability to grow grass and utilise rotary dairies, as the member for MCMillan said. New technologies in these areas have made them a far cry from the original dairy farmers whom so much debate in this parliament has been about. I guess the main thrust of this bill, member for Wakefield has so rightly identified, is that the opposition and the government have joined forces in supporting a freer trade in the dairy industry following the GATT round. Many members in this House would recall the very heated and strong debates both in electorates and in this parliaprofitable ment about former minister Kerin's plan to change the focus of the dairy industry from an inward looking focus to an export orientation. This legislation completes that process and makes sure that the dairy industry will now, forever and a day, be concentrated in export markets, those growing markets in South-East Asia where profits will be made and maintained and where the profits of certain dairy farmers no longer rely on the domestic high priced milk. We have all been through that debate and we all understand the arguments that were so vigorously pursued, that doomsday was around the comer. Obviously, the very important factors of subsidised milk products and subsidised farmers in Europe really upset the international market. Again, as the member for Wakefield identified-and it is worth reiterating-between $US55 billion and $US60 billion has been pumped into the agriculture support systems of the European common market. Some 340 million people live in that market and only eight million farmers receive that sort of level of government support. But governments around the world, and of course European governments, are now starting to question the ability of Europeans to subsidise agriculture to that level. Now agricultural production is more related to the market forces and that level of subsidy is no longer available in such massive forms. So we can now make changes here in our own domestic arrangements. Along with the member for Wakefield, I had a chance to look at what Europeans would consider to be an updated dairy with 20 belgium blue cattle. We inspected that farm early in the morning. I think the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) was there; he is not from a dairy farming background. That farm was a clear demonstration as the of what the Europeans considered to be efficient and what we in Australia thought to be highly inefficient and would survive only with a massive amount of subsidy. The argument here in Australia is that fresh milk markets in the capital cities were always because the domestic market could afford to pay for that milk and there was a certain amount of regulation by all state governments of all political colours. This was based on the original concept that fresh milk had to be delivered 365 days a year to the city milk markets from comparatively close dairy farms. State governments had price stabilisation plans, and the low export prices that were generated by international markets further exacerbated this attitude of mine, that we must at all costs make sure that the domestic consumer helps the dairy farmers. This legislation, as other members have indicated, ensures that the Australian parliament and the Australian dairy industry meet GATT legal requirements, that the export subsidies be reduced by 36 per cent. As the member for Wakefield quite rightly identified, it depends from what base these export subsidies are used. The case of Israel, which the member for Wakefield discussed, was from a very high base but here in Australia our export subsidies in the dairy industry are from a comparatively low base. So there is some legitimate argument that the level playing field is not as level as it might be in certain GATT rearrangements depending on what base you start from. The GATT arrangements need subsidised exports to be cut by 21 per cent. Again, a similar argument as to what level you start at is involved. We note that in some of these other nations around the world they have started at a very high level. Even though they are reducing it by the statutory requirement, it is not really as good as it might be. The ABARE statistics, which the honourable member for MCMillan quoted, give some reason for confidence. When the benefits of the full impact of the Uruguay Round competitive market pressures and genuine outcomes of real prices flow to the dairy producers they will improve cheese prices by 20 per cent, milk powders by 16 per cent and butter by four per cent. The Kerin plan, just to remind members of the House, proposed a levy of 45c per kilogram butter fat. That subsidised the dairy exporters who were at that time dealing with a very difficult market. As we have mentioned, the EEC was highly subsidised. So there was some legitimate argument that domestic consumers might contribute at that time to make sure that the dairy farmers remained reasonably profitable. The domestic support scheme that we are now looking at is a value added approach to milk manufacturers who export their product. So we are really looking at this very important concept of those people who manufacture milk products and export are entitled to some help from the government. If we look at the Industry Commission report, in 1992 we see that 27 per cent of the production in Australia was fresh milk; 73 per cent was manufactured, of which a large proportion was exported for the export dollars. As we know, on the fresh milk argument, there was a comfort clause to ensure that state governments and dairy farmers at the capital city level would not interfere with so-called interstate-intrastate competition. Some of us had considerable reservations about these arrangements but inevitably the marketplace has taken over because the pressure from international pricing has now brought about a more realistic assessment. In terms of Australian exports, Victoria exports a major proportion of Australia's production and is a very efficient industry, along with New Zealand. We see considerable progress in Victoria where both export and domestic demand is being maintained. The really staggering statistics in the dairy industry, as identified by the Industry Commission report, is that in 1975 we had 43,000 dairy farmers in Australia. Some 20 years later we have about 16,000 dairy farmers left who are very productive and very efficient. The number of dairy cows has decreased from 2.8 million to one million. The other staggering statistic is that those one million dairy cows are now producing 3,800 litres per cow compared to 2,600 litres per cow in 1975. So productivity has gone up; numbers of cows have gone down; and numbers of dairy farmers have gone down. This is a far cry from the subsidisation of the dairy industry over the 1960s and 1970s when some $30 million of taxpayers' funds were injected into the dairy industry to maintain dairy farmers on small dairy farms which were highly uneconomic. But market forces and a gradual rationalisation of the dairy industry by the factories, by the political process and by common sense have meant that the dairy industry is now reasonably efficient and has a buoyant future ahead of it without government subsidies. The particular bill before the House ensures that these arrangements conform to GATT, as other members have pointed out, moving from 22 per cent support payments in 199293 down to 11.7 per cent in 1999 to the year 2000. So we have this gradual reduction of the support payments which will be conforming in a genuine sense to the GATT round negotiations. I think we have met our obligations in this parliament and in Australia to keep ourselves internationally competitive without government support or schemes that purport to meet GATT rounds but are in fact under the table type operations. The Dairy Produce Amendment Act 1992, of which this legislation is a follow-on, extended market support payments for dairy products until 30 June 2000; provided for a phased reduction in the rate of the market support payments for exports of dairy products; and terminated the underwriting of dairy export prices from 30 June 1992. Whilst that is history, it is worth getting it on the record so that all those people in the dairy industry can understand what this parliament has, done in a bipartisan sense. It is now not an export subsidy, as it was historically, by the domestic consumer; it is a levy rebated to all exporters. The coalition supports that approach. I will conclude by discussing some comments by the Victorian Dairy Industry Authority, which was the regulating authority both in terms of price and processes. That authority is chaired by Mr Tom Austin, an excellent chairman and a former minister for agriculture, whose role now is to look at the price arrangements, the quality assurance programs and information technology as it affects the dairy industry. In my discussions with the authority today, they indicate that 60 per cent of milk produced nationally is now produced in Victoria. That authority may adopt a role of quality standards for the rest of Australia in view of the amount of exports that are generated in Victoria. In Victoria, 91 per cent of the milk products are used in the manufacturing sense, at approximately 25c per litre; and nine per cent of its production is in the fresh milk market, which is about SOc per litre at the farm gate. Members of the House would appreciate that there is a premium for those farmers who supply that fresh milk market. In view of the way in which the dairy industry authority used to operate, I was encouraged by the comments of the general manager, Mr Doug Weir, on 31 August which indicate a massive change of attitude by leaders in the dairy industry. He said: . . . the shake-out really began 30 years ago when Britain joined the Common Market, closing Australia's traditional export market for butter and cheese. ""The industry was slow to recover from the shock and, of the 50,000 dairy farmers in the State then, only the toughest and the very best have survived. He then went on to make this interesting comment, which shows a remarkable change of attitude by the industry leaders: We've had to leam and explore new markets and new products as a matter of survival ... consequently we have today an industry highly productive, internationally competitive, market-oriented and has great growth potential."" I think that sums up what we are now facing in the industry. It is an export based industry; with growth markets in Asia; with Europe being more sensible about its agricultural policies; with the fresh milk market supporting the other capital cities-that is, Brisbane, Sydney, Adelaide and Perth-and with Victoria and Tasmania being the predominant providers of export milk products. Given that the USA pays lip-service to and, hopefully, will support the Uruguay Round commitments-Canada likewise-and that the Europeans are under considerable political pressure, I think the dairy industry can look forward to a very confident future. Because we are very efficient in Australia, we can compete with New Zealand. The new technology of pastures, rotary dairies and genetics in the dairy herd all add up to the Australian dairy farmer being the best in the world. I might say that part of my own electorate of Corangamite could end up being the centre of the dairy industry in Australia, if not the world. The rainfall pattern, the soil type, the value of the land and the dairy farmers' preparedness to make management changes have indicated that they are in the forefront of dairy technology. This bill before the parliament will enhance that view. It will ensure that they are out in the cold world of international competition; that they are competitive at that level; that they are profitable; and that they have a very sound future-if anyone can say that people in primary production have a sound future on world markets .

Bill presented by Mr Willis, and read a first time. Second Reading",77
160,Mr WILLIS,MAIN COMMITTEE,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Budget that I deliver tonight has one principal objective: to provide for the continued expansion of the Australian economy. It will enable the continuation of substantial employment growth, falling unemployment and rising living standards, while reducing pressure on interest rates, inflation and the current account. It will do so by tackling the major constraint on growth: the long term decline of our national savings. A higher level of national savings will allow higher levels of investment and economic growth without the costs and constraints associated with undue reliance on the savings of foreigners. This Budget provides a two part plan to improve Australia's saving performance, immediately and over the longer term. Firstly, it increases public saving. The Budget delivers a surplus in 1995-96 of $718 million. This is a massive turnaround in the budget outcome of $12.9 billion or 2.8 per cent of GDP. It is the largest ever turnaround in the budget outcome. It brings the Budget into surplus 3 years earlier than previously forecast. This is achieved by cuts to spending, increases in revenue, and asset sales, including part of the proceeds from the sale of the Government's remaining equity in the Commonwealth Bank. Importantly, the Budget for 1996-97 will be in surplus excluding asset sales and special debt and capital repayments. And the budget surplus by 1998-99 will be $7.4 billion or 1.2 per cent of GDP. Secondly, this Budget will introduce a major increase in private saving in the medium to longer term by the progressive introduction of employee superannuation contributions, with the second round of the One Nation tax cuts paid on a matching dollar for dollar basis employee superannuation accounts. Together with the Superannuation Guarantee and existing award superannuation this initiative will, within a generation, boost Australia's annual saving performance by 4 per cent of GDP. The return to budget surplus will reduce Commonwealth Government debt, which is already well below the average for OECD countries, by almost 30 per cent as a share of GDP over the next 4 years. Tonight's Budget also addresses immediate high priority needs with new measures for families, health care, the environment and justice. NA Mr Speaker, the return of the budget outcome to surplus in 1995-96, and to substantial surplus in 1996-97 and beyond, fulfils the Government's promise to significantly tighten fiscal policy. The measures announced tonight provide a net fiscal tightening, excluding the effects of asset sales and early debt redemptions, of $3 billion in 1995-96 and $4Y2 billion in 1996-97. On the outlays side this tightening has been accomplished by a rigorous examination of all areas of government expenditure. The decisions I am announcing produce a net reduction in outlays of $700 million in 199596 excluding asset sales and early debt redemptions. Overall, a real reduction in outlays of 2.5 per cent has been achieved, the first real reduction since 1989-90. Outlays are projected to fall from 26.7 per cent of GDP in 1994-95 to 24 per cent of GDP in 1998-99, demonstrating the Government's determination to reduce its call on national saving. Total taxation revenue collected by the Government as a share of GDP declined in each of the 6 years between 1987-88 and 1993-94. The revenue measures that I am announcing tonight strengthen the Commonwealth's tax base and provide a significant contribution to improving the budget outcome. In all they add $2.4 billion to revenue in 1995-96 and $3.6 billion in 1996-97. into But even after allowing for these measures, budget balance will be restored with revenue much lower, in relation to GDP, than in the past. When we last moved into surplus in 1987-88 revenue represented 27.2 per cent of GDP compared to an estimated 25.3 per cent in 1995-96. Our fiscal policy compares more than favourably with that of most other industrialised countries and, amongst such countries, we will continue to be one of the lowest taxed. NA Mr Speaker, one of the principal objectives of this Budget is to meet the medium term imperative of improving national saving to maintain investment and employment through the 1990s and beyond. Tonight I can announce, on behalf of the Government, a radical and innovative program to meet that challenge and further decrease Australia's reliance on foreign borrowings. This initiative complements the addition to Australia's savings arising from the budget surplus. It meets a goal and establishes a commitment. The goal is better retirement incomes for Australians. The commitment, simultaneously established, is to substantially increase the nation's savings. The measure will build on one of the most far-reaching steps taken during the Government's years of office-the development of Australia's superannuation and retirement incomes policy. Tonight's announcement will dramatically strengthen and extend that policy. It will not only sharply increase the incomes of Australians in retirement, but will also build a large pool of savings to finance the nation's continuing prosperity. This initiative has two elements, an employee superannuation contribution and a matching government contribution. Mr Speaker, in One Nation we said, and I quote: ""The Government will be giving consideration to using employee contributions and tax cuts to increase the total level of superannuation support by a further 3 per cent of earnings."" The Government believes that this is the time to do so--in fact, we believe there is now a need to go beyond the objectives we set then. Accordingly, under tonight's initiative, the Government will support the inclusion in all awards of provisions for employee superannuation contributions beginning at 1 per cent of earnings in July 1997 and rising to 3 per cent of earnings by July 1999. This will be timed to coincide with wage increases through enterprise agreements or awards, so that workers will not experience a reduction in disposable income. The second element, Mr Speaker, is that the Government will match dollar for dollar the contributions paid by most employees into their superannuation accounts-a government contribution, when fully phased in, of $4 billion a year. By paying the One Nation tax cuts into employees' superannuation accounts we are delivering them in a way that significantly improves national saving. Together, additional contributions will add 6 per cent of wages to the superannuation of people earning around average incomes. By 2002 this will build on the 9 per cent contribution from employers under the Superannuation Guarantee arrangements. This new initiative will, therefore, lift the superannuation savings for a person on around average earnings to a minimum of 15 per cent of their wages. I want to make it abundantly clear, however, that the Government continues to see the age pension as the foundation stone of our retirement incomes policy. Tonight's arrangements build on the existing pension system. For a couple on average earnings, now in their mid 30s, the Government's initiatives deliver retirement incomes 75 per cent higher than the age pension. For their children joining the workforce in the next decade, retirement incomes will be more than double the age pension. Mr Speaker, the new policy has been designed to benefit low and middle income earners. Furthermore, employees currently contributing to superannuation will not need to make additional contributions to be eligible for the matching government payment. The government contribution will be means tested. The Government will match contributions up toa limit of around $1 000 per annum for all workers earning less than around $46 000. The Government will enable the selfemployed to claim the matching government contribution on a proportion of their superannuation savings. Finally, for equity reasons, the existing means-tested rebate for member contributions will be retained. Mr Speaker, the policy announced tonight will change forever the expectations of workers as they move towards retirement age. It will give Australia a comprehensive long term private savings plan---one that could not have been contemplated without the ground breaking work on superannuation done by this Labor Government since 1983. I remind honourable members that in 1983, after decades of neglect by the Liberal and National parties, less than 40 per cent of all employees had superannuation coverage. Today, as a result of our reforms, that total nearly 90 per cent. For women, the increased coverage from the previous initiatives of this Government has been even more spectacular, rising from 24 per cent in 1983 to 85 per cent today. Thus women now have a major stake in superannuation-and it will be a bigger stake after the Budget's measures. Today superannuation savings have already reached $186 billion. But, Mr Speaker, under the policy announced tonight that figure will increase tenfold by year 2020. Together with our earlier reforms, tonight's initiatives are estimated to further increase national saving progressively by around 2 per cent of GDP per year by the end of the decade. When fully implemented, they will add 4 per cent of GDP per year to national saving. In today's values that means an increase in saving in the order of $18 billion per annum. These new superannuation measures will be extremely good for Australian workers and their families, and just as good for the nation. NA NA Mr Speaker, Australia's economy has been growing for 312 years. During this time, Australia has had one of the best performing economies among industrialised countries. In 1994, Australia was among the fastest growing industrialised countries, but with inflation below the average of these countries. Notwithstanding the severe drought which has affected much of eastern Australia, GDP growth is expected to be 4% per cent in 199495. And this growth has been broadly based. Business investment, which has been growing since late 1992, is expected to grow by 18 per cent this fiscal year. Employment has grown by 4.2 per cent over the 12 months to March 1995. By delivering around 550 000 new jobs since is April 1993, the Government has already surpassed its election commitment to create half a million jobs in this term of office. As a result, the unemployment rate has fallen to 8.7 per cent. The number of long term unemployed people has fallen by 25 per cent over the 12 months to March 1995 as the Government's Working Nation program continues to assist them into jobs. Critical to maintaining this strong growth in activity and employment has been the maintenance of low inflation. the Australia's inflation rate has been below that of our major trading partners over recent years. Low inflation is the result of reforms to the structure of our economy over the past decade. A key factor has been the success of the Government's wages policy and industrial relations reforms through the Accord, which is unique to this Labor Government and rejected by the Opposition. Business is facing an increasingly competitive environment. With protection reduced and markets opened to competition, businesses are increasingly required to adopt international standards of best practice. Widespreadmicroeconomic reforms have also resulted in a more competitive economy. The recent· historic agreement between the Commonwealth and the States to implement the national competition policy reforms will, in conjunction with related reforms in industries such as energy and transport, further raise the level of competition in the economy. All these developments are keeping production costs and therefore inflationary pressures down. An added benefit of this restraint in prices and wages is that it puts less pressure on monetary policy, and reduces the need for increases in interest rates. As a result of these improvements in labour and product markets, Australia's international competitiveness is now 18 per cent higher than in the September quarter 1990. Nevertheless, rapid growth in domestic demand, particularly for investment goods, has led to a sharp rise in imports. In addition, adverse effects on our exports from drought and the hesitant recovery in Japan have increased our current account deficit to an estimated 6 per cent of GDP this year. Tackling this problem is largely what this Budget is about. OUTLOOK FOR 1995-96 Mr Speaker, in 1995-96 GDP growth will ease from the higher rates recorded in 1994 but will remain strong, at around 3% per cent. Domestic demand will move more into line with growth in output as a result of: · a slight moderation in private consumption; · a continued decline in dwelling investment as housing construction eases back toward underlying demand; and · a slowing in public demand growth. Export growth should be rapid as world demand continues to grow strongly and the effects of the drought begin to ease. Reduced domestic demand will lead to a decline in the growth of imports. Despite an offsetting increase in our net income deficit due to higher world interest rates, the current account deficit is expected to decline by Y2 per cent of GDP. Wage growth is expected to be higher in 1995-96 but, in the context of enterprise bargaining and continued improvements in productivity, it should remain compatible with maintaining an underlying inflation rate around 2 to 3 per cent on average over the course of the economic cycle. This favourable outlook is strongly supported by the union movement's commitment to responsible wage outcomes under the Accord. And achievement of this goal will be further aided by the spread of enterprise bargaining throughout the workforce. Employers and employees are taking advantage of the new system by making work practices more flexible, thus improving our productivity performance and providing a firm basis for wage rises for Australian workers. A new Accord is being negotiated with the ACTU, which will underpin the continuation of responsible wage outcomes and low inflation: Business investment is expected to remain strong in 1995-96, rising by around 13 per cent. This will contribute to growth in the capital stock and help maintain economic growth without supply bottlenecks triggering higher inflation. Employment will continue to grow strongly, by about 3 per cent or over 240 000 jobs. The unemployment rate should fall to around 8 per cent by mid-1996. Real household disposable income is forecast to increase by 4- per cent, following this year's 4 per cent increase. Mr Speaker, the economic environment facing us over the next few years is one that offers great national opportunities, and great opportunities for all Australians. This Budget's savings strategy will allow us to maximise these opportunities for economic growth. NA Mr Speaker, I turn now to other significant measures in the Budget. This Budget includes a major statement on our Agenda for Families which responds to the issues raised during the International of the Family. The Government will provide further practical support for families through the initiatives I am announcing tonight. A new means tested maternity allowance of $816 will be introduced from 1 February 1996. It will provide a vital boost to family income when it is most needed: on the birth of a baby. About 85 per cent of women will be eligible for the payment which will be available to women both at home and in paid employment. The level of Guardians Allowance paid to sole parent pensioners will be increased by $4 a fortnight from September 1996. Rent assistance will also be increased by $5 a fortnight from March 1996 for families with children. Both these measures build on significant real improvements in family payments made to low income families over the life of this Government. From July 1995 the new Parenting Allowance which was announced as part of Working Nation will provide about 115 000 low income working fa.'1lilies with an average of $59 a week. Mr Speaker, tonight's Budget also focuses on t-e health needs of families through preventatlve health care measures for children and young people. To raise the immunisation rates among our children and so reduce the incidence of preventable diseases, a National Childhood Immunisation Program costing $llm in 199596 will be introduced. A new 'Health Australia' program provides $18m over 3 years for measures to strengthen health promotion and reduce the consumption of tobacco, particularly among young people. Mr Speaker, the Government will continue to help families meet the challenges faced by competing work and family responsibilities. The Government will deliver on its 1993 promise to meet the projected demand for work related care by 2000-01. In this Budget we have taken steps to ensure that the focus is on meeting the needs of Year working parents, while providing equitable access to subsidised child care for parents who stay at home with their children. The Government will also provide additional financial support to carers of older people and disabled people, and will promote the role of carers in the community. A number of the measures to be announced in the Government's forthcoming Justice Statement will help families to avoid legal problems and deal with disputes. Families of indigenous Australians remain seriously disadvantaged. In this Budget, the Government will build on past initiatives by spending an additional $204m over 4 years to improve the standard of health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. NA Mr Speaker, to reduce spending, the Government looked first at the cost of delivering its own programs. Indexation arrangements for both Commonwealth Own Purpose Outlays and Specific Purpose Payments to the States with substantial wage costs are to be rationalised from 1 July 1995 producing savings of almost $2 gain billion over the next 4 years. The changes will not apply to personal benefit payments-that is, there will be no change to indexation arrangements for pensions, allowances and other income support payments. Reductions in administrative costs of departments and agencies will produce savings of around $640m over the next 4 years. Together with a range of efficiency and other measures already adopted by the Government over recent years, this will lead to a reduction in administrative costs of 15 per cent in real ter-s over the next 4 years. The Government has also been able to reduce spending on labour market programs. These savings will not jeopardise achievement of the Government's Working Nation targets. They result largely from more efficient delivery of programs and a stronger labour market. This Budget also includes measures to simplifinancial year. fy the income test applying to pensions through the introduction of a deeming system on financial investments only. It will replace the current system of assessment of unrealised in 1997-98. capital growth on shares and managed investThe ments. The Government will take steps to reduce the mercial basis. rapid escalation of some health program costs. REVENUE New arrangements for delivering pathology services and an increase in the safety net threshold for general patients under Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme from $407 to $600 from 1 January 1996 will provide substantial savings. The Government reaffirms its election comfrom mitment to support health research by increasyears ing funding for the National Health and Medical Research Council by $58m over years. Mr Speaker, for the higher education there is a budget-neutral package which will provide 5850 new higher education places over the next 3 years and increased funding for research infrastructure. An additional $217m over 4 years will be a provided for initiatives to protect our natural icy. environment, with particular emphasis on our coastline and our native forests. We will accelerate implementation of the National Forest Policy Statement through $53m package over 4 years to undertake comprehensive regional forest assessments five high priority areas and conclude associatsale ed regional forest agreements with the The Government also remains determined to improve the urban environment with a further $254m over 4 years for the Better Cities Program. In a major addition to our transport infrastrucThe ture, international and domestic airport facili1 ties will be constructed at Sydney West in time for the Sydney 2000 Olympics. Tonight I am announcing further developments in the Government's asset sales program. The Government proposes to sell and leaseback DASFLEET's motor vehicle fleet this The Government's remaining 50.4 per cent equity in the Commonwealth Bank will be sold in two tranches, one in 1995-96 and one sale will complete the process of putting the ownership of the Bank on a fully comMr Speaker, the revenue side of the Budget will also play its part in fiscal tightening. the With the strong economic recovery, the corporate profit share has returned to the record levels of the mid 1980s. Companies in Australia have also benefited a number of tax concessions in recent to stimulate business activity. They include investment allowances, accelerated 4 depreciation, the 150 per cent R&D tax concession and a large reduction in the comsector pany tax rate from 39 per cent. These measures will be providing a benefit of more than $3 billion to businesses in 1995-96. Now that the economy is growing strongly it is appropriate that the corporate sector make contribution to the tightening of fiscal polAccordingly, the rate of company income tax will be increased from 33 to 36 per cent for the. 1995-96 and subsequent income years. a This measure will add $320m to revenue in 1995-96 and $1,570m in 1996-97. in The One Nation statement reduced the wholesales tax on passenger motor vehicles by States. 5 per cent to stimulate demand. Now that passenger motor vehicle sales are at a high level, it is appropriate to restore the sales tax rate to the general rate of 21 per cent from tonight. Government has also decided that, from July 1995, sales tax at the concessional12 per cent rate will apply to currently exempt builders' hardware and certain building materials used mainly in the completion of buildings. The bulk of building materials used in construction, such as bricks, timber, cement and roofing tiles, will remain exempt. Mr Speaker, Medicare levy receipts as a proportion of Medicare outlays have fallen from over 30 per cent in 1988-89 to an expected 24 per cent in 1994-95. Tonight I am announcing an increase in the Medicare levy from 1.4 to 1.5 per cent which will partially reverse this decline. The excise rate on tobacco will rise by 10 per cent from tonight. This will replace the 5 per cent increase originally scheduled for August 1995. In recent years evidence has emerged of an erosion of the PA YE tax base, where individuals have attempted to move out of traditional employer/employee relationships in order to avoid tax. Accordingly, the Government will be amending the income tax law to ensure the intended coverage of the PA YE provisions can be enforced. I will also be releasing soon a discussion paper dealing with the use of schemes to avoid tax on personal services income. In order to reduce deferral of tax payments under the PA YE system, the threshold at which bi-monthly remittance is required will be reduced to $lm per year. Generally, this measure will affect companies with around 120 employees or more. To protect the revenue base, I am also announcing tonight measures to correct a number of deficiencies in the tax laws. Eligibility for the research and development tax concession for syndicates investing in private tax exempt bodies will be limited to exclude investors who are not fully at risk. This measure will prevent inappropriate access to tax benefits, and parallels a 1992 measure applying to public sector tax exempt research bodies. There will be clarification of certain wholesale sales tax rate classifications including removal of the tax exemption for nonpermanent microchips used in certain goods. The current exemption has proved virtually impossible to administer, introduced significant distortions and inefficiencies in the market, and caused considerable loss of revenue. 'Light' fuel oils, which are in effect industrial diesel fuels, will be made subject to excise in the same way as diesel fuels. This is designed to address the tax-driven substitution of 'light' fuel oil for diesel which is taking place at some cost to economic efficiency and the environment. From 1 July 1995, the interest rate which the Reserve Bank of Australia pays banks on their non-callable deposits will be set at 5 percentage points below market rates. This measure recognises the benefits which accrue to banks from being authorised by the Government and subject to RBA prudential supervision. More detail on each of these and other revenue measures is contained in the budget papers and accompanying statements. NA Mr Speaker, tonight's Budget responds to the economic challenges facing Australia today other and in the years ahead in a creative and decisive way. It presents a comprehensive plan to address the deficiency in our national saving. The immediate restoration of the budget to surplus and the major enhancement to Australia's superannuation arrangements will dramatically boost our savings performance. At the same time, we have improved the level of social justice so that all Australians benefit from our economic progress. Over the past dozen years, Australia has undergone a transformation which has made our economy far more competitive, efficient and dynamic than was ever previously imagined. We are now well placed to capitalise on these improvements. With continued diligence, hard work, preparedness to change, and intelligent application of our collective skills, we can confidently look forward to a secure and prosperous future for this nation. I commend the Budget to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Howard) adjourned. BUDGET PAPERS 1995-96",78

(2) What targets have been set to assess the performance of each of the programs referred to in part (1) in (a) 1994-95 and (b) 1995-96. (3) What action will be taken if a program substantially fails to meet its targets. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) A comprehensive strategy is being developed by my departmentto evaluate the Working Nation initiatives. The purpose of the strategy is to assess the effectiveness of the measures over a four year period and progressively to identify any policy adjustments required. The evaluation strategy is in five parts, covering the Job Compact, entry level training enhancements, the Youth Training Initiative, improved service delivery (including case management) and the impact of the initiatives on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. A report of the evaluation will be available in 1998, with an interim report to be published two years earlier. The process of preparation of the strategy includes consultation with specialist researchers, together with training sector, peak business, union and community representatives. An interdepartmental committee, chaired by my department, has an overarching advisory role. Qualitative and quantitative methods will be used in evaluating the initiatives. Main data collections for the evaluation include: (a) a longitudinal survey of employment and unemployment patterns conducted by the ABS. This survey will measure changes in both the numbers of jobless people and their labour force characteristof ics while the Working Nation initiatives are operating relative to changes in a random sample of the working age population; and will enable program participation and outcome information to be NA mapped into the official unemployment statistics Evaluation framework; (b) a DEET longitudinal cohort study, combining the use of DEET's administrative systems and surveys, which will track a sample of jobseeker clients over the next four years so that longer term outcomes can be measured relative to the type and level of assistance received, client characteristics and the prevailing conditions in local labour markets; and (c) supplementary collections to obtain in depth information from employers, training providers, community organisations,jobseekers, trainees and other stakeholders. The evaluation strategy described above will test the effectiveness of programs over the four-year term of the Working Nation strategy. The performance of labour market programs covered by those initiatives will be continuously monitored through the Post Program Monitoring survey. The survey provides information on short term program outcomes, that is, the proportions of clients who are in unsubsidised employment or mainstream education and training around three months after leaving program assistance. In addition, as part of the broader WorkingNationmonitoring and evaluation strategy, outcomes will be monitored on an extended basis through additional sample-based surveys at points six arid 12 months after clients have left their program places. (2) At the outset, it is important to state that the targets outlined in Working Nation are indicative and will be influenced by overall economic performance and client needs. WorkingNationdid not specify particular targets for individual programs in 1994-95 and the forward years. The number of places in individual programs in 1994-95 and subsequent years will depend on the numbers of eligible people and the needs of individual clients, particularly those assisted through case management. Program usage will change to reflect changing circumstances, particularly at the local and regional level. The number of clients to be assisted in each year the four year strategy, either directly into a job placement or into a training pathway to a job, was estimated in the Working Nation statement. These estimates were based on economic forecasts of client numbers. Broad indicative labour market program commencements and expenditure for the current and 1994-95 76,700 For 1995-96 indicative labour market 1995-96* (* breakdown by employment 50,000 additional entry-level training places will be provided by 1995-96 in apprenticeships and traineeships and other programs with a significant training component such as the National Training Wage, the Landcare Environment Action Program, Accredited Training for Youth and JobSkills. As has been indicated above, numbers and expenditure will vary according to the numbers of eligible clients and their individual needs. The actual number of clients requiring assistance will vary over the four years and the level of training assistance required will vary according to the case managers assessment of client needs. Client numbers and planned activity are monitored regularly and adjusted as required to achieve the four year strategy. (3) As noted in the answer to (2) the targets outlined in Working Nation are indicative and will be subject to change based on economic circumstances and the changing needs of clients. The program mix will be realigned and funds moved to more effective programs if it becomes evident that a particular program is not achieving required outcomes; Programs are continually monitored to check for the need to review program policy or operational roles, to improve performance and ensure the achievement of outcomes. Department of Social Security: Residential·Properties (Question No. 1711) Mr Jull asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 10 November 1994: (1) How many residential properties are owned arid managed by the Minister's Department or its agencies. (2) Where are the properties referred to in part (1) located in each State. forward years as set out in the Working Nation documentation are: Job Compact (Number) Total (Number) Employment Employment Programs Other Programs Other Total ($M) 75,500 244,511 347,900 1,680 program commencements and expenditure are: Job Compact (Number) Total (Number) Total ($M) 313,000 647,000 2,220 programs and other not available) (3) Which agency manages the properties at each location. Mr Baldwin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) 85 residential properties are owned. (2) New South Wales Bega 1; Broken Hill 1; Dubbo 1; Griffith 1; Maroubra 1; Moree 1; Parkes 1; Walgett 1. Queensland Charleville 1; Emerald 1; Thursday Island 2; Townsville 1.

However, if a property is to be sold or purchased the Department may use an outside service provider. Working Nation Statement: Program Evaluation (Question No. 1803)  ment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 17 November 1994: (1) ,What is the method of evaluation for each program implemented within his portfolio under the Working Nation Statement. (2) What will each program referred to in part (1) cost in (a) 1994-95 and (b) 1995-96. (3) What targets will be used to assess the performance of each program in (a) 1994-95 and (b) 1995-96. (4) When will the first evaluation occur. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1), (2) & (3) I refer the honourable member to the answers to Parts (1) and (2) of Parliamentary Question No. 1652. (4) Under the Working Nation Evaluation Strategy, the first evaluation will occur in 1995-96. Child Support Review Office (Question No. 1867) Mr Ferguson asked the Assistant Treasurer, upon notice, on 8 December 1994: (1) What is the practice with respect to reduced Child Support Agency (CSA) payments from decisions made by the Child Support Review Office (CSRO) when the outcomes occur many months after the application was made. (2) What is the ratio of male to female child support review officers. (3) What measures are undertaken to ensure the impartiality of child support review officers. (4) How is a child support review officer's performance monitored. (5) In view of the substantial monetary gains or losses involved in the child support review process, how does the Government ensure the integrity of the CSA and CSRO. (6) Does a child support review officer have the power to make decisions that overrule or pre-empt decrees of the Family Law Court. (7) Is there an imbalance in the onus of proof for financial proof statements. (8) Is legal representation permitted at CSRO hearings.",88
168,Mr GEAR,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Review officers endeavour to ensure that their decisions do not create arrears for non-custodians or over-payments for custodians unless the circumstances of the case warrant such action. A review officer is required to determine that a departure from a child support assessment is just and equitable. This involves a consideration of the effect of the departure on the child, the custodian and the non-custodian. After a decision is made by the CSRO, the CSA amends the administrative assessmentto reflectthe decision. A majority of applications are finalised within three months of receipt of the application. This period is necessary to allow sufficienttime for the respondent to respond to the application, and the applicant to consider the respondent's response, before the hearing is held. (2) There are 39 CSRO officers. 12 are male and 27 are female. (3) Each review officer has been given guidelines which define the general parameters for review to ensure the appropriate approach is taken in review cases. These guidelines do not fetter the review officer's individual discretion. They are broad guidelines only. Review officers are expected to be knowledgeable in family law and the child support precedents established by the Family Law Court. Review officers are not involved in general CSA business. (4) The performance of review officers is the responsibility of the local CSA Director and the Principal Review Officer. A sample of determinations made by each review officer is reviewed for quality and consistency by Regional Review Officers, who report to the Principal Review Officer if necessary. Regional Review Officers are experienced review officers selected by the Principal Review Officer. (5) Since the start of the CSRO the overall monetary gain or loss to the Government as a result of the process has been negligible. This issue is being examined as part of an evaluation of CSRO arrangements being jointly conducted by the CSA, the Department of Finance and the Department of Social Security. The outcome of the evaluation will be available before the end of April 1995. (6) No. A review officer is unable to review those parts of an administrative assessment which have been altered by a court order. A review officer cannot overrule a decree. A review officer would not normally make a decision on a matter if the review officer is aware that the matter is before the court. However, the court will sometimes adjourn a matter to await the review officer's decision. (7) No. Both parties to a review are required to provide the information necessary for a review officer to make a decision. The applicant is required to make a case and the respondent is required to respond. There can be difficulties where the applicant is relying on information about the respondent's financial resources. However, both parties are required to satisfy the review officer of the accuracy of information. (8) No. To keep the review process simple and inexpensive, representation is not permitted. Review officers keep their determinations and explanations as simple as possible and avoid technical language. Review officers appreciate that many clients may not understand the relevant issues and attempt to ensure that all available facts are gathered. Pharmacy Restructuring Authority: Hilmer Report (Question No. 1887) Mr Vaile asked the Minister for Human Services and Health, upon notice, on 31 January 1995: Does the Government's commitment to the recommendations of the Hilmer report on national competition policy extend to the operation of the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority: if so, to what extent is the regulatory requirements that pharmacists must demonstrate that they are meeting a definite unmet public need consistent with that commitment.",93
169,Dr LAWRENCE,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Pharmacy Restructuring Authority (PRA) was established as a result of the Pharmacy Agreement which was signed on 6 December 1990. The PRA, (which pre-dates the Hilmer Report), administers Ministerial Guidelines which flowed from the 1990 Agreement. In the case of pharmacy, it is important to realise that the regulations of ownership and other controls such as product scheduling are the responsibility of the State and Territory Governments. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) is involved in the expenditure of taxpayer's money and as such has a duty to minimise the flow of funds while improving public health. The PBS is involved in protecting the general public from the high cost of essential drugs, and not about running chemist shops. The business of being a chemist is a commercial operation that is controlled by normal State law. The Commonwealth Government's involvement in the industry is to use the community pharmacy industry as a network to provide access for the Australian community to pharmaceutical benefits under the PBS. In this regard, the Government approves pharmacists to supply benefits. The controls over approvals, implemented through the PRA, have been very successful in providing a good network and ensuring an efficient supply of pharmaceutical benefits. For new approvals, the pharmacist is required to demonstrate the public need for another outlet for pharmaceutical benefits. Although I appreciatethatthe pharmacy industry is similar to other industries,it is also very different because the supply of medicines is limited to suitably trained people in order to encompass the public health protection requirement. I consider that the improvements in services and business efficiency produced by the work of the PRA are consistent with the Hilmer Report. The Hilmer Report has been considered in negotiations on the new Pharmacy Agreement. Trade Representations in the United States of America (Question No. 1910) Mr Latham asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 31 January 1995: (1) How many missions does the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade operate in the USA. (2) What was the (a) purpose and (b) cost of each mission referred to in part (1) in 1993-94. Mr Bilney-The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade operates three missions in the USA-namely, the Australian Emba:ssy in Washington, the Australian Mission to the UN in New York, and the Australian Consulate-General in New York. In addition, Austrade also manages Consulates-General in Houston, Los Angeles and San Francisco. (2) (a) The purpose of each mission referred to in part (1) and managed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is as follows: The Australian Embassy in Washington is responsible for representing a wide range of Australia's interests in the United States, ranging from political representation to provision of consular services. The Australian Mission to the UN in New York was established to facilitate Australia's representation in the United Nations Headquarters in New York. The Australian Consulate-Generalin New York is responsible for the provision of a full range of consular services to Australian citizens. The Consulate-General also represents a range of Australian interests within its Consular District. (b) The running costs of each mission in financial year 1993-94 were as follows: Washington New York (UN) New York (CG) Ministerial Conncil of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs: State Agreements (Question No. 1914) Mr Latham asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 31 January 1995: (1) On which issues and proposals has the Commonwealth sought the agreement of the States at the Ministerial Council of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs since 1991. (2) How long did each State take to respond in each case. (3) Was agreement eventually reached in each case; if not, why not. Mr Baldwin-The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: I am advised that: The issues detailed below are those put on the agenda at the Council's meetings by the Commonwealth for the purpose of seeking the States' agreement to a proposed course of action. In all cases but one the participants immediately agreed to the proposals. The exception is Agenda Item 6(i) at the Council Meeting of 1 March 1991, where all participants agreed to explore the issue further via a Ministerial Committee, and at the following meeting on 20 March 1992 all participants considered the report of that Committee and agreed not to pursue the issue further at that time.

Commonwealth-State Agreements (Question No. 1919) Mr Latham asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 31 January 1995: (1) On which issues and proposals has the Commonwealth sought the agreement of the States at the (a) Ministerial Council for Corporations, (b) Ministerial Council on Consumer Affairs, (c) Ministerial Council on the Administration of Justice, (d) AustralasianPolice Ministers' Council, (e) Corrective Services Ministers' Conference and (f) Standing Committee of Attorneys-Generalsince 1991. (2) How long did each State take to respond in each case. (3) Was agreement eventually reached in each case; if not, why not.",94
170,Mr LAVARCH,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Quite apart from the question of the extensive resources necessary to obtain the information sought, which I do not consider is warranted, it should be noted that, in general, the deliberations of Ministerial Councils are, unless all members agree otherwise, confidential. This principle was reaffirmed following a review of Ministerial Councils in 1993 by the Council of Australian Governments. In the absence of State and Territory agreement, this would preclude providing information of the kind sought by the honourable member. Moreover, Ministerial Councils differ in the nature of their work, procedures and frequency of meetings. The Standing Committee of Attorneys General, for example, meets three times a year and currently has over 55 matters on the Agenda. In Ministerial Councils that have a decision making role, including the preparation of Commonwealth, State and Territory legislation, issues and proposals of concern to the Commonwealth are not necessarily raised at the request of the Commonwealth. Where significant legislative proposals are involved, these may take several years to bring to fruition and it is often difficult to determine atwhat particular stage of the process a jurisdiction endorses the proposal. Indeed, in some cases changes in the membership of a Council may result in a different response by a jurisdiction during this process to one previously given. In other cases decisions can be made on a majority vote which may bind other jurisdictions. Thus, even if it were appropriate to provide the information sought by the honourable member, in many cases the way the issue arose, its nature and the process involved in of reaching a decision would not lend itself to a straightforward answer of the kind that appears to be contemplated by the question. Commonwealth-State Agreements (Question No. 1920) Mr Latham asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, upon notice, on 31 January 1995: (1) On which issues and proposals has the Commonwealth soughtthe agreement of the States at the (a) Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council, (b) Sport and Recreation Ministers' Council, (c) Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area Ministerial Council, (d) Wet Tropics Ministerial Council and (e) Willandra Lakes Region World Heritage Property Ministerial Council since 1991.

(3) Yes. Pathology Collection Centre Closures (Question No. 1932) Mr Nehl asked the Minister for Human Services and Health, upon notice, on 1 February 1995: (1) How many pathology collection centres have been closed in each federal electoral division since January 1993. (2) Where was each centre located.",97
172,Dr LAWRENCE,MINISTERIAL COUNCIL,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) A licensing scheme for pathology specimen collection centres was introduced from 1 February 1992, as part of a series of reforms announced in the 1991-92 Budget to achieve a more cost effective and efficient pathology industry. Under the scheme, all privately owned Approved Pathology Authorities (APAs) are required to hold a licence for each of their pathology specimen collection centres for Medicare benefits' payment purposes. Licences are issued for annual periods commencing 1 February. The number of centres licensed under the scheme and their location are influenced by a range of factors and these need to be borne in mind when considering the matter of centre closures since January 1993. Firstly, one of the stated aims of the scheme was to reduce the number of collection centres across Australia through the phasing out of temporary centres over the first two years and the introduction of a limit on the number of centres licensed in a year. These measures were in response to concerns that there were too many centres in Australia leading to inefficiencies and increased costs to Medicare and the community. In all, 603 temporary centres were closed under these arrangements with 315 closures occurring in the twelve months from 1 February 1993. Attachment A provides State/Territory details of these closures. Secondly, a set number of centres is licensed each year under the scheme. The number of centres licensed Australia-wide has been stable with 1121 centres licensed at 1 February 1994 and 1157 at 1 February 1995. These compare with 1049 permanent collection centres licensed under the scheme at 1 February 1993. Thirdly, the location of centres licensed under the scheme is decided by APAs based on commercial and other factors. During the annual licensing period, AP As may choose to close a centre completely or move a centre to another location. Data on the number for each of these categories is not available separately and, thus, it is not possible to provide details of centre closures under these arrangements. However,as AttachmentB indicates, the number of centres licensed by State/Territory has been relatively stable over the last three years suggesting that AP As do not close centres but rather relocate centres. In addition, a financial incentive has been incorporated in the scheme to encourage AP As to locate centres in particular areas and thus promote rural and remote Australians access to pathology specimen collection services. Under these arrangements, a licence can cover three centres for specified rural and remote areas. Finally, the licensing scheme is to be reviewed in 1.995 in the light of concerns about its efficiency and effectiveness in delivering collection services to the Australian community. The review will be undertaken as a joint effort with the pathology profession and industry through the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia and the Australian Association of Pathology Practices. The review will be completed to enable its results to be implemented from 1 February 1996. NA Temporary Centre Closures from 1 February 1993. The State/Territory breakdown for these closures is as follows: State 1992 NSW 106 VIC 73 QLD 66 WA 39 SA 2 TAS NT 1 ACT 1 TOTAL 288 NA Number of Licensed Collection Centres At 1 February State (a)1993 1994 NSW 401 VIC 237 QLD 213 WA 111 SA 55 TAS 13 NT 4 ACT 15 TOTAL 1049 1121 (a) Data for 1993 refers to permanent licensed collection centres. Child Support Deductions (Question No. 1938)  upon notice, on 2 February 1995: Are payers of child support via employer deduction penalised for late payments; if so, (a) what total sum is collected in penalties and (b) where the money used.",98
173,Mr GEAR,ATTACHMENT B,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Where an employer has deducted an amount for child support but has failed to remit that amount the Registrar on time, the employer is liable for a penalty. The penalty for the employer is composed of a flat rate of 20% of the amount unpaid, and an additional amount equivalentto 20% per annum on the child support and penalties that remain unpaid. The payer is not liable for any penalty in these circumstances. Where an employer has not made a deduction, for whateverreason, the payer remains responsible for the payment of child support to the Registrar. If the child support debt is not paid on time, the payer is liable for a penalty for late payment. That penalty is composed of a flat rate of 8% per annum 1993 Total of the amount of child support outstanding and an 119 225 additional amount equivalent to the Treasury note yield, taking the total late payment penalty to 69 142 approximately 16% per annum. This penalty is not 70 136 compounded. 51 90 (a) The Child Support Agency advises that 3 5 $1,105,534.61 was collected in late payment penalties for the 1993/94 financial year. The 2 3 Agency is unable to advise what part of this 1 2 amount was collected from payers subject to 315 603 employer deduction. (b) All monies collected as late payment penalties are paid into Consolidated Revenue. SBS Television Transmissions (Question No. 1942) 1995 Mr CAMERON asked the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 2 432 442 February 1995: 252 262 Is SBS TV being transmitted to areas within the 212 223 federal electoral divisions of (a) Richmond and (b) 129 135 Wide Bay; if so, (i) what (A) was the initial cost 58 60 and (B) is the annual cost of transmitting in each 17 17 division, (ii) why were the areas given preference 7 4 over other areas and (iii) who made the decision to extend coverage to the areas. 14 14 1157 Mr Lee--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) & (b) SBS television is scheduled to be broadcast from the Mt Nardi transmission facility to the RichmondlTweed coverage area, including the Federal electorates of Richmond and part of Page in 1995/96. Residents of Lismore, Ballina, Casino and Murwillumbah will be able to receive the service. It is also scheduled to be broadcast by June 1996 from the Mt Goonaneman transmission facility to the Wide Bay coverage area which contains parts of the Federal electorates of Wide is Bay, Hinkler and Fairfax. The major townships to receive the service are Bundaberg, Hervey Bay, Maryborough, Gympie, Tewantin, Noosa Heads, Nambour, Caloundra, and Maroochydore. (i) (A) The estimated capital cost of providing to the service is $1.82 million for the RichmondlTweed area and $3.03 million for Wide Bay. This includes the main transmitter and infill translators. (B) The estimated annual operating costs are $0.29 million for RichmondlTweed and $0.60 million for Wide Bay. This includes electricity costs and repairs and maintenance. (ii) The Government decided in the context of the 1994/95 Budgetto extend SBS television to the RichmondlTweed and Wide Bay areas as they are the two largest areas of Australia currently without terrestrial access to SBS television.

(3) Did the Comm,onwea1th subsequently sell any of the houses referred to in part (2); if so, in each case, (a) which house and (b) what profit or loss was made. (4) What is the (a) location and (b) value of each of the houses referred to in part (2) which are still owned by the Commonwealth. (5) With respectto each of the houses referred to in part (4), (a) under what authority (i) was the house purchased and (ii) is it retained, (b) what Department is responsible for retaining it and (c) under what program or sub-program is its retention funded. (6) Will he provide a list of the houses referred to in part (4) which are rented or leased out showing the (a) weekly income received and (b) costs of maintaining the house, including water rates, local authority fees, charges, taxes and other expenses.",107
190,Mr WALKER,ATTACHMENT B,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I am unable to provide a list as sought. While the Australian Valuation Office may have valued houses belonging to members of the Australian Public Service for subsequent acquisition by the Commonwealth, the specific purpose for which a requesting Department wishes to obtain a valuation is not recorded. (2)-(6). There is no central register of residential properties owned by the Commonwealth. The ownership of a house acquired from a member of the Australian Public Service would rest with the employee's Department and any receipts or expenditure relating to such a property would be included in that Department's estimates of revenue and expenditure. Australian International Airports (Question No. 2074) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 27 February 1995: On what dates (a) were decisions made to build the existing international airports at (i) Brisbane, (ii) Melbourne, (iii) Hobart, (iv) Adelaide and (v) Perth and (b) did each airport become operational.",108
191,Mr BRERETON,ATTACHMENT B,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: To answer this question adequately, it is necessary to combine parts (a) and (b) for each of the airports on which information is sought. The Federal Airports Corporation (F AC) has provided the following information: (i) Brisbane The decision on the site itself was made as a result of a joint Commonwealth/State Government and Brisbane City Council study in 1970171. The current international terminal opened in December 1975. The Government decided in December 1977 to proceed with building the new airport. An initial EIS was released on Stage 1 works in 1978 and the final EIS was released in July 1979. The Government approved the initial works in July 1979, subject to submission to the Parliamentary Public Works Committee (PWC). The PWC hearing was held in October 1979. The completed new international airport opened on 19 March 1988. (ii) Melbourne The Government decided in May 1959 to develop Tullamarine and land was subsequently acquired. The airport opened for international operations in July 1970. (iii) Hobart The decision to build the new airport was made in the 1947/48 financial year. The airport opened for operations on 23 June 1958. The first international flight in December 1980 operated from the existing domestic terminal. The first international terminal opened on 3 June 1983, at the same site as the current international terminal. (iv) Adelaide The 1939 policy announcement by the Commonwealth Government to provide an additional airport for all capital cities resulted in the January 1946 acquisition ofland for the new airport. Work commenced on the site in September 1947. The airport opened for operations on 17 February 1955. International activity was initially limited to diversions as an alternative to Sydney and Melbourne Airports. Following a joint Federal/State agreement in 1982, work commenced on an international terminal. The dedicated international passengerterminal opened for operations in November 1982. (v) Perth The Government acquired the land on which Perth Airport is sited for civil aviation purposes in 1938, however shortly after acquisition WWII commenced and the airport was developed for RAAF purposes. Due to a continuing but declining military function, over time the buildings erected by the RAAF were converted for use as airline hangars, terminal buildings and for administrative purposes. The first civil aircraft to use Perth Airport departed in May 1944. The first international flight was by Qantas (then QEA) to Ceylon on 17 June 1944. Tourists: Full Time Tertiary Studies (Question No. 2075) Mr Ferguson asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 27 February 1995: Further to the answer to question No. 1218 (Hansard,30 June 1994, page 2569) concerning tourists undertaking full-time tertiary studies in Australia, what additional measures to those identified in the answer are being used in response to the majority of universities indicating that they lack the staff to check the residency status of student applications. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: As noted in my answer to question No. 1218, there is an onus on higher education institutions to ensure that students are enrolled according to their correct status. This responsibility stems from the funding arrangements for higher education contained in the Higher Education Funding Act 1988. Under these arrangements,higher education institutions are granted financial assistance in return for agreeing to meet a number of conditions set by the Commonwealth. DEET reminded all higher education institutions of this responsibility in writing in May last year. DEET also provides higher education institutions with information about the Commonwealth's visa and entry permit classifications to enable them to fulfil this responsibility. Higher education institutions have not informed my Department that resource constraints prevent them from meeting this obligation. However, my Department will raise again with institutions their obligation to ensure students are enrolled correctly and seek confirmation of their procedures to ensure that this obligation is met. Students also have legal obligations when enrolling at higher education institutions. All students must complete a Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS) Payment Options Form, indicating the status in which they are applying for enrolment. The HECS Payment Options Form includes a declaration by the student that the information provided is complete and correct. The Form also contains a warning about penalties under Commonwealth law for deliberately making a false or misleading statement. Australian Embassy, Washington (Question No. 2076) Mr Tim Fischer asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 27 February 1995: (1) During what periods in 1994 was a charge d'affaires in charge of the Australian Embassy in Washington in the absence of the Ambassador. (2) How many requests from the (a) Australian media and (b) US media for media interviews of the Ambassadorwere made in 1994 and how many were granted. (3) Did the Embassy formulate a prediction of the outcome of the November 1994 US Congressional elections and relay it to Canberra; if not, why not. (4) What was the staffing level at the Embassy at 1 January 1995. (5) How many Embassy staff, excluding the Ambassador and political reporting staff, occupy trade related positions. Mr Bilney-The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1 ) The Embassy was headed by a charge d'affaires in 1994 during the periods of 4-11 March, 20-28 August, 10-20 November and 10-17 December. (2) The Ambassador has been in regular contact with the US and Australian media including discussions with editorial boards and specific interviews with a range of print, radio and television reporters. In 1994, the Ambassador also gave a number of public speeches in the US and Australia, some of which received media coverage. On the basis of Embassy records for 1994 the Ambassador (a) granted 15 interviews to the Australian media and; (b) 15 interviews to the US media. The Embassy does not keep a record of interviews requested but not granted. (3) The Embassy provided extensive reporting during the lead up to the 1994 Congressional and Gubematorial elections covering the likelihood of a strong swing to the Republican Party in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. The reports included the views of US politicians, party officials, leading pollsters and political analysts. (4) As at 1 January 1995, the Embassy had 108 A-based officers, incorporating 52 from the Department of Defence, 36 from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and 20 from other government agencies. The Embassy also employs 198 contract or permanent locally-engaged officers. (5) The Trade Branch of the Embassy comprises 14 officers, of whom six are Australian-based. Austrade have a staff of 5 of whom 1 is Australia1990-91 1991-92 1992-93 1993-94 1994-95 Two factors mean that the funding for 1994-95 is lower than in previous years, particularly when compared to 1992-93 and 1993-94. First, up to December 1994 Skillshare grants were paid on a calendar year basis with 7112 paid in the first half of the year (January-June) and 5/12 paid in the second half (July-December). The level of funding in 1994-95 comprises the remainder of the 1994 funding (5/12 for July-December 1994) and 6 months transitional funding for the period based. Other officers in the Congressional Liaison and Public Affairs Branch of the Embassy, along with the Deputy Chief of Mission, are also heavily involved in advancing Australia's trade interests. Skillsbare Group Funding (Question No. 2077) Mr Slipper asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 27 February 1995: (1) What loans, grants or other funds did the Commonwealth provide to each Skillshare group situated within the redistributed electorates of (a) Fisher and (b) Longman in (i) 1990-91, (ii) 199192, (iii) 1992-93, (iv) 1993-94 and (v) 1994-95. (2) For what project was each funding provision made. (3) What accountability measures apply to the funding provisions. (4) Are the Skills hare groups allowed to operate commercial businesses; if so, (a) on what basis, (b) do the businesses compete with private enterprise on an unfair basis and (c) what commercial businesses were operated by Skillshare groups within the redistributed electorates of (i) Fisher and (ii) Longman in (A) 1990-91, (B) 1991-92, (C) 199293, (D) 1993-94 and (E) 1994-95. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Three Skillshare projects, Caloundra, Pine Rivers and Caboolture, are located in the redistributed electorates of Fisher and Longman. The following grants were provided to these projects in the period 1990-91 to 1994-95. Caloundra Pine Rivers Caboolture Skillshare Skillshare Skillshare $ $ $ 183,334 131,667 159,584 209,234 179,934 218,750 286,469 176,849 292,264 331,847 207,400 320,752 206,251 133,693 219,584 January-June 1995 as the Program moves to a financial year basis. Second, the provision of capital funding, in addition to recurrent grants, in 1992-93 and 199394 resulted in some Skillshare projects receiving additional one-off funding in those years. (2) Commonwealth labour market program (LMP) funding, including Skills hare funding, is to help long-term unemployed people and people at 'high risk' of becoming long term unemployed to get a job or go on to further education or training .. (3) The Contract between each Sponsor and the Commonwealth specifies the terms and conditions applying to the Skillshare grant. Sponsors are required to spend the grant in accordance with the purposes specified iil the Contract. At the conclusion of the grant period, each Sponsor is required to submit an Audit Statement certified by an independent Registered Company Auditor. (4) Yes. (a) Sponsors can undertake activities beyond those funded under the Skillshare Program. However, the Commonwealth does not necessarily know the extent of such activities. A number of Sponsors receive Skillshare funding to undertake business ventures (known as Enterprise Activities) to assist Skillshare clients into jobs through training or work experience in a realistic commercial environment. However, the Program guidelines specify that all Enterprise Activities should be commercially viable (ie total financial independence from Skillshare funding) within a maximum of two years. Any funding beyond the second year must be agreed to by the Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET) Area Manager in the Area. (b) Approval of Enterprise Activity funding is conditional on the acceptance of a business plan which includes details of the proposed Enterprise Activity objectives, product/service, budget, marketing strategies and performance indicators. The plan must address the question of competition and, before approving Enterprise Activity funding, the DEET Area Manager must be satisfied that the proposal does not create an unfair advantage over possible competitors. (c) As indicated in 4(a) above, the Commonwealth does not necessarily know the extent of Sponsors' involvement in non-Skillshare funded activities except where they provide training and/or employment related services under other labour market programs. (A), (B), (C), (D) and (E). The Pine Rivers Skillshare project received no Enterprise Activity funds in the period 1990-91 to 1994-95. The Caloundra Skillshare project conducted a catering facility with Enterprise Activity funding assistance in 1990-91 and 1991-92. This facility has ceased operation. The Caboolture Skillshare project started a garden furniture manufacturing business in 199091 with Enterprise Activity funding assistance for two years. I understand that this venture continues to operate but without Enterprise Activity funding assistance. Australian GaIIipoli Veterans Representatives (Question No. 2081)",108

196,Mr CONNOLLY,ATTACHMENT B,"the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 28 February 1995: Was the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) commissioned to conduct noise monitoring at Badgerys Creek Airport; if so, (a) why, (b) what brief was given to the CAA and (c) what were the results.",115
197,Mr BRERETON,ATTACHMENT B,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Yes. Following the Government's 1989 decision to commence the development of the second Sydney airport at Badgerys Creek, the CAA was commissioned by the Department of Transport in 1991 to undertake a noise monitoring program for the new airport. (a) The program was establish-d in compliance with one of the recommendations made by the Minister responsible for the environment following the final Environmental Impact Statement on the site selection program for a second Sydney airport. The particular recommendation stated that a noise monitoring program should be established to: provide baseline data on ambient noise levels, prior to the establishment of an airport, and identify areas where aircraft noise may become a problem during the operation of an airport, enable the weightings given to night-time operations to be kept under review, and assist future airport design and management. (b) The CAA was briefed to collect the required noise levels by means of three additional fixed Noise Monitoring Terminals (NMTs) connected to the Sydney Airport Noise and Flight Path Monitoring System. The three NMTs were installed on and near the airport site and became operational in early 1992. (c) The results have been and continue to be a long-term record of the ambient noise levels at the sites of the three NMTs. Austudy Payments (Question No. 2105) Mr Hawker asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 2 March 1995: What was the average Austudy payment per capita in each federal electoral division in (a) 199091, (b) 1991-92, (c) 1992-93 and (d) 1993-94. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable Airport member's question is as follows: (1 ) Average Austudy payments in each federal electoral division for 1993 and 1994 follow. The average Austudy payments have been calculated by dividing total Austudy expenditure by the total number of students with home addresses in the particular electorate who received an Austudy payment during the period.

Veterans' Review Board (Question No. 2110)",115
198,Mr CAMERON,AUSTUDY,"the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 2 March (1) What (a) number and (b) percentage of to the Veterans' Review Board in each in (i) 1993 and (ii) 1994 resulted in (A) a of his Department being upheld and (B) an outcome different from his Department's decision. (2) Are unemployable persons who served in receiving service pension and war pension payments at levels below 70 per cent of the full war pension entitlement. (3) Will persons who were subjected to signifiphysical stress as combatants in Vietnam be denied access to higher rates of war pension than recommended in the judgments relating to the Bowman v. Repatriation Commission case. Mr Sciacca-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: 1992-93 NSW 564 Vic 527 Qld 812 SA 195 WA 360 Tas 45 Total 2503 1993-94 NSW 792 Vic 562 Qld 780 SA 221 WA 381 Tas 89 Total 2825 (2) Yes. There are veterans who are permanently incapacitated for work receiving an invalidity service pension under Section 37(1) of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 who also receive a disability pension at less than 70% of the General Rate including some who receive no disability pension. The effects of all disabilities are considered for an invalidity service pension but only accepted war caused conditions are assessed for disability pensions. (3) No. Veterans of the Vietnam war, who have incapacity as a result of injuries or diseases accepted as being war caused, are eligible for a disability pension in accordance with the level of that incapacity. That level is determined by application of the Guide to the Assessment of Rates of Veterans' Pensions as legislated at s.29 of the Act. Pensions higher than the General Rate are determined according to criteria set out at sections 22, 23 and 24 of the Act. The decision in the 1981 Bowman case (34ALR556) discusses, inter alia, the considerations that are to be taken into account in determining eligibility for those higher rates of pension where a veteran's work capacity is under examination (Le. Intermediate of Special Rate). Those considerations, set out since 22 May 1986 at s.28 of the Act, are a continuation of the provisions of Schedule 2 of the Repatriation Act 1920.

(2) Will Australia be represented at the conference. Mr BHney-The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The Italian Government has convened a diplomatic conference to consider the adoption of the draft Unidroit Convention on the International Return of Stolen or Illegally Exported Cultural Objects, which will be held in Rome, Italy on the premises of the Italian Ministry of Culture at the Complesso Monumentale del San Michele a Ripa, from 7 to 24 June 1995. (2) No decision has yet been made but it is anticipated that Australia will be represented at the diplomatic conference. Human Rights: Indonesia (Question No. 2119) Mr Abbott asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 2 March 1995: (1) Has the Government expressed its continuing concern at human rights violations in Indonesia; if so, how. (2) Has the Government received guarantees that Indonesian military personnel trained in Australia will not be used in internal security roles; if what guarantees. (3) How will the Government ensure that strongwith er bonds with Indonesia are compatible with likely Australia's support for human rights. Mr Bilney-The Minister for Foreign that Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes. The Government regularly raises a range of human rights concerns with the Indonesian Government, in the context of our constructive dialogue on these issues. Over the last six months, the Government has raised a number of human rights issues apart from East Timor. These include, for instance, the gaoling of an independent trade union leader; the possible effect of a draft Presidenamong tial decree regulating NGOs; the closure of three magazines and reported extrajudicial killings of of suspected criminals in the lead-up APEC meeting. These concerns have been raised through representations at Ministerial and diplomatic levels and in public statements. In addition, the Government supported a consensus statement made on 8 March by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, which expressed concern about the human rights situation in East Timor. The Govern the ment will continue to pursue its human rights March 1995: concerns in the region through public statements; bilateral representations on specific human rights issues; assistance, where requested, in the building of human rights institutions, including encouraging the ratification of international human rights conventions and cooperation with United Nations human rights mechanisms and encouraging positive human rights trends within the region. Most recently, I expressed the Government's concerns about human rights, and in particular the deteriorating situation in East Timor, during meeting with the Indonesian Foreign Minister Jakarta on 21 February this year. The Australian Am bassador to Indonesia reiterated Government's concern at the situation in East Timor to the Indonesian authorities during his to that province from 9-14 March. (2) The deployment and conduct of foreign military personnel on return to their home after training in Australia are the responsibilities of their governments. Foreign military personnel attending courses in Australia generally undertake the same training as Australian Defence Force (ADF) personnel. ADF training provided to the Indonesian Armed Forces is directed towards the development of professional military skills. We do not provide training to Indonesian military personnel which is related to the internal security function of the Indonesian Armed Forces. (3) The Government believes that a more substantial relationship with Indonesia will, in general, so, mean that we can pursue our specific objectives, including human rights objectives, more successfully. Simply put, if we have a strong relationship a Government on a range of issues it is more to listen to our concerns on sensitive issues such as human rights. The Government believes this consistent approach has contributed to improvements in the human rights situation in Indonesia-in the observance of human rights in individual cases, human rights education and building institutions to protect rights. It has also led, for instance, to the Indonesian Government inviting the participation of Australia's then Human Rights Commissioner, Mr Brian Burdekin, to a National Human Rights workshop in August 1994. At this meeting the Indonesian Government and the United Nations Centre for Human Rights agreed, other things, to develop a National Action Plan for Human Rights in Indonesia-the concept national action plans was, in fact, an initiative of to the Bogor the Australian Government. North Head and Middle Head, Sydney, NSW (Question No. 2120) Mr Abbott asked the Minister representing Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 2 (1) How many military personnel (a) live and (b) work at defence establishments at North Head and in Indonesia; Middle Head in Sydney. (2) Will implementation of the Defending Australia White Paper presented to the House on 9 December 1994 result in defence establishments at North Head or Middle Head being relocated. (3) Will the (a) School of Artillery remain at a North Head and (b) Headquarters Training Comin mand and HMAS Penguin remain at Middle Head. (4) How many jobs would be transferred if the the establishments were relocated. (5) Will the Government sell land occupied by visit defence establishments at North Head or Middle Head: if so (a) what sum is expected to be raised and (b) is that sum based on selling the land for countries high or medium density development. (6) Have environmental studies been conducted of the sites of the defence establishments at North Head or Middle Head: if so, has dumping of military waste been revealed.  provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) (a) North Head-52 military personnel live on Defence establishments; 151 military personnel work at Defence establishments (b) Middle H-225 military personnel live on Defence establishments; 677 military personnel work at Defence establishments In addition to the 677 military personnel working at Middle Head there are some 150 trainees both serving and accommodated at HMAS Penguin. (2) No. The proposed relocation of military establishments from North Head and Middle Head is not the result of the 1994 Defence White Paper Defending Australia but is related to the Sydney Harbour Foreshores Agreement and a desire to provide modem facilities. In the case of the School of Artillery, the move will also colocation of the school with a larger training area and allow more efficient training to be conducted. (3) (a) No. It is planned that the School of Artillery will move out of Middle Head no later than 2000. (b) It is anticipated that Headquarters Training Command will move within the next 5 to 10 years. Its future location has not been determined. A study is currently being conducted on the future of HMAS Penguin. It is due for completion late 1995. (4) It is anticipated that all positions would be transferred. At present there are 828 military and 269 civilian personnel employed at the Defence establishments at North Head and Middle Head. (5) No final decisions have been made in relation to land occupied by Defence at North Head or part Middle Head. As there has been no decision there are no estimates of revenue. When land is no longer required for Defence or other Commonwealth Government purposes, the Government's policy is to sell the land on the open market at market value. That process would involve consultacontribute tion with state and local planning authorities. (6) Environmental studies have been carried of both North Head and Middle Head as follows: matter, (1) Army Establishments Pollution Audit, NSW 1991 by Connell Wagner Consulting Engineers. This report details the findings of the Army Pollution Audit for NSW and presents actions required for pollution control and management; and (2) Georges Heights Bushland Survey and Regeneration Plan, National Trust 1992. This report details the type and condition tion of the site and details management considerations for the area. There are no Defence records indicating dumping of military waste at either site. South Australian Level Crossing Committee (Question No. 2124) Mr Wakelin asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 2 March 1995: (1) Has his attention been drawn to the fact that (a) road and rail traffic through the level crossing at Warnertown, SA, exceeds the standard criterion for the installation of flashing lights and (b) the SA Level Crossing Committee has recommended that flashing lights be installed at the crossing. (2) Did he refuse an application by Australian National to provide $130,000 for the installation of flashing lights at the crossing in a letter dated 10 September 1994. (3) What action will he take to facilitate the enable the installation of the lights.",117
199,Mr BRERETON,AUSTUDY,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1)(a) and (b) Yes. (2) In a letter dated 10 September 1994, Australian National requested that certain savings achieved under the One Nation rail program be allocated to the Warnertown level crossing. As with all large programs with a wide range of separate investments, One Nation has had some projects which came in under initial estimates and some which .exceeded initial estimates. Consistentwith standard practice, savings in one area of the program were reallocated to other priorities associated with the One Nation standardisation program, in this case in South Australia Wamertown level crossing was not of the One Nation program, therefore it did not to sell have first call on these funds. (3) The provision of protection at level crossings is normally undertaken by SA Government authfull orities. However, in this case, AN offered to one-third of the cost of upgraded level crossing protection if the SA Department of Transport and local councils provided the rest. This out offer, which went beyond AN's obligations on the was rejected. Accordingly, further resolution of the matter is the responsibility of SA authorities. Submarines: Waste Disposal (Question No. 2131)",120
200,Mr CONNOLLY,AUSTUDY,"the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on of the natural vegeta6 March 1995: (1) Is it a fact that Oberon Class submarines at s\!a dispose of intractable waste in cloth bags. (2) Is the waste known as gash. (3) When the submarine is submerged is gash expelled through a special tube known as a gash ejector. (4) When the submarine is surfaced is gash thrown over the side. (5) Will the Collins Class submarines use the same technique. (6) Do other RAN vessels throw intractable waste overboard.  provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Oberon Class submarines at sea do dispose of waste in cloth bags. The disposal of garbage at sea is dictated by a number of factors, including operational and habitability considerations. If garbage in the submarine reaches excessive levels, habitability requirements for the crew necessitate disposal. This is effected when submerged by the use of the garbage ejector and when surfaced from the bridge. The submarine's program and movements are considered when disposing of garbage. Garbage is stored for disposal ashore if the program and habitability constraints permit. During this period, garbage will be stored in the accommodation space hatch area. The location of the submarine is a further consideration, with the prohibited areas being rigorously observed. . Garbage disposai places certain operational limitations on a submarine with respect to disclosure of its presence. All submariners are indoctrinated from initial training in the need to reduce garbage and to avoid the inclusion of oily waste in garbage. In addition, bagged garbage is to be subjected to water pressure prior to discharge to ensure that all expelled garbage sinks immediately. Royal Australian Navy (RAN) submarines generate minimal plastic waste, the disposal of which is prohibited under the international policy. This plastic is retained in the submarine for discharge ashore. (2) Gash is a traditional naval term defined ""remnants of a meal; leavings or pickings"". Within the RAN, gash is the accepted term for all manner of waste. (3) Oberon class submarines are fitted with a gash ejector to discharge bagged garbage from the submarine. The procedures for use of the garbage ejector ensure that all garbage immediately sinks. (4) When the submarine is surfaced, garbage is discharged from the bridge. The garbage remains bagged and, with the exception of being subjected to pressure, fulfils the same criteria as for expelling garbage when submerged. The garbage is weighted such that the bag sinks. For operational and environmental reasons, loose garbage is not discharged. If the submarine is on surface passage through an area where garbage cannot be djscharged (e.g. Great Barrier Reef), bagged garbage is often stored in the fin as a temporary holding measure. (5) Collins class submarines are fitted with similar arrangements to those found in the Oberon class. Collins class are subject to the same restrictions as Oberon class submarines in this matter. (6) The increased availability of space on a RAN surface vessel, compared to a submarine, enables them to carry garbage 'hoppers' in which waste is its stored prior to arrival in port. Commonwealth Employees (Question No. 2161) Mr Campbell asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 7 March 1995: (1) How many persons are employed by the Commonwealth in (a) road, (b) air and (c) sea transport. (2) How many persons employed by the Commonwealth in (a) road, (b) air and (c) sea transport occupy each grade, level or classification. (3) What is the annual cost in (a) salaries and (b) administration of persons employed by the Commonwealth in (i) road, (ii) air and (iii) sea transport.",120
201,Mr BRERETON,AUSTUDY,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The following information is provided for the Department of Transport only and excludes corporate and research staff. I am not prepared to apply resources to collect information from other Commonwealth and portfolio agencies. (1) (a) 184 (b) 212 (c) 60 (2) Staff in the Department of Transport by classification/level and functional areas at 31 December 1994: ClassificationlLevel Aboriginal Cadet Air Safety Investigator Level 1 Air Safety Investigator Level 2 Air Safety Investigator Level 3 Air Safety Investigator Level 4 Administrative Service Officer Class 1 Administrative Service Officer Class 2 Administrative Service Officer Class 3 Administrative Service Officer Class 4 Administrative Service Officer Class 5 Administrative Service Officer Class 6 Information Technology Officer Grade Professional Officer Grade 2 Senior Executive Service Band 1 Senior Executive Service Band 2 Senior Information Technology Officer Senior Information Technology Officer Senior Officer Grade A Senior Officer Grade B Senior Officer Grade C Senior Professional Officer Grade A Senior Professional Officer Grade A Senior Professional Officer Grade B Senior Professional Officer Grade C Senior Research Officer Grade 1 Technical Officer Grade 2 Technical Officer Grade 3 Technical Officer Grade 4 These figures from the personnel recording system reflect a counting of staff in acting positions at 31 December 1994 as well as the substantive occupants who are on leave.

(3) Has her Department investigated whether APMA 's campaign contravenes the Trade Practices Act; if so, what action is proposed as an outcome of the investigation. (4) Did she inform the House on 7 February 1995 that APMA's campaign undermines the rights of consumers; if so, does she maintain that position. (5) Does brand substitution result in an average saving of $1.40 per prescription; if so, will she continue to defend the availability of that saving. (6) Has the Government undertaken an information program to inform consumers of their right of access to low cost prescription drugs; if so, what is the status of that program.",121
202,Dr LAWRENCE,AUSTUDY,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The APMA, in a circular to its members on 7 September 1994, advised that free advertising support (approximately $850,000-$1,000,000) had been offered by publishers of all key medical tabloids and journals and pharmacy tabloids and journals, for the next twelve months. The purpose of the free advertising is to encourage doctors to - outinely prescribe original brand products. This action is considered to be against the spirit and intention of the Government's policy on brand substitution. On 7 February 1995 I served notice in the House that if the APMA' s campaign persisted, the Government would take further action. The Department of Human Services and Health has been closely monitoring the campaign and has raised concerns with the APMA and the Trade Practices Commission where it felt aspects are in contravention of the Industry's Code of Ethics or the Trade Practices Act. (2) The APMA, expecting a delay in the production and issue of new prescription pads containing a box for choosing whether or not to recommend brand substitution, has issued doctors with selfinking stamps bearing the message ""Brand substitution not permitted"". In the House on 7 February 1995, I served notice on the APMA that, if the campaign results in doctors misusing their veto powers, new prescription pads, which would have made it easier for doctors to simply tick a box to indicate that they did not want the drugs interchanged, would not be issued and the use of rubber stamps would be outlawed. (3) The Department has written to the Trade Practices Commission seeking advice on whether the APMA campaign is in breach of Part IV of the Trade Practices Act 1974. To date no reply has been received. (4) Yes, I did inform the House on 7 February 1995 that the APMA's campaign against brand substitution was trying to encourage the medical profession not to use its clinical judgement about whether there is a good reason not to have brand substitution for a particular patient, but to veto automatically, apparently in order to support the commercial interests of APMA members. I believe that it is not sufficient to accept that the doctors' and the industry'S interests outweigh those of the patient. My opinion is firm on this matter. (5) It is calculated that, on average, brand substitution will result in a saving to the patient in the order of $1.40 per prescription. The legislation relating to brand substitution was introduced as a cost saving measure for all Australians and as a consumer's right to choose and the Government will continue to defend it. (6) The Department is currently developing an information campaign on a range of Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme issues. A major priority for this campaign will be informing consumers of their right of access to low cost prescription medicines. It is anticipated that the campaign will be underway by mid-1995. Moreover, the Consumers Health Forum has received a grant from the Departmentto raise awareness among consumers on pharmaceutical issues. Some of this money is bei-ng used to specifically raise awareness of brand substitution. Single Income Family Payments (Question No. 2166)",122
203,Mr CAMERON,AUSTUDY,"the Minister for Human Services and Health, upon notice, on 8 . March 1995: (1) Did she recently state that the total sum directed by the Government to single income families was four times that paid to double income families; if so, (a) why, when and where did she make the statement, (b) what was the source of the figures on which the statement was based and (c) will she provide a breakdown of the figures. (2) Does she recognise as work the child care performed by mothers. (3) Is the expense incurred by parents, usually women, who relinquish their income in order to care for their children considered a work related expense; if not, why not. (4) Is the child care cash rebate (a) conferred in recognition oflegitimate work related expenses and (b) treated within the tax system as a work related expense; if not, why not. (5) Have Government policies been detrimental to the status of women who nurture their children at home by making those women appear to be welfare recipients if they receive the home child care allowance. (6) What action will she and the Government take to improve the social and economic status of women who care for their children at home.",123
204,Dr LAWRENCE,AUSTUDY,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. (2) Yes. (3) Only direct child care costs incurred in working, studying, training and looking for work are considered a work related expense. (4)(a) & (b) The Childcare Cash Rebate recognises that child care costs, like many other costs associated with employment, are a legitimate work related expense. (5) The receipt of Home Child Care Allowance is not detrimental to the status of women who stay at home to look after their children. Home Child Care Allowance has been introduced by the Government in recognition of the important contribution made by partners who remain substantially out of the workforce to care for their children. Issues of equity and justice were central to the Government's decision to introduce the Home Child Care Allowance. An estimated 55,000 low income families who received little benefit from the Dependent Spouse Rebate are able to receive up to $61 a fortnight under the Home Child Care Allowance. The Home Child Care Allowance is only one of several payments available through the social securitY system which assist families. In the vast majority of cases, people eligible for Home Child Care Allowance would already be re-eiving some other form of assistance from the Departnient of Social Security. For example, Basic Family Payment is paid in respect of over 3.5 million children and is received by most Australian families. Further, payment of Home Child Care Allowance through the social security system allows the payment to be directed to the primary care giver, usually the mother. This policy advances the status of women and is a significant improvement over providing a rebate through· the taxation system which directs the payment to the primary wage earner, usually the father. In addition, the payment of the Home Child Care Allowance through the social security system is more responsive to changes in a person's financial circumstances, so that the assistance is available when it is needed. For example, when a woman ce-ses work as a result of the birth of her child, financial circumstances will have changed and she will be eligible to claim Home Child Care Allowance immediately. (6) A major new initiative, the Parenting Allowance, will commence on 1 July 1995. The Parenting Allowance is a non-activity tested payment for families, which is available to either member of a couple who is caring for children, although this is most often the woman. The allowance will be available to partners of income support recipients and low income earners who have dependent children under 16. It will incorporate, and go beyond, the Home Child Care Allowance. A feature of the new allowance is that low income families· will have a greater degree of choice about whether one partner will stay at home and care for their children; a choice generally available up to now only to those on higher incomes. Around 117,000 low-income families are expected to gain around $59 a week from Parenting Allowance. At the same time, the entitlement of most higher income families to the basic parenting allowance component that is currently Home Child Care Allowance will be maintained. The Parenting Allowance initiative will give the partner caring for the children an independent source of income, recognising still further the valuable work of the child carer at home.

211,Mr CONNOLLY,AUSTUDY,"the Minister for Embasis ployment, Education and Training, upon precise notice, on 9 March 1995: Did his Department recently tender for and acquire substantial quantities on a rental, non-purchase basis; if so, (a) Did the purchasing procedures and contractual arrangements conform with the Department Administrative Services' purchasing guidelines; if not, how did they differ, (b) What were the precise terms of the contract, (c) Did the Department agree to non-contract serviCing of the machinery or other non-contract items, (d) Did the Department's acquisition of machinery duplicate purchasing services offered the Department of Administrative Services; if why were the latter Department's services not (e) Were photocopiers amortised on a purely rental basis based on cost per copy; if so, (i) what period and (ii) based on what cost per copy, (f) What was the (i) number, (ii) type of machinery purchased from each supplier under the contract, (g) Does the Department of Administrative Services maintain a list of recommended machiconsumables nery; if so, what (i) number, (ii) value and (iii) type of the machinery acquired did not conform with the list, (h) When was the need for machinery identified, (i) When and where were tenders called for, (j) Will he provide a copy of the request tender, (k) What was the closing date for tenders, (I) When were suppliers chosen, (m) When did equipment from each supplier begin to be delivered to his Department, (n) Was equipment delivered immediately after tenders (a) were called for or (b) closed; if so (i) what equipment and (ii) how was it paid for, and (0) Who owns the machinery at the end of the rental period. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: My department tendered for and obtained 1273 new and refurbished convenience photocopiers a non-purchase basis. The agreement with the supplier is classified as an operating lease based a click charge or cost per copy. (a) All purchasing procedures and contractual arrangements conformed with the Department of Administrative Services' purchasing guidelines. (b) Given that the contract was accepted on the that its content would be kept confidential, the terms of the contract cannot be disclosed. However, the draft terms and conditions of contract used as the base for negotiations with Canon Australia were contained in the Request for Tender of office machinery documentation. (c) The contract provides for all servicing of the machinery and no other non-contract items were of agreed by the department. (d) There was no duplication of purchasing services as the Department of Administrative Services (DAS) does not provide a common use contract for the supply of click charge (or cost per copy) photocopying services. The Department understands that DAS will issue such a contract in the the near future. Members of the Department's by procurement team have provided some advice to so, DAS on the development of a common use click used, charge contract and to other agencies who are developing their own request for tenders at present. The draft terms and conditions of contract prepared over for the DEET Request for Tender have been provided to DAS to assist in preparing a click cost and (iii) charge Common Use Contract. (e) Copiers provided under the contract are not rented. Under the operating lease the contractor amortises the capital cost of the equipment, and maintenance in the cost per copy. (i) The contract is for a period of five years. (ii) Disclosure of this information would unreasonably affect the commercial, business or financial affairs of the company concerned. However, the accepted cost per copy was the lowest of those for tendered and the whole offer made by Canon Australia represented the best value for money for the Department. (f) There is only one supplier under the contract. (i) 923 new copiers and 350 refurbished copiers were provided by Canon Australia The Department pays for each copy produced on the equipment. No equipment has been purchased under the contract. (ii) The cost of the equipment is amortised over a Guaranteed Minimum Number of photocopies and the contractor is paid on the basis of copies produced. The $13,950,000 figure notified in the ""Commonwealth Purchasing and Disposals Gazette"" is the amount the Department is committed to pay in return for the provision of national photocopying services for a period of five years. Under the terms on and conditions of the contract, any photocopies produced by DEET above 60 million copies per on annum will be charged at approximately one cent each. (iii) Three models of new Canon copiers were provided to the department-the 30 copies per minute (cpm) NP6030, the 50 cpm NP6650ii and the 60 cpm NP6060, as well as refurbished copiers to be used as contingency equipment and to provide some limited photocopying facilities to DEET clients. (g) DAS has not yet released its common use contract for click charge type lease agreements and no list of suppliers or copiers available under such an agreement exists at this time. The current DAS common use contract Buyers Guide BG99 lists photocopiers currently available for purchase and rental (not click charge type lease). The copiers provided by Canon do not appear on this list. However, that common use contract states that the overriding consideration in selection of copiers should be to obtain a copier that suits the needs of the user. All copiers selected by the Department were considered to be those best suited to the department's needs. The NP6030, which incorporates new technology and comprises over half of the new equipment provided under the contract, was not released when Buyers Guide BG99 was issued. (h) The Department examined its use of photocopying facilities over the period June 1993 to March 1994. After examining all available options, it was determined that disposal of existing copiers and the introduction of a national click charge agreement would result in increased efficiency and economy. The Department believes that substantial savings will be realised through the introduction of the national photocopier contract. (i) Tenders were called on 27 June 1994 by advertisement in national newspapers and in the ""Commonwealth of Australia Purchasing and Disposals Gazette."" Copies of the request for tender document were available on request from that date. CD A copy of the request for tender will be forwarded to your office. (k) Tenders closed at 4.30 pm on Friday 29 July 1994. (I) A shortlist of three companies was determined on 1 November 1994. Canon AustraliaPty Ltd was chosen as the sole supplier on 30 November 1994. The contract was signed on 21 December 1994. (m) Canon Australia commenced delivery of equipment under the contract on 24 January 1995, (n) No equipment was delivered immediately after tenders were called for or closed. (0) Canon Australia will retain ownership of the copiers at the end of the contract period. The Department does, however, have the option to extend the lease on a month to month basis or to acquire some or all of the copiers at the end of the contract period. Department of Employment, Education and Training: Review of National Office (Question No. 2198) Mr Connolly 'asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 9 March 1994: Have Ernst and Young been commissioned to conduct a review of his Department's national office; if so, (a) at what cost and (b) will he provide a copy of the·review. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: No. My Department is undertaking an internal review of the functions and resources of National Office. It has contracted Ernst and Young to provide technical assistanceduring the initial stages of the review process. This has largely related to the devel<>pment of the methodology to be used. The consultancy firm has not been involved directly in the review activity. (a) The cost of the contract is $30,100 based on a fee for service arrangement. (b) The review is being undertaken progressively and no report is available. . Crash Test Vehicles· (Question No. 2199)",126
212,Mr CONNOLLY,AUSTUDY,"the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 9 March 1995: Has his Department in the ACT purchased vehicles for crash testing; if so, (a) why, (b) what models and make of vehicles were purchased, (c) what did they·cost,(d) from which company were they purchased,. (e) where and in what circumstances will they be crashed, (t) what will become of them after being crashed, (g) are the crash tests necessary and (h) have the tests been conducted elsewhere ..",127
213,Mr BRERETON,AUSTUDY,"-,-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) Yes, as part of the Federal Office of Road Safety's ongoing research program to improve occupant pro-ection in vehicles. (b) Since 1990, the following make/models have been purchased: Holden Commodore, Ford Falcon, Toyota Camry, Mitsubishi Magna, Nissan Pintara, Toyota Corolla, Ford Laser, Toyota Landcruiser, Mitsubishi Pajero, Suzuki Vitara, Mitsubishi Triton, Holden Rodeo and Toyota Hilux. (c) The cost of the vehicles crash tested to date has been approximately $326,000 and a further $37,000 has been spent on two vehicles to be tested later this month. (d) All vehicles were purchased through the Department of Administrative Services fleet contract, except for three vehicles purchased from ACT Fleet Services. (e) The crash test programs have been conducted by facilities following a successful tender process on the open market. The crash tests have been conducted by General Motors-Holden's Automotive at Lang Lang in Victoria and New South Wales Roads and Traffic Authority Crashlab in Sydney. The crash tests have been full frontal rigid barrier tests and offset frontal tests into a deformable barrier element. The first tests were conducted in 1991. (f) Some of the vehicles have been destroyed under supervision of Departmental personnel and the remainder, pertaining to current research, are being stored in secured premises of the Department of Transport and the Department of Administrative Services. These will also be destroyed once the research projects are finalised. (g) The crash tests are necessary as part of research to develop regulations to improve occupant protection in vehicles. (h) The test program is the only Australian program aimed at providing information to support the development of more stringent regulations to improve vehicle safety. Manufacturers may carry out tests in Australia and overseas as part of their vehicle design and development program. Department of Human Services and Health: Office Machinery (Question No. 2200)",127
214,Mr CONNOLLY,AUSTUDY,"the Minister for Human Services and Health, upon notice, on 9 March 1995: Did her Department recently tender for and acquire substantial quantities of office machinery on a rental, non-purchase basis; if so, (a) did the purchasing procedures arrangements conform with the Department of Administrative Services' purchasing guidelines; if not, how did they differ, (b) what were the precise terms of the contract, (c) did her Department agree to non-contract servicing of the machinery or other non-contract items, (d) did her Department's acquisition of the machinery duplicate purchasing services offered by the Department of Administrative Services; if so why were the latter Department's services not used, (e) were photocopiers amortised on a purely rental basis based on cost per copy; if so, (i) over what period and (ii) based on what cost per copy, (f) what was the (i) number, (ii) cost and (iii) type of machinery purchased from each supplier under the contract, (g) does the Department· of Administrative Services maintain a list of recommended machinery; if so, what (i) number, (ii) value and (iii) type of the machinery acquired did not conform with the list, (h) when was the need for the machinery identified, (i) when and where were tenders called for, 0) will she provide a copy of the request for tender, (k) what was the closing date for tenders, (I) when were suppliers chosen, (m) when did equipment from each supplier begin to be delivered to her Department, (n) was equipment delivered immediately after tenders (a) were called for or (b) closed; if so, (i) what equipment and (ii) how was it paid for, and (0) who owns the machinery at the end of the rental period.",128
215,Dr LAWRENCE,AUSTUDY,"-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Department of Human Services and Health (HSH) issued in August 1994 a request for tender to photocopier suppliers concerning the provision of a national photocopying service (NPS) on a ""click-charge"" basis to the Department and participating portfolio agencies. Following an examination of the tenders received, and considering the overall packages offered, it was found that HSH was not going to receive value for money compared with the existing procedure of purchasing photocopiers under the Department of Administrative Services (DAS) common-use-contract (BG99). As a result, it was decided to discontinue the tender process. All tenderers were advised of this decision by letter on and contractual 20 January 1995. Departmental Office Equipment (Question No. 2201)",128
216,Mr CONNOLLY,AUSTUDY,"the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 9 March 1995: (1) Which departments and agencies purchase office equipment such as photocopiers and fax machines (a) outside his Department's central purchasing facility and (b) without regard to his Department's purchasing procedures. (2) Does his Department advocate leasing arrangements for office equipment such as photocopiers; if so, what arrangements does it (a) recommend and (b) not recommend. (3) Does his Department maintain a list of recommended photocopiers; if so, what machines does it (a) recommend and (b) not recommend.",128
217,Mr WALKER,AUSTUDY,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Although COIrlmonwealth departments and agencies must use the Common Use Arrangements established by my Department where they meet their needs, records are not kept of instances in which purchases are made outside these arrangements. Since the establishment of the National Procurement Board in December 1994, agencies must now report their reasons for electing to purchase outside the Common Use Arrangements. (2) The new Common Use Arrangement for photocopiers, to be effective from 1 May 1995, will include the option of leasing as an alternative to purchasing. My Department does not recommend any particulararrangement-individualagenciesdeterminethe option which best addresses their needs. (3) The Buyers' Guide for the current Common Use Arrangement lists those photocopiers that have been recommended for use for a five year period by the Commonwealth. Those photocopiers cover both low and high volume categories, and full colour, and the current suppliers are Konica, Sharp, Inchcape (Ricoh), Panasonic, Mita, Toshiba, Fuji Xerox, Oce (Minolta), Kodak and Canon. This arrangement expires on 30 April 1995, to be replaced by a new Common Use Arrangement on 1 May 1995 for which the panel of suppliers and the machines recommended may be different. Naval facility: Taylors Point, New South (Question No. 2209) Mrs Bishop asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 9 March 1995: (1) What are the plans for the future of the naval facility at Taylors Point, NSW. (2) Has the Department of Defence leased part of the facility to another organisation. (3) Is the wharf at the facility being upgraded; so, at what cost to the Commonwealth. (4) What is the annual maintenance budget for the facility. (5) Do buildings at the facility contain asbestos; if so, will the asbestos be removed and when will it occur.

(2) No. (3) The old unsafe timber wharf is currently being replaced with a concrete and steel structure which is sixty metres shorter and one metre lower than the original wharf. The total cost to the Commonwealth is about $733,000. (4) The total annual maintenance budget is currently approximately $10,000. (5) The roof and eastern wall of the building is of compressed asbestos cement construction. This material is in a very good state of repair and, according to National Occupational Health and Safety Council guidelines, does not present a health risk. Prompt removal would be undertaken if the material deteriorates and becomes a health hazard. (6) The Government does not have plans to remove the buildings at the facility. Defence Memorandum of Understanding with Singapore (Question No. 2214) Mr Taylor asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 9 March 1995: Did the Prime Minister discuss the final stages of a defence memorandum of upderstanding (MOV) with the Prime Minister of Singapore during his visit to Singapore in March 1995; if so, (a) does the Wales MOU (i) formalise planning for a Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) helicopter contingent to be based permanently at the Army's Aviation Centre at Oakey, Qld, in the short to medium term and (ii) allow for about 250 SAF personnel, their families, at least 12 Super Puma helicopters and major works and commercial support program at Oakey, (b) what are the budgetary costs for the SAF, (c) what are the benefits for (i) Australia, (ii) the Australian Defence Force and (iii) the local community, (d) to what extent is basing the SAF contingent at Oakey if an import component of the Government's regional defence strategy outlined in the 1994 Defence White Paper and (e) when will the Government announce full details.  provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The Prime Minister did not discuss the final stages of a Memorandum of Understanding during his visit to Singapore. (a) (i)-(ii) In February, the Department of Defence conducted an initial round of negotiations with Singapore on a proposal to locate a Singapore Armed Forces helicopter squadron at Oakey Army Aviation base in Queensland. Subject to satisfactory arrangements being agreed, these negotiations will result in the signing of a formal agreement between Australiaand Singapore. The proposal involves the location of up to 12 Super Puma helicopters and about 500 personnel (including dependants) at Oakey. The helicopters will be operated from new facilities which will be constructed in the event of a final agreement being reached. An important aspect of the negotiations will be arrangements for adequate Australian industry involvement in the provision of maintenance and other services related to the helicopter squadron. (b) The budgetary costs for the SAF will be dependent on the outcomes of the negotiations between Australia and Singapore. (c) (i)-(iii) Should the proposal be agreed, there will be direct benefits to Australia from the capital investment connected with the new facilities to be constructed at Oakey and the Australian industry involvement in the provision of maintenance and other services to the SAF. The arrangements would also offer important strategic benefits to the Australian Defence Force by increasing our ability to operate with the Singapore Armed Forces, contributing to defence industry and logistics cooperation and increasing the exchange of knowledge and ideas on training and operational doctrine and techniques. The local community will benefit from the employment and investment generated by the Singaporean presence in the area. (d) The proposal is entirely consistent with the policy of regional engagement as expressed in the Government's White Paper on defence, Defending Australia 1994. As stated in the White Paper, the development of substantial Singaporean training and exercising activities in Australia reflects the strong sense of trust between Australia and Singapore, and serves our strategic interests by helping to enhance Singapore's defence capabilities. (e) A press release on this proposal, and a related proposal to base Singaporean Skyhawk aircraft at RAAF base Amberley, was issued by the Department of Defence on 30 March 1995. Eyre Highway Flooding (Question No. 2218) Mr Wakelin asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 9 March 1995: Is it a fact that hundreds of trucks were delayed in early March 1995 by the flooding of sections of the Eyre Highway near Norseman, WA; if so, will the Government (a) estimate the loss of Commonwealth revenue caused by the delay and (b) urgently develop a plan to prevent a recurrence of the blockage.",129
218,Mr BRERETON,AUSTUDY,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Yes. About 1000 vehicles were delayed between 27 .February and 3 March 1995 when a 10 km section of the Eyre Highway was washed out. No. The Government will not estimate the loss of revenue. The Government will not develop a· plan to prevent a recurrence. The affected section of the Eyre Highway was part of a 16km works project, involving exposed pavement reconstruction and upgrading works to achieve a wider, safer and smoother road surface to keep the road in a well maintained state. The washout was the result of unusual and unseasonal weather. The Federal Government will not be deterred from undertaking major improvements to the Eyre Highway by reason of this event. Western Aboriginal Legal Service (Question No. 2219) Mr Cobb asked the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, upon notice, on 9 March 1995: (1) What was the (a) name and (b) location of each (i) director and (ii) employee of the Western Aboriginal Legal Service in each year since its inception. (2) What (a) remuneration and (b) other entitlements (i) was each of the persons referred to in part (1) entitled to and (ii) did each receive, in each year the person was employed by the Western Aboriginal Legal Service. Mr Tickner-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission has provided the following information. The Western Aboriginal Legal Service (WALS) was established in 1977. Neither the WALS or the Australian Securities Commission have the level of detail in their records to enable preparation of a response to the question. Audited financial statements provided to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission also do not provide this level of detail. To obtain the information sought would involve the Commission in considerable research and I am not prepared - to authorise the time and resources entailed in collecting the information. Jobsearch and Newstart Allowance (Question No. 2232) Dr Kemp asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 27 March 1995: How many persons transferred from (a) Job Search Allowance and (b) Newstart Allowance to each type of social security payment or benefit other than Mature Age Allowance and Mature Age Partner Allowance in (i) 1990, (ii) 1991, (iii) 1992, (iv) 1993, (v) 1994 and (vi) 1995 to the date of answering this question. Mr Baldwin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a)&(b); (i) to (vi) I am not prepared to authorise the use of the considerable resources involved in extracting and validating the information that would be required to answer this question. Partner Allowance Recipients (Question No. 2233) Dr Kemp asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 27 March 1995: How many of the estimated average number of recipients of the Partner Allowance in (a) 1994-95, (b) 1995-6, (c) 1996-7, (d) 1997-8 are expected to be transferred from (i) Job Search Allowance, (ii) Newstart Allowance and (iii) each type of social security payment or benefit. Mr Baldwin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: There are not expected to be any recipients of Partner Allowance who will transfer from Job Search Allowance or N ewstart Allowance or other social security payments. The qualifications for Partner Allowance after 1 July 1995 include that a person with recent workforce experience, or who has been in receipt of Job Search, Newstart or Sickness Allowance in the 13 weeks prior to lodging a claim for Partner Allowance, cannot qualify for Partner Allowance. Recent workforce experience is defined as employment of at least 20 hours per week for a total of 13 weeks or more in the previous 12 months or employment of 20 hours per week or more during the week before lodging the Partner Allowance claim. There will be no new grants of Wife Pension after 1 July 1995. Partners of Pension claimants will be able to claim Partner Allowance, Parenting Allowance, or some other payment type. The numbers estimated in this category are as follows: 1995-96-8,600; 1996-97-23,900; 1997-9836,700 Electoral Rolls Transfers (Question No. 2242) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 27 March 1995: Is he able to say which authority compiles and publishes the electoral roll for each house of parliament in Australia.",130
219,Mr WALKER,AUSTUDY,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Electoral enrolments for all States and the Commonwealth are processed by the Divisional Offices of the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC). The AEC compiles the Commonwealth Electoral Roll which includes enrolment information in electronic form for all States and Territories except for South Australia. The South Australian State Electoral Roll and the South Australian portion of the Commonwealth Electoral Roll are maintained on a commercial computer system using software jointly owned by the South Australian State Electoral Office and the AEC. The AEC is also responsible for the printing and publication of the Commonwealth Electoral Roll.
