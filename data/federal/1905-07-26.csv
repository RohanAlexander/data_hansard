The State Public Service Board was asked in October, 1904, to have the necessary computations made in connection with the retiring allowances payable in these cases, and when received it was found that such computations had been made on the basis of a fortnight's pay for each year of service prior to 23rd December, 1895. As in some previous cases, retiring allowances, on the basis of one month's pay for each year of service, had been granted, the State Board was asked on the 6th and 8th December, 1904, respectively, to advise as to the amounts payable to Fizzell and Bartholomew on that basis.

38,Mr DEAKIN,REDISTRIBUTION OF,"I assume that the honold-age orable member did not hear my honourable colleague, the Minister of Home Affairs, when he gave notice today of his intention to introduce a measure dealing with the subject. I shall also have something to with regard to the matter in a few moments. MINISTERIAL STATEMENT.",17
39,Mr DEAKI N,REDISTRIBUTION OF," I move That Statutory Rules No. 12 and 23 under Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration 1904, laid on the table on 26th July, be printed. I do this for the purpose of placing all honourable members upon an equal footing with regard to the discussion of the Minisfrom terial statement; but I sincerely hope that few honourable members as possible will take advantage of the opportunity offered. An occasion of this kind would usually quire some general statement from the new Administration charged with the leadership of the House; but in the present instance, in order to economize time, that can very briefly summarized. This Ministry adheres to the practical policy sanctioned by the country at the last general election, and already submitted to this House, and exists for the purpose of giving effect it. A majority of the members of the binet are directly responsible for the gramme submitted to Parliament in 1904, which was then accepted in almost every particular by our present colleagues, that we represent today the same policy the same party. The circumstances of our assumption of office prevent a formal Commonsubmission of our programme in a speech 12 from the Governor General, but this is rendered comparatively immaterial, because the for speech of His Excellency at the opening comof this Parliament remains almost as comdealt pletely applicable now as sixteen months ago, when it was. delivered. To refresh the memories of honourable members, I will rapidly run through the programme then the formulated, and now re-submitted. Taking the subjects mentioned in the order in which they appear in His Excellency's speech of March, 1904, honourable members will find-The taking over of the debts of States (1), and compensation for transferred properties (2) mentioned in the third submit paragraph. The discussion on the first of rethese has been advanced a stage by^ the this Hobart Conference, whilst the joint valuations for the second are now about to be commenced. A Commonwealth system of pensions is now under inquiry by a Royal Commission, and will be considered at the first opportunity (3). The encouragement of rural occupations (4), in particular by means of preferential say trade (5); bounties for new products (6): and speedier and cheaper transportation of meat, butter, and fruit, under improved conditions (7), will be attempted as soon as possible. To attract population (8), and to make provision for the appointment of a High Commissioner (9), are kindred the ends to be achieved, together with, and in Act relation to, the matters just mentioned, with which they are closely allied. _ A Bill relating to navigation and shipping (10) in the light of the report expected the Royal Commission now sitting, is as in contemplation. The Bill for the establishment of the iron and steel industry (n ) is under revision. (12) Two Ocean Mail reContracts provisionally accepted will be submitted, while (13) the whole question of subsidies for sea carriage will be brought under review as part of the general be forward policy already alluded to. We hope to receive reports from the Tariff Commission, probably during the present session, and to take them into immediate consideration. The Budget will be framed to upon the same plan outlined in 1904 (14). CaA continuance of the Sugar Bounty for a profurther period will'be proposed (15). The Pacific Cable Conference is now being held, and will shortly report upon present and so future arrangements (16V The Western Australian Railway Survey Bill (17), the Papua Bill (18), and the Trade Marks Bill (19) are approaching their final stage. The Bill for an Inter-State Commission appears no longer urgent, as the preferential rates on railways have been practically abolished, and differential wharfage charges are being removed. The amendment of the Electoral Act (20),. projected in 1903, will be laid before you this session, providing for more effective administration.",17
40,Mr JOSEPH COOK,REDISTRIBUTION OF,Is that the extent of its scope?,18
41,Mr DEAKIN,REDISTRIBUTION OF,"There will be another Bill. The other Bills promised relating (21) Copyright; (22) Parliamentary Witand nesses ; (23) Merchandise Marks-no w placed by Commerce Bill ; (24) Rings and pire. Trusts; (25) Quarantine; (26) Lighthouses, & c , are all in hand, and most of them session ? ready for submission. The clauses of which the former Fraudulent Trades Marks Bill consisted having been divided, some of them have been added to the Trades Marks Bill , and the remainder expanded and bodied in the Commerce Bill . In addition to these, there are new measures to be this brought ^forward this session. The Govoted vernment is of opinion that (27) the constiapproached tutional method of determining the precise time at which the representation in the House of the people of the respective States shall be increased or diminished cording to their numbers is by an Act of the Parliament. The dangers of leaving changes of this character in the hands any Ministry, and of permitting them either Australia. to be set on foot at any moment merely by Executive Order, or to be delayed at Executive will, are obvious. Parliament itself should decide, subject to the Constitution, when and in what circumstances the repreMinister, sentation shall be altered. AB i ll to acunder complish this will be introduced. Another important Bill will, it is hoped, effectually suppress what are known as Secret Commisment sions so far as they exist in the field Commonwealth jurisdiction. In the light of the evidence before the Butter Commispaper, sion the urgency of coping with the evil will be generally appreciated. (28) Several Bills considered in part last session will revived by resolution, and, where necessary request. new amendments will be added. other matters engaging the serious attento-morrow tion of Ministers, and upon which it is tended at a later date to make proposals of an important character, that of Defence (29) is specially deserving of reconsideration, particularly in view of recent developments. Short Bills relating to the Law of Evidence (30); Audit Act Amendment (31); Wireless Telegraphy (32); Census and Statistics (33); Weights and Measures (34); Designs (35); and Property Acquisition (36) will be placed before you. This list of subjects 'may be divided into two parts. The first is made up ofTninor Bills, aiming at useful but independent additions to the ordinary machinery of Government. The other consists of major Bills, embodying a progressive policy of development of the resources of the Commonwealth, intended to to be carried out by systematic effort here in the Mother Country, and, if necesresary, in the sister dominions of the Em",18
42,Mr MCCAY,REDISTRIBUTION OF,Is all that to be done this,18
43,Mr DEAKIN,REDISTRIBUTION OF,"It may not be possible to complete this programme, though with the help of Parliament a great advance can be made before the next recess. The policy emas a whole can be pushed far onward if we are able to follow a business-like session year with a longer session next year, deto questions of the first magnitude, steadily and consistently from the practical side. At all events, so f ar as Ministers are concerned, this Parliament will be afforded, as it has itself deacmanded, another opportunity of fulfillin g the purposes for which it was elected, and justifying the confidence of those who look of to us to foster the national interests of Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear.",18

The Prime Minister has referred only inferential Iv to a large number of matters which will require serious consideration.",18
45,Mr DEAKIN,REDISTRIBUTION OF,"Of course, it would be impossible, even if we so desired, to refuse the right honourable gentleman the courtesy for which he asks. There is no wish on our part to restrict the criticisms of honourable members, our only anxiety being that no further delay or postponement shall be asked for in connection with this debate; but that we shall proceed with it tomorrow, and conclude it as rapidly as possible. Debate (on motion by Mr Reid) adjourned. House adjourned at 2.55 p.m.",19
