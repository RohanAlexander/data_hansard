1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Leo MCLeay) took the chair at 10 a.m., and read prayers. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1992 Second Reading Debate resumed from 14 October, on motion by Mr Baldwin: That the Bill be now read a second time. upon which Dr Kemp had moved by way of amendment: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not opposing the passage of the Bill, the House condemns the Government for its failure to adequately address the problems in the administration and targeting of student financial assistance to ensure that it is fair and accessible to all"". .",10
2,Mr CHARLES,STUDENT ASSISTANCE,"LaTrobe) (10.01 a.m.)The Student Assistance Amendment Bill is about making alterations to Austudy. I am delighted to see that the Minister responsible, the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin), is in the chamber this morning. Over the last 2112 years he and I have had a· number of very active debates in this place regarding Austudy and the provision of higher education in general. I congratulate the Minister on getting something right for a. change. Well done! I note that the Bill is about introducing, into our system of student financial assistance, student loans referred to in the Bill as 'supplements'. I point out to honourable members that student loans have been on the agenda for a very long time, but this Government has been afraid to talk about student loans and still denies that opportunity in the language used in this Bill. Last night in this debate the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) spent some time criticising the concept of student loans as being inequitable. Yet he fully supports the concept of supplements, which in essence are student loans, taken out by students in giving up some of their entitlements to the grant of Austudy. In his second reading speech the Minister said: Australia has one' of world's best student financial support schemes, which is one reason we have one of the world's most equitable higher education systems. Mr Baldwin-True.",10
3,Mr CHARLES,STUDENT ASSISTANCE,"I am not sure that I would go along with the Minister on that point. We have had many active debates in this place regarding student financial assistance-Austudy and Abstudy. One of the reasons for that is that the system, as it has evolved, has been shown to have many inequities. One of its principal negatives is the fact that it has been very poor at targeting assistance to those most in need. In the debate last night the shadow Minister for education, the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), well outlined to the Government many of the problems that have surfaced through the years and that we have brought to the attention of the Government in the operation of Austudy. Not the least of those is the fact that until very recently the Government did not even have a statement of real objectives for the scheme-that is, the Government had not set out in clear English what the scheme was meant to accomplish. From my viewpoint, what student financial assistance ought to be all about very simply is making sure that no eligible student is denied access to education because of financial constraints. It then becomes a matter of deciding who has financial constraints, under what manner these are caused, whether or not it is proper, right and reasonable for the Government to help those who need assistance and how to go about targeting those most in need. In March 1991 the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training brought down a very damning report on student financial assistance. It was reported widely in the press; debates were held on public radio and on television. I think very sincerely that that report has helped shape the debate on student financial assistance througMut the remaining time of this Parliament. It was a very good report, and it was a bipartisan effort. We said to the Government, 'You have not set proper objectives for Austudy. You have not said what it is all about. Whatever those objectives a£e, it appears to us that you have not met them well. The system is not equitable, it is subject to rort and abuse, and it does not necessarily achieve the objectives set out'. year we are spending $1.65 billion on student financial assistance. Make no mistake about it: that is a great deal of money in anyone's language. Our report of March 1991 canvassed many things that the Government might do in order to modify the Austudy scheme to make it more equitable. I know that a number of the things that we recommended then have been picked up in the Budget Pape-, but we have yet to see the detail from the Government on those particular items. I will return to those later. That March 1991 report set the standard for the debate. Many of the recommendations that we made have already been picked up and put into place in Austudy. Following on from that, initiatives have been announced in this Budget which pick up even more of the items that we recommended at that time. Just after that report was issued, I wrote a discussion paper on student financial assistance for the 1990s. My report canvassed essentially what is happening in the rest of the world and how the rest of the world has gone about approaching this issue of assisting students with their financial n-eds while they are in full time study. Essentially, the discussion paper found that most of the rest of the world has moved away from total reliance on grant schemes in favour of loans to students, generally interest free, generally over a long period of time and generally repaid at some time after students have finished their education and are in a financially better position to pay back the money which they used during their study time. The loan scheme is, in essence, anticipated income. The governments of those countries that support loan schemes do so knowing that the majority of students will earn higher incomes because of the qualifications that they obtained from the study. So they are asked to repay that loan money. In other words, they forgo income while they are studying and repay the loan later when they are in work. In my discussion paper I recommended a whole range of options that we should consider. Some of those have been picked up by the Government through legislation on the Austudy scheme and some, no doubt, we will I note that this continue to discuss. In April 1992 Dr Bruce Chapman gave to the Minister another report on Austudy. But before he did, in November 1991 the Opposition gave to the Australian public our Fightback package. The Fightback package spelled out a number of major changes that we in the Opposition thought were necessary to help make Aust-dy more equitable. Included in those are some of the items that were announced in the Budget in September, which we will debate later this year. The Chapman report was really in two phases. It came about because, following the House of Representatives Committee report on Austudy and my discussion paper, the Minister made a decision that he needed outside advice away from the constraints of the Department of Employment, Education and Training on how best to go about modifying the student financial assistance scheme to make it more equitable and cost efficient. So he commissioned Dr Bruce Chapman to inquire into the whole issue of student financial assistance. Dr Chapman wrote a preliminary report which was directed towards a major change in terms of our balance. We currently have a total reliance on grants to assist students. That means that someone decides, through some bureaucratic mechanism, who needs financial assistance, how much financial assistance is needed, and how it will be given to each particular student. In his preliminary report Dr Chapman came down on balance for replacing a reasonable portion of the grant scheme with loans to students in lieu of the grant. That created a big ruckus. Students and the student unions went hell for leather in criticising Dr Chapman. In fact, they made life really miserable for him on his and other campuses. It was a vociferous debate. Of course, students have a vested interest in student financial assistance and its mechanisms, and I well understand that. They should be concerned. But for some reason they seemed to believe that it was equitable to decide that one individual, because of that person's parents' financial circumstances, was entitled to a grant but another individual, because of his or her parents' financial circumstances, was not to be entitled to a grant. That determination may not pick up the fact that, regardless of their financial circumstances, the parents may not be willing to support the student. In any case, after Dr Chapman brought down his preliminary report he and the Minister had discussions. He revised his format and in April 1992 brought down a final report, which brings us to this debate. Although the Government has neglected to address many of the recommendations in the Chapman report, it has picked up one.of them. This Bill, which is about supplements-in fact, a student loan scheme-was one of the options that the Chapman report proposed. There is no doubt in my mind that the provision of student loans in lieu of grants is a proper way to go. I have no doubt that grants have a place to play in the system, but it is my own belief that many students are disadvantaged by the grants scheme itself and that there are others who need financial assistance but are targeted out by the scheme, such as those who have no means of helping themselves other than through some kind of loan mechanism-and the banks certainly are not interested in providing students even with high interest loans. There are several reasons for looking at loans in lieu of grants. The first of those, and probably the most important altogether, is targeting. Targeting is particularly difficult. All of us have a desire to see that people get the money that they need. That is inherent in this debate. It is not really a political debate. It is not about ideology; it is not about Left or Right or centre or anything else; it is really about trying to make sure that young people particularly who need and deserve an education have the opportunity to receive that education. In our travels around the country, in talking to various groups about the grants scheme, we have found that many' students who come from middle income backgrounds today are severely disadvantaged. They are probably the most disadvantaged in terms of student financial assistance of any group in the student society. The reason is that increasingly-the recession may have something to do with it, but changes in our society probably have something to do with it also-numbers of parents are saying to their children, 'When you finish high school you are on your own; you can go off to university. Yes, the Government pays for the majority of your costs at university, but you will have to figure out how to support yourself, because we have looked after you up to this point and we are not willing to contribute any more'. There are other young people who have lost their parents. Also, unfortunat-ly, in society today many families have broken down and young people literally do not have a family to assist them. Students of middle income parents are probably the most disadvantaged group and are very difficult to target. The loans provide supplementary income for some students for whom it is particularly difficult, and in times of recession impossible, to find part time jobs in order to support themselves. Our Standing Committee certainly supports students working to help put themselves through tertiary education. I certainly worked to put myself through university. Nobody else was going to do it for me. We have been successful in convincing the Government to raise the limit on student earnings before killing a student's opportunity to receive a grant. That has been very positive. One of the most negative things about our grants scheme in early 1990 was that so many students attempted to rort the system because the income base that they were allowed before they started losing SOc in the dollar of their Austudy grant was very low. Now at least it is set at a reasonable level, and it appears that it will continue to rise. There have been changes in eligibility to Austudy grants through this Budget and through earlier mechanisms. Those changes in eligibility prevent some students from receiving the Austudy grant. This supplementary mechanism, this student loan mechanism, contained within the Bill now gives those students some opportunity to def-r income so that they can take up a loan now and pay it back on an interest free basis when they are earning a good income. The Budget has several other mechanisms that will affect Austudy, but we have yet to see the detail in legislation. The Budget announces a lower age of independence. Our Committee certainly supported that. It was one of our major recommendations. The Government has not gone as far as we would like to go; nonetheless, this measure is an improvement in the right direction. The Budget says that the value of some fringe benefits will be included as being income for testing of parental support. That is a very positive initiative because part of the rorting of the system, as seen by the public, has been the ability of some individuals to use the taxation system to their benefit: to take low apparent incomes and use those low apparent incomes to fund assets. The income and assets test still allows the students to receive grants while their parents are quite capable financially of supporting their students. It will be interesting to see what items the Government picks up in tenns of fringe benefits-things such as personal superannuation, things subject to the fringe benefits and negative gearing on property. I look forward to receiving the detail of the Government's intentions in this. regard. The Budget says that debt management expects to pull in another $7.5m in overpayment to students who did not deserve the payment. Our side of politics and the audit group see that there is great scope for improvement in that, because $71hm is a very small portion of the amount which is probably currently being taken out of the system when it should not be. The Budget also picks up a coalition and Committee initiative in raising the level of minimum payment for Austudy. Very small payments of $10 or $15 a week are still sent out to students, which is clearly a nonsense. It is, I think, to this Government's credit that it has brought this legislation in. Despite the flowery rhetoric of calling them supplements instead of student loans, the Government has introduced the legislation in defiance of a massive lobby from students who say it is only the thin end of the wedge. The students argue that once the door is open to student loans the Government will increasingly reduce the grants scheme and increase reliance on student loans. That may well be true, because the rest of the world has very clearly moved in that direction in the 1980s and the 1990s and probably will continue to do so. The targeting is very clear. If a .student needs the money, the opportunity to defer income in order to obtain living expenses at the time provides the best targeting mechanism available.",10
4,Mr BEVIS,STUDENT ASSISTANCE,"I am pleased to enter this debate in support of the Government's legislation enhancing the Austudy-Abstudy provisions of the education system. I would like at the outset to endorse some of the remarks made by the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) about the work of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training that was undertaken in 1990-91. The work of that Committee set the direction for much of the debate which has occurred during the life of this Parliament on key aspects of Austudy and Abstudy. I think it is important also in that context to tax, acknowledge the contribution made by the then chairperson of the Committee, the hon Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence-who perfonned an outstanding job as chairperson in conducting that inquiry. Along with a number of other members of this place, I was pleased to be a part of that inquiry, and I think its report is one-which the Parliament can be proud of. The Australian Labor Party has a long and proud history of supporting and improving access and equity in education, particularly in the post-compulsory education. The concept of needs based assistance-of targeting money to those most in need-was introduced into these systems by a Labor government in the 1970s. Since 1983, this Government has expanded and improved on that system. Since 1983, the number of secondary students in receipt of income support has increased by· a massive 350 per cent; the number of tertiary students in receipt· of support has increased by an enormous 125 per cent. Nearly half of all tertiary students are now able to receive finandal assistance from the Government to enable them to undertake their studies. In many cases, I have no doubt that they would not be able to Undertake those studies were it not for the targeted support provided by the Government through the Austudy and Abstudy systems. Not only has the number of people in receipt of benefits increased; the actual. value ment. of the benefit has improved over time. The real value of maximum benefits has increased by 11 per cent.· After taking account of cost of inflation, since 1983 there has been 11 per cent increase in the real support vided to students in receipt of Austudy at tertiary level. At the secondary level, increase in real terms is a very substantial per cent. That, of course, has a lot to do with the changes which were also made to the benefits for unemployed people some years ago. Next year over half a million Australians will be in receipt of Austudy or Abstudy. Some 556,000 Australians will' be in receipt of that benefit next year. That indicates the wide penetration which the system has those people. achieved. At the outset I would like to pick up a couple of the comments that were included in the parliamentary Committee's report entitled Student Financial Assistance of 1991 which need to be fleshed out for further action.' The honourable member for La Trobe referred to those people who are able to structure their income and their assets to become asset rich but income poor. They are able to manage their income and affairs to reduce their taxable income so that they fall below the cut-off point and thereby are able to gain various government benefits, including Austudy, when in fact by any standard they' have a wealthy lifestyle. I refer to people who through fringe benefits and other arrangements that they are able to enter into with their employers, or selfemployed people who so structure their affairs, have their standards of living met by the company and not through their taxable income. Those people. are ripping off the system. The Committee made it quite clear in its report that the days of students rolling up at university in a Mercedes Benz or BMW and picking up Austudy had to stop. This is not an easy thing to fix because the taxable income, which is the basis upon which most of these systems operate, does not adequately address the problem. The Committee made recommendations on this aspect and .I am aware it is being considered by the GovernI strongly urge the Minister for Employthe ment, Educatiori and Training (Mr Beazley) an and the Government to ensure that action is protaken to better direct the payments so that the those people who are genuinely in need, who the have not rorted the system and rearranged 115 their assets to reduce their tax liabilities, should receive the benefit. No-one is suggesting that people go out and rearrange their . income and assets just to get Austudy. Austudy happens to be one of the fringe benefits they pick up along the way. It is important that the Department of Employment, Education and Training, through consultations with the Taxation Office, ensure that J;Ilechanisms are set in, place to catch I also want to mention the people who .are subjected to the means test for dependent spouse benefit. The Government t<?ok a decision, I think two Budgets ago, to alter that means test and in the process prevented a number of people completing studies. I think that was a very regrettable decision and it was commented upon in the report. I fear that time has probably now passed those people by. Nevertheless, I believe that those people-most of whom were women, people from low income families who were seeking to re-enter the work force and requiring training-do deserve particular consideration on the basis of equity and fairness. I hope the Government will be able to review the situation for those people who were in the system a couple of years ago but who have been forced to drop out. I am not suggesting that we continue the old rules in perpetuity, but I think there is a c-se for a sunset clause to phase out the old arrangement. The Committee made recommendations along those lines. I hope those matters will also be looked at by government. This Bill specifically introduces a supplement for recipients of Austudy and Abstudy that is designed to enable certain students to gain additional funds over and above their existing entitlements to benefit. The supplement will be available to tertiary students who are now eligible for grants through Austudy or Abstudy. It applies only to tertiary students and not to secondary students. The students will gain ,access to the supplement by, trading in $1 of their grant to secure $2 of a supplement. In each year, the amount of the supplement available to a student will be between $500 and $4,000. It is a significant opportunity for those students who wish to do so to access a substantia1.amount of money to aid them during their years of study. The supplement is also available to some students who are now not eligible for Austudy or Abstudy. Special provision has been made for those students who would otherwise be eligible for a grant, except that their parental income is too high, where that parental income is less than $5b,000. This will extend the assistance provided by the Government to tertiary students much further and will introduce a whole new group of people to financial assistance. In introducing this supplement the Government has recognised that student needs vary substantially. Not all students have the same opportunity or the same access, for example, to casual employment, depending on where they may live, what their family circumstances are and what their community obligations and commitments are. Similarly, not all students have the same costs to bear, again depending on family circumstances and where they live. The cost of accommodation in the capital cities of Australia varies markedly, of course the cost of accommodation in regional Australia is different again. The opportunity for students to choose, if they wish, to access the supplement will enable those students who for a variety of reasons need the extra cash to get the money when they most need it, while they are studying. The grants are indexed to maintain real value. That is an important characteristic which the Government is entrenching in legislation. I welcome that initiative. It provides some certaipty for the students of Australia about their ongoing income. The supplement will be paid ,fortnightly along with the grants. I would like to make a couple of comments about how the system is to operate, because I think the Government in introducing this has managed to' allay many of the concerns which were raised by student bodies. I guess first and foremost in that process was the indexation of the grants to ensure that the grants will continue to rise in line with the consumer price index. The repayments have been arranged in a very generous manner. There is no real interest rate applying on the supplement whatsoever. Outstanding balances-the amount owingwill be indexed to the CPI. So there is no effective rate of interest charged t6 students who choose to access this supplement. Moreover, there is no requirement to make any repayment at all for five years. That guarantees the students thebpportunity of completjng their courses and establishing themselves in their newccareers before they are required to make any payments whatsoever. At that point the repayments are in accordance with the existing HECSarrangements, and that seems to me to be quit¥ appropriate. If st-dents are in a position to make repayments within the first .,five years they are given an additional benefit by ,way of a 15 per cent discount. That is an inducement for those students to strive to make the repayment as early as possible. ., Whilst I am happy to support this Bill and the supplement that is provided for in it, I should record my general concern about loans based systems. The Government has proposed a continuation of an Austudy grant which is and targeted according toa person's income and assets, That is a wholly proper and equitable system that we should follow. The Government is building on that the opportunity, the choice, individually determined byeac.b student, to trade in some of that benefit to a loan. That stands in stark contrast to a concept of loans which has been promulgated by the Opposition at various times and was referred to by the honourable member for La Trobe just a few moments ago. As a supplement, a loans based system is I think acceptable. As a sole system, it reduces equity and does nothing but help the rich. One cannot say that a loans based system is targeted in any way. A loans based system ensures that the rich-the· students of rich families-have no trouble accessing tertiary education because they can take out a loan low interest rates. And why would they not? If people could get a subsidised interest rate loan they would take it rather than use their own money or go to the bank. They would take out a low interest rate loan, and if they were wealthy that would be no problem. Such students have guaranteed repayment. Under this· arrangement they can pay the loan off when they like, within the first five years, get a benefit that ordinary Australians-low income and middle income Australians-do not have access to. Once a grants system is replaced with a Austudy. loans system, rather than supplementing one with the other as we have, it ensures that the only people who are guaranteed access to tertiary education are the wealthy. The ordiits nary income earner in Australia is not in position to guarantee the sort of money which would be required. I will come to that when I refer to some of the other proposals that the Opposition has produced on this .matter, particularly with respect to vouchers. I think it is important to record in this debate that the Government is not about unrealistic introducing a loan system; the Government about providing the opportunity for some students to trade in part of their grant a loan, if they wish. We should never lose sight of the need for a grants system targeted to those in need, to those with the ability succeed in education-to those who would otherwise not have the economic means to complete their education. The Opposition in its Fightback package has proposed a number of initiatives which get would severely injure tertiary students. For starters, we cannot go past its goods and services tax which, by its own admission, would increase inflation by about 4 to 6 per cent, depending upon what analysis we look at. That is the rise in the CPI. It has compensated Austudy payments with an increase of 5 per cent and has said, therefore, that tertiary students will be no worse off. The Opposition says that the GST will cause higher inflation, but that it will give an increase to Austudy of the same amount. That takes no account of the fact that students who at are predominantly low income earners spend most of their money on food and servicesthings which do not attract any direct wholesale sales tax. Therefore, the increase in their weekly expenditure is not 4 to 6 per cent; it is of the order of 8 to 12 per cent. I do not have time to go through that debate in detail, but it certainly has been one waged on the .airwaves and in this place in recent times. It and is beyond doubt that low income earners spend a much higher proportion of their income on food and services, they will be the worse hit by a GST and they will not be compensated by a 5 per cent increase in ' The other thing that flaws the Opposition's argument when it comes to compensation is assumption that all the savings it proposes a for business, through reducing wholesale sales tax, payroll tax and other taxes, will be later passed on to the consumer-you and mewhen we go and buy a product. Those opposite would have us believe that none of the companies in the chain of production will decide to keep a little of that for themselves to increase their profit margin. That is an assumption. It was one of the bases is upon which their economic analysis was flawed from the outset. They double counted to get that. When they went to the business community, they said, 'We will take all these imposts' off you so that your profits will be to greater'. Then they went to the people of Australia and said, ""We will take all these imposts off businesses and they will pass it on to you so that you will get cheaper goods'. Those opposite cannot have it both ways. They cannot use the same pool of money to give the companies more profits and 'the consumers cheaper prices. It is one or the other. The truth is that the 6 per cent compensation·. which the Opposition proposes. for Austudy will not address the increases in prices that will occur due to the profit taking that I have j'.lst mentioned. Importantly, though, I think members of the Opposition have proposed a dangerous policy which threatens the equity in our education system, by supporting a voucher concept. thought vouchers fell out of favour in 1970s .. I am a little surprised that they have been recycled in the 1990s. Vouchers take no account of the costs of separate courses. tertiary course can cost between $8,000 $25,000 a year depending on what faculty student is studyingin-w4ether he or she is do-g medicine, engineering or arts. Obviously different programs have different in-b-ilt costs. If a student gets a voucher that averaged out, that does not give him or her the flexibility to do a course which he or may be capable of doing unless the student happens to be wealthy enough to pay the balance. What a voucher system inevitably does, and has dorie everywhere it has been applied, is . to restrict the choices for capable, intelligent students from low income families whilst at the same time providing more choices for the wealthy but less able students. It shifts the emphasis from ability to wealth. A voucher does not target those in need but effectively ensures that the wealthy have greater access than they do now and the poor have less access. To top it all off, those opposite then with the idea of imposing up-front fees, before students can even get in they have pay up front. Those opposite say that students can pay up front because they will give a voucher. Yes, that is true, but only true the context I have just mentioned. It is true students doing one of the high cost courses are wealthy enough to pay the balance. It true if students are wealthy and do not get voucher because they can front up and pay the bill anyway. But students who are capable, lntelligent but poor will miss the boat. That is not good enough for Australia; it is not good enough for our future. There are a few things in this life that we should guarantee but one of them is that all people in this country have the right to a complete education to the full extent of their ability, irrespective of their means. That is the basis upon which this Government has developed its policy. Regrettably, it is not the basis upon which the Opposition policy is developed.",13
5,Mr WILSON,STUDENT ASSISTANCE,";-The I speaker who has just resumed his seat, the the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis), has said that every Australian should have the right to a full education up to the limits of his A ability, and so he should. But the present and Government is denying 50,000 Australian a .students or more who have qualified to go to tertiary institutions from obtaining a place in those institutions. It. is denying them a place even if they want, from their own personal is resources or with family support, to pay the full fees so that they can go to those institushe tions. The Labor Party, the present Government,has been muddle headed in its whole approach to the rights for Australian citizens and Australian students. Let me look for a moment at the broader picture..It is argtled that all Australians should have a right to income security, but a person who is self-reliant is denied a social security pension and is paying taxes to pay sOGial security pensions for many people who could have afforded to - e self-reliant. Similarly, it is argued that a person has a right to health cover and health insurance protection. But the Labor Government denies people .the opportunity to insure for the gap; it denies people flirt the opportunity to insure against medical so expenses above the schedule fee. Where it to does allow people to insure privately, it makes them pay twice. They pay for the poor, them which everyone is prepared to do. Everyone in acknowledges that as a - ocial duty those with if means should meet the .expenses of the poor. Those people who privately insure. for is hospital expenses find that they have to pay a taxes at a level sufficient to pay for the Medicare cover of many people on incomes higher than their own. It is argued that all people have a right to nursing home care if they are frail and elderly and qualify medically. But if people have that care delivered to them in their own homes they are largely denied any benefits at all. If a person goes to a home and wants more care than the nursing homes are funded for, that person is not allowed to privately pay for extra care. So where are the rights of the individual and the freedom of choice in the allocation of an individual's resources? When we turn to education, we have recognised that it is a right to have primary and secondary education, yet this Government continues to impose a price on choice because there is free education-or largely free education-in a state run school but parents have to pay much more for the choice of sending their children to an independent school. Yet, in doing so, and while doing so, they have to meet their liability for taxation-and the tax burden is increased because in many instances those parents are paying taxes to provide state school education for people on incomes much higher than their own. The same is true when we turn to tertiary education. It is interesting here that we have two schemes in operation which in isolation seem to be muddled. But, if we were to sweep away all the institutional fabric that now have and start with a clean slate, we might find that in those arrangements is the germ of a sensible idea. We have a higher education contribution scheme under which students at our universities must pay about 20 per cent of the cost of their tertiary education or post-compulsory education. We now have this Student Assistance Amendment Bill under which Austudy grants, in addition to being made available on an income-assets test basis, can be converted into a loan arrangement. The germ of the idea in both of those proposals is that we are looking at life cycle accounting. We are saying that we understand that most people do their tertiary education when they are young, before they have had any earnings, before they have built up any personal wealth; and that they could not afford it but for government support for fees and government support for living expenses through Austudy. Now we are recognising that, yes, those who do post-compulsory education do benefit society, but they also benefit themselves. There is clear evidence that the earnings of tertiary graduates are substantially higher than the earnings of those in our community who have not had a tertiary education. There were that 700,000 graduates in Australia in 1989-90 who earned a mean gross annual income of $42,700 compared with a community average, which included the average of the graduates, of $28,920. So university education proVided those people with a bonus in their income earning capacity. I have a view that university education should be available to all; that university education should be provided in a way that all who get it pay for it. Before explainfng how I believe that should happen, let us look at primary and secondary education. It is quite clear that primary and secondary education, and even kindergarten education, should be available to everyone. It should be universally available, it should be free and it should be availed of by all. To the extent that such education is free, the freedom should be a freedom to receive that education at whatever qualified institution one wishes, whether a state school or an we independent school. Every parent should receive,on behalf of a child undergoing that primary or secondary education, a full value credit to use that credit-.call it voucher if you will-at whatever institution the parent chooses as being the appropriate place for that child to be educated. Then we would have a truly universal, compulsory and free system of education. We should not continue to use people's choice of different educational institutions as an indirect means of taxing them. We need a fundamental reform of the tax system, the system under which we deliver the value of free education to every child, society having appropriately said that that education, up to a certain level, shall be compulsory. Beyond the compulsory level, we need to ask ourselves whether there is anything different. Are we going to say that postsecondary education is available to all but will not be availed of by all because it is not going to be compulsory? If it is available to all, all people should have the opportunity and means of paying for it. We should not limit the number of places at universities to a number 50,000 less than those who want to go. We have to change the funding arrangements so that all those who want to avail themselves of post-secondary education, or post-compulsory education-however one chooses to describe it-can have that education. Furthermore, we need to have a system under which they can afford to have that education. Dr Chapman, in his report Austudy: Towards a More Flexible Approach, had some interesting observations to make. In relation to Austudy, he said: There is little doubt that the current arrangements sometimes target ineffectually, basically because there is relatively little sensitivity shown to the varied financial needs and circumstances of the potential clientele. The essential challenge for reform is to improve the targeting so as to ensure that the right amount of assistance is delivered those who most need it. I agree. I agree that every student going to a post-compulsory educational institution needs assistance. Assistance should be available to every student going to those institutions. Whether it is for living allowances or for fees, under our present HECS arrangement students pay about 20 per cent, on average, of the cost of their education; Dr Chapman went on to talk about that aspect too. He said: ... governments need to be concerned with postcompulsory education because the education process delivers major benefits to society. The challenge is to understand the nature of these benefits, why government intervention might be needed to maximise them, and what forms this intervention should take to. ensure maximum effectiveness I am not convinced that the way of government intervention to achieve maximum benefits for society is through providing financial assistance to those who go to tertiary institutions and making it available free and at public expense-at the expense of many who do not have the skills or the opportunity or who do not make the choice to go to tertiary institutions. Where do I go from there? I argue that the fees that should be charged to students should be the full cost of their education at postcompulsory institutions. Shock, horror! People would say, 'How would students pay for it?'. Students would pay for it in exactly the same way as they pay now under the HECS arrangement. We are moving to a system where we are. lowering the general level of taxation. Those who benefit from public expenditure should, as they benefit and as their incomes rise 48 per cent above the average income, be prepared to reimburse society for the resources that were expended upon them. I do not believe that it is necessarily appropriate to say to other taxpayers that because they get some benefit from those who go to universities, they should be paying taxes for them. The amount of that benefit is a quite arbitrary assessment. Similarly, I believe that every student should be granted an Austudy living allowance and that it should be recoverable under to the HECS system. Whether that student is supported by family or by his or her own efforts, by taking part time or full time work at the time or before he enters his or her university course, should be a matter of individual choice. Whilst I read a lot of interesting things in Dr Chapman's report, I feel that to some extent he has been locked in by the tunnel vision that we have that society must make some payment towards the cost of education. What society should be doing is using its resources to ensure that those who undertake post-compulsory education have the means to pay for it. That would be a public sector cost, because we would have to pay for that education while people are undertaking it, we would have to pay for those students' living allowances while they are doing their study and then recover it in the future. If we moved to a system whereby there was full cost recovery, by the Government providing that education and charging it through HECS or an equivalent system to the Austudy arrangements, I am sure the Government could encourage everyone who wished and had the ability to undertake post-secondary education to complete their courses for the benefit of the nation and make the contribution to society that Dr Chapman talks about. For some time. I have been arguing that there is a need for us to look at a fundamental reshaping of - e general settlement that exists between government and people. There needs to be a change in the relationship between individuals and the state. That changed settlement, that changed social contract, for the 1990s and into the next century should be based on three key principles. Firstly, there should be a key principle that the taxation regime in this country should increasingly reflect the notion that capacity to pay is a function not just of income but also of the extent to which that income is used to meet important social responsibilities and the extent to which the community has invested above the community standard in the generation of that income. If we were to adopt that principle, and adopt it fully, we would have to do so on the basis of a taxpayer having an income life cycle. In those circumstances, people could pay according to their capacity to pay and could draw on the system according to their need-whether they were a student or whether they were choosing to educate their children in private schools. The whole principle could go on right across the range of social expenditures. The second principle upon which this new social compact should be based should be a moral principle that there is a fundamental responsibility in any civilised community to ensure that individuals, if they are able, pay their own way and discharge their duties towards dependent others. Individuals who discharge these duties should not be disadvantaged for doing for themselves what society would otherwise have to do for them. Often if we do something for ourselves we pay the taxes to meet the social expenditure of many others whose incomes are greater than oUr own. The tax system needs that fundamental change on the basis that it is a moral responsibility of every citizen to meet his or her social expenditures, health expenditures, retirement income expenditures, education expenditures and expenditure for dependants. But meeting those expenditures causes a reduction in the capacity to pay tax over a life cycle. That incapacity to pay should be fully recognised. The only tax burden that should be imposed upon people in accordance with that arrangement is that which relates to those who could not afford to meet those social responsibilities. The third and final principle upon which the compact should be based is the administrative principle that it is not necessary for government to collect taxes from the self-reliant and then give it back to them in cash or kind, or to own and operate hospitals, schools or superannuation funds. People should be left with their own resources to spend them as they choose, provided they meet their social responsibilities, which should be clearly spelled out as a part of a new social compact between government and individuals.",17
6,Mr BALDWIN,STUDENT ASSISTANCE,"I wish to make a few brief comments in summing up the debate. It seems that all speakers in this debate have expressed support for the legislation before the House, so I thank all honourable members for that. Howev(1f, we have the usual rhetorical points that come up in debate. The sort of rhetoric we find in the amendment moved by the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) is consistent with motions he has moved on previous occasions when education matters have been debated in this House. His amendment states: . . . the House condemns the Government for its failure to adequately address the problems in the administration and targeting of student financial assistance . . . I would have thought that over the last few years we had, in a fairly comprehensive way, moved to achieve a better targeting of Austudy assistance. Over the last couple of Budgets we have made a number of very significant reforms, including those that liberalise the operation of the parental income test. We have extended Austudy eligibility to a broader range of courses and course combinations than were available before. We have made the scheme more flexible by allowing students completing their education to receive Austudy for an additional period. A whole range of increrpental improvements have been made to Austudy in the couple of Budgets preceding the most recent one. But in this most recent Budget we have announced rather more comprehensive reforms to the student financial assistance arrangements. Those reforms were based on a number of reports. We had the report from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. Its report made a series of recommendations which have been considered very seriously by government, and a number of those have been picked up. We also commissioned Dr Chapman of the ANU to look in a more fundamental way at the structure of student assistance and to tackle some of the more difficult issues to do with the way the scheme was targeted. Some of those issues are conceptually quite complex and difficult, and we recognise the need at this time to look in a fundamental way at the structure of Austudy. The changes that have been announced in the Budget, of which this legislation implements an important part, flowed from Dr Chapman's report. I do not see how we can be accused of failing to address the problem of targeting Austudy, given the sorts of initiatives we have undertaken over the past couple of years. We have made incremental improvements and we have taken action in. response to the very thorough review by Dr Chapman. I take this opportunity to say that I think the final report from Dr Chapman was an excellent piece of analysis that has proved very useful to government. I place on record the Government's thanks to Dr Chapman for his work. I refer briefly to what the honourable member for Goldstein said in respect of what happened earlier in the year when we had before us Dr Chapman's draft report. That draft report proposed not an optional trade-in loan arrangement of the kind that is being implemented in this legislation. The original draft of Dr Chapman's report advocated that students, after the second or third year of study, would be required to substitute a loan for their grant payment. The Government's view was that that had some significant problems, and I thought it appropriate to place that on record. I do not think it would be possible to say, as the honourable member for Goldstein said at the time, that that earlier version of Dr Chapman's recommendations was unambiguously progressive. I do not see how a scheme could be unambiguously progressive when a number of students who are the beneficiaries of maximum Austudy payments would be required to substitute their grant for a loan. Clearly, a person from a low socio-economic background will be more averse to the incurring of substantial liabilities than somebody from a relatively wealthy background. So if we require a student to substitute a loan for the grant, I think it is wrong to say that that is unambiguously progressive. This legislation gives students an option. If students want to stay with the grants scheme, they can do that. We have tried to counter the claim that this is the thin edge of the wedge by including specific provision for the regular indexation of the maximum grant in accordance with CPI. That commitment that the Government has given is embodied in this piece of legislation. We are not in the business of freezing or winding down the Austudy grants scheme. We believe that, for it to be a genuinely equitable scheme, the grants element in it has to remain central. We also believe that providing students with the option of accessing additional income support while they study through the voluntary loan arrangement embodied in the supplement is a significant improvement. It will mean that students who might otherwise have to seek part time work or who might otherwise need to withdraw from study, because in some cases they might be on less than the maximum Austudy payment, will now have an option that may make the difference between being able to progress at the maximum rate, take on a very heavy workload and focus on their studies instead of having to fossick around for part time work. I think that degree of flexibility is an unambiguous improvement. The supplement is one element in a number of substantial improvements to Austudy that were announced in the Budget. We seek to bring down the age of independence from 25 to 22. Clearly, it was absurd to presume that somebody at the age of 25 was fully dependent on his or her parents. I would have liked to have corrected that anomaly earlier, but it is a quite expensive measure. The savings that have been generated, by the introduction of the supplement, based on the assumption that a proportion of students will forgo their grant in order to access the supplement, have enabled us to make a number of these structural improvements in the Austudy grants scheme, including reducing the age of independence from 25 to 22 and further to liberalise the personal income test, which has already been substantially liberalised. We are adding another $1,000 to the aIJlount that students can earn without forgoing any capacity to access Austudy payments. We have made one significant addition to the proposal set out in Dr Chapman's report by making the Austudy supplement available to a significant number of stlJdents who are ineligible for any form of Austudy. In other words, some students who do not have any grant to trade-in at all will be able to access up to $2,000 in the form of the highly concessional loan arrangement with the zero real interest rate in the income contingent repayment mech-nism which cuts in only after five years.' A significant number of students who are currently ineligible for any form of Austudy assistance will be able to access that financing facility. I think that enables us to provide quite worthwhile-and useful assistance to a nUmber of students who currently cannot get any assistance. I think that addition to what Dr Chapman proposed in' his report represents a further significant improvement. ' Dr Kemp-He recommended that the assets test be looked at.",20
7,Mr BALDWIN,STUDENT ASSISTANCE,"The assets test is an essential element in the scheme to ensure that it is properly targeted. Much of the concern about the Austudy scheme is related to the fact that some people with quite substantial means but relatively low taxable income accessing the scheme, and that they really should not be if their genuine means and capacity are to be taken as the criterion. The Government has thought very carefully about this issue. Clearly there is a degree of minimisation of taxable income through various devices, whether it be negative gearing or whether it be passing income through companies or trusts. Clearly those issues need to be under constant review. We asked Coopers and Lybrand to look at that issue and to look at practically and administratively feasible ways in which that problem could be addressed. It is not as easy as it seems on the surface. There is a range of administrative and practical problems, but we have made a first step in tightening up the definition of taxable income by seeking to include fringe benefits from calendar year 1994. I think all in' all this is a key part of the Government's response to two very major surveys and reviews of the effectiveness of the student income support scheme that have been undertaken in the last couple of years. The latter, that undertaken by Dr Chapman, was explicitly sought by the Government. The net effect of these changes is that that there will be a significant increase in the grants that will be available next year. Next year We expect that the total funds available to students for income support purposes will increase by 20.7 per cent over what was available in 1991-92-an increase of almost $300m in one year in the amount of money available to students for income support while studying. I think that is a pretty good enhancement of the existing arrangement. Although, admittedly, there was some turbulence from student groups, once the students were made aware of what in specific terms the Government was proposing, I believe that the overwhelm-g majority of them saw these changes as being beneficial to students.

8,Mr COSTELLO,NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY,"Higgins) (11.13 a.m.)In November 1991 the parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority tabled its evaluation of the Authority in a report entitled Who is to Guard the Guards? The report supported the continued existence and activities of the National Crime Authority, but raised some serious doubts as to the adequacy of the accountability mechanisms in place under the National Crime Authority Act 1984. As a response to that, legislation has now come before the House to increase the accountability mechanisms under the Act. I see the Chairman of the parliamentary Joint Committee, the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay), here. I congratulate him and his Committee on the report. The report has a lot of very good recommendations and it has led to an improvement in this legislation. The decisions of the National Crime Authority are subject to review under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. Its work is monitored by the Inter-Governmental Committee, which consists of responsible Ministers from each State and Territory and the Commonwealth. The NCA is subject to the provisions of freedom of information legislation. But, besides all of these adrriinistrative bilities, there still is a necessity for more accountability through the .parliamentary Committee and, indeed, through the Inspector General, which is proposed in the National Crime Authority Amendment Bill (No.2). Pursuant to subsection 51(3) a member of the National Crime Authority or its staff cannot be required by a court to produce any document that has come into his or her custody in the course of the performance of duties under the Act, or to divulge to a court a matter that has come to his or her notice in the performance of his or her duties under the Act. There has been considerable argument about whether these provisions of section 51 apply to information sought by the parliamentary Joint Committee; that is, if the parliamentary Joint Committee seeks information from an officer of the National Crime Authority, is the National Crime Authority officer obliged by section 51 not to divulge it? The Government apparently is of the view that such an officer would be so obliged, for in August 1990 the Chairtnan of the parliamentary Joint Committee received an undated letter from the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) which advised: There is obviously a large area concerning operational matters within which NCA witnesses would be entitled, if pressed, to restrict disclosure out of regard f9r the prohibition in section 51. ' The Attorney-General relied on an opinion from the Solicitor-General, 'Dr Gavan Griffith. The Clerk of the Senate has come to a different view-the view that it could not be otherwise than in accordance with law to provide information to a parliamentary committee and, indeed, that to provide information to a parliamentary committee would in fact be for a purpose of the Act setting up the parliamentary Joint Committee. Discourse between the National Crime Authority and its other supervisorymechanism, the Inter-Governmental Committee, is also restricted by the NCA Act. Subsection 59(5) prohibits the NCA from furnishing to the Inter-Governmental Committee any matter the disclosure of which to members of the public could prejudice the safety or reputation of persons or the operation of law enforceaccountament agencies. So, as the NCA Act currently stands, neither of the bodies charged with the responsibility of supervising the activities of the NCA has a right of unrestricted access to its information. Indeed, it was this situation that led the parliamentary Joint Committee in its report to voice strong concerns about the lack of accountability. In the light of these concerns the parliamentary Joint CoIlllhittee recommended in its report that the National Crime Authority Act be amended to give the parliamentary Joint Committee unrestricted access to NCA information, but that some restrictions be placed on what in camera information that was received frbm the NCA could then be disclosed by the parliamentary Joint Committee. This is a sensible recommendation. Those who are to supervise the operations of an organisation need to be able to find out information about what it is doing and about how it is operating. Without information, close supervision is not possible .. That there be a free flow of information is important to enable supervision to occur but it is also important to reassure the public that there is accountability in the National Crime Authority by assuring the public tllat the parliamentary Joint Committee as a representative of the Parliament and the Parliament as representative of the people of Australia have the right to obtain information from this governmental agencyAs a second best solution-and this was put forward as a second best solution-the parliamentary Joint Committee recommended that the Act be amended to give the Joint Committee access to all information other than sensitive information. The Committee said that this category should be defined. It did not go into how sensitive information should be defined and how the second best option would work. Paragraph 7.58 said: The Committee understands that the main concern of the Government and the JGC is over the Committee's access to information that is variously described as 'sensitive' or 'operational' .. The Committee considers that the NCA Act should be amended to define this category of information. I raise this because the Bill that has been brought into the Parliament by the Government proposes to implement what the Joint Committee considered to be the second best option. The proposal to amend section 55(2) provides that the parliamentary Committee, in the performance of its dutieS, is entitled to request the NCA to produce to it any document held by the NCA, or to divulge or communicate any information held by the NCA, except to the extent that it is sensitive information. The Bill defines sensitive information as: ... information' ... the disclosure of which might prejudice: (a) the safety or reputation of a person; or (b) the fair trial of a person . . . (c) the effectiveness of an investigation by the Authority; (d) the operations of law enforcement agencies;"". When the Committee requests access to information, the NCA can refuse it on the grounds that it is sensitive, as defined. The proposal of the Government goes on to allow a request by the Committee to be made to the Attorney-General, who can either decide the matter for himself or refer it to the Inspector General. The point I want to make is that when the parliamentary Committee, in a very good report, came down in favour of higher and better accountability for the Natidnal Crime Authority, and when it looked at how that would be facilitated, it put forward two options: a best option and a second option. The Government has proposed the second best option. The Opposition has not· settled and never will settle for second best options. The Opposition believes, in accordance with what was found by an all-party committee-the p-rliamentary Joint Committee-that this Parliament ought to implement the best option. When a parliamentary committee that comprises members from the IJouse of Representative and from the Senate, and members from the Labor Party, the Liberal Party, the National Party and the Australian Demo.crats-a rather large. committee, with all complexions of view in the Parliamentcomel'! to an agreement on something, I think the Parliament ought to take it very seriously. There would need to be some very strong reasons why we should implement something that the Committee itself concluded was the second best rather than the best option. In this instance, the Government's proposal, the second best option-that sensitive information be limited when being provided to the Committee-is hot the best solution. In the debate in the Committee of the Whole House, I will move amendments to implement the best option. The amendments that have been circulated in my name propose to implement the report's preferred solution. I should by w-y of background explain how these amendments have been produced and how they came to represent what the Committee found was the best option. The amendments will provide that the parliamentary Committee will have unrestricted access to documents and information held by the National Crime Authority. In the performance of its duty, the Committee will have the power to require the National Crime Authority to produce to it any document or communicate to it any information. Allowing the Committee full access to such information does, of course, raise the possibility, at least the· theoretical possibility, that sensitive information might be disclosed. In the parliamentary Joint Committee's report, it recommended that this should be dealt with by placing restrictions on the disclosure of in camera evidence or information. The report referred to a private member's Bill that had been prepared by Senator Spindler of the Australian Democrats entitled the National Crime Authority (Duties and Powers of Joint Par-iamentary C()mmittee) Amendment Bill, introduced in - December 1990. Senator Spindler had said that information should be unrestricted, but he had proposed in his Bill various restrictions on discIosrlre' of that information. Senator Spindler had said that if there was going to be disclosure the Cotrimittee should notify the National Crime Authority; the National Crime Authority could certify that the information was' sensitive and might prejudice the legal rights of a person; and if such a certificate were issued the informa-ion would. not be disclosed; but if a dispute arose the matter would be referred to a judge of the Federal Court. That was Senator Spindler's proposal. When the parliamentary Joint Committee looked at this issue, it said that it liked tor Spindler's proposal but it required three changes. These changes are set out on page 160 of its report: (a) that the Bill should expressly apply to all fonns of disclosure, not just disclosure in reports to the Parliament; and (b) that the Bill should expressly cover all aspects of disclosure in a dissent by a Committee member to a report by the Committee (c) that the Commonwealth Minister with portfolio responsibility for the Authority should be the arbiter, not a Federal Court judge ... When the parliamentary Committee got to this, it said, 'Yes, we like the idea of all information being given to the parliamentary Joint Committee. We like the idea of protect"" ing rights by putting a certain process on what should be done if disclosure was necessary.We would like to suggest that Senator Spindl-r's Bill be taken as a rudimentary proposal and that it be improved in these three ways'. The funny thing is that on this point the Committee was unanimous, exbept for Senator Spindler, who said that he would accept it, except that he wanted to proceed with having a Federal Court judge as the person who would make the decision rather than a Commonwealth Minister. Here we have.a parliamentary Committee which takes Senator Spindler's Bill and says that it Can be improved in three ways and, with the objection of Senator Spindler in one respect, the Committee is unanimous. The Opposition has taken the parliamentary Committee 'sreport, put' in the changes as recommended' by Senator Spindler, and will propose to the Parliament that what was recommended as the best option by the parliamentary Joint Committee become the law and the way in which accountability is facilitated. I hope that on mature reflection the Government accepts these amendments. If it does not accept these amendments, I hope that Senator Spindler, who after all was the genesis-in this respect, if the Opposition was the Book of Revelation, Senator Spindler was the Book of Genesis-looks at this and realises that this Senais the way in which the Opposition has taken it up, and that he, uninhibited by pride and uninhibited by party discipline, which as we know ranks so strong in the Australian Labor Party, is able to exercise a mature judgment and support us in the Senate. I raise in passing the theoretical issue. We as a parliament can set up an organisation such as the National Crime Authority. Why? Because the Parliament exercises legislative power, it responds to the electors in elections. In a notional sense at least-although I would argue in a practical sense as well-the Parliament represents the people of Australia. We can set up the body and we can supervise it. It is a very troubling argument to put to this Parliament that, although it can set the body up and fund it, its delegated committee should not be able to have unrestricted access in its supervisory function to what this organisation does. It is almost an argument that says to the Parliament, 'Don't trust yourselves. You can set it up, but don't trust yourselves to receive infQrmation from it in exercising your supervisory responsibilities'. The distinction that we draw is really the distinction between the receipt of information and the disclosure of information. We understand that, if we received sensitive information and disclosed it to the world, in certain circumstances precipitate or unwise action could damage reputations and safety. We are proposing to put in place a mechanism that would slow down the procedure and prevent precipitate action. It is very difficult in that wide definition say that the Committee ought to have a restriction on what it receives-not just on what it discloses but on what it receives. It is drawn in a very wide manner, and the more I looked at it the more worded I got. Under the Government's proposal, the Committee would not be entitled to receive sensitive information. The provisions of the Bill state: 'Sensitive information' means any information the disclosure of which mightI do not know what the word 'might' means. Maybe it means on reasonable grounds; maybe it does notprejudice: (a) the safety or reputation of a person. Let me give honourable members an example. Suppose the Committee sought informati<;>n on the conduct in an official capacity of the NCA Chairman and the NCA says, 'Oh, that's the information the disclosure of which might prejudice the reputation of a person, namely the NCA Chairman'. That would be an open construction; it is drafted very widely. This is no theoretical matter. I am not suggesting for a moment that the Committee would or should be interested in matters of notoriety or matters that relate to the private affairs of people, but it may well be that in the course of one's deliberations one thinks that the Chairman-and I am not suggesting this applies to anybody, real or imagined-has acted in a particular way that is not in the best interests of the National Crime Authority. Maybe it is an administrative matter. It may be that one thinks the Chairman has not promoted on merit or has implemented a system of nepotism within the National Crime Authority. Let us say that someone requests information and the NCA says, 'Oh, that's information the disclosure of which might prejudice the reputation of a person, namely the Chairman'. That seems to me to be an open argument. Bear in mind, of course, that the person requesting the information is coming from the dark, and when the NCA is taking the defence that person does not even know what the information is. In that circumstance, one would say, 'Oh well, the matter can be reto ferred to the Commonwealth Attorney-General and the Commonwealth Attorney will intervene'. That would presumably be the argument. But, as we all know, Ministers tend to be creatures of their department, some more than others. It is a very rare Minister who overrules an agency or a department. I would much prefer to have the committee in a position where it could access the information prima facie and, indeed, require the information. I Know that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General (Mr Duncan) is a noted civil libertarian. He must have great difficulty with the situation that the Attorney has fronted him with on this particular Bill. He is in a situation where, if he rejects these amendments, he has to say, 'Well, we think the Parliamentary Committee should be restricted in receiving information'. He, of course, likes to think of himself as one of the enfants terrible of the administration of law and justice in the 1980s, a man of great civil libertarian principles and tendencies. Internalon ly he must be a mass of convulsions and contradictions over this particular piece of legislation. But in his heart he knows we are right on this. He knows that the Parliamentary Committee should be given that particular access to information. I will describe in more detail when we come to the committee stage how our amendment would work, but that gives an overview. I want to come now to the question of the establishment of the office of the Inspector General. The Opposition welcomes the Government's proposal to amend the NCA Act to establish the new office of Inspector General as another positive step towards ensuring that the NCA is properly accountable for its actions. Clause 10 of the Bill will insert a new part IlIA into the Act to make provision for the office of Inspector-General of the National Crime Authority. The Inspector-General's principal function will be to investigate complaints lodged by the public about the actions of members or staff of the National Crime Authority. Division 2 will provide for the receipt and investigation of individual complaints by the Inspector General. The Inspector-General will be ob-· liged to investigate all complaints, except those which he comes to the conclusion are frivolous or vexatious and, having regard to all the circumstances, do not warrant an inquiryDivision 3 will deal with the conduct of the inquiries. The Inspector-General will be required to inform the Commonwealth Attorney-General and the chairperson of the NCA before commencing an investigation. His inquiries will be conducted in private and will not be subject to formal procedural requirements. The Inspector-General will be entitled to compel the ,production of information and documents and to make such use of the information as may be needed for the purposes of the investigation. He will be entitled to compel people to attend before him and give evidence on oath or affirmation. A person will be entitled to refuse to give information or answer a question if there is a reasonable excuse for doing so. 'Reasonable excuse' is not defined in the Bill. However, examining the Bill it seems that the reasonable excuse exception would, subject to subclause 55AR(1)(e), authorise a person to refuse to give information, produce a document or answer a question on the ground that to do so would involve a breach of legal professional privilege. I am raising here the point as to whether it would be a reasonable excuse to disclose a document or information on the grounds that that would be a breach of legal professional privilege. We would like to keep that, and we have come to the conclusion that the Act preserves legal professional privilege. If the Government has come to a different conclusion, it had better state it now because we will try to amend the Bill. It is a well understood rule of statutory construction that a statute is not read as abrogating important common law rights, including legal professional privilege, save to the extent directed by express words or necessary implication. Apart from 55AR(1)(e), which expressly abrogates legal professional privilege in respect of legal advice given to a Minister, a department or authority of the Commonwealth, there are no provisions in the Bill which evince an intention to abrogate legal professional privilege in regard to the Inspector-General's powers under clauses 55AN and 55AO. On the contrary, the fact that the draftsmen considered it necessary to include subclause 55AR(1)(e) in the Bill implies that a claim for legal professional privilege falls within the reasonable excuse exception. A person will not be excused from furnishing information, producing a document or answering a question on the ground that it might tend to incriminate. However, such information, document or answer will not be admissible 'in any criminal proceedings. The Opposition considers this restriction too narrow. It would not, for example, prevent the answer from being used against a person in civil proceedings. Under the equivalent Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act that applies to the intelligenc- agencies, the restriction on the use of an incnminating answer compulsorily obtained by the Inspector-General is broader. It cannot be used in evidence against the person in any court, or in any proceedings before a person authorised to hear evidence. That would give immunity from the use of the answer in disciplinary proceedings. Mr Lindsay-Would people use that as a device?",23
9,Mr COSTELLO,NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY,"I will explain this to the honourable member in a moment. We twigged to this and we raised it with the Department. The Department accepted our answer and the Government will move an amendment to that in due course. So the Chairman of the Committee, the honourable member for Herbert, had better not speak too loudly against the proposition I was just putting, because in a moment he is going to vote fodt. We welcome the fact that the Government adopted that. We take it that there was a legislative drafting oversight. It now means that, in this respect, the protection, or the immunity, is the same for dealings with the Inspector-General under the security provisions as it is under the National Crime Authority provisions. That is the way it should be. We will support the Government. We thank the Government for coming forward with that amendment, as we raised it with the· Government. The Inspector-General will be required to prepare an annual report-and those provisions are in the Act-to the Commonwealth Attorney-General commenting on the investigations that have been made, which report should be tabled in the House. We believe that the National Crime Authority should be made accountable. We believe that there is a need to increase its accountability. We welcome the recommendations made by the parliamentary Joint Committee. We support the Governrilent bringing forward, as a result of those recommendations, the proposals for the Inspector-General, but we do .not settle for second best. On the question of disclosure, the Opposition says, 'Why not the best?'. I pose that question to the Chairman himself. We can do better on the question of accountability. In the committee stage, we will move amendments to secure that.",28
10,Mr LINDSAY,NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY,"The honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) came to this House with a highly deserved and well-earned reputation as a skilful barrister at the Victorian Bar. Indeed, his verbal essay on some of the aspects of this National Crime Authority Amendment Bill (No.2) 1992 do him credit in that capacity. Despite the honourable member's use of the words from page 160 of the report that the parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority regarded the first option as the preferred option and it regarded the second option as the second best, he is being somewhat mischievous in his proposed amendments. The honourable member for Higgins knows as well as I do that the responsible Liberal Ministers in New South Wales, Tasmania and the Northern Territory-and I expect also in Victoria-would never agree to the proposed amendments being put forward by him. He knows full well that that is the case. I ask the rhetorical question as to what he would do if he were the Attorney-General: would he be standing in this House moving the kinds of amendments that he proposes to move in the committee stage? This is an important piece of legislation. I am very pleased that, in general, the Opposition is supporting these amendments. The Bill introduces a number of important amendments to the National Crime Authority Act 1984. The amendments are apparently developed from the Government's response to the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, Who is to Guard the Guards 7. Although I do not intend to speak on each amendment, I would like to make some remarks on a few issues. First, I refer to the establishment of the office of Inspector-General of the National Crime Authority. His task will be to investigate complaints against the Authority or its staff. I pay tribute to the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) for his assistance in the development of this concept through the Joint Committee. Obviously, his experience in the House and as a Minister in a previous government stood the Committee well in developing this concept. In the course of the Committee's evaluation of the National Crime Authority, a number of witnesses suggested that, in addition to the parliamentary Joint Committee, other bodies could be given the role of investigating complaints against the Authority or its staff. For example, it was suggested that appropriate bodies could include the Commonwealth Ombudsman, a police complaints authority, the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, or a body similar to that which exists in the Criminal Justice Commission in Queensland. Other mechanisms were also suggested. At present complaints against the Authority are investigated and dealt with in a variety of ways. For example, the parliamentary Joint Committee, the Inter-Governmental Committee, the Attorney-General and the Authority itself playa role in this regard. Section SO of the National Crime Authority Act 1984 provides: The Attorney-General may appoint a legal practitioner to assist the Authority as counsel, either generally or in relation to a particular matter matters. In July 1989, the Authority issued a press statement headed 'NCA Drug Inquiry'. That was an inquiry into an alleged impropriety of Authority staff. The counsel conducting the inquiry was assisted by an Australian Federal Police officer and a Victoria Police officer, both of whom were attached to the Authority. I might add for the record that the investigation team found no evidence of impropriety by Authority staff on that issue. i The point I am making is that at present there is a wide variety of ways in which complaints are being dealt with; hence the need for this legislation. Although few complaints against the Authority or its staff have been brought to the attention of the parliamentary Joint Committee for investigation, the fact is that the parliamentary Joint Committee does not have the time or resources to deal adequately with individual complaints. The previous Chairman of the Authority, Mr Justice Phillips, favoured a system of inquiry outside the Authority for handling serious complaints. In the report Who is to Guard the Guards?, the Parliamentary Joint Committee recommended that the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security be given jurisdiction to investigate complaints against the Authority, its staff and those seconded to work for it. Furthermore, the Committee took the view that, if it were necessary to set up a new agency, it should be adequately resourced and that the procedures in dealing with complaints should be simple and able to be proceeded with expeditiously. I am very pleased that the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) has decided to adopt that recommendation and establish this new office of Inspector-General of the National Crime Authority. In practice, that responsibility will be carried out by the occupant of the office of Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. Although the Inspector-General of the National Crime Authority will not have the broad monitoring function which he has in his other capacity in relation to intelligence and security agencies, the Inspector-General of the National Crime Authority will investigate complaints against members or staff of the or National Crime Authority but will not be entitled to initiate an investigation on his own motion, in accordance with proposed section SSAE(2). The general monitoring of the work of the Authority will remain the responsibility of the parliamentary Joint Committee and also the Commonwealth-State Intergovernmental Committee. Moreover, the Inspector-General will investigate complaints only where they cannot be dealt with satisfactorily under complaints legislation or procedures applicable to a police force from which the possible subject of the complaint has been seconded to the Authority; that is to say, that where there are other mechanisms available, for example, dealing with complaints against police who have been seconded to the Authority, such officers should generally remain subject to the appropriate procedures in relation to their home forces. Indeed, I envisage there would be substantial difficulty, jurisdictional and practical, in setting in place, a complaints procedure in relation to NCA staff which included seconded police, where such persons are subject to their home force complaints arrangements. The Government's intention is that the office of Inspector-General of the National Crime Authority should operate as a highly visible complaints authority, able to handle matters which cannot be dealt with by other means. I think it is also important that the Inspector-General should be seen in. a highly visible way so people do have knowledge that there is an Inspector-General of the Authority to deal with complaints. The other issue, of course, is that the primary function of the Inspector-General of the National Crime Authority will be to investigate complaints about action- of members of the Authority and its staff. ill this regard he is to report on the investigations he conducts to the chairperson or chairman of the National Crime Authority and to the Min-ster administering the National Crime Authority Act, in this case the Attorney-General. I am pleased t9 note that under section 55AZH it is proposed that the Inspector-General will report to the Minister oil the operations of Inspector-General-that is, his office-during the year ended 30 June each year and that, in addition, the Minister must table a copy of ea-h report in each House of the Parliament as soon as practicable after, the report is received by the Minister. I am also pleased to note that one of the functions of the parliamentary Joint Committee in these amendments will be to examine each annual report of the Inspector-General and report to both Houses of the Parliament on any matter appearing in or arising out of any such annual report. It should be said during this debate that the Inspector-General will be able to investigate complaints made to him either orally or in writing by the public, whether made directly to him or through the Intergovernmental COinmittee or the PJC. Although he has power to require people to adduce their complaints in writing, if he is to proceed with them, the fact is that the Inspector-General will retain a wide discretion to assess whether complaints can be dealt with satisfactorily under alternative procedures, for example, Commonwealth or State legislation, and he also has a wide discretion to assess whether complaints warrant investigation by him-in other wo-ds, that they are not frivolous, vexatious or trivial. I now tum to other .innovative changes contained in these amendments, namely, the establishment of a review process in relation to the provision of sensitive information to the PJC. The honourable member for Higgins has spoken at length on clause 9 of the Bill. Indeed, as he said, he proposes to put forward amendments. Let me say what clause 9 does. It repeals existing section 55(2), which prohibits the parliamentary Joint Committee from investigating a matter relating to a relevant criminal activity, a term which is defined in the principal Act, or of reconsidering the findings of the Authority in relation to a particular investigation. Section 55(2) was considered at length in the parliamentary Joint Cotruplttee's evaluation report. Indeed, the previous Chairman of the National Crime Authority, Mr Justice Phillips, stated that there was 'an arguable the case' for the removal of the .words under section 55(2)(a) 'a matter relating to', which would have the effect of removing inappropriate limitations on the parliamentary .Ioint Committee. I should add that a distinguished Victorian barrister, Mr Merkel, QC, through the Victorian Council for Civil Liberties and its appearance before the parliamentary Joint Conupittee, had this to say: Section 55(2) should be repealed. We say that is the mischief that has been caused to the system and we say that, if accountability is to exist at all, it is imperative that the limitations on the power of the Committee to fulfil its functions be lifted. We say that all the niceties of how this should be done are very easily resolved: you repeal section 55(2), . , Whilst the Committee rejected the advice froni the Victorian Council for Civil Liberties, the Committee recognised that there had to be some limitations placed with respect to information held by the National Crime Authority. I believe that the new subsection (2) provides a suitable framework for the parliamentary Joint Committee to obtain information sufficient to enable the parliamentary Joint Committee to reasonably perform its statutory responsibilities. The new subsection (2) sets out the procedure by which information sought by the parliamentary Joint Committee can be obtained and also includes an important role for the Inspector-General of the National Crime Authority to advise the Minister, when requested by' him, as to whether or not documents or information sought by the parliamentary Joint Committee contains sensitive information, which is defined in section 3 of the Bill, as to whether it should reasonably be withheld frorn the parliamentary Joint Committee. Ultimately, of course, it is for the Minister to decide as to the release of such material. It is all very well for the hOQourable ber for Higgins to behave, I would respectfully suggest to him, quite mischievously in promoting the first alternative. He knows full well that there would be serious objections from his colleagues in Victoria, New South Wales, Tasmania and the Northern Territory as to the adoption of the amendments proposed by him. Although the Committee as a whole did prefer another option, the practical situation and, as we said, the second best solution-I wish we had never used those words-is that we proceed down the path as set out in the Bill. For that reason I am constrained and I support wholeheartedly the amendments contained in clause 9 of the Bill. I congratulate the Attorney-General and officers of the Attorney-General's Department on the diligence and speed with which they have developed amendments in accordance with the Government's response to the evaluation report of the parliamentary Joint Committee. I congratulate them. I believe amendments are sensibly drafted, they .are practical, they will be accepted by the members of the Intergovernmental Committee and I believe that they will work in practice. As the Minister said in his second reading speech when introducing the Bill, the National Crime Author-ty Act -984 will require refinement from time to time, and if we do meet hurdles in applying the provisions of these amendmentS or any other section of the Act then of course we would expect the Government to respond by either removil1g or adding to the Act to ensure that the work of the parliamentary Joint Committee procee¢; in a way which meets the expectations of the Australian community. I wholeheartedly support the Bill. I again would like to record my gratitude to members of the National Crime Authority parliamentary Joint Committee for the way in which they contributed to the development of these processes. Again I mention the right honourable member for New England who was most helpful in putting forward the propositions in the report which are now being incorporated into legislation.",28
11,Mr FILING,NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY,"I, too, a9knowledge the work of the right honmem- ourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) towards the objective and the end result of having the Act amended to provide for all Inspector-General of the National Crime Authority. I concur with the comments of the Chairman, the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay), on the work that was undertaken by the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority. I acknowledge the tremendous work that has been done by him in this area and in· the evaluation report, which is a very important document. I think the Committee excelled in providing the Parliament with a very substantial overview and review of the operations of the National Crime Authority. The purpose of this Bill, to which I have already alluded, is to establish the office of Inspector-General of the NCA to provide for inquiries into complaints against the National Crime Authority and to clarify which information from the Authority·the parliamentary that the Joint Committee can have access to. I will briefly go over the history of the Authority because I think it is important in this context. The Authority was established in 1984. We recall back in those days the royal commissions into organised crime, the various recommendations that came forward from those royal commissions, the long debates over how the National Crime Authority should evolve or should be formed and the question of the accountability of the Authority. The main purpose of the Authority was to conduct investigations into organised crime. The Authority came into being by agreement between the relevant Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers. The Inter-Governmental Committee, which comprises Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers, was set up to oversee the general operation of the NCA. At the same' time, as a result of the debates in the Parliament, the Parliamentary Joint Committee was also set up to provide a parliamentary oversight of the operations of the NCA. The National Crime Authority undertakes two types of investigations: special investigations and general investigations. The special investigations are based on referrals from the Commonwealth, State or Territory Ministers in consultation with the Inter-Governmental Committee. In empowering the NCA to conduct these inquiries, the Parliament gave the NCA some substantial coercive powersin particular, the power to force people to appear before the Authority to give evidence and to produce documents. These are powers that are far in excess of the traditional police powers that have been in existence in the Commonwealth, States and Territories before the setting up of the NCA. Since the establishment of the NCA in June 1991, there have been 12' references for special inquiries and these have ranged through tax evasion, importation and distribution of narcotics, bribery, corrUption and murder. As I mentioned, the special investigations usually involve more than one category of offences. The general investigations are initiated by the Authority. The difficulty has always been in the question of accountability of performancethe difficulty of assessing how the Authority is performing its duties because of the nature of its inquiries and the need for some confidentiality or secrecy of aspects of the Authority's inquiries. The other aspect is that, ty; and because of the comparative lack of data on the spread of organised crime within Australia, it is very difficult to compare the statistical results of the NCA vis-.a-vis the organised criminal activity undertaken in the country. The accountability, as I have mentioned, is jointly undertaken by the Inter-Governmental Committee and the Parliamentary Joint Committee. The latter body has, over a number of years, been critical of its lack of access to documents and evidence that would make its work more effective- I would like to tum to the report and read how the Authority, in its submission, viewed the NCA's accountability. In particular, it said: The NCA's work is monitored both by the InterGovernmental Committee and, of course, by the . Parliamentary Joint Committee on the NCA, established by the Commonwealth Parliament expressly for that purpose. In the evaluation undertaken by the parli-­ mentary Joint Standing Committee a number of recommendations were made, in particular recommendation No.3, which states: that the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security be given jurisdiction to investigate complaints against the Authority, its staff and those seconded to work fo- it. This is an important recommendation which attempts to deal with the problems where there are. individual complaints against the Authority and its staff, which neither the PJC nor the IGC are in a position to investigate, and also in areas where clearly the opportunity to retain the confidentiality of secrecy must be preserved. That recommendation was an important one. I again commend the right honourable member for New England for his tremendous contribution towards that end. Recommendation No. 5 deals with the changes to section 55(2)(a) and 55(2)(b) of the NCA Act. It states: . (a) that paragraph 55(2)(a) of the NCA Act be amended by deleting the words 'a matter relating to'; (b) that paragraph 55(2)(b) be amended to make it clear that the expression 'findings' refers only to major matters formally declared by the Authority to be findings at the time they are made, and does not include all conclusions reached by the Authori(c) that paragraph 55(2)(b) be amended to make clear that it does not prevent the Committee reviewing alleged maladministration within the Authority or the general adequacy of procedures used by the Authority, even if the. end result of the Authority'S use of the procedures is the making of a 'finding' in particular .cases. Recommendation No.6 states: that section 51 of the NCA Act be amended so as to make clear that section 51 does not prevent members and staff of the Authority providing any information or documents to the Committee, or appearing before it. That is probably the most important recommendation of our recommendations from the evaluation report. Recommendation No.' 8, which is an important recommendation, states: that the NCA Act be amended so as to confer a discretion on an Authority member to hold investigative hearings in public. These recommendations are' all designed effectively to make the NCA more accountable and to provide the PJC with the opportunity to ensure that that comes to pass. I want to turn to the question of accountability and, in particular, to refer to the comments made by the honourable member for Herbert in relation to the so-called second best option. I think it is important that we refer again to recommendation No.6: The Committee recommended: 'that section 51 of the NCA Act be amended so as to make clear that section 51 does not ,prevent members and staff of the Authority providing any information OJ; documents to the Committee, or appearing before it. In endeavouring to provide the Committee with the first best option, the amendments proposed by the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) attempt to do so in the following way: (1) Clause 9, page 4, line 23, omit ""request"", substitute ""require"". Clearly, the opportunity for members of the Committee to be able to fulfil their duties properly and to be able to pursue the inquiries that they consider are necessary to ensure that the Authority is properly overseen by the Committee would take away that option of . the Chairman to be able to refuse the request of a COlnmittee member. To that extent, support and concul' with that particular amendment proposed by the honourable The member for Higgins. The second amendment proposal proposed by the honourable member for the Higgins states: Clause 9, page 4, line 27, omit ""except to the extent that it contains, or is, sensitive information"", substitute ""and the Chairperson must comply with the requirement"". Again, this relates back to that question of the second best option. Bearing in mind the recommendation that was made by the Committee, that in order to fulfil the duties imposed on members of the Committee it is important that information that is necessary to the best picture or the fulfilment of a particular inquiry must be available to those members. We are trying to allow the Committee members the opportunity of having access to all information in order for them to fulfil their particular duty. Amendment (3) of the amendments proposed by the honourable member for Higgins states: Clause 9, pages 4 and 5, omit proposed subsections (3), (4), (5) and (6), substitute the following subsections: I would like to go through the procedure that is proposed in the amendments. Subsection (3) would read as follows: If the Committee, or a member of the Committee, considers that it is necessary, in a report to ·the Parliament or otherwise, to disclose: (a) oral evidence taken by the Committee in camera, from persons who, at the time they gave evidence, were officers of the Authority or to provide. a report of such oral evidence; or (b) a document which has been submitted to the Committee by an officer of the Authority and which has been requested by the officer of the Authority or ordered by the Committee to be treated as evidence taken in camera, the Committee or the member of the Committee, as the case may be, must inform the Chairperson in writing of the evidence or the document proIX>sed to be disclosed or provided. I think that speaks for itself as being an eminently reasonable way of ensuritlg that the process can be started in order for that evidence or documentation from the Authority to be able to be disclosed, if it is considered to be J;lecessary in properly informing the ParliaI ment of the performance of the Authority. Amendment (4) states: Chairperson may, within 14 days after a under subsection (3) has been provided ,to Chairperson, certify, by writing signed by the Chairperson and provided to the Committee, that the evidence or the document to which the proposal relates contains, or is, sensitive information. The Chairperson, within 14 days after a proposal under subsection (3) has been provided to the Chairperson, is then given the opportunity of certifying by writing, this certification to be provided to the Committee, that the evidence or the document to which the proposal relates contains, or is,sensitive information. This clearly then allows the Chairperson of the Committee the opportunity to be able to assess the sensitivity or otherwise of that particular information. Amendment (5) states: If a certificate has been so provided by the Chairperson the Committee or a member of the Committee must not, in a report to the Parliament or otherwise, except in accordance with subsection (10) or (12), disclose any evidence or document which is the subject of that certificate. In other words, the Chairman of the Committee has given that opportunity to assess the sensitivity or otherwise of the information. Then the process moves on to allow the following under amendment (10): If the Minister determines under subsection the evidence or document does not contain, or is not, sensitive information, that evidence or document may be disclosed by the Committee in a report to the Parliament by the Committee or in a special report to the Parliament by a member of the Committee. I think it is important to reflect that, in determining what is appropriate to be revealed to the Parliament or otherwise, it is clearly important that the confidential operations or investigations of the Authority are not disclosed in order to render that inquiry or investigation less effective or to reveal information that may otherwise compromise people who are involved in that investigation or who are the subject of that investigation. Clearly there is a need for the Parliament to be able to be informed of areas where there are matters of doubt or concern to members of the Committee who in those circumstances wish to inform the Parliament of those concerns and at the same time be able to use information that they believe is pertinent to that notification to the Parliament in their speech to the Parliament. Amendment (11) states: A special report by a member of the Committee under subsection (10) may be attached to a report by the Committee or may be presented to each House of the Parliament in the absence of a report by the Committee. I think that amendment 11 covers the concerns that have been registered quite a few times in the Parliament in relation to information that was revealed in a minority report to the Parliament on the Operation Ark matter. That matter became a matter of some controversy at the time because it is alleged by Government members on the Committee that, in so presenting that minority report to parliament, the signatories to that report, which included myself, were, I suppose, making the relationship between the Authority and the PJC untenable. I think that my recollection at the time was that the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) made an allegation that the relationship between the Committee and the Chairman had been somehow damaged. Following his speech to the House, he came back and made a personal explanation to inform the House that the Chairman of the Authority had contacted him (7) that to say that that was not the case. So in providing the processes for the opportunity of members to be able to have access to sensitive information, and for members to be in a position to report fully to the Parliament in relation to either minority or full reports or reports that they initiate themselves, I believe that the amendments that will be moved by the honourable member for Higgins are preferable to those that are part of the National Crime Authority Amendment Bill. I commend those amendments which are in the name of the honourable member for Higgins. In conclusion, I would like to make a number of points. They relate overall to the National Crime Authority'S special powers and the opportunity for proper oversight of the operations of the Authority. It has been mentioned that the IGC is supposed to provide that oversight for the National Crime Authority. I want to turn again to the points raised by the Committee in the evaluation report as to the effectiveness of that oversight by the IGC in the history of the NCA to the present. The Committee in its report said at 6.33: The Committee considers that IOC should have paid greater regard to the need to maintain public confidence in the Authority,· and to make public more of the material the IOC receives from the Authority. It also made some criticisms of the lack of frequency of the meetings of the IGC. I see the Chairman nodding in agreement, because that was an important element in the evaluation of the effectiveness of the NCA and also to this question of accountability. The Committee said in paragraph 6.29 that the claim by the IGC: ... that itself provides a better line of responsibility to ensure both the protection of civil liberties and the effective oversight of the operational and functional activities of the NCA .... is difficult to reconcile with the limited activities of the IOC. In the period July 1984 to October 1991, the IOC met on only 16 occasions. This suggests to the Committee that the IOC has taken only a very limited role in monitoring the Authority. In concluding, I must say that if one is to accept the principle that accountability is in the hands of the IGC on the one hand and the PJC on the other, and I suppose having seen the level of oversight provided by the IGC, then there is greater pressure on the parliamentary Joint Committee to provide that oversight. I am sure that the Chairman would agree with that. Since the formation of the NCA and the establishment of the PJC, the question of access of Committee members to information and of their being able to speak to members or staff of the Authority has been a matter for continual criticism. (TIme expired)",31
12,Mr ALDRED,NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY,"This legislation, the Nlltional Crime Authority Amendment Bill (No.2), flows directly out of the report, Who is to Guard the Guards?, prepared by the parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority and published in November 1991. The question posed in the title of the report is invariably a difficult one to confront in respect of any law enforcement body, and is timely, given the concerns raised about the performance of, and alleged corruption in, some such bodies in Australia over the last decade. In respect of the National Crime Al,lthority itself, there has been, of course, an ongoing debate for some time now about its effectiveness, including its prosecution and conviction record. It is to be hoped that the proposed new office of Inspector-General of the NCA will sharpen the organisation's performance and, in that sense, it is a desirable initiative. However, it must be said that many major matters of alleged official corruption remain unattended in this country, which the NCA is empowered to look at if an appropriate reference is given. I wish to raise two such matters today. Prominent among the many scandals of Labor's 10 years maladministration in Victoria was the infamous Continental Airlines affair, in which a significant number of well-known Victorians and other figures were found to have received discounted or free tickets from the airline. The proof of evidence provided by the late Mr Bob Tanfield, former sales manager for Victoria-Tasmania with Continental Airlines in the early 1980s, in respect of his committal for trial on fraud, listed 24 senior Victoria Police officers, public servants and others, who benefited by way of free or discounted tickets for themselves and/or their family members or friends. They included the then Assistant Commissioner, Paul Delianis, who accepted a waiver or free ticket for his wife, Thelma; the then Deputy Commissioner, Eric Mudge, who took two 75 per cent discount tickets to Auckland; the then Assistant Commissioner, Richard Knight, who got two tickets; the then Chief Inspector, Brian Harding, who took two tickets; Senior Sergeant Ron Elliott, who had two tickets; and the then Commander, Phil Bennett, who was given two tickets to Nandi. Apart from the then Deputy Commissioner, Eric Nudge, who resigned, essentially over the Continental Airlines affair, no other police officers or public servants involved had any significant official action, that is known to me, taken against them, though, no doubt, a number were privately cautioned about their actions. This is intriguing, as the Continental Airlines affair was a serious matter and obviously regarded as such in some quarters at the time. On 21 November 1985, the then Assistant Commissioner for Internal Investigations in the Victoria Police, Mr William J. Horman, wrote to Mr Robert Redlich, QC, as follows: Re: Ticket inquiry On Thursday, 21 November, '1985, a meeting took place at Parliament House, Melbourne, involving Minister for Police & Emergency Services, Hon. R. Mathews, Under-Secretary, Mr R. King, Chief Commissioner Mr S.I. Miller and Assistant Commissioner (I.D.D) Mr W.J. Horman and the following matters agreed upon: (1) The police would proceed to establish a computer matchup of a small number of items of information with respect to free and discounted Continental Airline tickets with (1) the police seniority list; (II) a provided list of public and public office holders; (2) Following the 'computer matchup' to be carried out by the Government Computer Centre, the matchup tape would be delivered to the DIEA, Canberra; (3) The DIEA Canberra, would be responsible for undertaking computer programming (estimated by Ms. Jennifer Williams of the Law Department to take three weeks-to be funded other than by the Victoria Police) for the purpose of producing a printolit of overseas travel details matched up with the supplied tape (as per (2) above); (4) that documentation, data tapes and lists shall at all times remain in the possession and under the control of the police; (5) that the use of all such documentation, data, tapes and lists remains under the authority and responsibility of the police; and (6) that the documentation, data, tapes and lists be used exclusively for the purpose of investigation of the police. For your information. That concludes the letter. It was appropriate that the matter be regarded as grave. Mr Tanfield clearly knew the illicit nature of the arrangements he was putting in place, in which .he was initially aided by his friend, the then Chief Superintendent, Bob Stewart, of the Police Research and Development Branch, who was himself another beneficiary of the arrangements. In stating what he had done, Tanfield's proof of evidence reads: I was aware that it was not in accordance with the lATA rules, so I had to be fairly careful who I let on ... Expanding on his use of tickets really only designed for airline staff, Tanfield added: When they came to the office I would fill out one of the forms I had designed for this type of ticket, putting them on as an employer of a particular airline and giving their work address and I.D. number. Though the transgressions of senior Victoria Police officers in the Continental Airlines affair evinced no direct official action against those involved, they parallel other strange events of that time which are also worthy of investigation by the National Crime Authority. I refer, of course, to the odd outcome of the investigation that followed the crucial servants Nunawading province by-election on 17 August 1985, which was a fresh election ordered by the Court of Disputed Returns after the infamous 'draw from the hat' result of 2 March that year. The ultimate result would determine who would control Victoria's Legislative Council. Within a week of polling day Mr Martin Peake, Chairman of the Victorian Nuclear Disarmament Party, lodged an official complaint with Mr Eric Richardson, Chief Electoral Officer of Victoria, about a deceptive NDP how to vote card handed out at the  Nick Nikolaidou, a solicitor, had issued and authorised a misleading how to vote card, that the card confused voters, that members of the Australian Labor Party were recognised handing out this card and that the allocation of preferences to the ALP on the card damaged the NDP. On 29 August 1985 the Chief Electoral Officer referred the NDP complaint to the Victoria Police for investigation and report. An investigation was then commenced byCm members from Nunawading, with Detective Senior Constable Van Maanenberg reporting on 27 September and revealing the following things: (a) a possible conspiracy between Nikolaidou, Peter Batchelor, Secretary of the Victorian Australian Labor Party and persons unknown to mislead or deceive voters. (b) a briefing was given on 17 August 1985 by  Victorian branch of the Australian Labor Party, at the electoral office of Mrs Kay I - Setches, ALP MLA for Ringwood, at 12 Railway Place, Ringwood, where the Nuclear Disarmament card (folio 32) was issued to ALP members and helpers for distribution at polling booths. (c) a senior adviser to the Premier of Victoria could also have been involved in the distribution of those cards. (d) some members of the Australian Labor Party were recognised as distributing the card at polling booths on 17/8/85. This preliminary report when to Chief Commissioner Mick Miller and Assistant Commissioner Paul Delianis on 30 September and on that same day further investigations were ordered. While these further investigations were under way, legal counsel, Mr D.G. Habersberger, who had been briefed - on the matter, advised the Crown Solicitor, Mr R.J. Lambert, that the Australian Labor Party had breached section 267B(1) of the Constitution Act Amendment Act 1958, which prohibited any activity likely to mislead or deceive an elector in relation to the casting of a vote of the elector. This advice, together with a memorandum from the Crown Solicitor stating that he had 'no reason to disagree with the views of Mr Habersberger', was forwarded to the Chief Electoral Officer on 9 October. The Crown Solicitor recommended that upon receipt of the final police report all relevant documents be submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions for consideration and appropriate action. The final police report was completed by Detective Inspector R.H. Russell on 19 December 1985 and contained compelling observations, conclusions and recommendations. In respect of the actual events on polling day, the report commented: On this day voters receiving this card have told police they were misled or deceived, believing card to be the official NDP card. Police have been told by some NDP helpers (handing out official NDP cards) that they were approached by persons, shown the Nuclear Disarmament card, and either informed that policy had been changed, or that they were being relieved and they· should go to some other particular booth. Police have also been told that on the official NDP helper leaving one booth the official NDP card was placed in the rubbish bin and the Nuclear Disarmament card distributed in its place. A great number of people were interviewed by the Victoria Police during the course of the inquiry, including members of the NDP, the Australian Democrats, the Liberal Party, the ALP and those most directly involved, plus voters who were misled. The report commented in detail on the distinct lack of cooperation with the investigation of some people, particularly Mrs Kay Setches former j MLA for Ringwood. The report concluded: 67. I believe there has been an agreel)1ent by Nikolaidou, Batchelor and other unknown persons to devise a scheme in an attempt to induce voters to allocate their preference votes in a manner which would give an advantage to the ALP in the election, the result of which was expected to be a close contest. 68. I do not fully accept the account put forward by Batchelor in his release, and the facts put forward in later interviews on television programs with him. It appears he was more prepared to talk to the press than the poliCe, and I believe it was an attempt to hamper and restrict any further police investigation. 69. It is obvious that a deliberate attempt was made to influence the rights of individuals when voting in a democratic election, but the identity of all the persons involved would not be known due to the lack of cooperation by witnesses in their refusal to answer questions. 70. I am concerned, due to this lack of cooperation, that police have not been able to thoroughly investigate all aspects of this enquiry. 71. I believe, however, there is sufficient evidence to support a prima facie case of conspiracy to 'defraud' under common law against Nikolaidou, Batchelor and Salvaris with persons name unknown. That is the end of those sections of the report. Inspector Russell then formally reCommended in his report that Mr Nick Nikolaidou, Mr Peter Batchelor and Mr Michael Salvaris be the charged with common law conspiracy in also defrauding voters· or conspiracy in deceiving voters under the Crimes Act section 321(1). Additionally, Inspector Russell recommended that Mr Nick Nikolaidou be charged with authorising material likely to mislead or deceive an elector under section 267B(1) of the Constitution Act Amendment Act. Moreover, the recommendation was made that the following persons be charged under section 267B(1) with distributing material likely to mislead or deceive an elector, namely, Mr Peter Batchelor, Mr Michael Salvaris, Mr Ronald James Carli, Mr Stefano Di Pieri, Mr Paul Slape, Mr Ian Baker, Mr Hand Van  MCDonald and Mr William Cooper.  Ian Baker are now the State members for Thomastown and Sunshine respectively. Mr Baker. was, until recently, also State Minister  now State President of the ALP in Victoria. After submission of the police report just prior to Christmas 1985; the legal assistant to the police in: the Crown Solicitor's office, Mr D.l Grace, reviewed the police report and the opinion of Mr Habersberger. He concluded, on 20 Janqary 1986, that there was evidence to substantiate charges against several persons under section 267B(1) of the Act, and also concluded that it would be difficult on the available evidence to sustain the conspiracy charges. rn March the Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr John Coldrey QC, recommended that prosecutions be laid against several persons allegedly involved'in the publication and distribution of the fake how-to-vote card. This advice was then sent along with the police report by the Chief Commissioner to the Chief Electoral Officer on 19 March 1986. Next day, the Chief Electoral Officer informed the Director-General· of Property and Services by memo of these events. On 21 March·the Chief Electoral Officer requested the Crown Solicitor to seek the advice of the Solicitor-General, Mr Hartog Berkeley, and junior counsel, Mr Gerard Nash. It was later disclosed, during an appeal under the Freedom of Information Act in early 1987 before Judge Rowlands of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, that the Director-General of Property and Services, Dr G.W. Russell-as . recalled by the Chief Electoral Officer in relation tei the Director-General-said: . . . had been talking to the Minister that the suggestion was that !>ecause of the element of doubt in the opinion they had already received, it might be an idea to perhaps seek advice from the Solicitor-General. On 2 April 1986 the Solicitor-General and Mr Nash recommended that no prosecutions be initiated. Further convoluted, administrative and legal manoeuvres took place, all of which resulted with the Chief Electoral Officer, on 8 May 1986, deciding not to press charges. In the FOI hearing before the AAT that .ended with an order on 28 May 1987 to release all legal documents except the police report, Judge Rowlands said, on page 19 of his judgment: The independenc,e of which the CEO spoke does not sit comfortably with the fact that he passed on the early opinions to his departmental head who consulted with the Minister before offering unsolicited advice to him upon which he acted. The then Minister for Property and Services, the honourable Mr Andrew MCCutcheon, referred to by Judge Rowlands, did later release the police report in highly emasculated form. Both the Continental Airlines affair, and the Nunawading by-election cover-up, with their appalling lack of action upon obvious and well documented evidence, are gravely disturbing reflections upon the standard of law enforcement and justice in Victoria under Labor and leave key questions hanging in the air. Why, in the Continental Airlines affair, despite clear evidence and presumably additional data drawn from the Commonwealth Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and elsewhere, did no concrete action result? Why, in the Nunawading by-election coverup, despite the recommendation by the actual investigating Victoria Police officers that charges be laid-a recommendation agreed with by Mr Habersberger, Mr Grace and Mr Coldrey-did nothing happen? Was there any connection between these almost simultaneous and peculiar sets of circumstances? Only a thorough investigation of both debacles could find the answers to these and other compelling questions. If the National Crime Authority will not examine these very disturbing matters, then they should become part of the major inquiry into alleged Victoria Police corruption and related matters announced last week by the new Kennett coalisome further legal tion Government. In conclusion, I seek leave to table the various documents that I referred to throughout my speech and which I have already shown to the Minister at the table.",35
13,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY,Is leave granted? Mr Duncan-No.,38
14,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY,Leave is not granted.,38
15,Mr DUNCAN,NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY,"in reply-I only want to respond very briefly. The shadow Minister, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), raised the issue of whether or not the National Crime Authority Amendment Bill (No.2) 1992 excludes legal professional privilege from being a reasonable excuse for not answering questions and providing information to the Inspector-General under clause 55AQ of the Bill. He gave as his opinion, I think that is a fair word to use, that he believed that legal professional privilege was protected. - concur with that and I think that is important to put on the record. I certainly appreciated his plaudits and praise for my role as a civillibertar,an in the past and I accept his comments \\j'ith much thanks. However, I will respond in more detail to the issue which he intends to raise by way of amendment in the committee stage during that stage.

The rationale for the amendments has been put by me in the second reading debate. The rationale is that the parliamentary Joint Committee ought to have access to information but there should be some restrictions, or at least a procedure, on how that information is dealt with. The honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) went through the amendments in quite some detail in his speech. Essentially what is provided is that if there is sensitive information and a committee or a member considers it necessary to report on that matter, the Chairman or Chairperson of the National Crime Authority must be informed.· The Chairperson can certify that the evidence or proposed disclosure is sensitive and if that is so certified, it·cannot be disclosed except subject to various appeal mechanisms which I will go on to. The provisions in our amendments then, go on to provide that if there is an argument between the Chairman of the National Crime Authority and the Committee or a member of the Committee, the matter can be referred to the Attorney-General. The Attorney-General can either make the decision himself or direct that the Inspector-General make the decision. If the Attorney-General is of the view that the information is not sensitive and it would not by be against the public interest for disclosure, that can be done. However, if the Minister effectively upholds the position of the NCA then that restriction on disclosing the sensitive information must hold. As I explained in my speech in the second reading debate, the genesis of that proposal came from Senator Spindler's Bill. With the improvement suggested by the parliamentary Joint Committee, we think it adequately protects both the position of the Committee in getting information and the position of those who might be injured or damaged, or investigations that might be injured or damaged, if there were precipitate disclosure. There is a long and fair procedure to lead to arbitration, and in those circumstances I commend the amendments to the House.",39
17,Mr DUNCAN,NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY,"The Government cannot accept the amendment moved by the Opposition. Whilst the Committee did describe what is proposed in the National Crime Authority Amendment Bill (No.2) as the second best option, as has been said, it still described it as 'but still an acceptable solution'. I think the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), is being a bit disingenuous in moving this. He knows quite well the framework in which the National Crime Authority operates. The National Crime Authority does not only operate under legislation of this Parliament; it also operates under an agreement between the Commonwealth and the various States and Territories. Furthermore, it is worth pointing out that the National Crime Authority could not operate unless that were the case. When the National Crime Authority Act was introduced in the early 1980s, it was legislation which it had been agreed was acceptable to the governments of the Commonwealth and of the States and Territories. As I understand it; the proposed amendments are acceptable to all of the State governments, including the Liberal-National coalition governments. In light of that, I think the compromise that Catley, R. has been reached is a fair one. I do not have any personal concern about it because I think that· in the circumstances this does provide adequate protection for the civil liberties of those concerned. What we are seeing here is a solution which will provide reasonable access to the Parliamentary Committee. It should provide it with proper access' and it should ensure that the good relations which have now been achieved between the Committee and the NCA can continue.

20,Mr SPEAKER,WARNINGS FROM THE CHAIR,"Before I call the Leader of the Opposition, I just remind honourable members of the remarks that I made yesterday regarding warnings. NA Unemployment",42
21,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister .agree with the assertion made in the Budget, and repeated by the Treasurer in Perth as recently as three days ago, that the unemployment rate would be down to 10 per cent by June of next year, despite the mounting evidence to the contrary?",42
22,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Treasurer says that he said that it was 12 months from the Budget. I did not see the Treasurer's statement but I at least give you the benefit of believing that you were quoting him accurately. Industrial Disputes,42
23,Mr COURTICE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister inform the House about the level of industrial disputes in Australia? What is the reason for the low level of industrial disputes? Is Government policy on inflation a factor in wage outcomes and industrial disputation? Finally, is he expecting a wage break-out that would prejudice the Government's achievements in this area?",42
24,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I noticed in the release by the Statistician on 12 October this year that the 12 months ending June 1992 a total of 906 disputes were reported in progress. This figure is the lowest recorded since the series commenced in 1981. It indicates, I think, that the annual average rate of 229 working days lost per 1,000 employees over the life of the accord is 61 per cent lower than the figure of 590 working days lost per 1,000 employees under the previous Fraser Liberal-National Party Government. I table for the information of honourable members a publication of the Department of Industrial Relations entitled Workplace Bargaining: The First 100 Agreements. You will see in that document all the flexibility that the Opposition now desires to have in the wage system. But, of course, it does not have flexibility down by cutting remuneration packages. The level of disputation in the context of the accord and the social wage of which it is part would, of course, fall away with the imposition of a 15 per cent consumption tax. That would adversely affect current wage outcomes and the application of existing industrial relations policies. Today there was published in the Sydney Morning Herald a paper, which the Sydney Morning Herald secured under freedom of information legislation, of a Treasury minute on the macro implications of a change in the tax mix, which was produced by the Treasury, signed off by Mr Fraser, Deputy Secretary, on 6 May 1992. In that paper, which was requested by the Treasurer, the Treasurer asked that the Treasury repeat its modelling work allowing for the possibility of the introduction of a goods and services tax leading to wage flowons. Those flow-ons indicate that in the short to medium term-I quote from the notes: There are less favourable effects to the economy compared with those reported in the earlier minute. The effects on domestic activity and GDP are much more negative, especially around years four to seven where activity is significantly reduced in the face of the wage-price spiral. GDP bottoms around 4 percentage points below controlthat is, below what it would otherwise bearound this time with domestic demand around 7 percentage points below control. Inflation and wages are much higher with prices peaking around 12 percentage points above controlin that is, 12 percentage points above what they would otherwise beand unemployment deteriorates in line with GDP peaking around two percentage points above control, above what it would otherwise be. There is a great similarity between this publication and these results and what I quoted from yesterday in the Murphy model, which was done by the Opposition's own modeller on its policies. The two charts show that for CPI Or Murphy has 10 per cent and the Treasury has 12; for real GOP Murphy has minus 4 and the Treasury has minus 4; and for the rise in unemployment from a flow-on Or Murphy has plus 2.1 per cent and the Treasury has 2 per cent. It is remarkable, is it not, that they are the same. Barring the inflation forecast where Murphy has 10 and the Treasury has 12, in terms of lost GOP of 4 per cent and higher unemployment of 2 per cent they are the same. It is funny about that, is it not? The reason the Treasurer did not make this information available himself was that he was waiting to see whether the Opposition's industrial relations policy, if announced, would allow for a national wage deduction.

26,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If we are to take the utterances of the honourable member for Bennelong at the National.Press Club during the week, we can see that no system of enterprise arrangements via contracts will in any way be able to discount for the price effects of a goods and services tax to avoid these outcomes.

The charts are remarkably similar: they are almost the same. What we can conclude from this is that without the wage discounts inflation will be around 10 to 12 percentage points higher; weaker unemployment will be around 2 percentage points higherMr Sharp interjecting,43

It is very interesting that the honourable member for Barker, who in 1985 was the President of the National Farmers Federation, was asked on The World Today about these things recently. I quote: In 1985 Mr MCLachlan saw things differently. As President of the National Farmers Federation, he opposed Paul Keating's support for a consumption tax because of the effect on inflation. Mr Keating's consumption proposition C had an inflation factor of somewhere between 12 and 14 per cent and that was one of the reasons he opposed it. Here we are with a forecast of 12 per cent by the Treasury and 10 per cent by Or Murphy, but now he is embracing it.

40,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I refer him to the Prime Minister's answer and in particular to the Treasury executive minute which he requested from Treasury and heavied and pressured it to produce. Is it a fact that Treasury tried to bury this work because it disagreed with the wages blow-out assumption? Is this point not supported by the fact that the minute notes that various assumptions requested by the Treasurer were 'heroic', 'at odds with reality', 'the assumption is crucial to the outcome' and - overall we would strongly caution against placing too much weight on any particular model-based outcome of this natur-'? Finally, I ask the Treasurer: If this minute is not an embarrassment to the Prime Minister and the Government, why have you sat on it for five long months since 6 May?

Lastly, to deal with the point from the Prime Minister, if you could not rely on it until you had seen our industrial relations policy, why is it that the Prime Minister went troppo when he had the Murphy report back in February?",44
43,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member for Flinders is like a political Dalek. He gets wound up, he gets pointed in a direction and he just starts talking. It does not matter what he says. It does not matter what distortions are involved. He just keeps going. This work was done to demonstrate what would happen if Opposition policy failed, if the superheroic assumptions of the Opposition did not work. It follows from some earlier work which was done by the Treasury which assumed that the Opposition policy actually succeeded. Mr Reith-It was their judgment.",44
44,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will cease interjecting.,44
45,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It was not their judgment at all. Mr Reith-Oh, yes, it was.",44
46,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has asked his question. He should listen to the answer.,44
47,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The assumptions were set as assumptions must be. The assumptions that Treasury was first asked to model were made on the basis that what you said was right, what Fightback assumed was right. Then Treasury was asked to model on the assumption that you were wrong. The extraordinary thing about the honourable member for Flinders is that, when the Treasury models something based on the Opposition's assumptions, the Treasury agrees with those assumptions; when the Treasury models something with different assumptions, it does not agree with them. Alternatively, when Treasury officials were earlier doing some work with which the Opposition concurred, they were wonderful and independent officials. Now that they are doing something else, they are being leaned on and they are acting under duress. Are tpese not the same Treasury officials who were traduced and abused by the Leader . of the Opposition for just being our stalking horses and our political toadies doing our dirty work? The Opposition cannot have it both ways. This document proves that it has been caught out-and caught out properly. The Treasury has not said its assumptions are right. It has not said its assumptions are wrong. It has said, 'Let's look at what will happen on the basis of a different set of assumptions' . Mr Reith-But we know the basis of the advice. Mr Ruddock-But your assumptions could not be relied on.",44
48,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will cease interjecting, as will the honourable member for Dundas.",45
49,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Indeed, it did not express a view on the likelihood of either outcome. This document mentions that the point is that this assumption-that is, whether or not workers would seek to maintain their real pretax wages-is crucial and no-one can be sure of the weight that can be placed on either assumption. I remind the House that on 29 September the Sydney Morning Herald carried the results of a survey of professional economists. The article states: A large majority of leading economists believe interest rates and unemployment would be higher, and economic growth substantially lower, under a Coalition Government if it wins the next election. But that is not what the Treasury has concluded itself. What it did was to model your policy with your model. What did it discover? Even with your assumptions built in, GDP falls and the CPI goes up by 6 per cent. But with the alternative assumptions, when you are incapable of keeping the cost increases out of the wages system, what does it reveal? It reveals that GDP will fall by 4 per cent by the sixth year; the CPI will be up by 12 per cent by the fifth year; employment will be down by 3 per cent; and unemployment will be up by a massive 172,000. Let me remind the honourable member for Flinders that this is his model and his policy. It is just being modelled on the basis of an assumption which most professional economists believe is a more likely prospect. , The point, as the Prime Minister has said, is that the crucial assumption here-and the only different assumption between the earlier work and the later work-was the assumption about whether the cost and price pressures implicit in the introduction of the GST would flow into wages. What the Opposition now has to show is what policy devices it would have to prevent that occurrence. Last week we had the honourable member for Bennelong saying that under the Opposition's decentralised wages system there would be no mechanism for a discount. Therefore, how can the old mechanical megaphone there, the honourable member for Flinders, say that there will be no feeding through of price increases into the wages system? Where is the mechanism? Where are the wage policy policemen to prevent that occurrence? One way of putting it is that the Treasury may well have taken at face value what the honourable member for Bennelong said last week-that is, 'We have no wages policy that can prevent price increases getting into wages'. This is not a question of what the Treasury thinks on this matter. This is a matter of the effect of the Opposition's wages policy. 'The honourable member for Flinders is going off to get his further instructions to work out what to say next. So fleet of foot is he, so quick on his feet, that he knows what to say next-off he goes to get his further instructions. I thought you had Fightback cOnlmitted to memory. This modelling exercise is about the Opposition's policy and the pressure that its policy would put on the wages system-that is, the inflationary impact of the price rise coming through from the wages policy. This is the Opposition's model, modelling its policy, with all the pressures inherent in it. It is his music and he has to dance to it. Tourism",45

53,Ms CRAWFORD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What are the prospects for growth in this industry?,45
54,Mr GRIFFITHS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Forde for her questions. Of course I am aware of concerns expressed by the tourism industry about the outlook for tourism if a goods and services tax were put in place. I was asked by someone in the industry what it would be like if this mobthat is, the Opposilion-ever got to put in,a GST. I said that it would be like jumping off a bridge. He said, 'We'd better not do that'. I said, 'I'll be prepared to do it, providing there is a bungee attached to my ankle'. But I know what it will be like for the industry. Under current policy, forecasts are for some 200,000 extra jobs to be created in the tourism industry by the end of the decade. Of those 200,000 jobs, honourable members may be interested to know that slightly in excess of 20 per cent will be in management positions. Only yesterday, to join a chorus of complaints about the Opposition's policies in relation to the tourism industry, the Australian Federation of Travel Agents warned that with a GST domestic travel costs would increase by between 10 and 12 per cent. For this honesty it was roundly criticised by the Opposition spokesman on tourism,· who has joined his colleagues in pointing out that anyone who has anything. to say' about the Opposition's policies is wrong-headed. This is not the only organisation to express its views, as I have indicated. The peak industry association-the Australian Tourism Industry Association-has also advised its members of just how devastating the coalition policy would be. Indeed, ATIA has pleaded with the Opposition to modify its package in a whole range of ways. The shadow Minister for tourism took the quite extraordinary stand of becoming a cosignatory to a document seeking massive changes to the Opposition's policy. As a cosignatory, he has condemned the policy position of his own farty. Ms Crawford-So he should.",45
55,Mr GRIFFITHS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, so he should. Ms Crawford interjecting",46
56,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Forde will cease interjecting.,46
57,Mr GRIFFITHS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"To be fair to the shadow Minister for tourism, ·he has at least been consistent. He publicly conceded some months ago 'in a forum he and I attended in Brisbane that in fact he had sought from the Opposition an exemption for the tourism industry in relation to the GST package. It was at that particular forum that he also corrected me. I must say that I was new to the portfolio. Politicians rarely confess to making a mistake, but I did. The mistake I made was to point out that -5 per cent of the industry was not covered by payroll ta.x and therefore would not benefit from that part of the Fightback package. The shadow Minister was honest and accurate enough, as it turns out, to indicate to the audience that in fact it was 86 per cent of the industry which would not benefit. The remaining part of the industry pays of the order of 3 per cent for that particular tax. The Opposition burst into laughter yesterday when the Prime Minister raised this matter, but it is worth making the point that, according to independent studies by Ernst and Young, amongst othersMr Downer-Are you still going? Is it nearly finished?",46
58,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Mayo will cease interjecting.,46
59,Mr GRIFFITHS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"the GST would be a de facto payroll tax. In that context, Ernst and Young points out that, even where payroll tax is paid, an average payroll tax of say 3 per cent is well below a GST of 15 per cent. Of course, that means that not only business but also employment opportunities would be diminished accordingly. There is one other matter that I will go to.",46
60,Mr CADMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Take another half an hour. Why worry?,46
61,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the honourable member for Mitchell interjects again, I will deal with him.",46
62,Mr GRIFFITHS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Australian Tourism Industry Association has circulated a confidential memorandum, a document that should be of considerable interest to members of this chamber, but in particular to the honourable member for Flinders, a person who has a long history of supporting the tourism industry in unusual ways. For example, I can recall very accurately indeed that when I first came to this place there was an issue whereby the honourable member for Flinders was proposing some redevelopment in the Phillip Island tourist destination. In short, he proposed to whack a concrete slab, would you believe, on top of an area inhabited by one of the foremost tourist attractions of Australia and Victoria-the fairy penguin colony. This document is, in a sense, addressed to the Leader of the Opposition and relates to his opportunity on Friday to respond to some of these issues and try to recover some of the damage he has done to his own Party's standing wi$ the tourism industry. Let me see what the Australian Tourism Industry Association regards as the key issues. It says . that the opportunity will be 'critical to provide some mitigationMr Hand interjecting",46
63,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Minister for Immigration will cease interjecting.,47
64,Mr GRIFFITHS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"to the relative adverse effects of GST for tourism'. Moreover, the Association goes on to say: A relative price increase of the magnitude estimated by Ernst & Young would be devastating. An example of that is that domestic aviation costs are causing an increase of some significance. The Ass6-iation says: The airlines do not pay excise on jet fuel used in the domestic aviation industry so the offsets to GST are limited. It goes on to say: The airlines further point out that they will not have to pay GST on the Australian legs of international flight schedules and consequently foreign packages will become much more attractive to market than domestic destinations. We have here a policy outcome that encourages Australians to holiday abroad to create jobs in places such as Fiji or Bali; but offers a disincentive, can you believe it, for people to come to Australia. I conclude with the final part of this document, which is of some moment.",47
65,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Minister might qui<;:kly conclude. Opposition members--:-Hear, hear!",47
66,Mr GRIFFITHS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The document goes on to endorse the validity of the Ernst and Young reports. The Opposition has been knocking the Ernst and Young material up hill and down dale. Let me quote what this document says in relation to the shadow Treasurer: The Ernst & Young figures ate consistent with the somewhat broad and conservative figures produced by Treasury's comprehensive PRISMOD analysis, which Peter Reith praised and commended to us. Mr Speaker, let me give you that again. In terms of the document that he has been attackingMr Costello- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. This Minister was asked for his views. He is boring the Parliament, silly by reading out the views of others. You have already asked him to come to the end of his answer. He has been going for eight minutes. He is a notorious bore and he ought to be brought to an end. Mr SPEAKER'-Order! The honourable member for Higgins has no point of order.",47

69,Mr GRIFFITHS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, Mr Speaker. Let me quote: The Ernst & Young figures are consistent with the somewhat broad and conservative figures produced by Treasury's comprehensive PRISMOD analysis, which Peter Reith praised and commended to us. Unemployment",47
70,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. In a recent survey of 200 leading business men and women, over 86 per cent predicted employment in their company would either fall or remain unchanged this year. Do you stand by your Budget time forecast of 10 per cent unemployment by June next year? Does this show that Senator Button was right and that you are wrong?",47
71,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Once again, the Opposition has misrepresented-which is not a new thing-what was said. What was said at Budget time was that we expected that the rate of unemployment would be below 10 per cent 12 months from now; that is, 12 months from,18 August when the Budget was brought down. As the Opposition ought to be awareMr Downer-That is going backwards in time.",47
72,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Mayo will cease interjecting.,48
73,Dr HEWSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That will be what? Here is your statement.,48
74,Mr DAWKINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I know what I said in the Budget Speech. What I said was that it would be below 10 per cent 12 months from now. I would notbeli-ve anything you said':""'-nothing whatsoever. You have the reputation for getting everything wrong-election dates, inflation rates, wage growth. You get everything wrong. You have a shocking reputation for your predictions. As far as the labour market is concerned, as Senator Button said on Sunday, it is one of the later statistics to tum around. Nothing he said in his subsequent remarks does anything to lindermine the credibility of the Budget forecasts. Commonwealth-State Relations",48
75,Mr OKEEFE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister and it relates to Commonwealth-State financial relationships. Can the Prime Minister inform the House about the progress of those Commonwealth State financial negotiations? Is he also aware of any plans to cut financial assistance grants to the States by 5 per cent? Is the Government proposing this course? If not, why not?",48
76,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"-;-I think it is fair to say that relations between the States and the Commonwealth have developed fruitfully over the past year. At our last meeting there was an agreement to set up a council of Australian governments to meet periodically to advance issues of common interests which are other than financial issues. But in the course of the same meeting we came to a new agreement in relation to vocational education and a common recognition of occupational standards, road transport and electricity generation. At the last Premiers Conference, the Commonwealth increased funding for the States. We now have in train a review of State government fiscal requirements which will be useful in reaching fiscal formulas to adequately resource the States for the remainder of the decade. In this context I notice that there proposal to cut 5 per cent from the financial assistance grants to the States. It is not a proposal which is at all attractive",48

82,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The honourable member for Gippsland will cease interjecting.,48
83,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The proposal is made in the Fightback! document issued by the Opposition. A cut of 5 per cent in Commonwealth payments to the States will cost New South Wales $187m this year. If it is enacted next year, then on this year's sharing formula it would cost New South Wales just short of $200m-that is, $193m. It would cost Queensland $145m next year on the same basis. It would cost Western Australia $84m, it would cost South Australia $82m, Tasmania $32m, and Victoria would be cut by $148m. I cannot see this as a sensible approach to Commonwealth-State relations. Where does the Leader of the Opposition believe these States can recover these funds? No doubt the recovery costs would not be in his inflation and cost forecasts in relation to his proposals. But the Opposition is committed to cancelling also the better cities program. This means that New South Wales would lose another $73mMs Crawford interjecting",48
84,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,48
85,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Victoria another $80m; Queensland another $50m; Western Australia another $28m, .and Tasmania another $8m. There will be another $272m off the States in 1993-94 and, of course, much more later. Then the Opposition is committed to chopping off Commonwealth housing payments to is a the States. New South Wales would lose another $46m, Victoria another $33m, Queensland another $25m, Western Australia another $14m, South Australia another $12m, and Tasmania another $4m. But that is not the end of it, Mr Speaker. The Leader of the Opposition would demand that States drop payroll taxes, but he would only reimburse them for the average last three years of payroll tax collections, so he would only reimburse them for the years when you have the recession in payroll tax payments.",48

The shortfall in compensation under this would be around $190m for New heavily South Wales, $l1m for Victoria, $22m for Queensland, $19m for Western Australia, and $llm for South Australia. Mr Speaker, when you look through all these things, New South Wales would lose just over half a billion dollars next year under an Opposition package; Imagine a State needing to collect half a billion! Mr Fahey's Government, of course, would be decimated Minister. trying to recover it. Victoria would lose at least $270m; Queensland would lose nearly a quarter of a billion-and the Queensland Premier is in the gallery; I am sure he would be less than plel).sed; WeStern Australia lose $145m; South Australia would lose $134m; and the Liberal Government in Tasmania would be looking for a loss of $43m. Mr Sharp-He is going to sleep.",49

90,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Cuts of this magnitude are ployed. not threatened by the Opposition; they are promised by the Opposition. They are not threatened, they are not mights or maybes, but are promised by the Opposition. They are essential to the Fightback figuring, but they are not spelled out. I have taken out in relation to each of the programs in the States to make it clear that New South Wales, for instance, wil\ be cut. It would represent nearly one-third of its entire recurrent spending on law and order and public safety. It would come off health, and in New South Wales a cut equal to about 12 per cent of total recurrent health spending. It would also come off housing and community services. There it is equal to about two-thirds of total New South Wales spending on housing and of the community services. This is the impact that Mr Kennett, Mr Fahey and Mr Groom, as conservative Premiers, would face from the promised cuts-not the rumoured or the speculated cuts but the promised cuts-under Dr Hewson's Fightback proposals to fund his reduction in petrol excise and the other proposals. If the States try to recover these funds they decimate their communities with indirect tax charges which would feed heavily into the consumer price index, which would then go into the inflation rate, wages, ongoing inflation and interest rates. No doubt these indirect effects are not in the Opposition proposals. That is why we say that if you add all these things in-Dr Murphy's proposal of 10 per cent or the 12 per cent proposed by the Treasury-it is very much in the ballpark of the financial vandalism which the.

You have got Buckley's chance of getting the Premiers to go along with that proposal without there being an inflationary impact on top of what has already been proposed. Whilst I am on my feet, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is now talking about employment consequences when his leader got up here the week of the Budget and said that we should slash spending by $6 billion. Is the Deputy Leader unaware that the impact of that would be to add 120,000 people to the dole queues in Australia? These are the people who are about increased unemployment, increased inflation, lower wages and higher taxes. Just remember what these people really stand for. Enterprise Bargaining",50
117,Mr FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Can the Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations inform the House of recent developments in enterprise bargaining? Are these developments consistent with the Government's strategy for improving industrial relations in Australia?,51
118,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In response to the honourable member for Reid, I can say that there have been very considerable developments in enterprise bargaining in recent times. We now have something like 367 registered enterprise bargains in the federal jurisdiction and, of course, many others which are unregistered or which are registered under the State jurisdictions. Of those 367 federally registered agreements, we do not have informatiori about the number of employees under about a quarter of them, but for those on which we do have information, there are about 250,000 employees who are covered by them-that is about 12'12 per cent of the number of employees covered by federal awards. These numbers are starting to become quite substantial. We would expect those numbers to increase considerably in future months as more and more agreements are completed. A most important feature of many of these agreements is that they are changing award conditions to suit the needs of the enterprise. We see this with quite a number of such agreements. I will refer to a few. At the ANZ Bank, for instance, where there are no restrictions put on the hours of work of full time employees provided they are not below 152 hours every four weeks, arrangements are negotiated to suit the worker and the branch manager. At Stafford Ellinson, which is a clothing factory in Bendigo, Victoria, the agreement provides for flexibility to organise working hours and involves banking of hours to enable JI).anagement to have employees working up to 12 hours on a single shift without paying overtime, excess hours above the standard 38 hours accumulated, and workers can apply to take the time off when they want it, or management can give at least 24 hours notice for the time off to be taken. That is real flexibility in the working week and is very much what members of the Opposition say they are trying to achieve, but it is being achieved under the present industrial relations policy enterprise bargaining approach. In relation to penalty rates at the firm of Kimberley-Clark in South Australia, there is agreement for annual salaries which incorporate an element that compensates for overtime and shift premiums so that workers can take 12-hour shifts-two days on, two nights on and then four days off. They can be called back into work if they are required without additional cost to the company because the penalty rate is included in the overall rate. That is not unique at all to the KimberleyClark company; it is in a number of others. At Coles supermarkets there is a major enterprise bargain covering some 35,000 employees. Whilst there is maintenance of the 38-hour week, there is greater flexibility in the hours worked within a four week cycle, greater flexibility in rostering arrangements and reduction in penalty rates for those working night shifts in 24-hour continuous trading shops from 200 per cent to 130 per cent, which has made 24-hour shopping a real possibility. We. see that there are these very considerable changes taking place to award conditions to suit the enterprise in these really basic conditions of employment. This is happening without any exploitation of the work force because these agreements do have to meet the requirement of the Act as it has now been amended, which means that the Industrial Relations Commission cannot reject agree.ments unless it believes that there would be disadvantage to employees. That is a fundamental protection against exploitation, whilst allowing real flexibility in the conditions of employment to suit the enterprise. The Opposition would have no such provision to prevent exploitation. It supposedly provides a minimum hourly wage and a minimum stipulation relating to annual leave, sick leave and maternity leave, according to what the Opposition spokesman had to say a week ago. He does not say what these levels would be or how he would impose them. But otherwise, apart from these minima, whatever they are, there would be no protection for people who are forced out of awards. Let us make no mistake that under the Opposition's policy people will be forced out of awards because people who are in positions where they have no real bargaining power, where unions are weak or non-existent, will be told by employers, 'If you want to work here, then you are going to have to work here under conditions which we set'. The condition is that there is an enterprise agreement. The employer will say, 'The enterprise agreement sets conditions which I say should apply'. They can be less than current award rates, except for these minima, whatever they are, that the honourable member for Bennelong in his generosity would set. We can see that this is a recipe for gross exploitation of sections of the work force. If that is not the case, then why abolish this section of the law which currently says there cannot be disadvantage to employees? Why abolish that? If you are not about exploitation, why abolish it? Why not leave it there? If you are concerned to ensure that people are protected, that there is no exploitation, why take away the anti-exploitation provision? Why pretend that this is a high wage policy when, quite clearly, by taking that away you are ensuring that for sections of the work force there will be a much lower wage or much lower overall conditions of employment? That is what those opposite are really about",51

To abolish that is an absolutely disgraceful proposal by the Opposition. Those opposite say that they are concerned about maintaining protection for employees. We can believe that as much as we can believe that they are concerned to maintain full employment or to go for full employment, or anything like it, when at the same time the Leader of the Opposition says that they will abolish full employment from the charter of the Reserve Bank.

Most significantly, these figures include an increase of more than 6 per cent in lending for the building of new houses in August. Lending for new housing is, of course, an important indicator for future building activities. I can confidently predict that we will see another rise in private sector construction in the September quarter and continuing recovery into 1992-93. I spoke with people in the housing industry in Victoria on Friday and they were pleased that, after a bad period, recovery is certainly in place in that State. The headline in the Australian today is 'Builders hail housing recovery'. The Government can rightly point to a sustained and substantial period of growth. Building starts have increased for five consecutive quarters. No-one, apart from the Opposition, can deny that record. It is time to put aside the negative approaches, the approaches espoused by the Opposition, that tend cynically to regard any sign of recovery as somehow soine distortion of the facts. The reality is that we have now had significiuit recovery over five quarters. We are now looking at very significant recovery indeed. The Master Builders Association has said today, in a document headed 'Jump in housing finance welcome news to builders: Today's housing finance figures provide optimism that housing recovery is starting to broaden. The current low mortgage interest rates, coupled with competitive house pricing, is making it very attractive for people to enter into home ownership. The Housing Industry Association, referring to home lending being up in August, said: The good news is that loan commitments for the construction or purchase of newly erected dwellings underare up 8% This points to future consolidation in the number of housing starts. Competitive housing prices and the stabilising of interest rates have led to the improvement in home buyer confidence. Housing recovery is on track, the Housing Industry Associat'ion says, to reach 150,000 starts in 1992-93. In this area of housing what the statistics have now shown right through the course of the year is that housing recovery is not just under way; it is now consolidating so that we see in prospect a very substantial achievement in the housing industry. The interesting thing about the current recovery is that not. only is it of a very sufficient scale, but it also reflects affordability levels that certainly are at their best since 1985-86. That shows in terms of house prices. There has been very little movement across the country so that people who at other times have not been able to get into the housing market are able, as a result of the policies being pursued by the Government, to get into that housing .market and buy affordable housing. This is not a time for cynicism; it is a time to recognise that housing is an important leading indicator, and that shows a sign that, where there is confidence in the economy, we will get very significant growth. There is conStant railing and talking down of th- economy by the Opposition. With every statistic that comes out a question mark appears,' as happened with the honourable member for Forrest today. The Opposition cannot recognise progress and recovery. It constantly talks down those signs. In terms of the housing industry, the position is totally unambiguous. It reflects the Government's policy and indicates the prospect for broader recovery in the economy as a whole. Welfare Groups",53

215,Mr SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPQRTANCE,Order! The House will come to order. Members on my left will cease interjecting and the Minister will cease interjecting.,59
216,Mr SMITH,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPQRTANCE,"Thank you for your protection, Mr Speaker. This is probably a good place to start because one of the things I was going to mention in the course of the discussion of the matter of public importance about pay TV today, in the unbelievable confusion, is the headline in one of the newspapers today which reads 'Caucus rebels over pay TV'. The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand), who has just left the chamber, is well known for his views about pay TV and, as I understand it, is one of those who are involved in the rebellion against the Prime Minister's mark 3 version of pay TV. The difficulty, of course, is that mark 3 was announced on Monday night; today we see an unbelievable back flip from elements of the Labor Party and everyone is now ducking for cover. We read this morning that the situation is fluid. The Minister who is supposed to be responsible for pay TV is Minister Collins, but he is in the Senate, unfortunately. That is why we have the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) to respond. The Leader of the House is a former communications Minister and I would assume he is across these issues quite well. He knows more than anyone about the unbelievable changes that have been taking place with pay television and the unbelievable confusion that is now rife within the potential bidding community, and indeed the whole community, about where pay TV is. It is always difficult to know where to start with pay TV because this saga has been going on and on for such a long time, but one of the good places to start is the classic Channel 9 interview with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). Many of us will remember it. On the Sunday program only a little while ago, on 31 May, he said to Laurie Oakes, 'We are out to try to create a sort of excitement. We want to really break through the policy log jam. I have just taken over as Prime Minister and I am going to show you how it is done'. He came forward with a few elementsTAPE, Qantas and also pay TV. Honourable members might remember that. He said this was going to be a revolutionary change and a whole range of new proposals would be put on the table. By the time it got into a piece and walked out of this place up to the Senate, it ran into extreme difficulty. It was excised out of the Broadcasting Services Bill and sent to a Senate committee. It was sent to a Senate committee because people who were sensible-there were many on the Minister's side of the table who had the same view-took the view that this was all done for the wrong reasons, that it was done in haste and that we had not properly thought through the structure of this new industry. So that piece of the legislation went off to the Senate Select Committee on Subscription Television Broadcasting Services. It was interesting that, at the time the debates took place in this place and in the Senate, several major speeches were delivered. During one of those speeches, the former Minister for Transport and Communications happened to be in here at the table when we were talking apout the issue of the ABC in pay TV. He will remember that the Prime Minister said, 'Over my dead body. Never, never, ever will we have the ABC in pay TV'. That was a major issue for us. If the Government is going to allow the free to air television networks to be involved in pay TV and migrate into the technologies, we argue that an opportunity ought to be given to the public broadcasters to likewise migrate into pay television, with the new technologies and the services that it might provide. The question for the Government was: 'What will be the detail and how are we to determine this?'. The Prime Minister said no-it was a flat no. When we were in this chamber debating this, an article in the Sydney Morning Herald by one of the leading writers in this area stated that Mr Beazley was sitting there as the member for Bass was indicating why it was that 'the ABC should be allowed to play in pay TV'. The article states: Beazley, sitting at the ministerial table as SmiL'l spoke, unconsciously nodded in agreement as Smith frankly observed that no-one in the Parliament really knew what the best structure was and that the decision the Parliament was about to make was far too important to be politicised in the way Keating had done. The writer went on to say that the stand of of legislation the Opposition: ... was in stark contrast to the pathetic and frankly hypocritical arguments Beazley paraded out before-about 10:20 pm ... Mr Beazley did not believe in what the Prime Minister did; neither does Senate Collins believe in what the Prime Minister did; nor does half of the Caucus believe in what the Prime Minister did. A decision was taken on Monday night which was released as 'Brand new pay TV policy; now nine channels. We are going to pick digital compression technology', which in 'my view is the correct technology to proceed with. But what happened this morning? The Minister for Transport and Communications went on AM, and again we start to see a change, a shift. He is now saying, 'Look, the ABC should be involved in something other than just news and current affairs. There could be other things that it could do'. But he is just not sure, because he does not know what is going on in the oval office. He does not know what the Prime Minister's views are. The difficulty for the Government is that nobody knows. That is why, in our view, either the Prime Minister should be in here addressing this very difficult issue in a meaningful way, or he should hold a press conference and tell the community what is going to happen with pay TV. He should let us know, and let the community know, what is going to happen with pay TV. It is not enough for the Prime Minister and just one of his advisers to be making up the decisions about the future of the pay TV industry after such a long period of discussion and debate in this community. Here we are on 14 October and nobody is any the wiser as to .where this decision will go next. There are many potential players in the pay TV industry. None of them-of the ones I spoke to this morning and late yesterday-ha,s any idea. They are starting to ring my office to ask me what I think the Government is going to do next. I notice the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) over there. I wonder whether he is going to speak, because he is one of those who might know. He is not a factional heavy like the Minister at the table, but he might know. I understand that he was at that original meeting with the Prime Minister. I refer to the late night meeting where they made the decision. There have been some more late night meetings. We might get a bit of information if we wait around to hear the second speaker in the MPI, because there sits a factional heavy. Therein lies the difficulty. We are not making policy to benefit consumers; we are not making policy about what is best for the development of pay TV, the ABC's involvement, the networks' involvement, the telecommunications companies' involvement-or about what technology we should be using. We are making decisions to meet the concerns of the factions. But not all the factions are having a go at this. A couple of faction chiefs went along the other night-Senator Schacht, and perhaps the honourable member for Burke as well was there-and they thought they had got a good deal. They thought, 'Digital compression-24 channels-just think of the choice! That is what we want-choice'. Then they walked away and discovered that there will only be nine channels available. Four will go to the first licence, a new player; four will be available for people whom the Prime Minister described as the jaded and""the faded. We will have two groups. There will be one channel, the ninth, for the ABC to run news and current affairs. That is different from what we are proposing. We are at least hoping that there will be not a duopoly of pay TV operators. The Prime Minister said, 'We will do away with the duopoly in the skies'. How often does he jump up here and say, 'Duopolies are bad and we are the ones who have made the decision' . He is talking about creating two separate fourchannel pay TV operations-a duopoly of pay TV. He will not have an open bidding system as we have been proposing. When we look at the close detail, or at least at the little bit that we can get, it shows that we will get a duopoly of pay TV. The big question mark is why? Who benefits, and why only nine? The technology can deliver 24. Why does not the honourable member for Burke tell me, or why does the Minister not tell me why? Whatever happened to the extra choice? We have been arguing about pay TV since 1986. In 1986 the Labor Party put a moratorium on it-'No pay TVit is too difficult'. Certainly it has been too difficult. We now find that we will not get a decision. It came out on Monday, and by today those opposite have decided they will not make a decision, but will leave it. The Minister again is putting his toe in the water and wondering how far he can get out in front of the Prime Minister to perhaps get a more meaningful policy. I think that the Minister is a genuine trier in this area. Opposition Members-Oh, come on. No, no!",59
217,Mr SMITH,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPQRTANCE,"No, I think he is. But every time he puts his hand up on an issue, he gets a call from the oval office to say, 'No, it has changed'. What is perhaps even worse is that Minister Collins's office had .to go to the media who had been briefed by the Prime Minister's office to find out what the policy was before they could answer the calls from other members of the media. This is totally confused. It sends out a signal to the international community about policy paralysis, about the unbelievable flip-flops of the Government. Honourable members will remember that we heard so much about the former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, being a jellyback. We were told that he could not make a decision, that he could not stick to it, but the one who wanted to be Prime Minister was saying, 'I can make the tough decisions; I can provide a bit of excitement and lead to the nirvana of a re-election victory'. But look at pay TV! All it has done is confirm everyone's worse fears. The Prime Minister wants to hold everything to himself; he does not want to have a proper Cabinet proceSs; he does not want to involve his colleagues. We will hear a defence this afternoon, but we all know that it will be hollow defence from the Leader of the House who has had his difficulties with the current Prime Minister. But it is hypocritical of current Prime Minister to say that· he has new structure when nobody knows new structure is. I hope that in the next couple of days common sense will start to prevail in this debate. There needs to be some commonand sense. We need to understand that we have have a competitive model for pay TV. to mandate all the possible ramifications the impact of a new technology and a new service delivery system will challenge the through. :wisdom of all in this place. It is not something we ought to undertake with any confiare dence that we can get an outcome that will visit the consumers-who, after all, are the people we ought to be putting first-with range of services that will be sustainable . the medium to long terin in' (),uality and price that they will be asked to pay. . I think the Government has forgotten fundamental issues that it should be addressare ing. They are the points we need to hear saying. about. It was this side that put forward the argument. that there has to be common cuslonger tomer reception equipment so that there is a multiplicity of little black boxes. We have ·been putting forward sensible arguments about media policy for a long time. honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore) has been in this place for a long time. He will the next Opposition speaker and will give chapter and verse as to the difficulties this Government has had in its media policy for the last 10 years. The one common thread every time we get to one of these issues. is the honourable pired) member for Blaxland. (Mr Keating). He is there every time. It does not matter who Minister is-'and we have had five Ministers you for communications-he is there every time to intervene. What is the product of the Prime Minister's intervention? It is more flip-flop and more confusion. Furthermore, what might well happen now is that we will be denied the possibility of pay TV. I well remember Mr Neil Brown, a former member in this place, a putting forward a private member's Bill to try to introduce pay TV into this nation. Of course, it was rejected. But he was trying to the . challenge the broad view in the Labor Party a - that this was a technology that we had to stop what that at all costs. It is not. There are many in the Labor Party who some know that they have to address this problem sensibly. But if they are going to address it do it in a way that is full of politics-and to that is what they have done-and try to blind To try people with the complexities of the of technology as an excuse for not making a decision, that is something we can all see Labor members are totally confused. They sending a very negative signal to the intematibnal community about the ability to be able to do business in this country. They a are denying the sensible start-up of a new in industry which will bring the benefits of the manufacturing and choice to this country. We have a regime that we have put to Govern the ment members time and time again, and they gradually seeing the sense of what we are Labor members cannot stand there any with their hands over their eyes and not allow the Prime Minister to intervene, to ride rough-shod over whoever the Minister is, over his whole Caucus, without explanation to this The chamber and to this community. It is an absolute outrage. That is why we have moved be this matter of public importance, to give the Government an opportunity to explain. The that Prime Minister has always intervened in communications matters, particularly broadcasting matters, and I had hoped to see him in here today to explain himself. ('lIme ex",61
218,Mr BEAZLEY,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPQRTANCE,"Swan-Minister for the Employment, Education and Training) (3.27 p.m.).....,.The Opposition's position can be put on a par with a homely example. If you walk down the street with a wallet in your pocket and somebody picks it, you are to blame. If you walk around a comer and in the course of walking arqund the comer somebody whacks you ov-r the back of the head and rips your mon¢y belt off you, you are to blame for that.! After all, you need not have walked around ithe comer, nor need you have walked down the street. That basically is where we are at now in relation to the pay TV debate as a result of exactly the parliamentary equivalent of that sort of process. It occurred when the Democrats combined with our opponents in the Senate to remove part VII of the Broadcasting Services Bill-the part dealing with pay TV - that we put through in th- last session. i The Senate had before it a series of propositions that would have substantially broadened the operation of those provisions in this country. The Senate had it available to pass at that time to let us get on with the process of putting out tenders for the opportunities that were then available and to proceed with all the sorts of benefits that the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) talked about in terms of employment and all the rest of it. All of that was possible. Why is that not before us now? It is not because of anything the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) did; not because of anything that Senator Schacht did; not because of anything that Minister Collins did. It is because of something that Mr Smith did. Mr Smith went to town in the Senate on that particular occasion and what he produced as a result was a Broadcasting Services Bill minus that portion. There was not much that we could do about it. It was indicated to us pretty clearly by those opposite that as far as they were conriot cerned this was going to a committee; it was to go through a delaying process. Why? Because the issue was enormously complex, with all these new technologies coming the importance of setting up a competitive regime. That is why the Opposition stopped the Government putting forward a regime, maldng a determination on this and getting it on the road. Because it was so complex, the technologies were complex, the competitive environment was complex, the matter had to go off to a committee. Now the committee has reported, we have had the report for a couple of weeks, and we are to make a determination on it. But we are told, 'Oh, that is too slow. We have sent it off to a committee to be looked at, we have delayed it on the ground of its complexities, and unless you respond within 24 hours you will have thrown the international markets into total confusion about the direction not just on the policy on pay TV but the whole image of .the Government in the international community'. We are told that if we do not respond in the course of 24 hours of the report coming down, thos- are all the sorts of things that will happen. Terrible! We were a little baffled on this side of the .House as to why the Opposition would choose to arrange this. I suppose one of the best defences you have if you have committed an open and public act of policy burglary such as this, the best thing you can do when you are seen running away with a wallet, is to say that the other mob gave it to you. You did not steal it at all; you took it from the other side and raced off into the middle distance with it. Becamje the other side's wallet was so complex and required. a competitive evaluation you took it around the street comer. When you have emptied its contents, you will stick it back via the committee process for committee members to· have a look at to see what is left in the wallet after you have been through it over the period of six months. While you are at it, blame them for the appalling delay of recovering their wallet. That is an appalling thing. You have run away; you have withheld it from them for the last six months. As a result of that, they have had that wallet available to them; they have not been able to show that wallet to the rest of the community. What a heinous crime they have committed for their failures in that in and regard. They stand condemned. Indeed, something so weighty as a .matter of public importance has to be brought on in the House of Representatives just so that we have absolutely clellr in our minds the terrible nature of the Government's lack of decision making as a result of having had its legislation burglarised. I do not blame the Opposition spokesman for having lost contact with where he sent this during the debate in the last Parliament. It was one of those lost nights which, when I was Minister for Transport and Communications, I was always pleased that he would share with Senator Alston. I did not necessarily have to share at all, being trusting of Senator Collins to handle the business effectively in the Senate. Because he is such a good Minister, I was in a position-I no longer have the portfolio-where I was able to place great trust in a very knowledgeable man, technologically particularly knowledgeable, in the form of Senator Collins, now the Minister for Transport and Communications. He, of course, has to now deal with the problem of Senator Alston. Therefore, I did not have to spend my evenings sitting in the advisers box of the Senate; he had to spend his evenings sitting in the box trying to teach the unteachable. In the process of teaching the unteachablebefore he said to the unteachable, 'This is far too hard; just whack the wallet off and head for the hill-. Don't bother about the explanations, we will find some way of blaming the Government for this act of theft when it all comes back here. Whack that wallet off.' - he made several attempts to teach them something else.· His point of view, to start off was, 'Don't pinch the wallet; just amend its contents. Take it out and convert all the $100 bills into $50 bills and convert all the fifties into twenties and tens. Provide a bit of loose change when you come down to dealing with the fives and then send it across to the other side of the House'. The problem was that he' had difficulty getting to grips with what particular notes ought to be converted into what. Indeed, the memory of my colleague the Minister for Transport and Communications was that the Opposition produced six different models between midnight and four in the morning. That is dramatic. Most people would describe that as policy on the run; some people would even describe it as insane. It would be unkind to describe it as that. When you are teaching the unteachable, as was occurring on this occasion, then I suppose it is quite reasonable to produce six policy models. Having done so, and assuming that the Government had been in a position to accept anyone of the six, we subsequently decided to pass that and put whatever that particular proposition was in place. According to the definition of the Opposition spokesman who brought on this matter of public importance today that ought to be a humming signal to the markets that we are doing things really well in this country. All they needed to do was to have a great deal of confidence in our parliamentary processes, because between midnight .and four in the morning we could produce six different models of a pay television regime. The sixth or the fourth or the fifth that we had produced, at whatever point at which we had decided we had so effectively jumbled the notes in the wallet, we had come to a very reasonable and effective conclusion and we need worry no more. I suppose we come to the point of wondering why it was, when they had six particular models and the seeming total attention of the Democrats and the Independents in the Senate at the time which would pyrmit them to get up anyone of them, they found life so hard in getting these things through. At the end of the. day, of course, we have with to have a look at what they did get through and thank our lucky stars at what they did not, because what they did get through in one or two other areas lives on in infamy of the recollections of members of parliament as they deal with great historic events of the day. For example"" in one of the particular amendments they got through-I do not know whether it was moved between 12 midnight and four in the morning but it certainly was spectacular-further to protecting journalists' sources, because they felt they were insufficiently protected in that Broadcasting Act, they took the matter a point further. That amendment was dramatic and revolutionary. It was one which in the clear light of day we could not sustain; nevertheless it was spectacularly interesting. Probably, given the views expressed in other .areas and in other places by Senator Schacht on our side, it would have been very much to his taste: it would have meant that judges could be put in gaol for asking journalists to disclose confidential sources. It went from the point where they might have been asked to put forward confidential sources and not be adequately protected in the course of that, to the further extreme where 'we will whack them in the chokey' - that is, the judges-for asking those questions. That is a perfectly adequate simile to the point that I made a little earlier on: when we are picking somebody's pocket and have taken the· wallet out of it, make sure he takes the blame. If a judge asks a journalist in the pursuit of seeking advice on any particular matter as to the confidentiality of his sources, whack him straight in the chokey! I am sure that, whilst Senator Schacht would have been honour-bound in the course of rationality and collective decision-making in politics-he would have voted against that-there would be certain circumstances in which he would have had some sympathy with that proposition. But overall he could not, so we had to make the necessary adjustments here in order to be able to do that. The Opposition likes to feel that the propositions it puts forward are devoid of politics; that all it is interested in doing is bringing forward a regime which produces the most open, competitive model and takes account of all the possible ramifications of technology for any particular model that it develops. It seems to view this as a not t-rribly difficult task, despite the fact that it had six shots in the course of that evening. We all know that that is an extremely difficult task indeed, but there is a political agenda brought to it by the Opposition and it is a pretty simple one. Nevertheless, people might like to think about it a little in the course of conversations about this: it concerns the ABC. People can make a reasonable argument about a requirement of the ABC to get itself involved· in new technology and, when it does, very considerable caution needs to be exercised in order to ensure it has the fiscal capability of doing that-the Government was offering it some substantial support in that regard-and that, in doing that, it does not compromise the capacity that it has had for years now to deliver an impartial source of information, news and views to our people. I say 'impartial' in the sense that it is beholden to nobody other than the taxpayer for the resources it has to disseminate the information it has. That is a serious policy issue on which we on this side of the House are divided from the Opposition: Our view is that the ABC needs to be given the resources to sustain itself. The view of the Opposition is that it needs to be given fewer and fewer resources and compelled to appear more and more as the years go by as a commercial broadcaster. That is, a reasonable debate. We can have two views on that; there is no question about it. We on this side of the House have one view and the Opposition has the other view. But, as in the case of the chap who cannot be regarded as wholly innocent when he picks somebody else's pocket and the victim cannot be entirely blamed, likewise in this regard the government which has one particular view on that cannot be entirely blamed for having a view that injects, if you like, a note of politics into the proposition. If you are arguing the alternative point of view, I would have thought it was quite self evident that you are also injecting a political element into the debate. When we have an institution-the freedom of information in this country-as important to impartial advice to our community on international and domestic affairs as is the ABC, and that is in some way or another at issue on any particular outcome, at it it should not be regarded as something that can be simply deliberated on and tossed off with the back of the hand. If it takes you a week or two to respond to a committee report in which these sorts of issues are raised, and you want to give it a bit of thought and allow those in the community who are interested in the positions of the ABC to have their views expressed, and if you have that to the forefront of your mind, I do not think it is necessarily at all justified to stand up and criticise in this place the people who are exercising a degree of caution. Having been obliged by you to revisit the issue-an issue which could have been settled six months ago-they might at least, not having had their previous model put up and accepted by you, test the propositions that have come forward from the committee and anything that they are likely to get through. There must be some regard to that fact on its own, let alone all the other enormous complexities that come with the various technologies which now deliver the pay TV system. It is also of very considerable importance in anyone of these decisions that you take at any point in time that you act in a way that encourages a competitive voice amongst the commercial sections of the media and likewise act in a way that does not so heinously disadvantage providers via older technologies from being able to have at least an opportunity of some participation in whatever new technology is coming on board. So this is a totally untimely matter of public importance brought forward by the Opposition in this regard. It is rather silly given the level of culpability of those opposite in the processes that we are now obliged to go throughand unnecessary in terms of the very competent Minister, the very competent committees and the very considerable expertise that resides in my Party on these communication matters. So well have we handled communications issues over the years that we have managed to get into what no other government before has been able to, which is a reform of the Broadcasting Services Act and the introduction of competition in telecommunications. At least we have the runs on the board in this area and the Government is quite capable of handling this without the advice of the Opposition. ClIme expired)",62
219,Mr MOORE,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPQRTANCE,"It is no wonder that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley), who has just sat down, has gone to great lengths to talk about anything but communications policy. In fact it is very suitable that his analogy should have been about walking around the comer and losing one's money because that is certainly what all the operators in the communications industry have been doing; they have been walking around looking for a policy and in the meantime losing their money while something is being done about it. The whole history of the communications policy of the Labor Government has been one of total fascination with the leadership. Government members have not been able to get away from it from the Hawke days to the Keating days-undue interest in the affairs of the Fairfax family and what went on there; undue interest in what went on with the aggregation policy. They could not get away from that one; they were all around that area. Who were the winners and who were the losers was what we heard consistently coming out as to what was going on in the Labor Party's interest in that area. While the leadership took enormous interest in what was going on in Fairfax, with aggregations, with the new ownership within the smaller television stations and what was going to happen to Channel Ten, Channel 7 and Channel 9, when they all fell out of bed, the revolving door of ministerial responsibility was taking place-Duffy, Evans, Willis, Beazley and Collins, not to mention Kerin and RichardsonMr Carlton-Richardson?",66
220,Mr MOORE,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPQRTANCE,"Yes, Richardson. Who is he now? He was one of those extra specials who knew all about what should be done in revolving doors, particularly in these areas. So, when the Minister talks about walking around the comer and losing one's money, it is worth thinking about what was really going on in the ALP in these areas. I was fascinated to see that senators seem to be 'a special'. We had Button on Monday; we have Collins on Wednesday. Who is next? Apparently there are some geniuses there determining Government policy on both economics and communications. When everyone talks about the coming great revolution in communications and what is going to be done with it, surely to goodness the Government can come up with some policy on communications. The way in which the Labor Government has gone about the handling of this matter has been a thorough disgrace. I just want to raise a couple of pomts about the handling of the ABC. The ABC plays a role in Australia. I am not a great supporter, but it certainly plays a role throughout community-there is no doubt about thatdoing and it deserves a place in the sun. But 1 it quite extraordinary that the ABC demands that it be put into this, accepts the news current affairs restrictions and then says, 'Well what are we going to do next? That is not good enough. We have to break out'. is what we heard this morning on the radio from the Minister for Transport and Comgo munications (Senator Collins) about the going into other programs. The cost of running one of these channels, running one of these pods off the satellite, about half a billion dollars. That is a lot money. The ABC is running around saying that it does not have enough money to vise football. It is putting a television service into Asia, which 1 presume will be paid for by clients or the taxpayers. But where is going to get the money that it is proposing to it. put into this area? It is a very big question that has to be answered by the Government. Why was the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) so opposed to this as time went by? ·What were the questions and why did he want to knock it out? It is probably time that we looked at the Prime Minister's agenda. What is the Prime Minister's problem, the Prime Minister's dilemma, in all of this? He has three policies. He had links with the former Minister, Senator Richardson, and we are into the Keating-Collins area. have to understand the other relationships. When the Aussat satellite was first put into the sky one particular media magnate, Packer, was badgering us daily to get into it-very heavily. The right honourable memis ber for New England (Mr Sinclair) would That recall that very well. Mr O'Keefe-And you fell for it, hook, line and sinker-and it has cost Australia $1 billion since.",66
221,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPQRTANCE,Order! The honourable member for Burke will have his opportunity in a few moments.,67
222,Mr MOORE,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPQRTANCE,"The real dilemma facing the Government at the moment is how to win the next election. The most important part of winning the next election is keeping the not the media in line. So what the Government is is spinning out the line to these people. find All that the committees are doing at the moment is listening to a long run of people and who are going to the Government to twist its arm for a deal here and twist its arm for a deal there. They go around to the Right; they That know how to handle the Right in Sydney; there is no problem with that. But then they to the Left, the only mob that really has no ABC idea what economics is all about. Look at Victoria; it is the only State led by the Left and the Left has completely blown it. When is people go and speak to the Left members of of a committee or Caucus, they come out with a big thumbs down. That is what it is all teleabout in the Caucus at the moment-a big thumbs down from the Left because it is not very good on economics. Those on the Right it can add up; they know which way to go on When we go past the factions, we then have Senator Schacht, the institutional expert on every subject-foreign affairs, communications, factions; no matter what it is, Schacht is into it. So now he has to be consulted on everything. Every time we pick up a paper, he is in on the act. I am not surprised that the Labor Party does not know which way to had jump on this. But 1 do know that it is absolutely imperative for the Prime Minister to now keep the media going one way. He got a But also we terrible bump yesterday. Speaking at the annual general meeting of Mr News Ltd, Mr Murdoch said, 'I wish the Government would get out of my way'. That not the way to speak to the Prime Minister. is not the sort of stuff he wants to hear from Mr Murdoch. The Prime Minister knows that, with election time coming up, if he keeps the lines spinning out there, the chances of keeping the Murdoch newspapers and the like in line are infinitely better. He says, 'Let not make a decision now; let us play it along a bit'. That is why no decisions are coming out of the Labor Party at present. We are going to have to live with indecision, no matter what the smoke screen might be and despite all the factions and all the waffle that the Minister just went through. His heart was in it. He knows that a sell-out is going on. He was sold out. He was one of those in the revolving door; he went through it. As a consequence of that, the end of the game comes for the Labor Party in that particular neck of the woods. I think that the handling of communications in Australia, which is our most important area for the future-probably for the next 10 years-has been appalling. There has been indecision, lack of leadership and consistent personal fiddling in areas where that should not have occurred. 1 refer particularly to the Fairfax business when the Prime Minister of the day. and the Treasurer of the day were in almost daily contact with principal players and were around the gallery. That is well known. What were they so interested in? Their interest was in making sure that the current Fairfax leadership was down and that the new owners, whoever they were-young Warwick was going to fail-were suitable. They wanted to bring in someone suitable. As a consequence they played a huge game in the print media. I invite honourable members to look at what happened with aggregation, the games that were played in the radio industry and licences that went out, and ask who received the special radio licences that were given out in particular areas. There is some very intera esting ownership around and that should be looked at. We should look at who is pulling the power in behind the decisions in the current make-up of pay TV. When that one is finally resolved, we should ask who is going to be in cable television, because that is ultimate prize. If honourable members have any doubt about that, I will quote again from Murdoch's statement on pay TV. In all these areas the sticky fingers of members of the Labor Party are out. They are deeply into communications area for manipulation, for control of the various forms of the press, ultimately to try to keep a manipulated area for themselves for the next election.",67
223,Mr OKEEFE,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPQRTANCE,"I Government could not believe my ears when I heard the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore) industry concede his role in this matter. There would be universal acceptance in this Parliament, both sides of the· House, that one of the biggest dud decisions ever made by a government in Australia was the decision to purchase Aussat. The honourable member has conceded in the House today that he was the Minister who did it. Ever since then we have all been trying to find ways of unloading the thing. It has cost Australia a billion dollars. The honourable member has been touted as the media expert on the other side of the House. The honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith), who led this discussion, does have credibility in these areas. However, I have to say to him that although his contribution today was eloquent he knows very well that it was fraudulent.",68
224,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPQRTANCE,I think the honourable member would assist by not using that word. He will withdraw it and continue.,68
225,Mr OKEEFE,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPQRTANCE,I will happily withdraw that term. He knows that what he had to say was not quite as things ought to be. Mr Staples-Bent.,68
226,Mr OKEEFE,MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPQRTANCE,"It was mendacious. Today's matter of public importance concerns the inability of the Government to develop a the coherent policy. Four months ago the Government arrived at a decision on pay TV. As it turns out, with the benefit of hindsight, it was decision that was not going to last because things have changed. What changed? First of all, the legislation passed through this House and went over to the Senate. The Senate rejected the legislation. The Senate formed a committee and arising out of that committee the was a very significant change in the whole ball game. That was due to a presentation by the owner of the satellite, Optus, to the Senate committee saying that we no longer needed to deal with analog technology, that digital the technology-which means that instead of dealing with six channels we can have anyand thing up to 24 channels-will be here much faster than anyone had predicted. The industry was telling both the Opposition and the that digital technology would not be available for at least five years. The is now conceding that it will probably be in the vicinity of two to three years. on I will concede that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was absolutely correct-and I have had arguments with him about it-all along in saying that one cannot lock out one form of technology from another in this, because it is all moving too fast. What has happened is that the Senate has arrived at the conclusion that this issue needs to be re-thought. The legislation has come back as a result of two key issues. The Senate was not satisfied with the role of the ABC and the model the Government proposed originally and it was not satisfied with the technology model that was being proposed. The legislation has come back to the Government and we have accepted two things. We have accepted that we now have to deal with the digital model. What that means to the people who understand the technology is that whereas we were having to look at a phasedin introduction of a range of channels we are now looking at a much broader option for Australian viewers and one that can be achieved much more quickly. That has meant that the model has changed. A proposal is evolving. I think that the Government will come to some consensus during the next week or so, so that when this House returns in two weeks time it will have a proposal that, hopefully, those opposite who have been complaining about delays will support in the Senate. What are the things we have to take account of in developing this model? The first thing we have to take account of is the technology. I remind those opposite that noone on this side of the House is interested in revisiting a million imported Japanese video recorders. When Australia moved to videos, VCRs, when the Opposition was in government, there was no attempt to put an Australian industry policy in place. The Opposition just let it be an import policy. We imported into this country half a billion dollars worth of video recorders. We are not prepared to do that with pay TV. We are insisting that digital technology be introduced in Australia via Australian industry to create Australian expertise and jobs. If it takes a months longer to develop the industry capability, rather than just imports, we will ly cop the delays because we want the jobs and the expertise in Australia. We are working through the industry policy. That means that when Australians go down to the electronics shop and buy their pay TV receiver to hook up to the satellite on their roof they will not be buying a model like the Opposition introduced, with VHS on one side of the video shop and Beta models .on the other, and hoping for heaven's sake that they have bought the right model. We are not interested in that. We are going to determine the technology that will suit all pay TV channels and all consumers. We are going to take our time and we make no apology for that. We are not going to have open slather for imported movies and imported production of film and content. We are desperately keen to promote the Australian film, television and production industry. It is part of our media policy. We are writing into this legislation very strong Australian content rules to ensure that the pay TV that we receive in Australia, when people look at all those other channels, does have strong Australian film, news and sport content in it. Many members of this House have travelled overseas. They know that they can stay in a hotel somewhere overseas and turn on anything up to 50 channels of television. Most of it is from all over the place and we would say that a lot of it is junk. If we are introducing pay TV 'and up to 12 extra channels of television for people who are going to be paying for it and receiving it by subscription, it is going to have solid Australian content. I do not think anybody should be criticising the Government for that. If it takes a little time we will take time, but it is coherent. To come in here and say that the Government, via a delay process that the Opposition started in the Senate, is in some way holding up the industry is being less than honest about the whole issue. I have a couple of other points to mention. The ABC will have a role in pay TV. It is totally dishonest to claim that the Prime Minister is opposed to the ABC being infew volved in pay TV. It is reasonable to say that the Prime Minister and other members of the happiGovernment are concerned about an openended financial commitment. We are looking at a model whereby the ABC can be involved with pay TV, but not be up for massive running costs. We should remember that the ABC does not have the capacity to earn revenue from other areas. It may be competing with other network giants who have magazines, advertising or film production around the world and so have some means by which they can subsidise the operation of their pay TV outfit. The ABC does not have that funding source; it is reliant totally on government funding. So we have to find a way to get the ABC involved without an open-ended financial commitment that finishes up in the Budget. We will work our way through that, and the ABC will be a key player. We are working our way through the very significant change in digital technology; we nations are working our way through the role of the ABC; we are determined' that the future opportunities in this industry, both in amended Australia and the Asia-Pacific area, will be taken up by Australians for Australians; and list. we are determined to stick to our industry policy and, film and production content. If it means a duopoly model 1992 and 1997, so be it. But everybody Report understands that the Government to an open ,and competitive regime in 1997, after the industry has had the opportunity to get itself established and the consumer base is there. As I have said before, revisit Japanese video recorders, Beta, and the whole mess that those opposite Notices made of that. It is coherent and it will work. (TIme expired) , , Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Hon.

228,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the ninth report of the Committee for 1992 relating to the office construction at section 45, Belconnen, ACT. Ordered that the report be printed.",71
229,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEES,"by leave-,-The Committee's ninth report for 1992 deals with the construction of a five-storey office building in the Canberra suburb of Belconnen. The building will be occupied by the ACT regional office of the Australian Taxation Office. It will have a gross floor area of 22,000 square metres of which 14,100 square metres will be for offices. The ground floor of the building will contain public access areas and an automatic document dispatch centre. The four upper storeys will contain office areas and staff amenities. The estimated completed cost of the building will not exceed $40.9m. The report recommends that the work should proceed, and also recommends a . number of features being incorporated in the design. These involve the installation of a gas co-generation plant to provide electrical power to the l,:milding, the installation of a dimmed lighting system, as opposed to a switched control lighting system, the removal of fill from the site' and landscaping. A number of arguments were advanced which purported to demonstrate that the use of a gas co-generation plant in the building would not be practical or economical. The Committee remains - unconvinced about the weight of these arguments and has recommended that a gas co-generation plant be installed. A gas co-generation plant· has a number of environmental benefits and its installation in la building owned by the Commonwealth will be a reflection of the Government's commitment to· energy conservation and to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The Committee has recommended that the building be provided with an automatic light dimming system. The system adjusts light levels automatically to compensate for the amount of daylight reaching the inside of the building. On bright sunny days, the lights are automatically dimmed and, on overcast days Report or during darkness,' the light intensity is automatically increased. The Committee believes this method of lighting control is far superior to a switched control system. The site contains a large amount of fill which will need to be removed before excavation can commence. The Committee has recommended that the contract for the removal of the fill should not preclude its sale by the successful tenderer. Nevertheless, the final destination of the fill should be determined and, if it is offered for sale, the cost of its removal should be adjusted accordingly. The Committee questioned the extent and cost of landscaping proposed and has recommended that the scope of landscaping be reduced. In view of its current heavy workload, the Committee has decided to table a short report recommending that the work proceed and enabling Australian Estate Management to adhere to its construction timetable. It must nevertheless be made clear that the Committee is seriously concerned about being placed in this situation. I make the 'follOWing points in this regard, lest there be any subsequent comment about the Committee's processes causing delays to the commencement of public works, which is a charge that the bureaucrats are not slow to put on us sometimes. In late January Australian Estate Management requested the Committee to approve the commencement of design and documentation and preliminary tender negotiations. The Committee agreed with this in late February. Australian Estate Management was hoping for an early hearing into the proposal and for the Committee's report to be tabled before the winter recess. The proposal was not referred to the Committee until 25 June of this year, which was too late for the Committee to conduct its public hearing and present its report before the winter adjournment. On 15 July Australian Estate Management sought the Committee's approval to call tenders for the excavation and foundation works in advance of the report being tabled in Parliament. The Committee's approval to do this was given on 28 July. The Committee at this time was optimistic that its report could be tabled by mid-October. However, because of the large number of references which had been received by the Committee in the intervening months-and we are about to receive three more today-which tended to rearrange the timetable of hearings and report preparation and over which the Committee had very 'little control, the Committee was unable to meet this unrealistic deadline. On 28 September Australian Estate Management sought the Committee's approval to award the earthworks contract in advance of' the tabling' of the Committee's report. The provisions of the Public Works Committee Act do not permit this course of action to be followed. This highlights the need for all departments and agencies to adhere closely to planned milestones during the development of a proposal. In this instance, Australian Estate Management planning proceeded on the basis of a favourable report from the Committee before the winter adjournment. The Committee believes the time has come to give the strongest possible signal to all departments and agencies that, in future, it will not have imposed on it unrealistic and unreasonable schedules which presuppose peremptory inquiries and approval of works. In conclusion, I want to particularly thank the other Committee members for the assistance they gave me in the preparation of this report. I particularly wanUo thank the secretarial staff and single out the Assistant Secretary, Michael Fetter, and our newest recruit, Sophia Konti. Only late yesterday did we get the first draft of this report for the Committee to go through. After the Committee went through it late yesterday, the secretariat staff worked late into the night. At midday today the Committee was again brought together and the final report was approved. There were some amendments to that, which meant the secretarial staff again worked on it, and only 10 minutes before I came into this - hamber did I get the final draft. The staff concerned with the preparation of this report worked far beyond the call of duty. On behalf of the Committee, I thank them for their dedication and the work they put into this. In conclusion, I commend the report to the House.",71
230,Mr TAYLOR,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The Opposition generally supports this proposal, subject to the caveat and the qualifications expressed by the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis). As another member of the Public Works Committee, I add my thanks to all those concerned with bringing this report forward in such a timely manner. I want to make two comments. The first relates to a point made by the honourable member for Throsby about the unnecessary speed which this matter had to be dealt with. . All departments should understand that in doing this we are not making an exception. They must observe the due processes of the legislation and the procedures of what is arguably the busiest joint statutory committee in this Parliament. The second point, on which the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) might wish to comment, relates to one aspect which has not been mentioned in relation to the national office of the Australian Taxation Office as distinct from the regional office of the ATO, which is referred to in this report. The national office will be reduced over the next 10 years by about 1,000 staff. There was some discussion in the Public Works Committee as to whether the proje-t before us proposal would be better sited in Civic than in Belconnen and that the national office might go to Belconnen instead. I hope the honourable member for Fraser will take it on board that the Parliament must not in a few years be faced with a reversal of that position and with unnecessary expenditure of public moneys. Other than that, the Opposition has much pleasure in supporting the project.",72
231,Mr LANGMORE,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I congratulate the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) on getting this decision through very quickly. The planning for this office block was very thorough. It involved consultation with the staff of the Australian Taxation Office. A survey was made as to where staff members wanted the office located. The majority of the 600 staff wanted it located in Belconnen. That was a welcome approach to planning and a welcome outcome. It means that more of the office work is located outside Civic; it is dispersed to Belconnen, which is what the principles involved in the planning of Canberra. require at present. The basis for planning in Canberra has been that work opportunities should be dispersed around the town-not concentrated in Civic, but spread in Belconnen, Woden and Tuggeranong so that we avoid the problems of congestion and high office costs that are experienced in a lot of other cities in Australia. Therefore, this step towards that dispersal is very welcome. .A case can be made for having the national office of the Australian Taxation Office in Belconneh as well. I fully accept that it would be wasteful to try to transfer the two now. But I hope that when the time comes, the national office will also be located, perhaps co-located, with the regional office in Belconnen, because that would achieve the dispersal of employment opportunity that we want and bring those two parts of the Taxation Office together. . I welcome. this approval because it means improved working conditions for the regional office staff; it means increased work for the local construction industry; and it does so in a part of the town that needs it v.ery badly. I in this support and thank the Committee for its consideration of this matter. Public Works Reference",73
232,Mr STAPLES,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services, I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Relocation of the Australian Hydrographic Office (AHO) to Wollongong. The Royal Australian Navy Hydrographic Service is responsible for the publication of nautical charts and other information required for the safety of ships navigating in Australian waters. On 24 June 1992 the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) announced that the Australian Hydrographic Office, the AHO, would be relocated to Wollongong and asked that work proceed to the point where the project could be considered by the Public Works Committee. Navigational services, currently provided from the AHO in North Sydney and to be relocated to Wollongong, include chart compilation and publishing, chart maintenance-updating-chart distribution, provision of texts such as tide tables and sailing directions, and an extensive archive of survey documents. The Australian Hydrographic Office is presently located in an eight-storey Defenceowned building in North Sydney. The standard of accommodation is poor and poses operational difficulties which give rise to many inefficiencies. The single most significant limitation. in the existing building, apart from the overall floor space available in the building, is the maximum useable area on each floor. This obliges chart production staff to commute continually between floors to carry out different aspects of their daily work schedule. Operationally, the building is inefficient for the functions performed. These inefficiencies cannot be overcome by alteration or refurbishment. The new facilities are proposed to be located in Station Street, adjacent to the Wollongong railway station and t,he new Taxation Office building to be completed in 1993. The proposed facilities will comprise a two-level podium containing entry foyer, stores, registry and a welcoming room at the ground level, with an upper level car park for 40 vehicles. Above the podium will rise the five-lfwel office tower, with each floor having a nominal net area of 800 metres square. The top floor is stepped back to the. north to provide a covered roof deck for staff recreational and ieisure use. The structured car park above ground was selected to avoid excavation of the rock sub-base present at the site. It is expected that preliminary design will be completed by March 1993, documentation by May 1993 and construction of the base building by December 1993. Fit out and commissioning of the building, together with installation and testing of equipment, is expected to be completed by February 1994 in advance of occupation from 1 March 1994. The cost budget for the proposed work is $lOm at October 1992 prices, encompassing the fit out, furniture and fittings, including furniture work stations. An additional $2.5m has been budgeted to cover project expenses, equipment, land acquisition and contingency to meet the total project cost at October 1992 prices of $12.5m. I commend the motion to the House.",73
233,Mr DOWNER,COMMITTEES,"The coalition supports the referral to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works of this work to relocate the Australian Hydrographic Office to Wollongong. Honourable members on this side of the House, and no doubt honourable members opposite, have enormous respect for the Hydrographic Office and the fundamentally important job that it undertakes on behalf of the Department of Defence. The work of the Hydrographic Office and its contribution to the defence of the nation are often underrated. There is still a very long way to go to finish the hydrographic work which began with Captain Cook in 1770. Some excellent work has been done by DSTO to facilitate that process with its LADS scheme. I wish the Hydrographic Office, particularly with its new LADS aircraft, all the best in getting on with that gigantic task. The coalition believes that the relocation of the Hydrographic Office from North Sydney to Wollongong has been motivated by political considerations by the Government, which is intent on trying to improve its flagging fortunes in the economically depressed Wollongongarea. It is not a decision which has been based in any way on considerations of how best to use taxpayers' money. That may sound, as the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples), who is at the table, seems to be suggesting, like a bit of rhetoric from an Opposition wanting to make a political point, but I happen to have with me in the House today to reinforce this matter-and it is a document that I would like the Public Works Committee to take I. into account in the process of its referenc-\a confidential memo written by Mr AI.S. Podger, the Deputy Secretary, Acquisitions and Logistics in the Department of Defence, to Minister Ray and repeated to Minister BiIney, the CDF, the Secretary to the Department, CNS and cas. In this document Me Podger, on behalf of the Department, makes a number of extremely interesting points. The document shows that Defence actually put Wollongong third and last in a list of three options for relocating the Hydrographic Office. The Defence document reads: Leichhardt remains the preferred location on cost benefit grounds; This is according to Me Podger's confidential minute to the Minister. It continues: Newcastle, at best remains marginally more expensive than Leichhardt, but has the risks of higher cost, lower benefit and added disruption; I am sure honourable members from Newcastle will not be pleased to hear thflt. The minute goes on: Wollongong would be the most expensive option by a significant margin. Defence would be required to buy land and pay carparking contributions not applicable in other options. It would entail similar disruption as Newcastle to the work of the office. Mr Lindsay-Where did you get the memo?",74
234,Mr DOWNER,COMMITTEES,"I was given the memo off the back of a truck, as is often said. This memo is, by the way, dated 23 April 1992. I know that the honourable member for Herbert is interested in the memo. A little later I will seek leave to table it so he will have the opportunity to peruse it, because it will interest him. It is interesting and not surprising that Me Podger comes to the following fairly obvious conclusion: I recommend that youthe Ministeragree the selection of Leichhardt as the most costeffective site for the relocation of the Hydrographic Office and that the Departme);lt proceed with the formal processes for project approval and PWC clearance. The subject of PWC clearance is beginning in this very debate. There was a subsequent meeting between Minister Ray, Minister Bilney and the Department where they decided to have another look at this. The minutes that we have been able to obtain do not tell us why they decided to reconsider it, but I think that is obvious for all to see. Taxpayers' money does not matter to them, does it, as long as a few votes are squared away for the ALP. These findings by the Department were not based on its assessments alone; they were based on an assessment which was also made by an independent consultant, and approval was given to the work done by the independent consultant. It is interesting to note that the Minister, in moving the motion, gives no better reason for the relocation than to say that the existing eight-floor office is inconvenient to personnel who need· to move between floors. The Government is actually proposing to move those people who have to work on eight floors into a building of what? A level building? No, a building of five floors. It saves them three floors-I concede that point-at a fair cost to the taxpayer. A subsequent minute dated 24 June 1992 from the Department of Defence to the Minister-another confidential minute which appears to be in my hand at the moment, if I can put it that way-refers to the Department's concern about the relocation of staff to Wollongong, or the commuting they would have to do to Wollongong. This is a matter of great concern, as I am sure the honourable member for Herbert knows, amongst those tremendously professional staff who are working at the moment in Walker Street, North Sydney. In this minute to the Minister, Me Podger says: · relocation costs to Newcastle or Wollongong might come down depending on the number of staff not prepared to move, but this could be offset if they were not rerleployable and redundancy costs were incurred; That is one of the things the Department is thinking about: making some of the staff redundant. Me Podger goes on to say to the Minister: · there is a clear preference of staff to remain in Sydney, with Newcastle a distant second preference and Wollongong clearly third; and · the effect of any intercity relocation on the operations of the Hydrographic Office would clearly involve some disruption, and Navy views might be sought. In the end, when it comes to votes for the ALP, who cares about the views of the Royal Australian Navy? They would be extremely expendable. The final point I want to make is that in the Minister'sMr Staples interjecting",75
235,Mr DOWNER,COMMITTEES,"I have 15 minutes and I am going to use every one of them. The Minister will be interested in· this because, although he did not write the speech he was reading out and actually knew nothing about it, he is on the record as the person who made the speech. One of the things he said in the speech, he might recallMr Staples-lam very worriedl",75
236,Mr DOWNER,COMMITTEES,"I know the Minister is Lavarack worried, particularly about the margin Jagajaga as a result of the State election. According to the Minister in his speech, at October 1992 prices the project will cost $12.5m. Is that what the Department thinks in its confidential minute? Answer, no. The Department estimates that the cost of moving to the Wollongong site is $19.3m. How the Government gets $12.5m out of $19.3m, one· does not know, but doubtless it is through some sort of creative accounting-and this is something the Public Works Committee will have an entertaining time examining. By the way, for honourable members who are interested in the alternatives, moving Leichhardt will cost $16.6m, and moving to Newcastle will cost $17.1m. That is over $2m cheaper than Wollongong. In a sense, that is the price we pay for pork-barrelling politics. What is great about these confidential minutes is that they actually put a dollars and price on pork-barrelling, which I know the public would like to be aware of. I assure the House that the coalition, on election to Government, will not proceed with this pork-barrelling fantasy. That will not happen under us. It is just one of the ways will ensure that defence is used as a vehicle to enhance the security of this country, not as some sort of vehicle to prop up votes of Labor members of parliament. Question resolved in t4e afftrmative. Mr Beale-I seek leave to table the two documents that the honourable member for Mayo referred to. Leave not granted. Public Works Reference",76
237,Mr STAPLES,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Mr Beddall), I move: That, in accordance' with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed works be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Redevelopment of Lavarack Army Barracks, Townsville, stage 1. Barracks is the home of 3 Brigade, in the Army's ready deployment force. It was originally built in two stages: in 1965-66 facilities were build for 3 Battalion task force; and in 1980-81 facilities were built for additionallogistics units to support the operational deployment force. Various changes over the years have led to unsatisfactory arrangements in some areas in respect of zoning, functional relationships, scales and standards of accommodation and inappropriate use of buildings. The proposal is the first for a multi-scale project for the provision of modem working and training facilities at Lavarack Barracks. The proposal provides for permanent purposeto built accommodation for 162 Reconnaissance Squadron, elements of 3 Brigade Administrative Support Battalion, Lavarack Barracks sick quarters and an area kerbside refuelling facility for the Townsville Logistic Company. The estimated cost of the proposal is $20.96m cents at December 1991 prices. I commend the is something motion to the House.",76
238,Mr ROCHER,COMMITTEES,"The coalition welcomes this reference and supports the Government's stated intention, subject to we the findings, recommendations and deliberations of the Parliamentary Standing Commitbut tee on Public Works, to proceed with these the works at the Lavarack Army Barracks in Townsville. As the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) pointed out, 3 Brigade, which is the Army's ready deployment force, is located at Lavarack along with other important units and elements of our Army. In general, the coalition supports the commitment to the establishment of these facilities in general in the Townsv-le region. The works proposed, including the sick quarters which will service the whole of Lavarack Barracks, will play an important part in maintaining, and perhaps improving, the morale of our forces at Lavarack. The 162 Reconnaissance Squadron is to be provided with some purpose built accommodation which will be an improvement on accommodation that it has had to occupy for some time. The proposed works also include a refuelling facility for the Townsville Logistic Company and the like. We welcome the reference and wish the Committee well .in its deliberations. The coalition looks forward to reading its and to considering its recommendations.",76
239,Mr LINDSAY,COMMITTEES,"I am delighted that this reference is being made to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works. Apart from the fact that this work will provide a big jobs boost in Townsville, I wish to point out that it is the first component of a multi-stage master plan for the provision of more modern working and training facilities at Lavarack Barracks. As has been said, this $23.45m stage one proposal will involve construction of purpose built accommodation for 3 Brigade Administrative Support Battalion, 162 Reconnaissance Squadron, a sick quarters for the barracks and an area kerb side refuelling facility for the Townsville Logistic Company. As has been said by other speakers, Lavarack Barracks is almost 30 years old. Although many ongoing improvements have been made, there is now an urgent need for .extensive upgrading and refurbishment of many of the facilities. The largest project to improve conditions at Lavarack Barracks so far is the $27m upgrade of 'single soldier accommodation, which has seen 36 buildings completed and a further two buildings current1y under refurbishment. Stage one of the pending new works will enhance the capability of key elements of the Army's ready deployment force. Mr Deputy Speaker, during the time that you were the Minister for Defence, you often visited Lavarack Barracks. I know that you share my joy at this announcement that these works are now being referred to the Public Works Committee. Provision has been made in this year's Federal Budget to enable commencement of the work in May 1993, and for the works to be completed by June 1996. I understand that the Public Works Committee, headed by the Chairman, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) and the Deputy Chairman, the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor), will be visiting Townsville on 20 and 21 November this year to conduct public hearings into this particular project. I wish them well in their examinations of this work, and for a speedy report to this Parliament so that that work will comfindings mence on time in May next year. Question resolved in the affirmative. Public Works Reference",77
240,Mr STAPLES,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus), I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Storage/display facility for the Australian War Memorial, Mitchell, ACT. The 1992-93 Budget process approved an appropriation of $4.572m and reallocation of previously approved funds for storage and display facilities and for alterations to the existing memorial building. The new facility will replace existing unsatisfactory temporary storage at the Royal Military College, Duntroon. This storage has deteriorated badly in recent years with flooding, vermin, minimal security, and poor environmental. conditions unacceptably increasing the risk of damage and destruction to the important and historically irreplaceable relics. The Australian National Audit Office earlier this year reported that the Duntroon store was inadequate for continued use and that alternative storage should be urgently sought. The store is totally unsuitable for visitors to view the objects held by the War Memorial and is denying public access to a significant part of Australia's national cultural collection. RMC Duntroon has advised that the old store building will need to be removed before the 1994-95 financial year to make way for RMC redevelopment. The project comprises construction of a building of approximately. 5,000 metres square of floor space. It will contain an unobstructed storage area, offices for up to three memorial staff, a small visitor entry foyer with facilities for charging and cloaking, and suitable toilet facilities. The facility will also provide a workshop suitable for the maintenance. and restoration of large relics, appropriate security and environmental equipment as well as associated parking facilities and landscaping. The building is estimated to cost $6.5m at September 1992 prices and construction is planned to commence in 1993 with the building taking approximately one year to complete. I table the supporting drawings and commend the motion to the House.",77

242,Mr STAPLES,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus), I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Construction of offices at the comer of Adelaide and Creek Streets, Brisbane, for the Australian Estate ment to be leased by the Australian Taxation Office and other Commonwealth Government agencies. The proposed work recommended by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works is the construction of offices at the corner of Adelaide and Creek Streets, Brisbane, for the Australian Estate Management to be leased to the Australian Taxation Office and other Commonwealth Government agencies. The proposed building, to be known as Terrica Place, will provide approximately 25,000 square metres net of office space, 2,300 square metres net of retail public contact space, 1,000 square metres of basement storage space and 210 basement car parking bays. The site is located in Brisbane's central business district and forms part of a Commonwealth owned parcel of land bounded by ANZAC Square, Adelaide, Creek and Ann Streets. The building will primarily accommodate the Australian Taxation Office, which will occupy at least 15,000 square metres of office space plus public contact space and basement storage. The balance of the office space in the building will be leased to other agencies. A small component comprising the retail area will be leased to small businesses or shops. Benefits resulting from this project include the effective utilisation of a currently underdeveloped Commonwealth site and the completion of the Commonwealth Government Centre providing a focal point for government services in Brisbane. The project, which is expected to take approximately 26 months to complete, will boost local employment and industry and· is expected to generate over 400 on-site jobs, with a similar number off site. The proposal Reference was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works in June 1992. The Committee tabled its report on 13 October 1992 recommending the building's construction at an estimated total .cost of $82m. In its report, the Committee recommended that Australian Estate Management continue discussions with the Brisbane City Council, ACROD and the Public Sector Union during the design development phase and report to it Manageon the progress of these discussions. I' am advised that these discussions are continuing and that progress will be reported to the Committee at the first opportunity. I thank the Committee for its report.

Question resolved in the affirmative. BOUNTY (COMPUTERS) AMENDMENT BILL 1992 First Reading Bill presented by . Mr Staples, for Mr Beddall, and read a first time. Second Reading",78
244,Mr STAPLES,COMMITTEES,"I move: . That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill proposes a number of amendments to the Bounty (Computers) Act 1984 which will introduce new· definitions· to limit eliginised bility of two bountiable factory costs, as well as strengthen the ability of the administrators of the scheme to substantiate claims made under the scheme. The computer bounty is an important element of the Government's policy for the computer industry which includes manufacturers of modems, multiplexers, microprocessors, computer sub-assemblies, electronic microCircuits and, since July 1991, printed circuit boards. The .continuation of the computer bounty scheme in 1990, which resulted in the extension of the scheme until 31 December 1995, reflects a commitment by this Government, .and indeed this Parliament, to encouraging increased development and use of computer equipment and microprocessor technology. In 1991-92 the computer bounty program provided about $74m of direct assistance to 516 registered manufacturing premises. The program is expected to provide $71m to industry in 1992-93 and similar levels in forward years with the adoption of the legislative changes proposed jn this Bill. On current trends, without either legislative or administrative changes, the Budget outlays for this program are expected to be of the order of $84m in 1992-93. The amendments in particular introduce a definition of 'research and developmenf in clause 4 of the Bill to clarify and limit the eligible expenditure which might be included under this phrase. This proposed definition, together with clause 5 of the· Bill, expressly requires that, in order for expenditure on research and development to qualify for inclusion in a manufacturer's bountiable factory costs, the research and development must be likely to result in the manufacture of bountiable equipment within the bounty period; that is, by 31 December 1995. The second definition proposed in this Bill, in clause 3, introduces a modified definition of 'operating software' to expressly exclude software for local area network or LAN systems and microprocessor-based equipment and to continue eligibility of operating software for ADP equipment. When the Act was established in 1984 the Government recogthat the development and modification of operating software could improve the performance of Australian produced computer hardware. Accordingly, the bounty encompassed operating software in order to encourage computer hardware manufacturers to invest in this activity. Today there are strong commercial incentives encouraging investment in the development of software for applications such as local area networks, EFTPOS equipment, microprocessor-based equipment and automatic controllers. The market forces and technology trends encouraging manufacturers to develop and modify such software for their equipment are expected to continue. Accordingly, the Government sees no necessity for the bounty to continue to cover software development for this type of equipment. However, the market situation for manufacturers of ADP equipment is different and the Government considers it is important to encourage this industry to invesfin the development or enhancement of operating software in Australia. Therefore, the Government proposes that the computer bounty continue providing an incentive to this industry to increase investment in operating software development activities. There are two other substantive amendments in this Bill which are explained in greater detail in the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. The first is designed to strengthen the ability under the Act to substantiate claims-clause 10· of the. Bill-by requiring bounty recipients to keep records and accounts which are relevant to claims for several years, in line with provisions in other bounty Acts. The second introduces an administrative refonn to allow interstate manufacturemployees ing operations to lodge consolidated claims across State and Territory borders, thereby reducing administrative effort and costs for some claimants, to which clause 6 refers. Financial Impact Statement The measures contained in this Bill which include new definitions for certain eligible factory costs and which strengthen the ability of the administrators of the scheme to substantiate claims made under it are expected to result in Budget savings in 1991-92 dollars as follows: $4m in financial year 1992-93, commencing 1 January 1993; $8m in financial year 1993-94; $9m in financial year 1994-95; and $5m in financial year 1995-96, ending on 31 December 1995.:1 commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill.

245,Mr SNOWDON,SEAFARERS REHABILITATION AND,"Northern TerritoryParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training) (4.45 p.m.)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill introduces a new scheme of compensation and rehabilitation for seafarers who are injured in the course of their employment. It will replace the outdated and inadequate Seamen's Compensation Act 1911 with modem and comprehensive rehabilitation and compensation arrangements similar to those applicable to Commonwealth employees. In 1987 the Government commissioned Professor Haro.d Luntz to conduct a review of the policy basis and the operation of the Seamen's Compensation Act 1911. The terms of reference of the review required Professor Luntz to consider the desirability of consistenof cy between the seamen's compensation legislation and the proposals being developed at that time for the new Commonwealth workers' compensation legislation. These proposals were subsequently enshrined in the Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988, or CERC Act for short. Professor Luntz's review of seamen's compensation was tabled in Parliament in June 1988. Since that time the Luntz review recommendations have been the subject of extensive consultations involving shipowners, the maritime unions and the ACTU. The outcome of this process is a Bill which radically moves away from the outmoded compensation regime which the Seamen's Compensation Act provides. The new scheme will combine fair, earnings-related benefits with comprehensive rehabilitation requirements and other measures aimed at getting injured employees restored to health and back to work as quickly as possible. The Bill also restores the former nexus with the workers' compensation legislation applicable to Commonwealth employees. This is consistent with the unitary compensation structure applying across public and private sector employment in all the State and Territory workers' compensation schemes. This is a large and complex Bill with many essentially technical provisions. These are described in detail in the explanatory memorandum. It is appropriate, however, to draw the attention of honourable members to the main features of the Bill. Liability and In.surance The new arrangements will be based on individual employer liability. This acknowledges that the individual employers and their insurers already have the necessary infrastructure in place to manage such arrangements and that the imposition of a Government fund on such a small industry, with around 6,000 employees, would not be cost-effective. In order that employers will be a1?le to meet their liabilities, the Bill requires them to be insured with an insurer authorised under the Insurance Act 1973 or be indemnified by a protection and indemnity association which is a member the international group of protection and indemnity associations. There will be a special industry wide 'safety net' fund, to provide coverage for industry trainees and for temporarily unemployed seafarers while attending seafarers engagement centres in accordance with industry labour pooling arrangements. Both these categories of persons are employed by the industry as a whole, rather than by individual employers. The safety net fund will also be the nominal insurer. In other words, if the employer or the employer's insurer is unable to meet liabilities because of bankruptcy, for example, the fund will meet those liabilities. There is provision for the industry-wide fund to be established in one of two ways-a fund operated by employers collectively as a corporate entity or a fund operated by the administering authority. The Bill provides for the Minister to approve a corporate body as the furid, provided it meets stipulatedconditions. Industry employers have already established such a corporate entity. However, if the industry fund should ever fail to meet the stipulated conditions, the Minister has the power to revoke the approval of the corporate body and. declare the administering authority to have the functions, powers and obligations of the fund. Benefits I turn now to the benefits which will be payable under this legislation. These benefits will be aligned with those currently payable to injured public sector workers covered by I the CERe Act. Like the CERC Act, the benefits will be indexed annually in line with consumer price index movements. Incapacity At the heart of the new scheme is the change from a system of fixed long term benefits adjusted by regulation to one of weekly benefits calculated on the basis of the individa ual employee's normal weekly earnings. Employees who are totally incapacitated for work will receive weekly benefits equal to normal weekly earnings for the first 45 weeks of that incapacity. Partially incapacitated employees will receive benefits to. bring t-eir wages up to normal weekly earnmgs dunng that period. After 45 weeks of incapacity the basic rate of benefits applicable reduces to 75 per cent of normal weekly earnings. The rate of benefits payable to partially incapacitated employees who are able to work will be on a graduated scale. For these persons the combined total of compensation plus earnings will be between 75 percent and 100 per cent of normal weekly earnings, depending on the number of hours that the employee actually works. Weekly payments will not normally be paid beyond the age of 65. Permanent Impairment In addition to the weekly benefits for incapacity which I have just outlined, the Bill provides for the payment of lump sums for permahent impairment. Under the current Seamen's Compensation Act, lump sum payments are made on th- basis of a: table ?f maims. The range of maIms compensated IS exclusive and does not recognise the broad range of work-related injuries and diseases. This outdated and crude approach will be replaced' with a much more comprehensive and fair method using the modern concepts already adopted in assessing permanent impairments for war veterans and injured Commonwealth employees. Non-economic Loss In conjunction with an assessment of pennanent impainnent there will be an assessment of related factors' defined as noneconomic loss. These factors include pain 'and suffering, loss of quality of life and shortened life expectancy. Attendant Care and Household Services The Bill makes provision for injured employees to receive financial assistance for the cost of any necessary household services and for necessary attendant care' services. Death l;Jenefits In the case of an employee who has died as result of a work-related injury or disease, there will be a lump sum benefit, which will be apportioned between the dependants. Additionally, dependent children will receive weekly benefits. Rehabilitation I now turn to the most important feature of the new scheme, rehabilitation. Early and effective rehabilitation cuts the human and monetary costs of serious industrial injury by helping to repair the physical damage and, equally importantly, by overcoming the 'compensation. mentality' that can so easily overwhelm mjured employees when left to their own devices. Comcare attributes a major part of its success in reducing its compensation costs to the similar rehabilitation arrangements applicthe able to Commonwealth employees under the CERC Act. Since the CERC Act came into operation in late 1988, the number of incapacity cases lasting more than four weeks has halved. The Bill requires employers to arrange a rehabilitation assessment of any injured employee whose incapacity lasts, or is expected to last, 28 days. If that assessment concludes that a rehabilitation program is appropriate, the employer will be required to engage an approved program provider to develop and conduct an appropriate rehabilitation program. To encourage a positive attitude towards program, the injured employee will be required to be fully consulted in the development of the program arrangements. However, if the employee refuses to undertake the program, there is provision for compensation benefits to be suspended. The Bill requires the employer to take all reasonable steps to provide suitable employment for an employee who has undertaken a rehabilitation program, or to assist the employee in finding alternative employment. The employer will also be required to provide any necessary aids and appliances, or home, vehicle or workplace modifications to enable an injured employee to have as nonnal a life as possible. Reconsideration and Review Process The Bill establishes a two-stage process reviewing cases in which an employer's detennination of a claim is disputed by the employee or dependant. The first stage requires the employer to reconsider its initial detennination on request by the claimant. If the claimant is not satisfied with a reconsidered detennination, the claimant may seek a review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The Bill sets down special procedures for the first stage reconsideration process, requiring the employer to obtain the assistance of either a Comcare officer or an industry panel. The Comcare officer or industry panel, as the case may be, will provide the employer with an independent assessment of the merits of claim. The claimant will also receive a copy of this assessment. The assessment will not be binding on either party but the process is expected to result in most cases being resolved quickly without recourse to the AAT. The costs of the services of Comcare, or the alternative industry panel, will be met by the relevant employer. Common Law Actions I now tum to common law actions for negligence. Common law negligence actions are counter-productive to the fundamental objective of helping injured employees rebuild their lives and return to employment as the quickly as possible. Accordingly, the new legislation, like the CERC Act, will restrict common law actions against an employer or fellow employee to non-economic losses and cap the amount of damages that a court may award. Furthermore, the employee will be required to make an irrevocable election that he or she intends to pursue a common law action before any lump sum compensation benefit for permanent impairment and non-economic loss has been paid. No lump sum compensation is payable once an election to pursue common law has been made. There will be no restriction on employees pursuing common law actions against third parties. Similarly, there will be no restrictions on dependants pursuing common law actions for against the employer or fellow employee of a deceased employee, or against third parties. However, in the event of an employee or dependant receiving damages, the employee or dependant will be required to pay the employer either the amount of compensation received or the amount of damages, whichever is less. Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Authority The Bill establishes the Seafarers Rehabiliprogram tation and Compensation Authority. This Authority will consist of six persons' to be appointed by the Minister-an independent chairperson, a deputy chairperson and four part time members representing the interests of industry parties. This structure will allow employees and employers to participate directly in the administration of the compensation and rehabilitation system. The primary functions of the Authority will be: · To monitor the operation of the Act; · To promote high operational standards of claims management and effective rehabilitation procedures by employers; · To co-operate with other bodies or persons with the aim of reducing the inCidence of work-related injuries; · To publish material relating to these functions; and · To advise the Minister about anything relating to the Authority's functions and powers and other matters relating to the compensation and rehabilitation of employees. The Authority ,will be serviced by the Department of Transport and Communicaand tions. There is provision in the Bill for the Authority to take over the fund's responsibilito ties as an employer if the Minister either not approve an industry fund, or withdraws approval of the industry fund. In such an event, all costs of compensation and rehabiliNavigation tation incurred by the. Authority and its administrative overheads' will be recoverable from industry employers. Separate Bills are ' being introduced to enable a levy to be applied to employers, on the basis of the number of seafarer berths on theirships. In conclusion, this Bill will create a progressive compensation and rehabilitation journed. system, comparable with other modern workers compensation arrangements in Australia. The measures will ensure injured seafarers are quickly and effectively rehabilitated. This, in turn, will cut the time lost through work related injuries and the associated compensation costs and human suffering. a first time. This reform represents another step in the Government's comprehensive shipping reform which has resulted in significantly increased Australian shipping competitiveness including a 50 per cent reduction in crew sizes on modern, technologically advanced ships.

This Bill provides the transitional arrangements from the current Seamen's Compensation Act 1911 to the proposed Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1992. In essence, this Bill will facilitate a smooth equitable transition of benefit entitlements and other arrangements under the current Act those which will be provided under the does new legislation. The Bill also repeals the Seamen's Compensation Act 1911 and makes a number of consequential amendments to the Act 1912, the Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and CompenSation Act 1988 and the Social Security Act 1991.

247,Mr SNOWDON,SEAFARERS REHABILITATION AND,"Northern TerritoryParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training) (5.00 p.m.);-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to provide for a levy as a contingency arrangement to enable the Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Authority to operate the 'safety net' fund provided under the Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Bill 1992. There is provision in the Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Bill for the Minister to approve a corporate body established by maritime industry employers to operate the fund. If this occurs-and it is expected to occur-the corporate body will be funded directly by industry employers and the levy provided for by this Bill will not need to be triggered. In the unlikely event that the corporate body fails to materialise, or if it fails to meet criteria prescribed in the Seafarers Rehabilitathe tion and Compensation Bill, this Bill will enable the Commonwealth to collect moneys for the Authority to operate the fund. If the levy arrangements are triggered, the levy will be payable by all employers who employ or engage seafarers on prescribed ships. The basis for the levy is the number of seafarer berths on a prescribed ship. The Governor-Gen-ral will be able to make regulations prescribing the amount of levy payable for each seafarer berth. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Rocher) adjourned.

This Bill sets out the necessary procedures for the collection of the proposed seafarers rehabilitation and compensation levy. It provides penalties for the non-payment of levy, and allows for the detainment of a prescribed ship if necessary. The levy will be payable quarterly, following the lodgement of a return by the employer. The Bill prescribes penalties where employers fail to lodge returns, or where the returns are inadequate or false and misleading. The Secretary to the Department will have the power to authorise certain persons to enter premises with the permission of the owner, or with a warrant issued by a magistrate, to search for documentation or other evidence relating to the number of berths on a prescribed ship. The Governor General will have the the power to make regulations in respect of manner of payment of the levy, and other procedural matters ..

249,Mrs KELLY,COMPENSATION LEVY,"Canberra-Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories) (5.05 p.m.)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill gives effect to Australia's obligations arising from the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty, known as the Madrid Protocol. The Madrid Protocol designates Antarctica as a natural reserve devoted to peace and science, and puts in place a legally binding and comprehensive regime for protection of its environment. The Government has shown leadership in Antarctic environmental matte,rs and· already has made significant progress in implementing the requirements of the protocoL-This Bill will enable Australia to move forward to ratification of the protocol. The Madrid Protocol stands amongst the world's most significant environmental agreements. It is unique in setting out to ensure protection of the environment of an entire continent. It is an outstanding demonstration of countries working together on environmental protection. Australia thus takes great pride in its role in leading its treaty partners to adoption of the protocol in October 1991. Elsewhere in the world in recent years we have seen attention given to the long standing problems of pollution, insensitive development, and uncontrolled exploitation of resources. We have learned from our mistakes. In Antarctica we had a continent seemingly immune from the environmental problems, but our view of Antarctica changed as we came to understand what is happening in the atmosphere. It was Antarctica that revealed the depletion of ozone. Antarctica is a continent of enormous scientific potential; a continent that may provide invaluable information about the health of the environment in the rest of the world. The Government recognised that Antarctica can only do this if we fully protect it. Antarctica, once far removed from the attention of most of the world, came to prominence in the 1980s. The decade saw dramatic developments in Antarctic environmental policy, reflecting the increased attention given to the environment worldwide. Antarctica's unique environment provides the setting for a unique approach to international relations. For over 30 years the Antarctic Treaty has set aside the differences between countries and provided the framework for unrivalled cooperation between the 40 countries that are party to it. As an original tory to the treaty, Australia is fully committed to supporting the Antarctic Treaty and encouraging the consensus approach to decisions about Antarctica's future. The Government therefore believes that by strong support for, and effective contribution to, the treaty system we can achieve the best possible measures to protect the Antarctic. Without doubt, the most significant recent development in the Antarctic Treaty system was the adoption in 1991 of the Madrid Protocol. Adoption of the protocol represented a dramatic change in attitude by the treaty countries to what are acceptable activities in the Antarctica. Following six years of negotiation of a regime that would allow the possibility of mining in Antarctica, the treaty parties have agreed to a regime that prohibits mining. The Government's leadership on this issue was instrumental in achieving what is now recognised as one of the world's most outstanding examples of international cooperation in protection of the environment. Negotiation of the protocol followed the Government's decision in May 1989 that Australia would not sign the Antarctic minerals convention. The Government had concluded that mining could not be undertaken consistent with protection of the environment. Instead, the Government proposed that treaty parties negotiate a regime which would prohibit mining and provide for comprehensive protection of the Antarctic environment. When the Government announced its decision it was warmly welcomed by the public. However, overseas, Australia's proposals were not received enthusiastically by many of our treaty partners. The then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, acknowledged in his announcement that we had set ourselves an ambitious task. However, concerted efforts by the Government culminated in the adoption of the protocol after some two years. The Government takes this opportunity to place on record its appreciation for the skilful negotiation efforts of officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Antarctic Division of the Department of Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories. During these negotiations Australia was signasupported initially by France. Italy and Belgium also came to support our proposals and following a meeting of treaty parties in November 1990, further support for the Australian position emerged. In Madrid, less than a year later, the treaty parties adopted protocol signalling achievement of the objecThese tive of putting in place comprehensive legally binding measures to protect the Antarctic environment. The prohibition on mining Given the context in which the protocol was negotiated, its. most significant feature is article 7, which prohibits activities relating mineral resources other than scientific research. This article represents the commitensure mertt of the treaty parties to set aside a whole continent from what was potentially one of the most environmentally destructive activities. The Government had, of course, recognised the need to provide legal means to prevent such activities in 1990, prior to conclusion of the protocol, and we had passed legislation prohibiting mining in the Ausactivities tralian Antarctic Territory and prohibiting Australian involvement in mining anywhere in the Antarctic. This legislation, the Antarctic Mining Prohibition Act 1991, will now be incorporated in the Antarctic Treaty (Environensure ment Protection) Act 1980 for the sake of completeness. The Government is, of course, delighted that the protocol has put in place the mining prohibition that we sought. However, .the protocol is much more than a ban on mining, and there are many other significant environthat mental protection provisions within the protocol and its annexes. These provisions will ensure that activities undertaken in Antarctica are done in the most environpacts mentally responsible way. Annexes to the Madrid Protocol Key features of the protocol are that it designates Antarctica as a natural reserve devoted to peace and science; it establishes environmental principles for the conduct of all activities in Antarctica; and subjects all activities to prior assessment of their environmental impacts. Accordingly, the. protocol provides for a whole continent to be recognised as a place worthy of protection, and a place where all activities should be approached with consistent environmental standards. At the time of adoption of the protocol, 4 the . October 1991, four annexes had been agreed. provide detailed measures relating to and environmental impact assessment; conservation of Antarctic fauna and flora; waste disposal and waste management; and prevention of marine pollution. Subsequently, the treaty parties adopted a fifth annex relating to area protection and management. Most of these provisions will be covered by this Bill, to which amends the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Act in a number of ways to that our protocol obligations are met. The environmental impact assessment process A fundamental part of the protocol's mechanisms to ensure that activities take account of environmental values is Annex I. The protocol requires prior assessment of all proposed to be' conc;Iucted in the Antarctic Treaty area to assess likely impacts on the Antarctic environment, and dependent and associated ecosystems. Aimex I specifies the procedures that are to ,be followed to that proposed activities are appropriately assessed. The intention of the environmental impact assessment process is not to prevent activities from proceeding but rather to ensure that they are undertaken in a way that takes into account, and minimises as far as practicable, any environmental impacts. The Bill puts in place an assessment scheme relies on three levels of impact assessment according to the extent of likely impacts, and provides for conditions to be imposed on activities so that the actual imcan be assessed and verified. The Bill provides for regulations to be made relating to detailed aspects of the procedures. Conservation of Antarctic fauna 'and flora Over the years the Antarctic Treaty parties have adopted a number .of measures in relation to the protection of fauna and flora. These measures have been put into place in the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Act. Annex II of the protocol replaces many of the existing measures, strengthening them where necessary. Consequently, as the. existing measures have been implemented into Australian law, this Bill proposes to amend that Act by incorporating the additional requirements of the protocol relating to the protection of fauna and flora. Annex II includes a provision prohibiting the introduction of non-indigenous species into the Antarctic. One aspect of t-e requirements is the obligation to remove huskies from Antarctica by 1 April 1994. Within Australia the Government's acceptance of this provision has been difficult. Australia is one of only three Treaty countries that still uses dog teams in Antarctica and during negotiation of the protocol Australia argued strongly for retention of the dogs. However, our position became untenable in view of Australia's strong push for comprehensive environment protection measures. Only one of Australia's Antarctic stations still maintains dogs. Even though the dogs at Mawson are well manag-d there remains the possibility of dogs breaking free and attacking wildlife, or wildlife straying into the dog lines. Australia is arranging to remove the dogs accordance with its obligations as a signatory to the protocol and consistent with the decision of the treaty parties to implement the protocol as far as possible pending its entry into force. Waste disposal and management Annex III of the protocol, rehlting to waste disposal and waste management, will largely be implemented by regulations. However, the more serious matters of introducing nonsterile soil, polychlorinated biphenyls and polystyrene beads and chips have been dealt with in this Bill. These have all been identified as posing particular dangers to the environment and their introduction into Antarctica will be prohibited. As now required by the protocol, Australia continues with its program of cleaning up past waste sites at its stations and much has been achieved to date. Prevention of marine pollution Annex IV of the protocol, relating to the prevention of marine pollution, was implemented earlier this year by way of amendment to the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983, which falls within the responsibilities of my colleague the Minister for Transport and Communications. Improved management of protected areas Annex V of the Madrid Protocol provides significant improvements to the Antarctic protected areas system. In particular, it rationalises the earlier proliferation of categories of protected areas and allows all sites with values worthy of protection to be subject to an agreed management plan. All existing protected' areas will be preserved in the new scheme, with no diminution of the level of protection given to them. The previous protected area system had been provided for in the Antarctic Treaty. (Environment Protection) Act. This Bill modifies those provisions to put in place the requirements of the annex, while allowing for retention of the old system until Annex V becomes effective. Minor and technical amendments The opportunity is also being taken to make some minor and some technical amendments to the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protecin tion) Act to clarify or update certain provisions. The proposed amendments will clarify some of the permit provisions; update penalties; make a consequential amendment to provide for the setting up of monitoring sites under the Antarctic Marine Living Resources Conservation Act 1981; and reflect an amendment to the annex to the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals. As well, a minor amendment to the Antarctic Marine Living Resources Conservation Act is proposed which will allow other laws in relation to arrest to apply to this Act. Entry into force The Bill has a number of provisions relating to commencement to reflect the circumstances that surround the ultimate entry into force of the protocol and its various components, and the need to retain some provisions of the Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Act pending the varying dates of entry into force of these components. The protocol will enter into force when all the parties required have taken the steps necessary to ensure that its provisions can be made binding on its citizens. This Bill, together with the regulations to be made under it, will enable Australia to ratify the protocol. At this stage, only one signatory to the protocol, Spain, has ratified. While all the necessary parties have signed the protocol there is still some way to go until it will fonnally enter into force. Our ratification will finnly demonstrate our commitment to the Antarctic Treaty system, and to protecting the Antarctic environment. It will encourage other countries to similarly proceed to ratification so that the protocol can enter into force promptly. Conclusion As I said earlier, the Government is proud of its record of providing leadership in protecting the Antarctic environment. That leadership has been recognised in our successful promotion among treaty partners of the initiative for comprehensive protection of the Antarctic environment; in our past and continuing efforts in improving environmental management of our Antarctic activities; and ,in the progress we are making in implementing the requirements of the protocol. The Government's stand on protection of the Antarctic environment has been strongly supported by the Australian community. The negotiation and adoption of the protocol saw unprecedented cooperation between the Government and the environmental movement. I take this opportunity to record the Government's appreciation of the support that it has received from the environmental organisations who were instrumental in achieving support overseas for Australia's stand. The Government looks forward to continued cooperation. In conclusion; Mr Deputy' Speaker, I believe this legislation will be widely welcomed. I urge members of the Opposition to be equally finn in their support of it. I present the explanatory memorandum which contains more detailed explanations of the provisions of the Bill. Before I finish, I would like to personally thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and other members of this House who have shown great interest in Antarctica over the years. Many members of the House, like yourself, have visited Antarctica. I know that your support and enthusiasm have been instrumental in achieving this monumental breakthrough.

250,Mr CREAN,WHEAT MARKETING AMENDMENT,"Hotham'-Minister for Primary Industries and Energy) (5.19 p.m.)I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to implement a package of measures to enhance the future of the Australian wheat industry. The package provides a framework for the development of a vertically integrated industry to the end of the century. It has the endorsement of the peak wheat grower body, the Grains Council of Australia. The Grains Council agreement on these measures exemplifies the Government's approach to rural industry policy. We have strong views on where our rural industries should be heading and we have a clear vision for their future. But We do not impose changes on those industries. We consult closely with them on proposed improvements and work together to attain our shared vision for their future. This is the approach that I have recently adopted with the dairy, wool and sugar industries and which I have now applied to the wheat and grains industries. Such an approach gives greater confidence to industry participants in planning their futures. Wheat is Australia's most valuable crop with an estimated gross value of production in 1992-93 of $2.2 billion. Wheat is also one of Australia's most important exports and this year will be our third largest rural export earner after wool and meat. This package has regard to the particular circumstances of the industry and. the environment in which it currently operates. It represents a further step in the evolution of wheat marketing arrangements. For many years the Australian Wheat Board held a monopoly over the sales of all Australian wheat on domestic and export markets. Three years ago this Government deregulated the domestic . wheat market and thereby introduced competition to the Wheat Board within Australia. Since then, on export markets, the Wheat Board has moved further away ftom being a supplier of bulk homogenous wheat .and instead has also pursued niche markets for specific qualities of wheat based on customers' needs. These changes helped to inspire the Grains Council to hold the Grains 2000 Conference in September 1991. I gave the concluding address to that conference where I set out my views on the future directions for the industry. I stressed the long term decline in the terms of trade for Australian agricultural producers and pointed out that, on the other hand, growth in the trade of value added food products was increasing. Moreover, Australia was well situated to take advantage of the growth in demand for these products in the populous and increasingly wealthy countries of Asia. I urged the industry to raise its sights and direct more of its resources to take advantage of the growth in demand for value added food products. I am pleased to say that at that conference industry leaders shared many of my views on the future vision for the indQstry. Grains Council leaders Andrew Inglis and Donald MCGauchie and Wheat Board Chairman Clinton Condon also spoke of the need for the industry .to move away from being solely a supplier of bulk raw material. . Two other important issues raised at the conference were the export powers of the Wheat Board and the' future capital base for the industry. Both of these issues, as well as value adding, are addressed in the package implemented by this Bill. Following the Grains 2000 Conference, an extensive process of consultation was set up by the Grains Council with the involvement of the Wheat Board and my Department. Expert consultants were engaged to advise on the financial and structural aspects of future grains 'marketing. This process led to the publication in April this year of what became known as the Newco proposal. In the months following, the Grains Council organised an extensive series of grower meetings in all mainland States to debate the Newco proposal. I welcomed these meetings as a means of ensuring that growers were fully consulted on the issues. I had earlier expressed reservations about some aspects of the proposal. Moreover, after the consultative process was complete, it was clear that the Newco proposal in its original form did not have the support of the majority of growers; nor, however, did the alternative proposals which had been put forward over the last year or so, such as those from the various State grower bodies and from the Australian Grain Exporters Association. However there was general support for certain elements of these proposals and this support has been embodied in the package of measures before the House. These elements are: a continued build-up in the industry's capital base through the wheat industry fund levy; a more active role for the Wheat Board in grains based value adding activities; and a continuation of the Wheat Board's export monopoly in light of the current uncertain outcome in the GATT round and the highly corrupted state of the world wheat market. I believe the continued build-up of a capital base is essential to ensure the industry's future. Such a view is shared by the industry. Currently, the Wheat Board borrows heavily during the season to make advance payments to growers. Those borrowings are guaranteed by the Government under an arrangement which was scheduled to end on 30 June 1994. The financial consultants to the Grains Council and to the Wheat Board have estimated that the wheat industry fund would need to build to over $400m to provide sufficient capital for the Wheat Board to make advance payments to growers at around current levels without a government guarantee. The Government and the Grains Council have therefore agreed that the fund will continue for five years past 1994, until June 1999. By that time, it is estimated that the fund will have reached a level sufficient for the Wheat Board to make advance payments without the government guarantee. During this build-up period, the qovernment has agreed to continue its guarantee on borrowings by the Wheat Board until June 1999 at a level of 85 per cent of the aggregate estimated net pool return. This extension of the guarantee will provide a welcome and necessary breathing space for the wheat growers during the build-up period and will remove any uncertainty about the future of the Wheat Board's borrowing arrangements. At the end of the build-up period, the Government's firm intention is that the government guarantee will cease as it will no longer be necessary for the Wheat Board's operations. It is also the Government's view that the Wheat Board will be able to be corporatised at the end of the build-up period. Turning now to value adding activities, this Bill grants the Wheat Board the power to become directly involved in grains based value adding activities, subject to al limitations. This will enable a broadening of the economic base of the grains industry and the strengthening of linkages between growers and processors. Until now, the Wheat Board's involvement in value adding has been limited to investment only. The Bill provides this value adding power to the Wheat Board for export and interstate trade. Complementary State legislation will be necessary to cover intrastate trade, as is the case with the Wheat Board's powers under the current legislation. Furthermore, the Grains Council and I have agreed that the Wheat Board will establish a subsidiary specifically for grains based value adding activities. The intention of the industry and the Government is that these activities will mainly involve joint venture arrangements. The subsidiary will be able to draw on wheat industry fund equity. The exact form of the Wheat Board subsidiary has not yet been finalised. I intend to consult further with government and with industry on this. However, I intend that the members of the board of the subsidiary will be selected by the Australian Wheat Board in consultation with me as Minister and with the Grains Council. The board of the subsidiary will reflect an appropriate mix of skills and will include representatives of both the growing and processing sectors. The wheat industry fund will also continue to be used for the Wheat Board's trading division operations. My expectation is that the Fund will be used until 1999 as follows: around 80 per cent of future contributions for building up the capital base; around 20 per cent of future contributions together with around $30m of current equity for value adding activities by the Wheat Board's subsidiary company; and around $100m of current equity for the Wheat Board's trading division operations. The investment and use of the fund both by the Wheat Board and its subsidiary will be subject to the same safeguards for growers which currently operate, that is, in accordance with a business plan approved annually by the Grains Council. Any profit made by the subsidiary from the use of fund monies will constitutionbe returned to the fund. The Government guarantee of wheat industry fund borrowings will cease on 30 June 1994, as provided for in the current legislation. On the question of the Wheat Board's export monopoly, it is clear the majority of growers favour the continuation of the Wheat Board's single desk export operations. I am aware that there are calls from some growers, and certainly from other commercial interests such as the Australian Grain Exporters Association, to introduce at least a degree of deregulation in Australian export wheat sales. However, the Government has decided that now is not the appropriate time to change the Wheat Board's export powers. All honourable members will be aware of the corrupt state of the world wheat market where the subsidy war between the United States and the European Community has been waged for many years now. The intensity of the war has recently increased with President Bush's global export enhancement program and the announcement attaching to it. The Government will continue to work towards a successful outcome in the GATT Uruguay Round. However, the outcome of the round is still uncertain, an important reason why the Government believes no change should be made at this time to the single export status of the Wheat Board. The Government will review these export powers after the current GATT round outcome is clearer and as any successful reforms arising from the round become effective. The package of measures I have outlined today will provide substantial benefits Australian wheat industry. The package will enable the build-up of a capital base, bolstered by a continuation of the Government borrowing guarantee at 85 per cent until 1999. Growers can face the long term future secure in the knowledge that their strong national marketing structure will continue. The establishment of a value adding subsidiary of the Wheat Board will provide a new focus for this important aspect of the vision for the future shared by the Government and the Grains Council. The proposals put forward in the Bill will not directly affect Government expenditure although the Government's contingent liability in respect of the Wheat Board's underwritten borrowings will be increased. I commend the Bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Rocher) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL (No.4) 1992 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Duncan, and read a first time. Second Reading",88
251,Mr DUNCAN,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill (No.4) 1992 will amend several Acts within the Attorney-General's portfolio and make minor amendments to a related Act. The Bill contains amendments of a minor policy nature and makes minor technical amendments to existing legislation. None of the amendments concern major policy proposals or sensitive policy issues. They are explained desk in the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill. The proposed amendments will not have any significant financial impact. However, the amendments to the Privacy Act 1988 will have limited impact on Government expenditure. Any additional expenditure incurred by to the the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission will be absorbed within the Commission's present budget. There will be minimum direct cost impact on consumer credit reporting agencies and credit providers as the industry is already operating under the Privacy Act, and the amendments will not significantly require industry to change the way it operates. The amendments to the Bankruptcy Act 1966 will make consequential changes arising from the Bankruptcy Amendment Act 1991 which were inadvertently not made by that amending Act. Trustees' notices to creditors of the bankrupt tinder subsection 19(1B) of the Act stating the trustee's opinion as to whether the bankrupt is eligible to apply for early discharge from bankruptcy will also include the Official Receiver as a recipient. The Bankruptcy Amendment Act 1991 enables the Inspector-General in Bankruptcy to review decisions of trustees, including trustees' decisions about the bankrupt's application for early discharge. The Bill will also repeal various spent provisions. The Bill will make amendments to subsection 22(8) of the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981 which provides that complaints to the Ombudsman under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 shall be dealt with under the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981 rather than the Ombudsman Act 1976. Rearrangement of the provisions for complaints to the Ombudsman in the Freedom of Information Act and deletion of the reference to subsection 6(3) of the Ombudsman Act 1976 in the relevant provisions of the Freedom of Information Act necessitate consequential amendments to subsection 22(8) of the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act. The amendments to the Family Law Act 1975 and the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 will require registrars and deputy registhe trars of the Family Court of Australia and the Federal Court of Australia to give a promissory oath or affirmation of office before performing delegated judicial or quasi-judicial functions. The Bill will amend the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 to make it clear that a person represented in a representative proceeding under part IV of that Act OT in a proceeding of a representative character authorised by another Act cannot be ordered to pay costs except in special circumstances. This amendment reaffirms a long line of judicial authority which was said to be wrong in a recent judgment of the Supreme Court of Victoria in respect of statutory provisions in that State dealing with the power of that court to award costs. The amendment will remove any doubts that may have been created by that decision for proceedings of this kind. The Bill also contains amendments to the Family Law Act 1975, Judges (Long Leave Payments) Act 1979 and the Judges' Pensions Act 1968 to state, so as to put the matters beyond doubt, the method of resigning a judicial commission and the conditions affecting the reappointment of the present judges of the Family Court to the maximum age of 70 now permitted by the Family Law Act. The amendments will state the conditions affecting seniority, long leave payment and pension entitlements. . The Bill will make miscellaneous amendments to the Freedom of Information Act 1982. The National Companies and Securities Commission was abolished on 31 July 1992 and the Act will be amended to continue after the abolition an exemption from applications under the Act for documents of the Commission that were exempt under section 47 of the Act prior to that abolition. Section 56 of the Act gives the Administrative Appeals Tribunal the power to hear appeals where an agency has failed to make a decision within the required time limits and the agency is deemed to have made a decision refusing to grant access to a document or refusing to amend or annotate a record of personal information as appropriate. Where an agency makes a decision, between the time appeal is made to the Tribunal and the time that the Tribunal has finally dealt with the matter, subsection 56(5) gives the Tribunal the power to extend the proceedings by reviewing the decision that has actually been made if the applicant for review wants it to do so and if the agency has not granted the applicant's request in full and in the manner sought. The Bill will allow this to be done at the request of the applicant for review or on the Tribunal's own motion. Section 58 of the FOI Act sets out the power of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to review decisions under the Act and gives it power to determine the question whether there exist reasonable grounds for the claim on which a certificate issued under subsections 33(4) and 33A(4) is based. Section 33 was amended in 1991 to delete references to the public interest. Section 33A was also amended so that a certificate issued under subsection (2) or (4) conclusively establishes both that disclosure would affect relations with a State or Territory and that disclosure would not on balance be in the public interest. The Bill contains a consequential amendment to section 58 so that the grounds for appeal will be consistent with the grounds for exemption. Section 58C of the Act requires certain proceedings of the Tribunal to be held in private including proceedings where certificates have been given under subsections 33(4) and 33A(4). As a consequence of the amendments to sections 33 and 33A, the Act requires amendment to re-establish consistency between section 58C and sections 33 and 33A. The amendments to the Privacy Act 1988 in the schedule to the Bill will revise the provisions already made in the Act for the mortgage securitisation industry and expand it to include asset backed securitisation. The amendments will also deal with a number of anomalies in the credit reporting provisions of the Privacy Act that have been brought to the Government's attention by industry and the Privacy Commissioner in the course of implementing those provisions. The proposed amendments have the support of the Privacy Commissioner and have been prepared after consultations with interested parties. Securitisation is a recent development in credit industry. While provision for it was made in the Privacy Act when it was amended by the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Act 1991, the complexity of the industry has required clarification and revision of the current provisions, which as a matter of strict law do not always easily accommodate the particular practices involved in asset and mortgage securitisation. Securitisation, which is also known as the secondary mortgage market, refers to a method of financing often used in housing finance, but is also used in relation to other assets. A mortgage financed ostensibly by a credit union or building society, usually called an originator, will under a mortgage securitisation arrangement be ultimately financed by using funds invested by investors in a trust. The form of such arrangements varies significantly, but usually there is a formal legal trustee of $e trust fund, although the fund is often managed on a day to day basis by a trust manager. The trust manager deals with credit enhancers who actually take the financial risk by underwriting the securitisation scheme. The amendments will define a securitisation arrangement and will deem bodies involved in a securitisation arrangement to be credit providers. They will be placed under the· same obligations as other credit providers under the Act while!they are performing a task relevant to the securitisation scheme. They will, however, be different from other credit providers in that they will be able to obtain credit information from other members of the scheme without the consent of the borrower. This variation of the Act's normal policy on disclosure of information by credit providers is necessary as a result of the special nature of mortgage securitisation schemes. A consequence of deeming bodies involved in mortgage securitisation arrangements to be credit providers is that credit enhancers will be able to obtain access to credit reports from credit reporting agencies in their own right. Fundamentally, the amendments do not represent a major change from the policy of the existing provisions. However, they will clarify the circumstances under which bodies the involved in securitisation arrangements can have access to consumer credit information. The Government has been conscious for some time of the difficult situation faced by guarantors or would be guarantors in finding out information about the persons they are guaranteeing. Equally, credit providers lack certainty in deciding what information they are required or permitted by law to disclose to would be guarantors, given that such disclosures are exceptions to their duty of confidentiality to their clients and the information that can be disclosed can vary with the circumstances of the transaction. I am therefore proposing an amendment to the Privacy Act to provide that credit providers may disclose credit information regulated by the Privacy Act-that is, relating to a borrower's consumer credit worthiness-to guarantors or would be guarantors where the borrower has consented to the disclosure. In framing this amendment the Government 2164has been conscious that further consideration is being given to the disclosure of information to guarantors in relation to the implementation of the Martin committee report on banking. Thus, for guarantees entered into after the commencement of the provisions, the Bill does not seek to address what information should be disclosed or when information should be disclosed to guarantors. However, for guarantees in existence at the time of the commencement of these provisions' the amendments would permit disclosure of information to a guarantor where that information is relevant to the guarantor's liability or possible liability under the guarantee and the borrower has been notified that such disclosures to the guarantor may take place in the future. The Bill will also amend the Privacy Act 1988 to permit credit providers who have mortgages over the same property to share credit information where the borrower is more than 60 days in default. The Government has received complaints from consumers who have authority to use a partner's account but are not permitted under the Privacy Act to receive information about that account assist them in making payments and otherwise managing the account. Therefore, to meet these concerns the Bill will permit the disclossuperannuation ure of basic information concerning account, such as the account balance, the amount of av'ailable credit on the account, minimum payment due and some information about transactions, to the person l\uthorised operate the a.ccount. However, in order to protect the privacy of the account owner, information about the owner's transactions will not be disclosed to .that person. Thus, children who are pennitted by their parents use their parent's credit card will not have access to infotmation concerning the parent's credit transactions. The balance of the amendments corrects anomalies or adjusts the operation of the as a result of the experience gained since credit reporting provisions became fully operational in February this year.

Bill presented by' Mr Duncan, and read first time. ' . Second Reading",91
252,Mr DUNCAN,SUPERANNUATION SCHEMES," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time: The Commonwealth Superannuation Schemes Amendment Bill 1992 will amend a number of Acts under which superannuation benefits are payable to Commonwealth employees and office holders and their spouses and children. The purpose of the amendments is to remove discrimination on the basis of marital status from certain provisions of the superannuation schemes. The removal of discrimination in superannuation on the grounds of sex and marital status has been identified in the National Agenda for Women as a priority area to for Government action. Action has already been taken to review and limit the exemption in the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 for and to increase superannuation that coverage for women. The Commonwealth has for many years the followed a policy of providing adequate superannuation coverage to its office holders to and employees. In more recent times, as the Government has taken steps to extend superannuation coverage in the broader community, we ,have been committed to that coverage being provided in a fair and non-discrito minatory manner. The 1991 amendm,ents to the Sex Discrimination Act will ob-ige private sector employers to limit sex and marital status discrimination in superannuation only to . those limited superannuation practices Act which remain exempt from the Sex Discrimithe nation Act. These amendments, consistent with the Government's commitment to an the equitable provision of access to superannuation benefits, will ensure that Commonwealth . superannuation is also in conformity with the adSex Discrimination Act. , The legislation being amended is the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act 1973, the Governor General Act 1974; the Judges', Pensions Act 1968, the Parliamentary and Judicial Retiring Allowances Act 1973, the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuaa tion Act 1948, the Superannuation Act 1922 and the Superannuation Act 1976. These amendments will ensure that the Commonwealth's own legislative superannuation schemes are consistent with amendments which were made last year to the Sex Discrimination Act. Those amendments narrowed the previous exemptiori from the Sex Discrimination Act for superannuation so that most fonns of discrimination on the basis of sex or marital status in superannuation will be unlawful, subject to a number' of limited exemptions relating to particular superannuation practices. Those amendments come into effect two years from the date on which that legislation received royal assent-that is, 25 June 1993in order to permit the necessary changes to be made to superannuation schemes. This legislation amending the Commonwealth's own legislatively based superannuation schemes will come into effect on the same date as those amendments-25 June 1993. It will apply to benefits payable as a result of the death of a person on or after t\lat date, while the existing, provisions of each of the legislative schemes will continue to apply to benefits which became payable as the result of the death of a person before that date. Honourable members will note that the Superannuation Act 1990, which establishes the public sector' superannuation scheme, is not being amended by this Bill. The detail of the public sector superannuation scheme is contained in a trust deed and rules made under the Superannuation Act 1990. It is intended that the trust deed and rules will be amended along the lines of the amendments made by this Bill to remove discrimination in the public sector superannuation scheme. Similarly, the Military Superannuation and Benefits Act 1991 is not being amended by this Bill. However, it is intended that the trust deed and rules made under that Act will also be amended to remove marital status discrimination. It is anticipated that the amendments to both of those trusts deeds and rules will be made prior to 25 June 1993, the date of effect of the changes to the Sex Discrimination Act. The legislative superannuation provisions being amended by this Bill are those which provide for reversionary benefits to be paid to the surviving spouses, and in some cases children, of deceased superannuation scheme JIlembers or beneficiaries. Some of the schemes at present do not recognise de facto relationships for the purpose of entitlement to reversionary benefits, while others apply qualifying periods to de facto relationships which are not applied to legal marriages. Further, some of the schemes discriminate against ex-nuptial children in the allocation of benefits. The changes will result in some additional costs to Commonwealth superannuation schemes in some situations. These will chiefly be where, in future, de facto spouses of deceased scheme members or pensioners are able to establish the existence of a bona fide domestic relationship where that relationship does not meet the existing eligibility criteria for payment of reversionary benefits. ' However, the Department of Finance has advised that, because most schemes already recognise spouses, including de facto spouses where the relationship has existed for some years or where there is financial dependency, the additional costs would be very small. There is insufficient data on the incidence, rate of formation, duration of, or extent of financial dependency in de facto relationships among members of existing Commonwealth schemes to enable the additional cost or budgetary effect to be estimated with any certainty.' Any additional costs would be offset by social security and taxation clawbacks. The amendments in this Bill will apply a standard and non-discriminatory approach to the assessment of eligibility of spouses for reversionary benefits and will remove the provisions which discriminate against exnuptial children. The key criterion for eligibility of a surviving spouse to reversionary benefits under the amended legislation will be the existence of a permanent and bona fide domestic relationship. The, Bill provides tests for establishing that such a relationship exists: either that the couple were living together as husband and wife for at least three years, or, where the couple were living together as' husband and wife for a lesser period of time, that there is other evidence to establish that the relationship was a permanent and bona fide domestic relationship. The Bill provides a list of the types of evidence which maybe considered, but will not restrict the decision makers to that list alone. The assessment. will be made on the basis of all relevant evidence. Provision will continue to be made for the payment of reversionary benefits to persons who were legally married to but separated from the deceased superannuation scheme member or beneficiary at the time of death but were wholly or substantially dependent on that person. These persons will be deemed to be spouses for the purposes of the legislation although they will not have been in a permanent and bona fide domestic relationship at the time of death. The non-discriminatory definition of 'spouse' will mean that a person could have more than one spouse for the purpose benefits entitlement-for example, a separated House. legally married spouse and a current de facto spouse. Additional amendments will accordjourned. ingly be made to some of the schemes to provide that in such cases benefits are to be allocated among the spouses having regard to their respective needs and, where relevant, the needs of eligible children. In the case of the Superannuation Act 1922, it is already possible to recognise more than one spouse. However, there can be discrimifirst time. nation in the way in which benefits are divided in such circumstances. Accordingly, the Superannuation Act 1922 will also be amended to provide that benefits are to be allocated among spouses having regard to their respective needs. In addition to amendments dealing with the entitlement of I move: spouses, some of the Acts are being amended in the provision for children of deceased superannuation scheme members or benefiDeaths ciaries. The Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act will be amended to remove the necessity for ex-nuptial children of the annuation scheme members to prove dependsociety, ency. A child or ex-nuptial child of a spouse of a member who does not come within the amended definition of child will still be required to prove dependency at the date of death. The Judges' Pensions Act will be amended to provide that a pension will be payable respect of a child of a judge or retired judge, a child who is wholly or substantially dependsituation ent on the judge or retired judge at the of death, and a child who would, but for death, have been dependent on the judge retired judge. The amendment reduces the coverage of the current Act by excluding as possible beneficiaries the children,of or former spouse of a judge or retired 'judge who have no dependent relationship with the judge or retired judge. The additional amendments to the Superanof nuation Act 1976 will improve equity in Torres eligibility for children's benefits and will ensure that the classes of children eligible benefits reflect the recognition of additional marital relationships.

253,Mr TICKNER,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,"HugheS-Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Aboriginal Reconciliation) (5.57 p.m.)That the Bill be now read a second time. The Royal Commission into Aboriginal in Custody found that the most significant factor contributing to the over-representation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in custody is their disadvansupertaged and unequal position in Australian socially, economically and culturally. Running through many of the Royal Commission's recommendations is the proposition that eliminating these disadvantages requires an end to domination· of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people by nonAboriginals and the return to them of control in over their own lives. The social, economic and cultural factors which contribute to this lead to low self:.esteem and reduced time confidence. It is a national tragedy that the Australia's indigenous people remain the or country's most chronically disadvantaged group on every social indicator, including health, housing, employment and, importantly a spouse in this context, education. The poor levels of educational achievement recorded in the cases examined by the Royal Commission are an apt reflection of the level education participation by Aboriginal and Strait Islander people generally. Of the 99 cases investigated by the Commission, 40 for of those who died had not proceeded beyond primary school and only two had completed secondary schooling. There is wide agreeinent in Australia, including across political parties and among church and community groups, that there is a need to raise the level of awareness of nonAboriginal people about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander history, cultures and contemporary issues. For far too long the education system did not offer Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people a place and provided no recognition of the richness of Aboriginal culture and history, and theimportance of contemporary issues as they affect Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. This blinkered approach must continue to change if Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are to find relevance within our education system and if we are to increase non-Aboriginal people's awareness of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander issues. A number of recommendationS made by the Royal, Commission seek to achieve this balance. Specific recommendations proposed that the curricula of schools at all levels should reflect the fact that Australia has an Aboriginal histQry and Aboriginal viewpoints on social, cultural and historical matters, and that Aboriginal viewpoints, interests, perceptions and expectations are reflected in curricula, teaching and' adn:llnistration of schools. The Royal Commission endorsed the joint Commonwealth-State agreement to the 21 goals of the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education PDlicy, AEP. These goals, developed by governments in consultation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, aim to addresS the educational inequalities experienced by Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islan<;iers. Strategies to achieve these goals are currently being implemel).ted under the AEP. In endorsing the AEP, the Royal Commission identified areas where more needed to be done, such as the provision of preschool education, provision of education to prisoners and, importantly, ,expansion of Aboriginal studies and Aboriginal control of curriculum. This Bill represents a continuation of the Commonwealth Government's commitment to addressing the inequality of educational opportunities between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and non-Aboriginal people. The Commonwealth remains committed to overcoming the educational disadvantages faced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, which were highlighted by the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. In 1989 all State and Territory governments and the Commonwealth Government agreed to a joint policy statement underpinning the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy, AEP. The policy statement included a commitment by the Commonwealth to supplement its normal provisions of recurrent and capital funding for education in the States and Territories with a dedicated commitment of funds on a forward triennial basis for' assisting the implementation of the national policy through one consolidated Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program. The policy statement also contains a commitment by State and Territory governments not to diminish funds allocated for Aboriginal education by them because of any additional funds provided by the Commonwealth. Since the introduction of the AEP in 1990, the Commonwealth has provided $214m under the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program-AESIP-for initiatives directed at improving educational outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, in addition to other forms of direct assistance to individuals and groups. I will table later this session a report on the implementation of the policy in 1990 and 1991. This Bill proposes a significant increase to $241m in the level of funding, a 13 per cent increase over the first AEP triennium. I have made it clear to education providers. that the implementation of the Royal Commission's recommendations concerning education are the Commonwealth's first priority over the next triennium. The second Commonwealth priority for the next triennium is the implementation of the national Aboriginal languages and literacy strategy, the first component of which is the Aboriginal language education strategyALES-which will commence in January 1993. ALES will support strategies geared towards the teaching of Aboriginal languages in schools. These strategies include: (a) special 'languages other than English programs' in Aboriginal languages for children attending Aboriginal schools; (b) bilingual and bi-cultural programs; (c) measures for Aboriginal languages curriculum development and materials production; and (d) the provision of Aboriginal bilingual language teaching and para-professional staffing resources. Such activities will, I believe, have a critical place in the maintenance of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures. The second component is the Aboriginal literacy strategy, also to commence in January 1993. It will support special strategies to improve the English literacy of Aboriginal primary and secondary students, particularly students whose first language is not English. Here again I see an opportunity to break down barriers, reduce disadvantage, and create positive self-esteem. Bilingual and bi-cultural education is essential if strong and weakening Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages are to be maintained. From an educational perspective, it is vital that a balance be found between maintenance of Aboriginal languages and the teaching of English literacy. The acquisition of knowledge and skills to allow Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to live without disadvantage in the wider society on the one hand, and the retention of Aboriginal culture on the other will continue to be a challenging issue. I now tum to the third priority of the Commonwealth for the next triennium, the national reconciliation and schooling strategy. The role of Aboriginal studies, both as a discrete area of study and as an integral part of all curriculum-from preschool education through formal schooling to post-schooling and higher education-is vital to provide a proper foundation for future relations between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians and in bridging the gap between home and school for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students. Aboriginal studies will make a significant contribution towards the process of reconciliation. The negative attitudes towards Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people held by many non-Aboriginal people on a large range of issues need to change. These attitudes form the basis of negative myths, generally based on ignorance or misinformation, which are the foundation of racism and prejudice. These myths are major obstacles in the development of harmonious cross-cultural relations and have had.their foundation in the school age education received by most nonAboriginal Australians. In a very real way, generations of non-Aboriginal Australians were educated to be prejudiced. Through the process of educational and societal change these issues can and will be addressed. The process of including Aboriginal studies in the curriculum has created an opportunity for change. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander viewpoints on social, cultural and historical matters are providing much needed . opportunities for non-Aboriginal people to redefine and increase the richness of their ullderstanding of their society. It is also a strategy which will assist in maintaining the rich indigenous cultures of this nation and the' identity of Aboriginal and Torres Strait the Islander people. I believe Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander studies will lay one of the foundations for the development of Australian society in the twenty-first century. It is encouraging to know that there has been some considerable advance made with the development and inclusion of Aboriginal studies in the curriculum of some tertiary institutions and education systems. Last year I announced elements of the reconciliation and schooling strategy-a way of putting together some existing curriculum development work and providing new elements and a new focus for this work. . Work on this initiative so far has included: (a) the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander studies curriculum project, contributing to the national collaborative curriculum exercise, and preparing a publication as a guide to Australian schools; (b) a review and survey of best practice in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander schooling, leading to a video and teaching notes; (c) the teacher in-service modular education system, designed to increase the quality of in-service training of teachers of Aboriginal studies and of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students; (d) a comparable exercise for pre-service training of teachers; (e) the sister schools scheme, which I launched recently, to encourage contact between students of predominantly non-Aboriginal schools with students in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander schools: the reception to this scheme has been most encouraging, and I am confident that with further promotional activity at the beginning of the next school year there will be a large number of schools participating in 1993; (t) the local history project, which involves a video and kit to encourage and help Aboriginal school communities to research and prepare local histories for use in the Aboriginal studies curriculum of their schools; and (g) initial steps to research and develop a strategy to improve education and training for Aboriginal prisoners and ex-offenders, who are amongst the most educationally disadvantaged in Australia. As the third priority of the Commonwealth for the second AEP triennium, I am confident that this work will be advanced by education providers. Definitely much more needs to be done to ensure the continuation of efforts towards achieving goals under the AEP. As the next AEP triennium approaches, I am looking forward to hearing about different strategies to address the vita\ national issue ensuring that Aboriginal students are just as well taught, well educated, highly motivated and successful as any other Australians. The Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill 1992 provides for the continuation of Commonwealth funding of the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program addressing the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy for the years 1993-1995. The purpose of the Bill is to appropriate funds to enable the Commonwealth to continue to enter into bilateral education agreements with State and Territory governments, non-government school systems, Aboriginal education institutions and Aboriginal education consultative bodies for the provision of Aboriginal education initiatives consistent with the AEP. The Government has allocated a total of $241m as its commitment to the national policy over the next three years. This amount includes $17.3m in response to the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody in relation to additional preschool places and additional Aboriginal education workers; and an amount of $16.8m has been included for Aboriginal languages and literacy initiatives. The Bill provides for the appropriation of $76.9m in 1993, $81.3m in 1994 and $83.1m in 1995. This Bill underpins one of the continuing successful reforms of the Federal Labor Government. This Bill is about social justice and about greater accountability in government expenditure in Aboriginal affairs. It is a good news story for the Government and the nation, and warrants the backing of the whole Parliament. I present the explanatory memorandum and commend the Bill to the House.

254,Mr ROCHER,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,"The of States Grants (General Purposes) Bill 1992 is a machinery Bill that provides for general purpose grants to the States and the Northern Territory. The Australian Capital Territory is provided for separately, in Appropriation Bill (No.2) 1992-93. These general purpose grants represent the outcome of the 1992 Premiers Conference, the Loan Council meeting on 12 June of this year and, of course, the 1992 Budget. . The level of general purpose assistance to the States under this Bill is set at $14.092 billion, which represents about 13 per cent of estimated Commonwealth Budget outlays in 1992-93. This is one of the single largest items in the Commonwealth Budget and it is one of the most important factors in determining the Budgets of the State governments. With these grants, the Government appears to have lived up to its undertaking at the 1990 Premiers Conference and Loan Council meeting to maintain the level of the general revenue assistance in real terms over the three years, 1991-92 to 1993-94. The Commonwealth has also agreed to a one-off payment of around $166m for 1992 which will not be reflected in the base level of funding for 1993-94 and after. This was chosen by the Premiers over the possibility of a more certain three-year arrangement with the Commonwealth reflecting the straitened financial circumstances in which the States find themselves as a result of the recession imposed upon them and the rest of the country by this Commonwealth Government. A working party of State and Commonwealth Treasury officials has been established which is looking into the medium term budgetary outlook for the Commonwealth and the States. This working party will report to the 1993 Premiers Conference on the outcome of its deliberations. This means that this year's Premiers Conference effectively deferred any detailed consideration of FederalState financial relations until next year. The heads of Treasuries working party is examining the adequacy of the current scope and methodology of fiscal equalisation and the principles on which it is based. The working party will make recommendations on the complexity and transparency of the current arrangements, the efficiency costs of horizontal fiscal equalisation, and the implicahad tions of all this for facilitating structural change throughout Australia. The working party's report will be considered in conjunction with the Grants Commission's major methodology review in 1993, and the studies currently being prepared by the governments of Victoria and New South Wales. Clause 4 of the Bill provides for the ter for Health to determine the hospital grants component of the financial assistance grants to be made under this legislation. This is the mechariism by which the Government hopes to bail out Medicare and the financial difficulFederal ties faced by its health budget. It should be noted that the coalition State governments are in the process of challenging the formula for the allocation of thes- grants. While this Bill follows the provisions of the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill 1991, a great deal has changed in the Commonwealth State relations since that Bill was dealt with. Since then, we have acquired a new Prime Minister, as well as new Premiers in four States and a new Chief Minister in one Territory. We have also seen the scuttling of former Prime Minister Bob Hawke's new federalism initiatives, as a result of the bid of the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for the top job late last year. Within days of the State Grants (General Purposes) Bill being debated in the House last year, the honourable member for Blaxland, now the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), made a speech at the National Press Club in which he played on Caucus fears of an end to the pork-barrelling potential of Commonwealth funding - o the States. As we all know, there is nothing Government members like more than unveiling plaques in their electorates for projects supported by Federal funds. One member of the steering committee, when looking at Commonwealth-State financial relations, said that the honourable member for Blaxland's speech had 'thrown a dead cat at the financial relations side of our agenda'. So what stood then as a renewed commitment to reforming Commonwealth-State relations was blown out of the water by the current Prime Minister's leadership aspirations. A senior State government official also occasion to remark at the time that 'Keating and the Ministers who support him treat us like trogs who can't be trusted with the milk money' - another touch of our Prime Minister's arrogance. We should not be surprised, then, to find that little progress has been made in reforming Federal-State financial relations since we Minislast debated a States Grants (General Purposes) Bill in this place. The Labor Government's belated commitment to reform of Federal-State relations fell apart under the weight of the leadership struggle within the parliamentary Labor Party. It will, therefore, be some time before we see a major reform of Federal-State relations, and that refonn will take place under a coalition rather than a Labor Government. In June 1990 Federal and State Liberal leaders met and committed themselves to a review of the taxation sources available to the States, in addition to looking at reforms grants system to ensure a stable and more broadly based system of funding for the States. The current Prime Minister is a committed centralist. In fact, he is even more of a centralist than many of his Caucus colleagues, which is a fairly remarkable achievement given the propensities of many of those opposite. Given his performance as Commonwealth Treasurer, this commitment to centralism by the now Prime Minister-particularly fiscal centralism-is to be expected. It was largely by cutting back on Commonwealth grants to the States that the then Treasurer and now Prime Minister was able to confect a couple of Budget surpluses a few years ago. The Commonwealth shifted the burden of expenditure restraint onto the States, while allowing its own purpose spending to increase significantly. . Since 1982-83 Commonwealth own purpose outlays have increased by 35.5 per cent in real terms compared with a reduction of 1.7 per cent for Commonwealth payments to the States. The increase in States own purpose outlays has been only 29.1 per cent in real terms. The Prime Minister is well known for his desire to run everything in sight. It is therefore unlikely that we will see the many problems with Commonwealth-State financial relations being satisfactorily addressed in the near future by this Government. Many countries around the world today are re-examining their federal systems of government in order to improve efficiencies. Some countries, such as the Federal Republic of Gennany, already have advanced federal systems that have worked well for many years. In Australia, however, we continue to live with a federal system that has many of the disadvantages and few of the benefits of a federal system of government. We have all the inefficiencies and duplications that are generated by multiple levels of government and complicated tax sharing arrangements, but we have few of the benefits of accountability and responsibility that should flow from having three distinct and competitive levels of government. Of all the federal systems in the world, to the Australia must have the most centralised system of revenue raising and the highest level of vertical fiscal imbalance. This represents a long term historical trend as well as the recent politics of Federal-State financial relations. Proposals to reverse this trend towards fiscal centralisation are invariably undermined by political expediency on the part of both State and Federal governments. In terms of the outcome of the 1992 Premiers Conference and the 1992 Commonwealth Budget, the Commonwealth accountS for around 70 per cent of public sector revenue but only 50 per cent of public sector outlays when transfers to other levels of government are excluded. The State Government sector accounts for 27 per cent of public sector revenue and yet is responsible for 45 per cent of total public sector outlay. The difference between the expenditure and revenue collected by the States is made up by intergovernmental grants such as those provided for in this Bill. These grants have increasingly been used by the Commonwealth to impose its will on the other levels of government. The Federal Labor Government has increasingly tied grants to the States for its own purposes through increases in specific purpose payments at the expense of general revenue assistance grants. Specific purpose payments have increased from 30.4 per cent of total Commonwealth payments to the States in 1982-83 to 41.1 per cent in 1991-92. The proportion of tied grants is likely to increase in the near future rather than decrease. Of course, the States have not been blameless in this process of fiscal centralisation. The States have continually shirked responsibility for raising their own revenue, despite their otherwise legitimate protestations about the inadequacy of the tax base on which they are forced to rely. But the Federal Labor Government's repeal in 1989 of the Income Tax (Arrangements with the States) Act virtually guaranteed that the States would be denied a satisfactory revenue base of their own. The repeal of the Act came just as the Greiner Government in New South Wales was giving serious thought to an income tax rebate under the provisions of ,that Act for the taxpayers of New South Wales. There is no excuse for the Commonwealth repealing the principal piece of legislation would have enabled the States to assume the taxing responsibilities originally intended for them by the framers of the Constitution. Indeed, there has been no more ridiculous a contribution to. the debate about Federal-State fipancial relations than that spoken by the then Treasurer about double ta'xation in his second reading speech to the repeal Bill. It is clear that the States are now prepared to take up a greater share of the responsibility for raising their own revenue and are prepared to exercise the fiscal discipline that they have long lacked due to the absence of appropriate incentives under excessive levels of fiscal centralisation. The States are presently stuck with an extremely narrow' tax base. The , narrow tax base available to the States requires high rates of each type of available tax with the result that these taxes are highly distortionary and highly inequitable in their effects. The only major addition to State taxing powers in recent titnes has been the handing over, of the Federal bank account debits tax to the States as a consequence of the Debits Tax Termination Act. .In seeking to reform Commonwealth-State financial relations the States are not ly looking for new taxes or even extra revenue. Rather they are looking for a guaranteed share of Federal income tax revenue that will enable them to manage their budgets and be held accountable for their spending policies. A State. government has little incentive to exercise spending restraint if it is then unable to pass on the benefits of that restraint to taxpayers in that State. Contrary to the long expressed views of the current Prime Minister, the States can be trusted to exercise fiscal reStraint· so long as they can be held responsible by their electors for the raising of the necessary revenue. It is very much a case of the pot calling the kettle black for the Prime Minister to accuse the States of fiscal irresponsibility, given that he has shifted the burden of public sector expenditure restraint onto the States to increase the level of the Commonwealth's own purpose spending. The sharing of such responsibility between the Commonwealth and the States is potentially an effective way of that ensuring that public s.ector spending and taxing is held consistent with national economic priorities. There are a number of mechanisms by which this could be achieved without the States having to levy their own income or other taxes. Fiscal competition between the States has the potential to dramatically lower taxes and discipline State spending policies in a way that the Commonwealth has been unable to achieve under this Government. The current distribution of fiscal powers is already subverting any attempt to run a responsible public sector burrowing requirement. It must also be appreciated that reforming FederalState financial relations is an essential prerequisite for addressing many of the other issues in Commonwealth-State relations. Professor Ken Wiltshire noted in his paper on cooperative federalism for the Economic Planning and Advisory Council: Federal financial arrangements are the single most significant obstacle to a shake out of inter-governmental duplication. The dominance of the Commonwealth Government in the taxation arena is in many ways the driving force behind its large scale involvement ... in areas of government activity formerly considered the constitutional preserve of necessarithe State and local governments. As I have remarked on previous occasions, Federal-State financial relations cannot be addressed in isolation from Federal-State relations more generally and a fundamental examination of the role of government in this country. At the same time as we address the spending and taxing responsibilities of each level of government it is imperative that we also address the proper extent and role of the public sector in this country. Federalism is not just about administrative arrangements between different levels' of government. It is also a theory about how governments can be limited and made accountable by these arrangements. We should examine Federal-State relations in this light. This is something that should be addressed in the course of examining proposals for constitutional refonn in the lead up to the centenary of federation. As Professor WiltShire also remarked: Very few words indicative of anything resembling criteria for allocation of functions between the levels of government appear in the actual wording of the Constitution. This is undoubtedly one of the causes of the many problems that confront Australian federalism today and something that could be usefully addressed in any proposals that might emerge for constitutional refonn in the next few years. An enhanced Federal system that leads to greater competition between State governments and effective checks on the power of the Commonwealth Executive has the potential to greatly enhance the welfare of the Australian people. It is strange that, while we do not, generally speaking, tolerate monopolies or restrictive practices in the case of business enterprises, we have often acquiesced in the process by which the Commonwealth Government has sought to monopolise the provision of certain goods and services, and eliminated competition between State governments. Refonn of Commonwealth-State relations in general, and Commonwealth-State financial relations in particular, is an - ssential component of any agenda for micro-economic refonn in this country. Unfortunately, it is probably one of the. most neglected areas of micro-refonn by a government not well known for having set a cracking pace in this regard. As the position paper presented by the Premiers and Chief Ministers I to the May heads of government meeting said: There has been very little progress on reform of Commonwealth-State financial relations Amen to that. Nothing has happened since May of this year that would lead anyone to change that assessment.",99
255,Mr JOHNS,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,"Petrie-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services) (5.31 p.m.)-In addressing the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill, I want to pick up two comments made by the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher). There are two matters on which we agree. He made the point that these grants are of such magnitude that they have an enormous ·impact on State governments. It is impossible for a State government to frame its Budget and to detennine its priorities, I would argue, without first of all going through the negotiation process, otherwise known as a bun fight, at the Premiers Conference in the middle of the year and at subsequent Loan Council meetings and so on. But let me finish the second point that the honourable member was making: that it could be argued that a burden had been shifted onto the States and that they had to take some severe medicine in the last couple of years. I would suggest that it follows that there is not a great deal more efficiency to be had by squeezing the States even·further when those grants are to be cut, as the Opposition has promised if it is to reach government. I·think I should make some comment about that. The general agreement that was reached at the Premiers Conference-Loan Council for 1992-93 gave us three outcomes. The first was to maintain the level of general purpose capital grants provided under State government loan council programs at the same nominal level as for 1991-92; and, secondly, to increase the global borrowing limits of the States and Territories by 10 per cent in order to assist in accommodating increased public sector financing needs. It was difficult to get agreement on the third point so, by way of compromise for the 1992-93 period only, it was decided that the base level of the financial assistance grants would be distributed on the basis of the per capita relativities recommended by the Commonwealth Grants Commission in accordance with the November 1991 tenns of reference for its update of the 1991-92 general revenue grant relativity. Let me illustrate· the point on which we agree; that is, the enonnous amount of money that is raised by the Commonwealth and then handed on to the States. I would like to indicate the magnitude of the·moneys. Budget Paper No.4 for 1992-93-and I am referring just to Queensland, my home State-shows that the per capita Commonwealth payments to Queensland under general revenue were some $908; under general purpose capital, $15; and under specific purpose paymentS to the States, $632. The total specific purpose payments to Queensland were $944 per capita, and the total paymentS to Queensland were $1,765 per capita or, rather, that is the estimate for 1992-93. Then in global terms the general revenue assistance to Queensland estimated for 1992-93 is some $2.78 billion. So we agree, I would suggest, that the Commonwealth by and large raises the bulk of the money. I do not think there are any foreshadowed changes of a major degree about to occur, but under present arrangements an enormous amount of money is then dispensed to the States under various formulae, which are agreed, sometimes disagreed, between the Commonwealth and the States at the Premiers Conference, Loan Council, et cetera. Having put the argument in place, let me refer to a proposition that the alternative government is making with respect to those .grantS to the States; that is, that there would be a 5 per cent cut in financial assistance. grants to all States should a coalition government be elected. I want to spell out the various ways in which that cut would be, felt in Queensland. In Queensland it would be felt most particularly in employment in the public sector-remembering also that, if we were shift jobs out of the public sector, we would of course hope that anyone dismissed from the public sector would be able to pick job in the private sector. But I would argue that is most unlikely when; at the same time, a consumption tax is introduced on the private economy, which is meant to suppress exthat penditure and will therefore make it very difficult to create jobs in those. people about to be tossed out of the public sector. Let me provide some figures. A 5 per cent cut in the financial assistance grants of the sort that I have already mentioned in Budget Paper No.4 would mean a cut of $140m per year to Queensland. On top of that there would be a further $150m cut in financial assistance grants, which we understand will mostly go in favour of New South Waies and Victoria, as a result of the impact of the distribution of such grants following the abolition of payroll tax. As I understand it, this means that New South Wales and Victoria gain most through a payroll tax, and if it is to be abolished under the alternative government's proposition there will have to be consequent compensation. That will mean a shift of revenues-a loss of $150m on top of the $140m to my State of Queensland. Further, and just to complete the illustration, there will be a $60ni reduction in funds for public housing, a $15m reduction in urban public transport funding, and a $30m cost in the transfer of responsibilities to the States by the Commonwealth in areas such as legal aid, the environment and occupational health and safety. Mr Hawker-Fuel tax affects railways, too. ' Mr JOHNS-Sure. There are some consequential changes, but the Opposition will have to come a long way down the track to recoup what is around a $400m loss to the revenue from the Commonwealth to Queensland. In addition, State Government estimates that our better cities program, which comes in under the general purpose capital assistance grants, and is part of this discussion, will cost it $100m in terms ofloss. That is the' Opposition's argument; that is to its ideological position. It· wantS to force smaller government onto Australia, so it has to take the political consequences. The politiup a cal consequences are a $400m loss to Queenslanders. For that they will not treat the Opposition kindly. I will tell them every day over the next six months of this Parliament they will be treated cruelly by the severe cuts in grants to the States, particularly to the private sector for Queensland. The cut in these various Commonwealth grants to Queensland under the alternative proposition of around $400m-the State Treasury estimates that it is $393m-would have the following sort of impact. I do this by means of illustration because we cannot determine how any State government would create a new budget under this sort of pressure. I would hate to be Keith De Lacy in a year's time, havmg had $400m cut out of his grants from the Commonwealth, sitting down with his State Ministers and having to knock up a State Budget. This is the sort of thing that he might be forced to do. Either he has to raise more revenue himself from the very narrow revenue base, which is the argument of the' honourable member for Curtin, or he has to bite the bullet and take the political consequences of raising taxes. The alternative is to cut services. Cutting services means sacking people. When administrative efficiencies are sought, it is hoped to have one person do the job of two. When the point is reached where there are not any more administrative efficiencies to be had-I suggest that there are not that many more to be had in the governance of the Australian States because we have certainly put them under a little pressure ourselves in the last decade-and having gone that far and not being able to go any further, the point is passed of the nonsense of seeking administrative efficiencies and one gets into the very heart of programs; one gets into the sacking of skilled workers. A $393m loss per year to Queensland would mean a cut of some 2,400 in police numbers in Queensland. When Wayne Goss came to power in 1989 he promised, under pressure from the entire Queensland cO,mmunity, to increase the number of police in Queensland by 1,200 in his first term. I understand that he ha- successfully. completed that task. In addition to that, the Liberal Party at the last State election just some weeks ago was arguing on its law and order cllmpaignwhich did not go down too well amongst the voters, I might say-and had also promised to increase by a further 1,200 t-enumber of police in Queensland. So, under this sort of arrangement, we would lose 2,400 police. So all of the Goss gains can be wiped out, the 1,200 police that he has put into place all around my electorate and other electorates in Queensland and, in addition, one can wipe out the 1,200 that the Liberal Opposition in QueenslandMr Hawker-That is nonsense.",103
256,Mr JOHNS,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,"It is not nonsense. If those opposite are going to cut $400m out, they will have to lose some jobs; or my constituents will have to lose some jobs. In addition to that, if there is no other way around this other than raising taxes at a State level-and none of us wants to see that-2,475 teachers would have to be cut out of the Queensland teaching service which, I might also. mention, represents the total number of additional teachers employed by the Goss Government in its first three years, in its first term. So all of those gains are lost, all of those gains are wiped out as a consequence of cutting these Commonwealth grants to Queensland, as proposed by oui opponents. A total of 3,000 nurses would go. It is not possible to hang on to people and pay them wages when the people who really pay the wages, the Commonwealth, has suddenly withdrawn its funding. The game is over; it is necessary 'to start sacking people. We figure that there would be in the vicinity of 800 other State employees in danger, people such as welfare workers who are employed by the Department of Family Services and so on. Those are the real consequences. We can have a debate writ large about vertical fiscal imbalance, revenue sharing between the Commonwealth and the States, governments seeking efficiencies, and so. on. They are all decent' elements of a debate. But at the end of the day members of the Opposition should not suggest to us that they are seeking to do any more than save money. They want to save 5 per cent of these grants to the States, which the Queensland Treasurer tells ,us is the equivalent of almost $400m year on year. Those moneys will not be able to be recouped by any other means.: If there are a future set of negotiations between a coalition Government and the States that might introduce different means of revenue sharing or allow the States greater ability to raise taxes on their own behalf, that is fine, that is terrific, but that will be a new set of consequences which will have to be built on this base of $400m less to Queenslanders year on year. It will have to be built on this base of a weaker public sector; it will have to be built on the base of fewer persons employed in the public sector who, I would argue, will not be picked up in the private sector. People .have determined through any number of years that there should be a public sector in this country of a decent size because they like the sorts of services that are delivered by public services: police, teachers, nurses, welfare workers, and so on. The State Liberals ran very hard just a couple of weeks ago on a law and order set of issues in Queensland. They were not kindly repaid by the electorate, principally because of the way they campaigned. I think members of the State Liberal Party introduced a couple of USA Republican persons who advised them. They use the sort of drivel that is used by the Republican Party in the USA. Australians, of course, are far more intelligent and resisted that campaign. But even if the campaign was faulty, the Liberals had run an argument in Queensland which said, 'We want to employ 1,200 more police officers in Queensland'. They cannot do it and be mates with their Federal counterparts. Members of the coalition have said, 'Not only can you not have the extra 1,200 police; we will also have to chop out the 1,200 police that are already there introduced by the Goss Government over the last three years'. I suggest to members of the coalition that they will find themselves in enormous conflict with their State counterparts, even with the new Premier of Victoria, Jeff Kennett. He will not like this .sort of stuff. When Wayne Goss gets on the radio and starts to spit a little venom at the coalition, he will be doing it not because he is a Labor Premier, but because he is a Premier. It will not matter which side one is on when it comes to a criticism of cutting State grants. Any State Premier will fight tooth and nail to make sure that the income received from the Commonwealth is not reduced, arid reduced enormously-a 5 per cent cut. When a budget is drawn up, whether it is Commonwealth or State, we all know that 96, 97 or 98 per cent of the money has already been spent. It has already gone in programs, capital and so on. We are only ever talking about the last few per cent when it comes to the introduction of new programs. The Minister for the Arts and Territories (Ms Fatin) would know that; we only get to fiddle at the edges 'year by year. Over time there will be the opportunity to change the shape of arts in Australia enormously; we know that. Year by year only a couple of new programs can be sought to be introduced because the money is basically locked into existing programs and the salaries that go to pay for people who run the programs. Such a, severe cut as proposed-' as promised' were the words the Prime Minister used in Question Time today-by the Opposition to State grants would mean that all of the flexibility for State governments, when they come to frame their programs and their Budgets in the ensuing few years, would be denied them. Those opposite talk about centralist power. There can be no greater power exercised by the Commonwealth Government than to deny all Australian State governments, at least in the near term, any flexibility whatsoever to determine their own programs. It would not matter whether it was a State Labor or Liberal government or Premier, they would be prickly about this sort of stuff. Those opposite will deny them any ability to produce new programs unless they are prepared to raise taxes in their own right under their existing narrow revenue base or cut enormously a particular set of programs. Those might be programs that support the agricultural sector or rural communities. They might be programs that affect particular regions of a State-the far north of Queensland or the west of Queensland. They may involve communities where the consideration is based on age, such as young children who are currently receiving before and after school care; children at school. The programs may involve the disabled, older people, or women who seek the care of their children. When severe cuts are made into the heart of government programs, difficult decisions have to be made. At the end of the day what will happen is that the electorate at large will kick and scream. It will make an enormous fuss about this, and I will make sure it gets sheeted home to a coalition government that wants to cut so severely the ability of the Queensland Government to determine its own priorities, as it rightfully should. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. . Message from Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Johns) read a third time. NA BILL (No.2) 1992 Second Reading Debate resumed from 7 October, on motion by Mr Beddall: That the Bill be now read a second time.",105
257,Mr MCLACHLAN,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"I am glad that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Johns) concedes that we on this side of the House will be in government in the near future. I was gratified to hear that Mr Johns-I will interrupt to say I was not conceding that.",107
258,Mr MCLACHLAN,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"The Parliamentary Secretary can interrupt all he likes, but that what he said. I have to say that I heartily agree. The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No.2) 1992 is really a Bill which is about the reduction of protection, reducing duties on various items, straightening up one or two other areas, and also fixing some mistakes that the Government has made in previous Bills. The main provisions of the Bill are as follows. The Bill introduces a free rate of duty for aquarium aerators, transmission shafts, cranks for outboard motors and master recording blanks. It inserts a new tariff split and a free rate of duty for books for games under tariff subheading 9504. That corrects an anomaly which has existed since the implementation of the legislation in 1991. It reduces the duty rate on aviation gasoline by one cent per litre. Schedule 4 implements changes to the Government's initiatives to assist footwear manufacturers; it abolishes quota restrictions on parts of footwear and replaces them with a reduced tariff at 10 per cent. In effect, this changes the arrangements for footwear manufacturers. There are other aspects of this item in other parts of the Bill which make it cheaper for Australian manufacturers to produce footwear. In other words, it reduces the input costs of these manufacturers. As well, it does the same sort of thing in the area of food processing and packaging by allowing duty free imports of goods designed for use in that sector of the food processing and food packaging industries, and also in metal, materials and goods for metal use in the food packaging industry. So the duties are brought down in those areas to reduce the input costs for those manufacturers. This is a very important aspect of this Bill. We support that general thrust, as we have supported, one might say in an almost bipartisan way, the general thrust of this Government over a number of years in the reduction of protection. We do not support it for any philosophical reason, but for a dollar reason because other people somewhere in Australia have to pay these costs. These are two very good examples in this Bill of an initiative brought about by this is Government to reduce the cost to manufacturers. It is therefore dishonest of the Government, through the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), to get up here day after day to say that this Government is the only government that has ever promulgated a reduction of protection in this country. It is dishonest of him to take pride in that, to pat himself on the back for doing that, but in the same breath to claim that the Opposition's protection policies will destroy this country. The fact of the matter is that since this country realised the cost of the protective measures that it has brought upon itself for 90 years now at least, and since the explanations and understanding of those costs have been taken up by the Australian population in general, there has been a more or less bipartisan approach to these reductions. When the Prime Minister says that he takes credit for all this, I remember well some circumstances in 1984. when he was getting some lessons on the cost of protection in some of the agricultural industries, some of which, as I have said before, had been trying to educate both sides of this House for many years before that. Some people will remember the very great cost put upon our primary industries by protective measures in the past. It is interesting to note that the latest work commissioned by the Manufacturing Council of Australia shows that the greatest beneficiaries of a reduction in tariff protection would be manufacturing exporters. I think the Council was quite surprised to find that it was not agricultural exporters or mineral exporters or mineral processors, but that manufacturing exporters would be the greatest beneficiaries of the removal of protection in Australia. In other words, the cost of tariffs is being borne by someone else, and that is a very good example. This Bill also extends the quota restrictions applying to certain other cheese by omitting the sunset clause which would have terminated the quota restrictions from 30 June 1992. In 1985 this country was beset-besieged is probably a better word-by the importation of a great quantity of two particular types of European cheese, Edam and Gouda. The importation of those cheeses was getting to such an enormous extent that the Government decided that it had to do something about it. The then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, went to Brussels and negotiated, amongst other things, the Andriessen agreement, which was an agreement by the Europeans to restrict the export of beef to Japan from their subsidised stockpiles of beef, which I am happy to say is still in existence, and also this tariff arrangement for cheese. We will not object to the perpetuation of this arrangement, but I must say that it does seem to us that the industry itself, although it has had some problems in contemplating this issue, would be much better off to run a countervailing duty action against the Europeans over this commodity. Prior to such a hearing, there is absolutely no doubt in any body's mind that the Europeans subsidise this commodity in its production. There is no doubt in anybody's mind that the Europeans subsidise this commodity in its export. At the same time, whilst we allow some 11,500 tonnes of cheese from Europe into this country, the Europeans. restrict our imports into that vast area to 3,000 tonnes. It does seem to us that were the countervailing duty arrangements more expeditiousin other words were people able to feel that they could run a countervailing duty case in a reasonable time, at reasonable cost, and moreover with some chance that the material injury that they showed did not have to be too great, but that at least having shown it they could get some reasonable reward or countervailing duty in place-I think the industry could well be better served than it is by the current arrangements. After all, they are quite uneven. It is an understatement to say that our being allowed 3,000 tonnes of cheese into Europe and the Europeans being allowed 11 ,500 tonnes in here is uneven. Having discussed it with the industry on a number of different occasions, I do know that it is nervous about running such an action because it is not sure what the results would be. I also know that it is worried about the evidential procedures and that the fact that it had agreed previously to this sort of arrangement might do it harm in the hearing itself. But I put forward the proposition that, if we could get a preliminary hearing over and done with in 65 days, and where injury is shown some penalties put in place-as opposed to the current arrangements in which, quite frankly we have to show rather more injury than one would have thought necessary-I put it to the House that the industry'S confidence would be more towards running a countervailquota ing duty case. If that were done, we do not know what the result would be, but it is reasonable to assume that some penalty would be put in place which would bring things to a more even result. I was at that meeting in Brussels-not at the negotiations, but at the meeting. That was seven years ago, times have probably changed and we and the industry should be looking at other ways of dealing with it. This perpetuates an uneven arrangement which I think probably should be changed. This Bill also imposes an additional duty of $5 per kilogram on manufactured tobacco and tobacco products. In other words, this is one circumstance where the duties will go up. There is no doubt that we should agree. The justification for this was no doubt based on grounds with which one could not disagree. Schedule 6 of this Bill restructures many the tariff subheadings which cover textiles clothing and footwear articles. There are nchanges of duty involved; it will merely simplify the classification of goods under these chapters. There are various other changes and reductions, including, of course a reduction in the rate of duty on imported b-r. I do not imagine that anybody in this House would object to that. These measures are not world shattering. The Budget effect is minimal and the increase in duty on the imported manufactured tobacco and tobacco products is expected to raise an additional just under $6m in customs duty. The changes to the arrangements on footwear parts from 1 July 1992 are expeCted to involve a loss of revenue of about $4m per annum. So the financial implications are not great. Many of the proposed amendments in this Bill are uncontentious. The changes under schedule 4 also allow for the duty free importation of goods designed for use in food processing and food packaging industries. As I said earlier, it is an indication that the Government concedes that tariffs are pushing up costs. It can be nothing else; otherwise why would it reduce them? That is simply the point that I wish to make again because it is very important in this debate that it is undertained stood that both sides of this House have set about a policy of reducing protection in Australia for one purpose only, which is to open up Australia to the rigours of international competition, to the rigours of having to address, if you like, best practice in whatNational ever area of manufacturing or business. That best practice will apply equally to the industrial relations area as to protection reducted tion. So, given that many of the changes in this Bill are either non-contentious or represent an improvement, we do not oppose the Bill.",107
259,Mr HULLS,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No.2) 1992 contains a number of amendments to the Customs Tariff Act of 1987. Many of the amendments have already been introduced as customs tariff proposals. As has already been said by the honourable member for Barker of (Mr MCLachlan), amendments in this legisia-on concern th- - oba-co industry, the dairy mdustry, the aViation mdustry, the Australian footwear industry, tariff preference arrangements for developing countries and the Florence agreement to which Australia is a signatory. Despite what the honourable member for Barker said, the amendments contained in this Bill reflect the radical difference between the Government and the Opposition on the very important tariff issue. The Opposition wants to drop tariffs to zero in Australia, giving industries no protection as they restructure to become more efficient. Despite what people such as Senator O'Chee might say on the tariff issue when they go around rural Australia, the bottom line is that the coalition's policy is indeed one of zero tariffs. In contrast to this, the Government is reducing tariffs gradually in full consultation with business, and will maintain moderate tariffs for industries that need them-for example, 25 per cent for clothing and 15 per cent for cars in the year 2000. Of course, the Government is also providing support for restructuring. On tariff policy this Government and the coalition are very different.. The Government is not abolishing tariffs; amendments conin this Bill make that very clear. Some industries such as the dairy industry or the sugar industry will need continued support and protection, and this Labor Government will give it to them. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), the Leader of the Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) and indeed the honourable member for Barker would not do that. The Opposition is committo zero tariffs across the board. In a debate on this issue on 31 March 1992 the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) said: In no other country in the world-not in Margaret Thatcher's England-has there been it policy of zero industry protection. . . . No country .in t-e developed w,?rld lacks a policy for protectmg Its motor vehIcle and textiles, clothing and footwear industries. The contrast between the Government and the coalition position is indeed clear. The Government is phasing tariffs down to 25 per cent for the clothing industry, 15 per cent for textiles, 15 per cent for cars and 5 per cent for most other industries. The coalition proposes a zero tariff regime for everything. Three industries affected by the Bill are particularly relevant to my electorate and I will direct my comments therefore to the effect of this legislation on the tobacco industry, the dairy industry and the aviation and related tourism industry. The first aspect of this legislation that I want to talk about concerns the tobacco ,industry. Schedule 5, which was operative from 19 August 1992, increases the duty on certain tobacco products by $5 a kilogram, as announced by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) in his Budget Speech. There are a lot of tobacco growers in my electorate and they are understandably concerned about the long term effect of State and Federal government increases in excise levels. They are also understandably more concerned about the coalition's plans for the tobacco industry. Fightback!, at page 83, states: As noted in the Health Policy (Supplementary Paper No 3) the Liberal and National parties will increase the excise on tobacco by 25 per cent. There is no mention of consultation with the ,industry or even acknowledgment that this policy may adversely affect farmers who happen to grow tobacco. Whether we like it or not, tobacco is a legal product. It seems to me that the Opposition is intent on punishing tobacco growers who are looking at certain economic ru,in should the coalition ever form a government. With a 15 per cent GST on top of its 25 per cent excise, some cigarette packets would cost over the $5 mark. I want to use this opportunity to remind the House that, whilst I share the concerns of my colleagues about the health risks associated with tobacco smoking, there are hundreds of hard working farmers in the Mareeba and Dimbulah area of my electorate who came out to Australia many years ago from Europe and were encouraged to plant tobacco leaf and invest in irrigation systems and drying sheds. They have invested their life's labour in a legal product and are now being made to feel somewhat like criminals. I have said in this House before, and I repeat it, that smoking is a dangerous habit and I support the Government's effort to reduce the number of smokers in the community and lessen the dreadful burden of tobacco-related deaths on the health system. However, where paternalistic policy measures such as tobacco advertising bans or increases in tobacco excise such as in this Bill directly ,affect the viability of farmers, I believe that it is incumbent on the Government to provide appropriate compensation or a crop substitution scheme for those farmers. The fact is that we do not have to go as far as a complete ban to justify the provision of a compensation deal or alternative crop assistarice for tobacco farmers. What we now have is a deliberate Government policy to minimise tobacco consumption which directly affects the viability of the tobacco industry. To put it in context, we have a quota system for tobacco growers and that quota system is based on the previous year's consumption. So if fewer people in Australia smoke in a particular year due to Government policies, tobacco growers are able to grow less of that product. Of course, the more we have policies to ensure that there is less consumption in this' country, the less viable tobacco farmers will become. I am pleased that the Government has responded to my concerns. The Minister for Primary' Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) announced last month that he would establish a tobacco, industry task force to look at a national approach to the future development of the tobacco industry. Grower representatives from New South Wales and Victoria have joined with the Queensland body and have taken up an offer made by the Minister to Mareeba growers in July this year to work with the industry to develop a growth strategy in light of public policy concerns in relation to tobacco. Under this approach the task force, involving representatives of growers .and manufacturers, will examine the prospects for the industry, including the export of Australian tobacco leaf and tobacco products. The decision to establish the task force, I believe, is a further demonstration of the Government's preparedness to work with the industry. It shows up yet again one of the big differences between this Government and the Opposition. We believe in consultation and listening to people. The Opposition...,-and sure the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) would concur with me-believes in whatever the economic rationalists in its right wing think-tanks tell it to believe in. This is clearly illustrated in relation to the process of consultation with the dairy industry on this Bill. The Bill also extends quota restrictions on certain types of cheese. This extension is the result of an intense and successful consultative effort between the Government and the dairy industry. The amendments in this Bill concerning the dairy industry have been welcomed by the industry. Why? Because this Bill retains the cheese quota, which is exactly what the industry wanted. The dairy plan has been well received by the dairy industry. It is proof that the Primary Industries Minister is not going to be driven solely by the dictates of Industry Commission reports. Again this is in stark contrast to the Opposition, which has a stated policy of fully implementing the recommendations of the Industry Commission. In December 1990, the Industry Commission was given a reference to inquire into the Australian dairy industry. With respect to the cheese quota, the Commission recommended that the quota not be renewed, much to the horror of the dairy industry.. In typical ion, the Industry Commission concluded that, while the quota limited imports from most sources to an arbitrary level, it did so without any of the assessments that accompany anti-dumping actions. This, according to the Commission, enabled manufacturers to increase their profitability by limiting competition in the market at the expense of consumers who are denied access to cheese at lower prices. Part of that may be true, but we have one of the most efficient dairy industries in the world-an indu-try that is competing in a radically distorted international marketplace. Much to the relief of the dairy industry, the Government adopted a cooperative, consultative approach to developing a plan for the future of the dairy industry. After wide consultation with the industry on 30 April the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy I am announced a new framework for the Commonwealth's dairy marketing arrangements. A key element of the arrangements, to which this Bill will give effect, was the retention of the cheese quota. I might say that Pat Rowley from the dairy industry actually came down to Canberra to meet members of the Caucus primary industries and energy committee after the Minister made this announcement. He made it quite clear that he was extremely· pleased with the way the Government had cooperated and consulted with his industry. Although he did not say it in so many words, he made it quite clear that such a consultative approach may well not have been forthcoming had a different government been in power. The successful outcome in.the dairy industry bodes well for the sugar industry as the sugar industry task force, which is headed by my capable colleague the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice), is currently involved in consultations with cane farmers, sugar millers, sugar mills and people working in. that industry up and down the sugar belt of this country. The cooperative approach is in marked contrast to the coalition's ideological approach to driving tariffs down to zero without any regard for the individual circumstances of our industries. The coalition is also confused about tariffs. fash- Some National Party members. I cited Senator O'Chee earlier-strongly support slower tariff reductions, or no tariff reductions, and indeed the retention of some tariff protection. Well, that is what they say when they are out in rural Australia, particularly rural Queensland. Even some Liberal members disagree with the Leader of the Opposition. I quote from a recently publicised statement by the .honourable member for Deakin (Mr Aldred) who said in this House not too long ago: It would seem that Australia's Rambo-like obsession with reducing industry assistance is clearly an increasingly dangerous and exposed minority position in the world at large. Yet the fact is that, despite the crocodile tears of some National Party and Liberal Party members who claim.to be against zero tariffs, they are irrevocably bound to implement them. The Leader of the Opposition has made it very clear that he will not budge from his commitment to zero tariffs. The final aspect of this legislation that I want to talk about relates to schedule 3 of this Bill, which reduces the customs duty on aviation gas by 1.1c per litre. This customs duty is charged on avgas, which is exclusively used by piston-engine aircraft. This Government has progressively reduced this particular excise. The funds collected go to the Civil Aviation Authority to fund its various operations around the country. It is worth noting that jet aircraft and prop aircraft, which service most of the tourist routes in Australia, run on excise-free avtur, not avgas. The reduction in the avgas excise results from the phasing out of the collection of that part of the customs duty attributable to the aerodrome cost recovery program and reductions in CAA costs of providing rescue and fire fighting services at airports. The reduction in the avgas excise will be welcomed by small aircraft owners and charter companies in my electorate, who are extremely fearful of the Opposition's plans fbr their industry. While the Opposition says that it will eliminate the excise, it has not said how it will alternatively fund the CAA. It has said, however, that it will introduce a 100 per cent user-pays safety levy. I have received many letters from aircraft owners and charter companies in my electorate expressing their fears that they will be hit with massive registration levies to cover the costs of CAA services. As I said, the reduction in the avgas excise results from the phasing out of the collection of that part of the customs duty attributable to the aerodrome cost recovery program and reductions in CAA costs of providing rescue and firefighting services at 'airports. The number of aerodromes. owned by the Commonwealth or under the aerodrome local ownership plan has been reduced to fewer than one hundred. This has enabled the Government to pass on the fuel reduction of 1.1c per litre. There will be a further reduction next year as more airports are phased out of the ALOP scheme. Mr Deputy Speaker, it might interest you to know that in the past 18 months I have handed over 15 cheques totalling $6,444,696 to local councils in my electorate. That process has involved the transfer of ownership of the aerodromes concerned from the Commonwealth to local councils. In total, 27 airports in my electorate have received $8,594,787. Mr Ronaldson-That won't save you.",109
260,Mr HULLS,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"It is interesting to note that the honourable member for Ballarat is making some specious, childish interjection. If he has a look at the State figures for his seat of Ballarat, he will see that he might not be with us after the next election. As I said, the turbotransfer of ownership of local airportS is intended to bring about a more efficient service as local communities are more aware of needs of their local airports. I take this opportunity to mention the fact that the Minister for Tourism (Mr Griffiths) will be in Longreach next week to hand over a $3.8m cheque to the Longreach Shire Council to assist that Council in taking over the management of its airport. The Longreach Airport is critical to the future of the blossoming tourist industry in north-west Queensland. The Longreach Council is seeking more funds to extend the airstrip so that the airport can handle larger jets. I will be doing my utmost to get the message across to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Northern Australia (Mr Humphreys) and the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) in relation to this matter. As you would know; Mr Deputy Speaker, Longreach is at the heart of the tourism boom in outback Queensland. Thousands of tourists are deliberately setting out across the country to visit the Stockman's Hall of Fame and other outback attractions such as the Blackall Wool Scour and the Barcaldine Workers Heritage Centre. At both those latter tourist destinations last weekend, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was welcomed with open arms and was certainly treated to a great day. Barcaldine and Blackall are very historic towns as far as the history of the Labor movement is concerned. We all know that if the Opposition had way it would wreak havoc in the tourist industry. The plans of the Leader of the Opposition would cost domestic airlines more than $25Om a year, even after allo-ing for supposed tax offsets such as payroll tax might abolition, petrol tax abolition and wholesale sales tax abolition. This cost would inevitably be passed on to .passengers, and Treasury estimates that air fares would increase 8 per cent. The Leader of the Opposition the elimination of excise on aviation fuel or .itvtur would bring air fares' down. As you would note, Mr Deputy Speaker, this is simply wrong. The Government removed the excise from .avtur fuel five years ago. In October 1991, the Opposition tourism spokesperson, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), said: ' I ask you, is it fair if you apply GST to a loaf bread and you .-on't apply it to. a holiday Hawaii? Apparently, he has decided that it is fair, because the GST would not affect interselling national air fares but, as we all know, would certainly have a devastating effect on the price of the necessities of life, including next election. bread. International air fares would be zero rated under Fightback, but domestic air fares adjourned. would not. In other words, families who can afford to fly to Hawaii for a holiday would not pay the GST, but families who wanted to travel from Brisbane to Longreach to visit the Stockman's Hall of Fame would. Clearly, the Opposition's Fightback proposal is anti-tourism and therefore anti-outback Queensland. if the coalition had its way, the GST would kill off the tourist industry as people headed for cheaper Asian destinations. The dairy industry would collapse in face of zero tariffs; the sugar would collapse in the face of zero tariffs; and the tobacco industry would be wiped out completely. Towns such as Mareeba and Dimbulah would become ghost towns as a result of Fightback's increased excise in relation to tobacco and, on top of that, the GST slug. In contrast, I believe that the amendments in the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill curits rently before the House are proof of the Government's commitment to phased tariff reduction and industry restructuring in an . atmosphere of consultation. While the honourable member for Ballarat is in the House, he do w-ll to note the fact that ollt in rural Queensland-and he has a rural based seat in Victoria-people are not wearing the GST proposal. They are certainly embracing with by over open arms the Government's response to industry concerns; that is, they are embracing the consultative process that this Government claims that has embarked upon. I mentioned earlier the sugar industry task force headed by my very capable colleague the honourable member for Hinkler. The sugar industry is certainly very pleased by the consultative process that that task force has embarked upon. The honourable member for Ballarat and the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran) may do well to of take on board what people are saying out in in rural Australia. They want consultation, they do not want zero tariffs and they want those opposite to understand that the GST is not in the bush. I think those opposite will find that, unless they drop this crazy proposal, they will certainly suffer at the polls at the Debate (on motion by Mr Ronaldson) ' NA Motion (by Ms Fatin) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Corporation Laws",112
261,Mr FORD,ADJOURNMENT,"This evening I want to discuss the business of Australia. One problem with this nation is that we have been reduced to a nation of paper the shufflers and form fillers. In the 1980s a whole group of so-called entrepreneurs built their phoney empires on paper shuffling, by acquiring fake asset· valuation and by meaningless paperwork. Australia now has a taxation system which punishes the thrifty and taxes personal savings at the marginal rate. Almost everybody, even the hapless PAYE taxpayer, has to be a petty hoarder of receipts and records. The nation's corporate rules are now so complicated and so unnecessarily intrusive that a sizeable number of people have to be employed just to keep the records up to date. Of course, just like an episode of Yes, Minister, there is no actual purpose in keeping the records up to date other than to keep an army of nosy public servants on the payroll. During the last two decades, this Parliament has allowed the bureaucracy to create a situation where the expectation is for a company to exist for tax collection and social welfare purposes. The legitimate aims of business have been forgotten; the interests of the shareholders have been forgotten; we have forgotten about development of products; we have forgotten about manufacturing; we have forgotten about mining. Apart from having created one of the most hostile business environments in the world, Australia has some of the most complicated tax and business laws in the developed world, yet we do not even have an industry policy. Everything is secondary to having the correct government form filled out on the right day. As our enterprises become fewer and fewer, the attack from the bureaucracy will become more and more concerted and relentless. This depression, or recession we had to have, is even more worrying than anything else in our history. Never before has the bureaucracy been so dominant. Even the most simple tasks are now very regulated. Try building a home made two-wheel trailer for a car in Victoria. The rules and regulations would drive a person insane. Australia will not recover from this depreshave sion until the bureaucracy is well and truly out of the way of business and well and truly out of the way of wealth creation and the individuals who create the wealth of this country. In the 1890s and 1930s, did businesses have to contend with the horrendous cost of the tax rules and the business rules; the workplace costs of a 17112 per cent loading on holidays; termination and redundancy payments; four weeks or more annual leave; a 38-hour week; occupational superannuation; high penalty rates; high employee insurance rates; or training levies? All these are administered by a dominant and self-interested but out of control bureaucracy. Even worse, the bureaucracy is unaccountable and is, in effect, responsible to no-one. The ASC's laws do not apply to the bureaucracy. The Trade Practices Commission laws do not apply to the bureaucracy. Somehow the legislature has allowed the nation to drift or be driven into an administrative nightmare. Increasingly, all the risks are being taken by farmers, miners and private business. A minority of the population is expected to generate all the wealth and take all the risks while at the same time suffering the most outrageous rules and regulations. It is only a matter of time before this institution starts passing legislation actually stating that the wealth producing class be exterminated. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating), for instance, is one of the greatest economic vandals of the twentieth century. He compares with Argentina's Peron, whose policies so impoverished the once wealthy Argentina. He is oblivious to the fact that the world's banks are imposing strict rules on countries with economic problems. France has recently been forced to cut pensions and the salaries of civil sel'vants. Great Britain, likewise, is .being forced to slash similar public outlays. How do these two countries compare with Australia's record under the regime of the world's greatest Treasurer? Let the facts speak for themselves. Unlike France and Britain, neither of which has an overseas debt, Australia groans under the weight of $160 billion of indebtedness. I fear that the day of reckoning is coming. As a nation we may to swallow some very unpleasant medicine, but it will rid us of all this form filling and unnecessary bureaucracy. (TIme expired) Sun Protection",113
262,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,ADJOURNMENT,"Some years back I developed a skin cancer which was in fact a malignant melanoma. lowe my place here today, in many ways, to a very courageous 'young man who appeared on 60 Minutes talking about his condition, who sadly has died, and also to Dr Peter Randell and Dr Fitzpatrick in Perth, who treated me. I developed this melanoma because I was tending to do my gardening in old business shirts. When the collars got a bit worn, I would wear them ,out in the garden when planting tomatoes and mowing the lawn.",114
263,Mr GOODLUCK,ADJOURNMENT,I wear them inhere.,115
264,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,ADJOURNMENT,"Bruce wears the old ones in here. I thought I was completely protected. I learnt, to my cost, that was not. The slip, slop, slap campaign leaves something very important out-that is, we do not have effective protection with certain categories of clothing. Business shirts are sufficient protection against the Australian sun. As honourable members know, our sunscreens have a sun protection factor coding. It is recommended that we all use a IS-plus sunscreen, such as the one put out by the Cancer Foundation and which I give out at schools. Mr Ford-We never get any sun.",115
265,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,ADJOURNMENT,"The honourable member looked pale after the grand final but I thought it was due to the result, not weather. This is a very effective coding system which really does work well. People know that IS-plus gives them 15 times their nonnal skin protection.' I am suggesting that we need a similar coding system for clothing. A traditional business shirt would have a coding of about four. The light can relatively easily be seen through it. Woven T-shirts would have a coding of seven.or eight. Virtually opaque T-shirts would have a coding of about 15. The sad thing is that, when people go into a store and buy a shirt, they do not really know what protection they are getting from it. Many of the imported Tshirts are substantially· inferior, and buyers should be beware of them. Many of tJiem can be seen through when held up to the light. This is a very important issue to be addressed for the protection of the Australian community. I surf regularly, and as a result of my condition I approached ONEILL Wetsuits in Victoria. It is a very good company and has a big export market. For the first time ever, it has produced a lycra summer weight wetsuit that I will wear when surfing from now until about next April. It gives me complete, 100 per cent, protection all day. I can surf for four or five hours and I will not get sunburnt through it. There is a new product out now called Frogskin, which also gives a protection factor of 36-plus. Anyone wearing it will not get sunburnt through it. I suggest that we need a coding system in place so that, when people go into stores and I buy T-shirts, they know that if they wear them in the garden, golfing, or playing tennis they will get IS-plus protection, which is the coding that we get with our sunscreen. I think not we ought to have that in place, particularly for T-shirts, which are recreational clothing. I have had great support from manufacturers such as ONEILL with this wetsuit. I take it to schools and tell young people, 'You can surf in the summer, but you really should surf with at least this sort of lycra wetsuit to coyer you'. Many young children go to the beach and it worries me that their mums put a Tshirt on them and think they are covered. IIi fact, they are not, especially if the T-shirt gets the wet. Very fine T-shirts will not hold up. The rule of thumb, for anyone who wants to know, is to hold it up to the light. That will show the amount of ultraviolet radiation that is getting through.' If it is relatively opaque, it will protect a person very well. An old business shirt or thiIily woven T-shirt. will not give adequate protection. I suggest that we do need to take a big step in this direction. I commend Dr Peter Randell and the College of Dermatologists in Western Australia, which is having its next skin cancer clinic on 12 November at the police headquarters in Perth. It is doing a survey of policemen aged 50 years and over because they often wear short-sleeve shirts during summer. We do need a big campaign on this. I think a code for clothing is the way to start. I support Australian made products. (Time expired) Superannuation",115
266,Mr MCARTHUR,ADJOURNMENT,"With the introduction of the superannuation guarantee charge, the Government has given notice that it regards compulsion as the way to go with superannuation, especially where employers are concerned. The Government has legislated to raise the initial 3 per cent employer funded contribution level to 9 per cent by the year 2000, with the possibility that a figure of 12 per cent may be introduced should a Labor government be in office. The disastrous consequences on employment have been discussed by bodies such as the former Confederation of Australian Industry. It has come up with a figure of some 80,000 jobs which will be either lost or not created as a result of the introduction of the superannuation guarantee charge. The Government has not heeded the calls for a more sensible retirement incomes policy that gives tax incentives for people to invest in superanmany nuation whilst at the same time ensuring that the prevalence bf double dipping is either eliminated or greatly reduced. A Hewson government wili raise the preservation age from the present level of 55 years to 60 years over a lO-year period from July 1994. This will ensure that superannuation is used for its originally intended purpose-the funding of one's retirement-and not as an easy way to have access to a sizeable sum of money at 55 and then to rearrange one's affairs onto a taxpayer funded pension at a later date. There should always be a link between employer and employee contributions. I have been a very strong advocate of this. The Government compels employers to pay a minimum amount as a superannuation contribution. There is little incentive for employees to contribute additional amounts to superannuation. Under the changes from 1 July 1992, if one is an employee who receives only employer superannuation contributions under an industrial award, one can receive only a 10 per cent rebate on the first $1,000 of contributions. Where is the incentive to contribute to a personal superannuation fund under these arrangements? At other times, the Keating Government's superannuation policy and its failure to focus on tax incentives have further unfortunate consequences. The example of South Australia's public sector, where one-third of the employees have not taken the action necessary to join their public sector scheme, shows how complacent individuals can be about financial planning for retirement when a government fails to emphasise the link between employer and employee contribution levels. In advocating compulsion as the way to go for superannuation, the Government has shown how unsure it is of itself by commissioning some market research at a cost of $98,000 in April 1992. The study of Brian Sweeney and Associates was entitled Community Education Campaign on Benefit of Saving for Retirement Through Superannuation. The Government has been spending thousands of dollars advertising the superannuation guarantee charge, but this report suggests that much of the spending may be unnecessary. The report indicates that, in April 1992,93 per cent of full time wage and salary earners were ,having their employer superannuation contributions paid into the fund. Over half of part time workers were similarly covered. Many of those not receiving the 3 per cent would be earning less, than the $450 minimum monthly earnings, a figure that now brings an employee within the ambit of the levy. Of course, this back flip to a higher figure of $450 on 16 June 1992 shows just how little idea the Government has regarding the impact of its policies out in Australian workplaces. The Government is now spending thousands of dollars in targeting members of the public with advertising about the SGC when the professionals that the majority of people rely on for infonnationsuch as accountants, superannuation funds, insurance companies and financial advisersare already well infonned about the whole concept of superannuation. In talking about a similar study regarding the extent of awareness of the tax file number rules, Senator MCMullan suggested that understanding of these rules was very high when he said on 28 May 1992: ... up to 93 per cent of respondents are able to correctly answer questions on the rules of the tax file number. If we take the same approach with the SGC, there seems to be little need for this ing and the $98,000 market research study. The Government's whole approach to superannuation is flawed. It has emphasised compulsion and that only one group-the employers-are to shoulder the major part of the burden in shifting Australians away from dependence on the social welfare system. This Government has wasted $100,000 in market research on people's attitudes to superannuation, when all along the Government's approach was known to be one of forcing an inflexible arrangement on unwilling and recession-hit· employers whilst ultimately failing to lift Australia's savings ratio. Australian Workers Union",115
267,Mr COURTICE,ADJOURNMENT,"I am very pleased to note this week that a frivolous charge that was brought against an Australian Workers Union official was dismissed. The Australian Workers Union organiser, Mr Dudley Watson, had a charge of assault occasioning bodily harm against him dismissed by Mr William Swan, SM, in the Charleville Magistrates Court. The complaint against Mr Watson was instigated by a Manuel Smith, a member of the Troubleshooters Available Labour Agency. In giving his decision, the magistrate said that he found the evidence of one of the prosecution's witnesses, Paul Frelek, also a member of the Troubleshooters Available Labour Agency, was not convincing and in conflict with the evidence of other witnesses' evidence, including the complainant, Manuel Smith. The magistrate rejected Frelek's evidence in its entirety. . The magistrate also found that while Mr Watson had called Mr 'Smith a scab, Mr Smith consented to the fight. The magistrate dismissed the charge and discharged the defendant, Mr Dudley Watson. I would also like to congratulate Sciacca and Associates, and particularly Brian Kilmartin, for preparing the case. What gets to the heart of this matter is the fact that this has been politically orchestrated by the New Right and by Troubleshooters across this country to try to discredit somebody who is standing up for the rights of advertisworkers in the shearing industry. Mr Elliott-Absolutely.",117
268,Mr COURTICE,ADJOURNMENT,"Absolutely, as my colleague says. We all know that the shearing industry is at the leading edge of the fight with regard to whether award conditions remain in place or whether they are broken down and the New Right rules. I was pleased that the union's SouthWestern District Secretary, Garry Ryan, said he believed that the charge was not only frivolous but that the complaint was made only as a deliberate attempt to attack the union through one of its officials. I am also pleased to say that Mr Watson came out of the disagreement without suffering any eye damage, because it is important to note that Mr Watson's defence included a doctor's testimony that shortly before the fight he had a lens implanted in an eye to treat a cataract and a blow to that eye could have caused loss of sight. This was a front-page story in the Courier Mail today and was publicised right across the country when the charge was originally laid. I would like to compare that with what was reported in the Longreach Leader on 12 July 1991: A Morven man was found gUilty of unlawful assault with an offensive weapon on Australian Workers Union Organiser, Mr Dudley Watson ... Ray Nielsen of Brunei Station via Morven appeared in the Charleville Magistrates Court on July 1 on a charge of assault. He was discharged conditionally on entering into recognisance in the sum of $1,000 to be of good behaviour for a period of 12 months. Nielsen was alleged to have struck Mr Watson with a steel bar on Brunei Station last January. SouthWestern District Secretary of the Australian Workers' Union, Mr Garry Ryan, said Mr Watson was attending to business as an authorised Union Officer and did not provoke such an attack. He said the Union intends to proceed with further legal action against Mr Nielsen for alleged breaches of the Industrial Relations Act 1990-91. ""This case should serve as a warning to others who believe they can physically or otherwise obstruct a Union Officer while he or she is conducting legitimate and authorised business,"" Mr. Ryan said. The point I make is that when this happened there were no headlines in any national paper, there was no hue and cry across the country because there was no orchestrated campaign on the part of Dudley Watson, who was just going about his job. But when a fight was staged and a stunt set up in Charleville Troubleshooters, there was an orchestrated campaign. I make the observation that a lot money is being pushed into organisations such as Troubleshooters to try to break down award conditions and to create industrial disputations in the shearing industry. It is sad to hear over and over again I speeches from the other side of the House people who want to attack award conditionsruined conditions that create a civilised society create a little bit of dignity for working and women in this country. In the Charleville area Dudley Watson has been successful 47 different occasions on various properties in catching people for breaches and thousands of dollars have been collected on behalf of workers as a result of the underpayment of wages. This has been done by the Australian Workets Union and it will'continue to do so. The union will not be intimidated by thugs like Graeme Haycroft who runs five Troubleshooters and who was a former suping porter of Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen in his for PM' campaign and the New Right stemshe ming out of the H.R. Nicholls Society Melbourne. ' Bender's Quarry",117
269,Mr GOODLUCK,ADJOURNMENT,"Franklin) (7.48 p.m.)Most people have read about Bender's Quarry ,in Tasmania. Ray Bender decided to take Government on about the, closure of his quarry in, the Huon Valley in Tasmania. the way, I have been tryirig to get a question up here for a long time. It is difficult to when one has something important to say and wants to bring forward the aspirations of somebody in one's electorate. One gets a frustrated. I have listened to the debates all week about the Catholics, the Uniting Church, and what the GST will do to the poor people and so on. I thought to myself, 'Boy, if income isn't generated somewhere, somebody has to look after the poor and the needy'. So we seem to be arguing the toss about what is right and what is wrong. All of a sudden down in the Huon we have the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly). They tell me that she supports the Raiders; I often see by her in a green uniform and they say that she is a green raider or something or other. When of she was appointed Minister for the Environment, I held my breath because I remember vividly her reaction on, first, the Franklin River and, second, on the pulp mill in Tasmania. Her reaction was all pro-greenie. thought to myself, 'We are' in for trouble in by Tasmania', because if '.ever a State has been by the greenies, it is Tasmania. It has and been absolutely ruined. We have unemploymen ment everywhere, with people battling to pay their bills, as I have said ad infinitum in this on House. So how the dickens can they pay for the poor and needy when they cannot even of the award get jobs themselves? All of a sudden the Minster decided to close this quarry in Tasmania on the whim and fancy of the greenies. The quarry has been operating for 43 years, supplying jobs to families in the area. It also had a generateffect through creating jobs for the pri'Joh mary producers and so on. All of a sudden decided to close it. But she picked the in wrong bloke. I like a bloke with a bit of tenacity who will have a bit of a go. Ray Bender is one of those people. He would have made a dashed good politician. It is useless the Labor candidate who is rurining against me trying to knock me off my the perch. Everybody tries to knock me off my, perch. The Minister for Family Support and ay Minister for Local Government (Mr Simmons), who is at the table, would laugh do so at that remark. Here we have another one trying to knock me off my perch, playing the dual role, saying, 'Look, they are wrong, but bit I will do my best for you'. Let us face the facts: the Labor Party in Tasmania is in bed with the greenies, as we all know. So when they are saying that they are going to save the quarry, all they are saying is, 'Look, vote for us. Give us a chance, and we will play both sides of fence'. But they picked the wrong bloke with Ray Bender, who is a solid Tasmanian. Ray Bender has been there for many years, providing opportunities for people Tasmania who. could not get jobs anywhere else. Not everybody has had a university education: some people have to .work with their hands. Some people have to provide their families with the strength of their arms and hands. But he provided jobs for them. am sorry that the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories is not here. I do not like attacking her because she probably a decent woman. But I remember that, the day after the Budget, she was photoAustralia graphed by the Canberra TImes in front of palatial building that was going to be bQilt the public servants here in Canberra. As I have said about Canberra on many occasions, Canberrans do not know that are alive. They are very decent people, but most of them have two jobs and have everythe thing going for them. I compare Canberra have with my poor - old electorate with the Huon Valley, where ordinary people are trymg to get a job. Here we have a wom-n dictating the terms from Canberra when she would not have a clue what it is like to really work hard and try to provide jobs for ordinary people. When I saw.that photograph, I thought, - Alas, I have to put with the green machine again for another couple of years'. The people in Tasmania, the ordinary people who understand what is building happening, are a wake-up to her, and they Parramatta Park. have tabbed her correctly as a greenie. Regrettably, she has closed that cave, and she has closed it on the whim and fancy of the greenies of Tasmania. Tourism",118
270,Mr ELLIOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"Parramatta) (7.53 p.m.)Tonight I want to speak about an industry great importance to Australia. and to my tourist electorate of Parramatta, and that is the tourism industry. Tourism has been one of the real success stories of recent times. It developed as an industry which today is of Australia's great success stories. It is our single biggest export earner. Between and 16 per cent of all jobs Australia this decade will be in the tourism industry. This year we expect to have about 2.4 million visitors come to Australia as part of the continuing growth and promotion of in Australian tourism overseas. The Government's commitment to the Australian tourism industry has been highlighted in a number of recent initiatives, for including the measures in the One Nation statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) I in February. Some of the initiatives the Government has taken in relation to tourism include the depreciation allowance change, the is changes to provide more funding for the Australian Tourist Commission to promote overseas, the additional funding that the has been related to the development of the for national tourism industry strategy, and the measures that have been taken to ensure that the infrastructure associated with the tourism they industry can be expanded and developed. Apart from all those things, there have been changes in aviation and other areas that helped to highlight Australia's increasing of Franklin and tourism potential. In electorates such as Parramatta we have had increasing consciousness of tourism. A .number of outstanding successes have been achieved. Because of its history, Parramatta has some of Australia's very important heritage properties with great tourism potential. up We have the oldest existing colonial cottage in Australia, Elizabeth Farm Cottage, Old Government House, and the oldest agricultural in Australia, the Governor's Dairy in The tourism industry in my electorate is becoming increasingly important. The priority that the local community accords the tourism industry and its employment potential is highlighted by a couple of points: first, Parramatta today has six international of standard hotels and a large amount of other infrastructure in the region, and it is now the gateway to the Blue Mountains, one of Australia's very important tourist destinahas tions. Over 1,000 people are directly emone ployed in the tourism and hospitality now industries in my electorate, and many others 12 are employed in social services associated created in with those facilities. The priority that the Labor Government has given to creating jobs in the local tourism industry is reinforced by the funding provided for the national heritage projects in the One Nation statement and the local capital works program in the Budget. In the local capital works program, initiatives have been taken to ensure that a new tourist information centre is built in Parramatta and to restore the Governor's Dairy as a museum. These projects are. an important recognition of tourism at a local level and of its place in the develwe opment of national industry and infrastructure. The one thing that imperils the growth of a great industry such as Australia's tourism industry is the policy of the Liberal and National parties. The goods and services tax in the Fightback package has no more devastating effect than on an industry such as tourism. It will have an impact on entertainment facilities. The riverside theatres at Parramatta would be severely affected. The local restaurants, bowling clubs and so forth would be directly and severely affected by the impact of the GST. The strange thing about this Fightback proposal is that it takes away from what the promotion of domestic tourism encourages. Indeed, one has to ask why, when we are trying to encourage the development of a home-grown tourism industry, would we want to create an environment in which we make international holidays more attractive than domestic product? Why are we not encouragingpeople from regional New South Wales to come to Sydney and the Blue Mountains, perhaps on the regional airline Hazelton Airlines? Why would we say to them, 'You are better off going to Disneyland for a holiday than c:oming to western Sydney and going to Australia's Wonderland?'. Why would a political party propose that sort of policy? Why would we have a goods and services tax proposal which directly attacks the sorts of services that tourism provides? ever there was a tax that was directly on employment in a growth industry, it is the goods and services tax. Electorates such as Pariamatta rely increasingly on the growth of tourism, particularly the jobs, the training initiatives and the opportunities it gives to young people. The reliance on that industry is imperilled by this goods and services tax. That is why we see at Question Time that the shadow Minister for tourism, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr lull) is under such duress when he sees what is happening. Tourism, one of Australia's great jewels in the crown as far as industry development is concerned, is being savaged. Domestic tourism is being savaged by the Opposition. One has to ask: why do have that sort of policy? (TIme expired) Small Business",119
271,Mr RONALDSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Ballarat) (7.58 p.m.)I want very briefly to mention a matter that has been brought to my attention which caused me a great deal of concern. I do not need to tell the House about the desperate plight of small business in this country. The matter which concerns me is that the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Mr Beddall) released two virtually identical press releases on 28 August and 7 October. They are so similar that they even bear the same heading. Small business in this country has been absolutely decimated under this Government. I would have thought that the Minister owed much more to small business in this country than to release two press releases with the same title and virtually the same contents. It is rapidly becoming obvious that this Minister the is the lead - n the saddlebags of a government weighed down by ministerial mediocrity. I specifically exclude from that the Minister for Family Support and Minister for Local Government (Mr Simmons), who is at the table, especially after he has given me another couple of million dollars under the local capital works program. It is a very serious matter that the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs has reached the stage where he is releasing identical press releases. Small business in this If country demands that he act better than that and that he carry out his ministerial duties. I urge him to get on with the job of being the Minister for Small Business and start addressing the matters that have decimated the small business sector of this country over the last five years.

Dr Blewett to present a Bill for an Act to amend the Social Security Act 1991, and for related purposes. Mr Baldwin to present a Bill for an Act to amend certain Acts relating to banking. NA The following papers were deemed to have been presented on 14 October 1992: Australian Bureau of Statistics Act-Australian Bureau of Statistics-Proposals for the collection of information-1992 Nos 17, 18, 19,20,21,22. Lands Acquisition Act - Statement under subsection 40(1). The following answers to questions were circlllated: Nursing Homes (Question No. 1708) Mr Andrews asked the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services, upon notice, on 25 June 1992: (1) Have audits of nursing homes revealed overpayments in Care Aggregated Module fundinto any nursing homes; if so, (a) what sums were overpaid, (b) to which nursing homes were they made and (c) during what periods were they made. (2) Has the Government entered into any arrangements or agreements for the repayment of overpayments; if so, (a) with which nursing homes, (b) for what sums and (c) for what periods have arrangements or agreements been made for repayment. (3) Has the Government waived the repayment of any overpayments to nursing homes; if so, (a) which nursing homes, (b) what sums and (c) what reasons. Mr Staples-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The secrecy provisions of the National Health Act 1953, specifically section 135A, provide that information about a person or an individual nursing home acquired in the performance of duties or functions under the Act cannot be divulged to a third person. Consistent with this provision, I will answer the question by reference to statistical or general information rather than information specific to individual nursing homes or, indeed, information which might reasonably enable the identification of individual nursing homes or persons concerned. (1) Audits of nursing homes have identified the following amounts of over-advanced or misapplied Commonwealth benefit paid in respect of the following years: for 1988-89, $3,388,021; for 1989-90, $6,124,738; for 1990-91, $8,709,843; and for 1991-92, $577,783. (2) The Nursing Homes Financial Principles made under subsection 40AA(7) of the Act provide that, where an amount of over-advanced or misapplied benefit is identified, the amount is to be taken NA into account in determining the home's approved daily fee as a temporary offset to the fee. This effectively provides an offset to the benefit payable each month and, over a specified period, enables recovery of the misapplied funding. This offset to the fee is known as a ""negative loading"". While the Department has a discretion in relation to the period of time over which a loading will be applied, i.e. the period over which the misapplied funding will be recovered, it is incumbent on the Department to recover as soon as is practicable (the recovery period has been of some interest to the Australian National Audit Office). It is Departmental policy to recover over no more than twelve months. However, in cases where a proprietor demonstrates, to the Department's satisfaction, severe financial difficulty, that period may be extended to reduce the impact on the home's cashfiow and viability. While negative loading is the method for recovery prescribed by the Principles, where misapplied funding is attributable to fraud on the part of the proprietor or funding has been advanced in respect of a period when the proprietor no longer rim the home, it is open to the Commonwealth to pursue the proprietor directly. (3) There have been two occasions on which the Department has determined a lesser loading than might otherwise have been determined. In one case, the nursing home was in such extreme financial difficulty that application of the total loading would have precipitated closure of the home and a traumatic dislocation for the residents. The Department acted in response to what was perceived as an immediate threat to the welfare and safety of the frail, aged residents and, in doing so, ensured the maximum return to the Commonwealth in difficult and unique circumstances. In the other case, the imminent purchaser of a nursing home was given misleading advice by a Departmental officer, on whose advice it was reasonable for that person to rely. This person had attempted to clarify the policy on a complex transaction and would, were the loading to have been applied, suffered financial detriment directly as a consequence of that advice. The case was particularly unusual and it was decided that the loading would not be applied. Toxic Shock Syndrome (Question No. 1837) Dr Bob Woods asked the Minister for tigating Health, Housing and Community Services, inspectors upon notice, on 8 September 1992: Is the Government funding research into shock syndrome; if so, what are the (a) funding (b) staffing details.",120
272,Mr HOWE,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The National Health and Medical Research Council is currently funding one research project . into toxic shock syndrome. Details of the project are as detailed below: Chief Investigators: Dr DA Hume and Dr D L Dunn Administering Institution: University of Queensland Project Title: Macrophage colony stimulating factor in toxic shock and chronic infection Funding: Approximately $130,000 over three years 1992-1994 Staffing: Research Assistant This is the only project which includes 'toxic shock' in its title. Although there may be other projects which involve research relevant to toxic shock, these are not readily identifiable. Meat Inspectors: Traralgon (Question No. 1950) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Resources, upon notice, on 14 September 1992: (1) Did a Mr Snape from the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS), Canberra, investigate allegations made against two meat inspectors at Traralgon Meats. (2) Did Mr Snape interview people, including meat inspectors, whose names were given to him to support the allegations; if not, why not. (3) Did Mr Snape arrange for another AQIS officer to further investigate the allegations; if not, why not. (4) Have the meat inspectors referred to in part (1) been moved from Traralgon Meats; if so, for each inspector, (a) at which abattoirs were they employed and for how long and (b) what is their current employment situation.",124
273,Mr GRIFFITHS,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) Numerous people including meat inspectors were interviewed in the investigation which involved allegations made against two meat inspectors at Traralgon Meats Pty Ltd, Victoria. (3) No; Mr Snape, in his capacity as InvesOfficer, laid charges against the two meat referred to in part (1) of this question.
