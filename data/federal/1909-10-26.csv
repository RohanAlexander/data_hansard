LETTER-SORTERS' EXAMINATIONS-CLOTH ING CONTRACTS-ELECTRICIANS ' WAGES - CASE OF MR . C. A. BEARD-'ERECTION , OF TELEPHONE LINES , NEW SOUTH WALE S. Mr J. H'. CATTS - Is the Postmaster General yet in a position to give me a reply regarding the complaints about the tests to which applicants for the position of letter-sorters in the General Post Office, Sydney, have been asked to submit themselves? I brought .the matter under his notice a month or six weeks ago.",14
1,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"The matter was brought under my notice when I visited Sydney. I consulted the Deputy Postmaster General of the State, the Secretary of the Department, and the Public Service Commissioner, regarding it, all of whom advised me that the tests applied are directed to the ascertainment of whether candidates are generally efficient for the work of sorting.. The object of the suggestions submitted by the honourable member was to limit the tests to a small portion of a letter sorter's duties. To that the Public Service Commissioner and the Departmental officers object. They say that the tests must be sufficiently general to guarantee efficiency.",14
2,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"It was stated in yesterday's Herald that the clothing contractors to the Department of the Postmaster-General view with considerable anxiety the statements made in favour of the establishment of a Commonwealth Government clothing factory. A Sydney official has ventured on the assertion that a saving of i o per cent, would be made on the cost of uniforms if a Government factory did the work. I do not wish to comment upon that statement, but I think it may be correct. in question, however, says that the statement is unfounded, and has quoted figures to show that it is cheaper for the Government to get the uniforms from private manufacturers. I wish to know whether it has stated what it saves by applying the task system instead of paying the piecework log. Does the Postmaster-General know that more than 50 per cent, is saved in that way ?",15
3,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,I am not aware of anything of the kind. I know that manufacturers who supply clothing to the order as listed. Department under contract have to comply with the usual conditions respecting wages.,15
4,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"I understand that .£1,900 is to be paid for the rewiring the General Post Office, Melbourne. Inasthe much as ios. a day is the union rate of wages for outside electricians, I wish -""know if the work will be done at that rate? ",15
5,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"I believe that the work will be done by day labour, as it quires particular qualifications. If it is in Australia. done under contract, it will be stipulated that the minimum rates of wages for skilled labour of this class shall be paid. On Wednesday last the honourable member for Riverina asked the following questions:1. Will he please state how many days ist January, 1908, to 31st December, 1908, and made here? from ist January, 1909, to 30th June, 1909, did Mr C. A. Beard, the; officer classified mail driver, salary ,£110 per annum, perform the duties of mail driver. See Commonwealth Gazette, No. 7, 2nd February, 1909, page <No. 27)? 2. If the officer referred to was not performing the duties of mail driver, what duties was he performing, io what branch, and in what loom of such branch? I promised - that inquiries would be made, and the Deputy Postmaster-General, Sydney, has now furnished the following replies : 1. Mr Beard did not perform the duties of mail driver during the periods mentioned. 2. The officer in question was engaged in sorting in the Despatch Koom of the Mail Branch, to provide for an emergency, he having passed the sorting test, and signified his willingness to prove his fitness. The necessity for obtaining the authority of the Public Service Inspector after a lapse of three months was inadvertently overlooked. On Thursday last the honourable member for Cowper asked the following, questions':1. Whether the preliminary action regarding the inviting and acceptance of tenders taken in The firm 33 out of the 77 telephone lines approved for erection in New South Wales during 1909-10, referred to in his answer to question No. a of 13th October, embraces any such lines in the electorate of Cowper? 2. When is it intended to proceed with the erection of otlier lines similarly approved? I promised that inquiries would be made, and the Deputy Postrr.aster-General, Sydney, has now furnished the following information : 1. Yes, one-Bloxland s Flat to Nymboida. 2. No specific date can be given as to when any particular work will be proceeded with. the Works will be carried out as far as possible in DEFENCE DEPARTMENT. SUPPLY' OF BAYONETS-CADE T UNIFORMS.",15
6,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,"Will the Minister of of Defence, before giving an ordei for supply of bayonets, call for tenders for their manufacture in Australia ? I am adto. vised that they can be made here.",15
7,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"We hope to be able to make bayonets at the proposed Small Arms and Ammunition Factory, but I ream informed that they cannot yet be made",15
8,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,I have seen a man who says that they can be made here.,15
9,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"Will the Minister, before ordering a supply of bayonets, invite tenders for bayonets manufactured in Ausfrom tralia, to determine' whether they can be",15
10,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"A supply of ns bayonets has been ordered, but the order was not sent until a report had been made 70 that it would not be possible to obtain bayonets here.",15
11,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"Will the Minister state whether, in view of the Tecent campaigns in Manchuria and South Africa, it is now the opinion of military experts that bayonets are a necessity in modern warfare?",15
12,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I am afraid that bayonets are still necessary, notwith. standing the experience of those campaigns.",16
13,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"When discussing the Defence Bill I suggested to the Minister that the junior cadets should be allowed to wear uniforms if provided by their parents. He explained his objection to that arrangement, of which I saw the force, but added that he would consider the advisability of providing the cadets with caps or belts. I suggest that they might be supplied with hat or cap ribbons with a crown upon them, such as are worn 'by men-of-warsmen, and also with belts. I am told that this will not cost more than is. for each cadet. The wearing of caps and belts would distinguish them as having been accepted by the Government as junior cadets.",16
14,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I am very much inclined to do what the honourable member suggests. I quite see the force of having a distinctive badge for the junior cadets, and, il. it can be managed, it will be done. ATTENDANCE OF MEMBERS. . Mr JOHNSON - Would it be possible to dispense with questions without notice, in view of the extremely favourable opportunity now afforded to the Government to get on with business in the absence of the Opposition ? MINISTERS laid on the table the lowing papers :Preferential Trade-Deputatio n from the Seventh Congress of the Chambers of Comday merce of the Empire to the Minister for Trade and Customs, 4th October, 1909-Repor t ol Proceedings. Ordered (on motion by Mr KNOX) be printed. Lands Acquisition Act-Lan d acquired under, at Port Melbourne, Victoria-As an Addition the Post Office Site. BUSINESS OF THE SESSION. Mr J, H. CATTS - As there are still twenty-one Bills on the notice-pa per, it will be impossible to get through them all before the session ends, will the Prime Minister pick out those which are urgent, - .and which he desires to have pushed through, so that honourable members may have an opportunity to devote themselves to the serious consideration of these necessary measures, with a view to ending the session on a date which will give them time to get back to their homes a few days before Christmas ?",16
15,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I shall be very glad if the honourable member will communicate his anxiety to deal with as many Bills as possible to the largest number of honourable members. If he looks at the list, he will find that quite a number of the measures contained in it have already passed the Senate, while some are consolidating Bills, which require consideration only in their technical aspects. I should be very sorry to surrender my hope of passing all the measures on the business-paper without imposing an undue strain 011 the House. DEFENCE BILL. In Committee (Consideration resumed from 22nd October, vide page 4954): Motion (by Mr KELLY) again proposed - That the following proposed new section be inserted- "" 153. Militia officers, who have passed the prescribed course at the Military College, shall take seniority over other officers of similar rank in the Commonwealth Militia Forces who have not passed the said course.""",16
16,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Wentworth) [3.13] - In view of the amendment which the Government succeeded in effecting in proposed new section 152, by striking out the proviso, it seems necessary to propose a further amendment in the new section now before the Committee, in order to make it workPAPERS. able. I beg, therefore, to submit the profolposed new section with the following proviso :Provided that seniority shall date from the subsequent to the creation of the Military College upon which officers have lodged their applications for the said Military College course. Without some such provision, difficulties to might arise. It might become impossible in the working of the Department to allow men to take the Military College course into the order of their applications, and a man whose application was in first, but heard last would, under the new section as first proposed, be penalized. My object in proposing it was really to encourage men and to take advantage as early as possible of the superior education to be afforded, but I am afraid that it would be fraught with difficulties unless some such amendment as I suggest be inserted. I know that the Minister is not prepared to accept the new section at all, but if he will agree to my amendment we can then take a vote oni the section itself. With the amendment, there can be no objection to it, unless, of course, honourable members are not prepared to interfere at all with the existing state of affairs among militiai ofBcers. The attack which has been made upon honourable members who have sought to improve the education of our officers is one of the finest possible arguments for the necessity for some such change as we now propose to make. We are charged with desiring to victimize honest persons, and to hit persons who are not named. I was asked in the leading columns of the Argus this morning to quote the names of officers who I thought were inefficient. I could imagine no more indecent action for any honourable member to take on the floor of the House tharTto adopt that suggestion. I cannot understand the reason for all this excitement regarding the alleged injustice done to existing military officers by asking them to prove their fitness. I ' trust to the loyalty and efficiency of those officers, so soon as opportunities are afforded to themi, to make them not only ready, but anxious, to prove, and capable of proving, their practical fitness in the way that we wish to see their fitness tested. However, it is of no use to discuss these questions now. This red herring has been drawn across the track. We are made to appear as if we are making an onslaught upon existing officers, instead of doing what we are bound to do-to consider first, last, and always the efficiency of the Forces with whose control we are primarily charged, and the safety of the country which we all hold dear.",16
17,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"ParramattaMinister of Defence) [3.18] - The honourable member for Wentworth has said a great deal about the efficiency of the Forces. My point is, that to begin by perpetrating an injustice is the wrong way to secure that efficiency.",17
18,Mr KELLY,Unknown,What is the injustice?,17
19,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The injustice is that the honourable member calmly proposes that any militia officer who has passed for lieutenant-colonel at the Military College may become the senior colonel of the Forces. That, I think, is a gross and grave injustice. I can conceive of no greater injustice to the senior officers of the Forces, who are at present fit and capable, than to require them to begin again by the process of examination to prove their fitness to command. Put' in a nut shell,. that is the position which I take up. May I remind my honourable friend that his proposal would subject militia officers to tests to which he does not propose to subject our permanent officers.",17
20,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Then let us make my proposal applicable to all of them?,17
21,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I hope that we shall not do so in the interests of the efficiency of the Forces. In his amendment my honourable friendsays plainly that our militia officers are unfit, and that until they prove their fitness they shall be liable to be superseded by officers who have been privileged to attend the Military College. That is the assumption underlying his proposal.",17
22,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"How can they possibly be fit, seeing that they have had only sixteen days' training during the year?",17
23,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I do not wish to discuss that point, which I submit is quite irrelevant. My own intention is to persevere, as best I can, with a view to establishing a higher standard of efficiency for our officers by providing them with all the educational facilities which it is possible to provide. I have already taken steps with that end in view, and I am not prepared to subject all the seniorofficers of the Forces to an examination in order that they may demonstrate their fitness for the commands which they hold. If I did so, I should expect to receive their resignations-no t because they are unfit-bu t because they are fit, and would have been told by this proposal that they were unfit.",17
24,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,Hindmarsh) [3.22]. - I wish to ask the honourable member for Wentworth whether-in view of the exhibition which we had on Friday lasthe thinks it is worthwhile persevering with any amendment unless he has at first ascertained that it commands the approval of the Minister.,17
25,Mr HALL,Unknown,Let us fight to a finish.,17
26,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,We fought to a finish on Friday last.,17
27,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I rise to a' point of order. I desire to know whether this discussion is in order, seeing that the question before the Chair, namely, the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Wentworth, has not yet been stated.",17
28,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"I point out to the honourable member for Lang that the ques^ tion before the Chair .is, "" That the clause, as amended be agreed to . """,17
29,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"On Friday last the honourable member for Wentworth was led to believe by some of his friends that they were in entire sympathy with an amendment which he had submitted. But what happened? The moment that they saw they were in a position to carry it , one honourable member walked out of the - chamber, and another rushed over to support the Government. What kind of legislation can we expect if such tactics are to be adopted? I would suggest to the honourable member for Wentworth that it is idle to submit any amendment unless he has first ascertained that it has the approval of the Minister.",18
30,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,That is sound advice.,18
31,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,I think that this farce ought to be at once ended.,18
32,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,Adelaide) [3.25] - ! am afraid that the indignation of the Minister of Defence is largely assumed.,18
33,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,There is not a tittle of indignation about me.,18
34,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"When the Minister suggests-as he did-that it is the desire of the honourable member for Wentworth to subject militia officers to a test which they cannot pass, to submit them to indignity by inserting in the Bil l an amendment which would call forth their resignations, I feel justified in declaring that his indignation is assumed. When any honourable member desires to improve the Bill , it ill becomes the Minister of. Defence to suggest to our militia officers that if Parliament expresses its opinion upon this question, they should at once hand in their resignations. I have heard nothing more lamentable from the mouth of a responsible Minister during m> Parliamentary career. To deliberately suggest, as the Minister did, that if Parliament dares to express its opinion by inserting the amendment of the honourable member for Wentworth in the Bill , he will receive the resignations of a large number of our militia officers, was distinctly undignified. It is a suggestion which ought not to emanate from any honourable member, much less from the head of the Defence Department. 1 protest against the Minister suggesting to these officers that they should be superior to Parliament, and that if their interests are in any way interfered with, they should at once tender their resignations. Mr. JOSEPH COOK. - What nonsense !",18
35,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"The Minister's uttercircumstances ance was more than nonsense. positively cruel, if not indecent, on his part to suggest to our militia officers that they should protest against Parliament taking any course which might commend itself to it by at once tendering their resignations.",18
36,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I hope that there was no such suggestion.,18
37,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"I see nothing in the amendment to warrant any such suggestion, neither is there one word in it which is calculated to reflect on our militia officers. I quite recognise the valuable work which they have performed in the past-the services which they have rendered without pay during a long series of years-bu t I believe from my own knowledge of a goodly number of them, that they are anxious that, if better men than themselves are forthcoming, those men should be given opportunities for advancement. The opportunities which have hitherto been enjoyed by our militia officers have not been what they ought, and I feel sure that every one of those officers who is worthy, of the rank that he holds would cheerfully undertake to demonstrate his fitness for his position. At the present time every militia! officer is subjected to an examination before he can pass to a higher rank. T h t junior officers are passing examinations",18
38,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,But the proposal under consideration would subject our militia officers to examination after they have attained their present rank.,18
39,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"The Minister must know that there are many officers who have not passed any examination, but^who have attained their rank solely by virtue of influence. They have not been subjected to any test. I repeat that at the present time our militia officers are being subjected to an examination. They have to pass it or stand down, so that the indignation of the Minister is transparently assumed.",18
40,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,But they need not go up for examination.,18
41,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"That is practically the same thing. My experience is that if a junior officer submits himself to examination and emerges from it successfully, his superior officers-if . they have failed to pass a similar test-cheerfull y submit to the inevitable, and place themselves upon the unattached list. They are not ih any way hurt by the situation. On the contrary, they are always prepared-shoul d render the adoption of that It was course necessary-to return to the Forces, and even to accept a lower rank than that which they held previously. I cannot believe that the Minister is satisfied with the present position. The 'only real difference now proposed is that, instead of being put through an examination by the means at present adopted, they shall undergo an examination at a thoroughly impartial, disinterested college. The Minister knows the sense in which I use those words. I fail to understand why there should be any objection to this provision. If we desire to obtain efficiency in connection with our Forces, we must start at the head. It is absurd to have an efficient soldiery of ""non-coms."" and the rank and file if , on the other hand, our officers have not given some proof of theirfitnessto command. The very best regiment or brigade in the world might be led into danger, difficulty, and disaster, merely because the individual at its head had not given any proof of his efficiency. I frankly admit that even the most efficient officer is liable to make takes, but Ave have here an opportunity to minimize the possibility. The Minister, without advancing a reasonable argument in support of his contention, suggests that we ought not to put officers to this test, and that honourable members on this side are desirous of doing injury in some way or other to the officers at present in our Defence Force. I say emphatically, as one of those who favour this proposal, that I would not for a moment lend either my voice or my vote to an attempt to do injury to any officer. On the motion for the second reading of this Bill, I made a well-deserved reference to one of the finest militia officers whom I know in tralia. I honour the militia officers for the work they have done, and desire to see their services, as far as possible, retained. I should like, however, to see some of them put through a practical test of their fitness, and not retained as the Minister knows they are retained",18
42,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,But this provision has nothing to do with that matter.,19
43,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"It practically means that an officer who has held his present position for some years, and is unable to rise above that rank, shall not continue to retain his seniority when there are coming along others who are able to prove their fitness, both in practice and theory, to command.",19
44,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,But this provision means a great deal more than that. The point to which the honourable member refers is already provided for in the Bill.,19
45,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"The honourable gentleman is mistaken. He objected to a proposed new section, which would have provided for it. This provision merely means that where we have, say, two captains, the one senior to the other, if the senior is unable to pass at the Military College, a test, both practical and theoretical, which the junior is able to pass, then the latter shall take the senior position. If the senior man had any love for the Force, and desired that it should be efficiently officered, he would raise no serious opposition to the junior man, who was able to prove his greater efficiency, taking the senior position. I hope that we shall not have a repetition of the cases in which men have been not merely retained, but promoted, when every person in authority knew that they had no right to promotion, and that it miswas unfair to the general efficiency of the regiment under their control that they should be promoted. That is practically the situation which the Minister desires to retain, and, on behalf of the Forces and - the large number of officers who have honoured me with their confidence in this matter, I regret it very much.",19
46,Dr WILSON,Unknown,"Corangamite) [3.35] In view of the fact that the Minister was so unwise as to refuse to accept proposed new section 152, as submitted by the honourable member for Wentworth, and that this provision depends entirely upon it, I think that honourable members must recognise that it could not well be embodied"" Aus- in the Bill. The majority against the adoption of proposed new section 152 in its entirety was certainly very small, but. in the circumstances, I suggest, as one of those who have been supporting all the provisions relating to the establishment of a Military College, that we should allow the question to be put without further discussion.",19
47,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Wentworth) [3.37] - I . think that there is a clear majority against this proposed new section, and, as I do not wish to obstruct business, I ask leave to withdraw the proposed new section. Proposed new section negatived. Motion (by Mr KELLY) agreed toThat the following proposed new section be inserted- "" 154. Officers attending the Military College shall receive such pay and allowances! as may be prescribed.""",19
48,Mr CARR,Unknown,"Macquarie) [3.39] move That the following proposed new section be inserted :- . "" 153A. Applicants for commissions who are required to qualify at the Military College in accordance with section one hundred and fortynine shall submit to a preliminary examination in military work. The successful candidates shall, in the numbers required, and in the order in which they pass, be given a free course at the Military College."" Proposed new section 149, which has been agreed to, provides thatNo officer shall be appointed to, or receive promotion in, the administrative and instructional staff until he has passed, as prescribed, a course at the Military College. That obviously applies to any one desiring to become an officer in our new Defence Forces. I am anxious that the College shall be conducted on the broadest democratic basis possible. It seems to me that it will not be safe to leave the matter to the administration. If candidates are selected haphazard, or as the result of influence or personal friendship, we may not get the best results, and certainly shall not be opening the way-as it ought to be opened in a country such as ours-for many capable men who are qualified to serve as officers to secure training. because I wish to see every safeguard afforded for ability to secure its opportunity, and desire the country to take advantage of the best military capacity that it possesses, that I propose this amendment. We do net wish to leave the selection of candidates to the caprice of any individual or to chance circumstances. Only those who have shown some aptitude, and who, bypreliminary examination and preliminary work have given evidence that it is worthwhile to give them a course at the College, should be received there. I have stipulated that the examination shall be in military work, and that the examinees shall be received in the order in which they pass the examination. That seems to be a perfectly fair and legitimate proposal. Although I am prepared to hear the Minister urge that the matter should be left to the administration, I point out that that will mean leaving it to chance-leavin g it to an individual who may be swayed by influences that should not operate. It is a much wiser course for us who are the direct representatives of the people, to lay down clearly defined lines as to the course to be pursued in admitting candidates. If we allow the Bill to go as it stands, it will contain no provision regulating the admission of candidates, and it will be quite competent for [178] - I the Director or Administrator to fix some arbitrary system, or to select candidates on account of personal friendship, or under pressure of social influence. This may lead to the exclusion of capable young men who are without means or influence. I ' trust that the Minister will give serious consideration to my amendment. It cannot injure the Bill . The Minister himselfhas admitted that it is right inspirit, though he urges that it is unnecessary. I say again, that we cannot afford to leave such a serious matter to the mere caprice of administration. We want to make the way absolutely clear for any young fellow of capacity to enter upon a course of training at the College.",20
49,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Parramatta Minister of Defence) [3.45] - I hope that my honourable friend, the member for Macquarie, will not press the amendment. We have already carried a clause, 154, which provides that officers attending the Military College shall receive such pay and allowances as may be prescribed.",20
50,Mr CARR,Unknown,Officer s are not applicants. The rank and file should be provided for also.,20
51,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The same prinI t is ciple will apply to those who go to the College for their preliminary military education. It may be assumed that one of the first things to be done will be to set up a system of scholarships, which will produce a healthy .competition, making for efficiency, among the examinees. Tbis is a matter for regulation.",20
52,Mr CARR,Unknown,B y this Parliament.,20
53,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"We are merely passing an enabling Act ; and if we are to prescribe everything that is to be done to the end of time, we might as well do away with administration altogether. The more details we put into this Bill , the more we shall tie the hands of the administration. The Committee must understand that Parliament will always have control over the Military College through the medium of the Estimates. Control is by 110 means surrendered by the passing of this Bill. l t will be exercised year by year. I h e matter in question is essentially one for regulation, and' is so regarded in - every part of the world.",20
54,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"Hindmarsh) [3.47]-The matter dealt with in the amendment of the honourable member for Macquarie is not one which should be left for regulation. The Bil l provides that officer-,, while undergoing training at the Military College, shall receive pay and allowances. What the honourable member for Macquarie is concerned about is that privates and non-commissioned officers shall have the same advantages as officers when they are undergoing training. As the Bill stands, pay and allowances might be refused to them. Payment would not commence until a man became a' lieutenant. The Minister has argued that we can exercise control through the Estimates. We could have a discussion on the Estimates; but, as we all know, Parliament can exercise no real control in the direction of the ordering of expenditure. If we were able to place a sum on the Estimates to provide for pay and training of privates and non-commissioned officers who wished to become officers, there might be no necessity for the amendment. But we are unable to do anything of the kind. The honourable member for Macquarie has directed attention to what is virtually an omission from the last clause with which we dealt. It should have made provision for ""applicants and officers."" But, as we have passed the clause without making such provision, we should now make sure that privates and non-commissioned officers will receive precisely the same treatment as those who have attained the rank of lieutenant. Mr CARR _ (Macquarie) [3.50] - The Minister has given me just the characteristic reply I anticipated from him, and it was as contradictory as usual. He first of all admitted that what I propose to provide for would no doubt be carried out in the administration of the Act, and he then proceeded to say that to embody such a provision in the Act would be to tie the hands of the administration. If Archer, E. W. those charged with .the management of Atkinson, L . the Military College will naturally follow Brown, Tilley the course I suggest, how can it be said Cook, Joseph that we shall tie the hands of the adDeakin, ministration if we make provision for that Fairbairn, Gcourse in this Bill? The Minister also Forrest, Sir John said that if my amendment were agreed Foster, Richard to we might just as well prescribe all Glynn, Fuller, G. W. kinds of details of administration in 'the Groom, F. neasure. But I draw a very distinct line Harper, R. between prescribing details of administraHedges, W. N . tion and the laying down of the broad lines Irvine, Hans on which the Military College shall be conducted. It would, for instance, be absurd to prescribe the use of certain text books in the college or to frame a curriculum, Wilks, W. H . but we shall be on absolutely safe lines in laying down such a democratic principle as I propose. We shall not be interfering in any way with the proper administration of l"".e Defence Act if we say that the selecI Mr. tion of applicants for commissions - shall be made from those who have passed the preliminary examination required, and in the order in which they have passed. If there is anything in the great principle of equality of opportunity that is the course which should be followed, and its adoption could only do good, and could do no possible harm. The Minister admits that, but contradicts himself immediately by saying that to provide for the adoption of that course would be .to hamper the administration. I wish to provide that the Director of the College shall have no choice in this matter, *and shall be given no opportunity to show favour to any one.

HUGHES (West Sydney) [3-59J-intend to submit a new section which should naturally follow the new sections providing for the establishment of a M i l tary College. I move That the following proposed new section inserted :"" A special school of instruction shall lished at the Military College for the training of an instructional staff of non-commismit sioned officers, and all future appointments persons to act as instructors shall be made amongst those who have at the close of a years' course satisfied the Director or some person duly appointed by him that they are competent. Provided that persons who have acted as structors in the British Army or those having served in the British Army, satisfy Director that they have the necessary qualifications may be appointed without passing through such course."" Since the Minister has agreed to the inhave sertion of a provision for the establishment of a Military College, he ought to agree to the insertion of this clause, that deals with a matter which, in my opinion, is even more important than the training officers. As he knows very well, the trainwill ing of soldiers is, after all, wholly in hands of the instructors. It was pointed out, during the second-reading debate, the honourable member for Adelaide, and, at a later stage, by the honourable member for Maranoa, that the men who are apsame pointed to drill the territorial troops England are .those who have passed through the regular army and are of, at get least, seven years' standing. I feel quite satisfied in my own mind that we shall not be able to get a staff sufficiently numerous and competent to deal with immense increase in the strength of our Forces unless we have men who have be gone through a course. In the case of education, it has been found expedient many years to teach the staff before setting them to teach others. For many years in this country, and in England, it was the practice to set teachers to work before they had been taught to teach children. was found, as it might have been found at the very beginning, to be the wrong method of procedure; and a teacher now goes through a course before he is intrusted with the teaching of children. That is, I this Avaythink, equally necessary in the case of training soldiers. Competence is more rethe quired in this case because of the period for which the men will be up for instruction. Everything will have to be done in the most up-to-date effective fashion; and, in order to attain our object, we must have trained men. We must not merely pick the brightest the trainees, call them corporals or ser- - is used. [ l 8 ] -2 7 geants, and expect to get from them an i - effective result. I trust that the Minister will accept my proposal, since it merely be makes provision in the Bill for that which he himself declares he is providing for be estabon the Estimates. We ought not to perthis matter to depend upon the vagaries of of different Ministers. On the contrary, from there should be a fixed and immutable rule, two and men who are not thoroughly competent should not be intrusted with the instruction inof our citizen soldiery. I submit that a who, man cannot be made a thoroughly comthe petent trainer of others inside two years. He ought to receive the best training at the hands of other men, and, of course, to every opportunity to exercise his growing abilities on the troops. We ought not to place our trainees under the direction of men who are not thoroughly competent. I trust that the Committee will approve of of my amendment. If honourable members look at the excellent proposals which the are due to the honourable member for Wentworth for the establishment of a Military by College, they will see very clearly that there is created the machinery by which my proposal can be carried out with the staff, so far as direction is conin cerned, and at the expenditure of no more money. It will be very much better to all dealt with in the one Bill than that one matter should be dealt with in the Bil l and another on the Estimates. Naturally, Ave shall expect to come out of the the Military College men Avho have ' been moulded by the one system. It would not a good thing to have officers trained in one Avay and the non-commissioned officers for in another Avay. They should all be subject to the moulding influence of one supreme head, who Would have an idea of Avhat was Avanted, and set about producing in the most effective Avay the desired result That in the necessary number.",20

63,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"North Sydney) [4.12] - We have already agreed to certain provisions which, we were assured, were sufficient and desirable, but now, in regard to at least one of them, exception is taken by some of those who supported them and a new proposal is made. I do not object to the proposal, but the position into which we have got is a very undesirable one. . The Minister stated originally that he was willing to accept a mandatory provision regarding the establishment of a military college. That provision having been agreed to, further provisions were moved which did not attempt to deal with all the necessities of case. We were asked to make a partial provision for a military college, although the Minister has told us that he is not yet aware, notwithstanding that officers have been specially appointed to draw up a scheme, what course it is desirable to follow. We are deciding important matters of detail in anticipation of information which we should have. We are making a one-sided provision, and this we should not do. The Minister should ascertain what is necessary in the'circumstances of Australia. Without guidance of this sort I am very chary about supporting these proposals. I do not oppose them on their own account, but I am doubtful of the wisdom pf agreeing to them without the statement from the Minister, or, through him, in our circumstances, from his officers, that they are desirable at the present time: They may clash with other provisions which it may be necessary to make when a fuller inquiry has taken place. We now discover that one proposal of the honourable member for Wentworth was insufficient, and it may be that the others will also prove insufficient, or, perhaps, antagonistic to what must be provided for later.",23
64,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Wentworth) [4.15] - I cannot understand the attitude of the honourable member for North Sydney. If it were pushed to its logical conclusion no honourable member would dare to move an amendment until the permission of the Minister in charge of the measure under discussion had been obtained. The other night he flagellated most unmercifully a number of those who take an interest in the subject of defence, notwithstanding that he has shown an interest in quite a number of matters himself. His attempt to demonstrate that we are proceeding unreasonably was without good ground. Although I myself thought that the term ""officer"" would cover a non-commissioned officer, what I and the Committee have been principally concerned about is providing for the training of officers. The complementary suggestion of the honourable member for West Sydney for the training of non-commissioned officers is most valuable. Honourable members have a right to propose amendments.",23
65,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,And others to ask for more information.,23
66,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Exactly , but surely a Committee is not ipso .facto to refuse to make amendments because the Minister the has no information to give. Under the system which the honourable member for North Sydney thinks should prevail, a Minister who wished to prevent the amendment of his Bill would simply declare that he had no information to give, in which case those who agree with the view of the honourable member for North Sydney would vote against all new proposals, and would defeat them, were they numerically strong enough to do so.",23
67,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"ParramattaMinister of Defence) [4.18] - I have spoken to the honourable member for West Sydney, and he agrees to amend the proposed new section by leaving out the words "" at the Military College,"" and by substituting a "" prescribed "" course for a ""two years' "" course.

71,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"North treatment Sydney) [4.22] - I wish to say a few words in reply to the honourable member for Wentworth, in support of what I have already pointed out. I said that we were asked to make very important amendments in the Bill without, as the Minister formed us, sufficient inquiry having made by him as to whether some of the proposals at any rate would be found justifiable; yet the honourable member for Wentworth, who moved these important should amendments, to the main one of which am not at all opposed, now says knowledge of military matters was not sufficient to inform him whether the word '' officers '' did not include non-commissioned officers. ",24
72,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I should get preference? think so, but the honourable member for Wentworth said that he did not. I ' am going to reflect upon that ignorance, but wish simply to point out what moved us to action.

Honourable members tests, will no doubt remember that some two years ago I brought before the House the case of a man who had been in charge of methe naval launch running from Williamstown all over the Bay, and applied for a position in charge of the Customs launch. No man had stronger recommendations for such a position than he had, and he felt that he would get it, as did the officer commanding the Naval Forces. He had excellent recommendations, and was willing to undergo a practical test as to his fitness. Being in the forces, he was confident that he would receive the same fair as would be given to an outsider, but unfortunately he found that his trust in the Department was misplaced. His only disqualification was that he was in the Naval Forces of the Commonwealth. The Public Service Commissioner could innot entertain his application on that been ground. Even the honourable member for Indi with all his Conservative ideas would, I feel sure, agree that a man who has given faithful service to the Commonwealth get, if not preference, at any rate I an equal run for his money when he that his applies for a position.",24

But the Public Service Commissioner said, "" You are part of the military organization, and are out the side the Commonwealth Public Service. the Consequently, you are not eligible to recontrol ceive the appointment."" As a result, a broken down saddler was selected to the office, the duties of which this very individual had been faithfully dischargvinced ing. The naval officer to whom I already alluded was disqualified similar ground; and in that case a man who had been employed in pulling a ferry boat across the Yarra was appointed to the vacant position.

When the Australian Contingents were being despatched to South Africa, the members of them were assured Branch that, upon their return, they would not only be honored, but would be given emdestroying ployment, wherever opportunity offered, the Public Service of the States.",25
77,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"But the State Governments did not keep their promise in that connection.  the case placed in my hands contains the following:.Tliese positions could be filled by trained men from the various .branches of the forces, particularly the Permanent Forces, where a thorough knowledge of the work is obtained. sent such appointments are unobtainable by the . soldier, the Commonwealth Public Service Act debarring him from' appointment. as they now stand are for public servants only.

The reports of the War Office (Reconstruction)' Committee, 1904, of which Sir George the Sydenham Clarke was a member, are very in their denunciation of the employment of civilians in the Military Forces.. the The following are a few extracts from The sporadic growths .of small financial' branches at the Head-quarters of three of Army Corps accentuate rather than diminish centralization in the War Office of civilian, over military policy and administration. We have made proposals for dealing with thisserious evil, which lies at the root of military fill inefficiency. To these proposals, we attach vital importance, and we are finally conthat no internal reform of War Officeorganization can be permanent and effective have which is not based upon a sound system of upon a decentralization. We desire to repeat that the criticism of military policy by civilians, whose functions should be limited to examination of estimated cost and expenditure,, has become a habit, incurable unknow less drastic reforms are applied. And further, the War Office papers teem with minutes proving that the clerks of the Finance freely express opinions on matters of military policy. This, which is a natural result of a dominant theory, has the effect of the responsibility of the military in heads ""of the War Office, of confusing the administration, and of delaying action. While the present system of financial control is futile in peace it is ruinous in war. Officers unaccustomed to bear any financial responsibility, and - ruled by' excessively complexregulations, cannot at once improvise a system for the control of expenditure in the field, when the restraints are suddenly removed. The result, as in South Africa, is ""the waste of millions. ' - The responsibility of the military heads has been rendered nominal, except in time of war, when the Finance Branch is effaced as a conAt pre- trolling power. The Secretary of State has been led to give The posi- decisions upon a partial presentment of a cases. The members of the Finance Branch, not contenting themselves with purely financial criticism and the framing df estimates, have acquired the habit of freely expressing their 'Opinions on questions of military policy. Thus, one principal clerk may convey, over his own signature, an implied censure to the 'General Officer Commanding an Army Corps, while another may copiously minute, in an adverse sense, papers, on which a military head of the War Office has expressed his opinion. Such conditions appear to us intolerable, and they f u l ly account for the administrative inefficiency of the War Office. I do not desire that the members of our Military Porces should have any claim whatever upon vacancies which may arise in the Defence Department, unless their qualifications are equal to those which are possessed by outside applicants. No proposal could be fairer than that. When the' honourable member for Richmond was Minister of Defence, he promised a deputation which waited upon him that he would insert some such provision in his Defence Bill ; and, from the tone of the House at the time, I am satisfied that his action would have met with unanimous endorsement",25

80,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Parramatta-Minister of Defence) [4.40] - I am entirely with the honourable member so far as the principle underlying the amendment is concerned. Many anomalies exist at present in consequence of the fact that about one-half of the clerical staff of the Defence Department are under the Public Service Commissioner, while the military authorities control the remainder. For instance, the Department has nothing to do with officers of the District Pay Staff; they are all under the Public Service Commissioner. There is no possibility of passing from the one service to the other, and this system is working very detrimentally to the Military Forces. Only a few days ago we advertised for applications for the position of, I think, military surveyor and supervisor of works in New South Wales. There is an officer there doing military survey work in connection with the Department of Home Affairs, and I could not conceive of a better or more competent man-for our purpose. If he stepped from the Department of Home Affairs to the Defence Department, however, he would sacrifice all his public rights and opportunities for promotion under the Public Service Act He could not be taken back, and would lose all chances of promotion. That is certainly anomalous and wrong. The system be no seems to affect the efficiency of the military,- as well as the Public Service; but what to do exactly I do not know. I suggest to the honourable member for Maranoa that he withdraw his amendment on my definite assurance that I will go into the whole matter with the Public Service Commissioner, and, if necessary, bring forward special legislation to meet the situation.

I agree with the honourable member for Maranoa that they should have the preference, but to pass this proposed new clause might be to create further complications without achieving the object which my honourable friend has in view. I suggest to him that he allow the matter to remain in abeyance for the present, and I will have it thoroughly gone into, with a - view of ascertaining whether we cannot do what he desires, and which I thoroughly favour.  prepared to accept the Minister's suggestion, as I recognise that he shares my view of the situation.",26

101,Mr HALL,Unknown,"Thos e who entertain such objections, might very well be permitted to give to the country other services which both in times of peace and of war would be equally valuable.",28
102,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"If the service prescribed under the honourable member's proposed new section were equally onerous, the number of non-combatants would not be increased.",28
103,Mr HALL,Unknown,"I think not. The history of warfare has shown that the ravages of disease have carried off more people - than have bullets. More soldiers die during campaigns from diseases, not only unpreventable, but preventable, than are killed on the field. I hold in my hand a valuable little book called The Real Triumph of Japan, which demonstrates how it was that Japan attained her teal triumph in her war with Russia, by triumphing over the - diseases which usually play such havoc with armies. The writer saysLongmore's Tables, which are accepted as the most reliable statistics of war, and which are based on the records of battles for the past two hundred years, show that there rarely has been a conflict of any great duration in which nt least four men have not perished from disease to every one from bullets. Uusso-Turkish war eight thousand died from - disease and twenty thousand from wounds. - is asserted on emiment French authority that in six months of the Crimean campaign the Allied Forces lost f if ty thousand from disease and two thousand from bullets. Further on, the writer savsIn the French campaign in Madagascar in 1804 fourteen thousand men were sent to the front, of whom twenty-nine were killed. in action and seven thousand perished from preventable disease. In the Boer war in South Africa the English losses from disease were simply f r i g h t f u l , greater even than our civil war record. But the crowning piece of imbecility was reserved for our war with Spain, where in 1898, fourteen were heedlessly sacrificed to ignorance and incompetency for every one who died on the firing line or from battle casualties. That, too, in a war, the chief campaign of which lasted only six weeks. So that the Americans succeeded, in a campaign lasting only a few weeks, in losing fourteen soldiers by disease for every one killed in the firing line. Mv proposal means that those people who do not care to take part in the work o i preparing to kill folks, shall have the opportunity of fitting themselves to cure people and to prevent disease. There is, I believe, a new hemisphere awaiting discovery in this direction in connection with military enterprise. I had originally purposed to submit a schedule to the Bill , to specify, the classes of work or kind of examination to be provided for non-combatants who desired to evade military service. I admit, at once, that if any man, by merely declaring that he had conscientious objections to passing the prescribed examination, could evade military service, the effect would be to do away with compulsory service altogether. But I propose an equally onerous class of service-that the time that would be occupied in passing the military examinations during the six years that a young man is expected to put in, as a senior cadet, and a citizen soldier, shall be spent in passing examinations in sanitation, military hygiene, and first-aid. The history of the Avar between Japan and Russia shows what an enormous amount of care was taken by the Japanese to insure the health of their troops. It is a fact that, in the Japanese Army, there were a number of men whose duty it was to go ahead of the troops and make preparations for insuring their health. Whenever they came to a pool of water, they examined it and determined whether it was fit to drink. If it was not fit for consumption, they ascertained what steps would be necessary to make it so. When the Japanese soldiers came up, they saw a In the notice at each pool telling them whether the v/ater therein was fit to drink, and how it It was to be treated if unwholesome. The consequence of these precautions was that the Japanese succeeded in so reversing the percentage of deaths from preventable diseases occurring in other armies, that, although British and American Armies have lost three men from disease for every one killed by bullets, the Japanese lost only one from disease for every three killed by bullets. Under this amendment, it would be possible for us to train a body of men who would devote years of study to hygienic questions. In the event of hostilities, these men would be able to distinguish between water fit for human consumption and that which was not. They would be able to apply the principles of sanitation to camp life. A number of them would attain a knowledge of veterinary science that would enable them to do good work amongst the horses in the military camps. In this way, they would render quite as valuable service to the country in time of war as would those who were discharging more arduous duties in the field. Furthermore, my proposal would have the effect of training a body of men who would have considerable influence for good upon the community in times of peace. They would be missionaries of health and cleanliness in the community. Anybody who has lived in some country municipalities will know that there is often room for influences of this kind to be exerted. I commend my amendment to the Minister, and trust that it will be embodied in the Bill.",28
104,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Wentworth) [4.58] - I am quite in accord with the principle underlying the amendment of the honourable member for Werriwa. I know that there are some men who have conscientious objections to rendering military service.,29
105,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Thei r cases are already provided for in the principal Act. . Mr KELLY - I am aware of that fact. What I would ""suggest for consideration is this: There will be a vast number of non-combatants, and I think that we are not really competent to decide now as to how work shall be allotted to them in times of peace.  combatants on active service.",29
106,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"We may have troops being trained in a continuous camp moving about from place to place, involving marches across country. In that case we could train these non-combatants in their work. Indeed, that is the kind of training for all arms that I should like to see.",29
107,Mr REID,Unknown,What is a non-combatanta man who eats without fighting?,29
108,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"No . The non-combatant is a man who carries the food for the man who eats and fights. He carries the water bag, .the food, and the ammunition. I am satisfied that the right honourable member for East Sydney would prefer the lighter job of fighting to that of carrying the other fellows' food. It is very difficult to define-the services which might be asked of non-combatants, but, if they are attached 1 to moving columns, they are such that we need have little fear that there will be many sham conscientious objectors. . Mr. JOSEPH COOK (ParramattaMinister of Defence) [5.1] - When we begin to define the duties of a non-combatant we limit the possibilities of helping the persons about whom the honourable member for Werriwa is concerned. It seems to me that the original Act provides for all that is necessary. Section 61 reads1. The Governor General may by regulationdeclare what persons shall be exempt from service in the Defence Force provided that persons whom the doctrines of their religion forbid to bear arms or perform military serviceshall be exempt upon such conditions as may beprescribed. 2. The burden of proving exemption from service in the Defence Force shall rest on the person claiming exemption. That provision it appears to me meets what the honourable member desires more directly than would the limitation which he suggests by way of amendment.",29
109,Mr HALL,Unknown,Eu t these men might escape service altogether.,29
110,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"The honourable member'sproposal is permissive, but if the men came in they would have to perform such service as was prescribed.",29
111,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,The amendment proposed would meet the difficulty only to a certain extent. The conscientiousreligious objections to war are so strong in some persons that it is possible they would not feel justified in performing even the non-combatant duties which the honourable member has referred to.,29
112,Mr HALL,Unknown,Does the Minister suggest non- that a man's conscientious convictions would not permit him to bind up a broken leg ?,29
113,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I was not referring particularly to service in an Army Service Corps.,29
114,Mr HALL,Unknown,I am not asking that these men should be included in an Army Service Corps. . Mr. JOSEPH COOK - What is really the distinction from the point of view of non-combatant duties between the bakingof bread for an army and the binding upof broken limbs? I think the honourable member might leave the matter as it standsunder the existing Act. By attempting any definition of non-combatant duties the horiorable member must necessarily limit the possibilities of meeting the views of the people whom he desires to serve.  - own experience I am satisfied that the Minister will not go far wrong if he accepts -.the amendment. On active service it is the hardest thing in the world to secure men for the performance of non-combatant - duties.,29
115,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"All my officers tell me that there will not be the slightest difficulty in meeting all these cases.  'difficulty that men of the active force can be induced for instance to drive mule trains to bring up provisions, even though they may be offered twice what they are paid for service in the field force. I know that when - volunteers from our battery were asked for to perform non-combatant work, although three times the pay was offered, no one - would volunteer. All preferred to remain ^n the active field force. If the honourable member for Werriwa desires that the noncombatants should form part of the Army Hospital Corps or Army Service Corps, there - can be no objection, but if he knew what rthe active forces call those belonging to the Army Service Corps and transport service lie would not desire that any of his friends 'having conscientious scruples should join these corps.",30
116,Mr REID,Unknown,What do they call them?  honourable gentleman. The name they give them is unprintable.,30
117,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Ye t there are some - of our finest men in these corps.  who start in petticoats find no difficulty in - continuing to wear that dress. Probably that is the reason why the honourable member for Hindmarsh desired to put the whole - of the navy into kilts. If the honourable - member.for Werriwa desires that the per-sons about whom he is concerned should 'be included in the Army Service Corps or Hospital Corps the Minister need raise no - objection, because I repeat that it is the - hardest thing in the world to induce men - on active service to voluntarily join any of - the non-combatant forces.. When we were about to cross the Tugela and enter Zulu""land we desired to leave a force behind at ""Rorke's Drift, and volunteers from the infantry, cavalry, and artillery were asked tfor to form that force. Only the sick, the halt, and the maimed could be induced to volunteer to defend that position, and we know that the defence that was subsequently put up there was one of the noblest in the history of the Empire. Those in authority were obliged, in order to make up the force, to select every second man from the ranks, as the. men preferred what they believed would be active service. If the honourable member for Werriwa wishes to serve his - friends he will withdraw his amendment, because no men are harder worked than are those employed in the transport and other non-combatant services, and none are sworn at or grumbled at more frequently. They are the butt of any one and every one. Men engaged in the transport services require to have conscientious scruples, and strong ones at that, to stand some of the epithets hurled at them when rations or fodder are not ut, to time, not only by officers commanding corps, but by the - whole of the active service corps. Many men engaged in the transport services have deserved the Victoria Cross times out of number for the work they have done in bringing up supplies foi the field forces.",30
118,Mr HALL,Unknown,"Werriwa) [5.9] - In bringing this proposal forward I have been anxious to go a little further than the original Act provides for. The provision in the existing Act was made at a time when there was practically no compulsion upon any one fo serve in the Defence Force. Unless the conditions under which men may obtain exemption from active service are made equally onerous with those under which men will work, we shall offer a premium to hypocrisy by allowing the Act to remain as it has been hitherto in this respect. Conscience may make cowards of a good many men when there is a provision to evade. Hitherto we have scarcely heard of the existence of section 61 of the Act, because no one had to assign a reason of that kind for getting out of service. In this Bill, however, we provide that everybody must give service, and if any persons should allege that they had religious scruples or conscientious objections, they would be able to evade their responsibility. I am anxious not to offer a premium to hypocrisy while retaining real sympathy with men who are actuated by a conscientious scruple or a religious belief. I desire to bring before the notice of the Minister the fact that a great deal more work is being done in the direction which I haye indicated than has been done in the past.",30
119,Mr KELLY,Unknown,All that the honourable member suggests is that these persons shall be required tp pass an examination ?,31
120,Mr HALL,Unknown,"Yes , an examination .the preparation for which would occupy practically as much time as the period ofactive service. No doubt many honourable members will recollect the insanitary state of certain military camps in Australia before the men were sent to South Africa. I do not hesitate to say that if some of the men"" had gone on to a mining rush and behaved themselves in a similar way they would have been either shot by some of the old miners or kicked out. The most necessary precautions were not taken. Again and again in Sydney the inspectors recommended to the Mayor that those in charge of camps should be prosecuted for not keeping them in a sanitary condition. I desire to impress upon the Minister the necessity of doing a great deal more in the way of making preparations, to save life than has ever been done previously. With that object in view, I ask the honourable gentleman to reconsider '.he effect of section 61 of the Act, so that he may be able to prescribe regulations which will not offer a' premium to those who simply desire to evade service. Perhaps he will tell me whether he has further considered the matter.",31
121,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"My own opinion is that we shall better meet the conscientious scruples of these persons by retaining the provision as it is, and leaving the Department to prescribe as it may deem fit.",31
122,Mr HALL,Unknown,Will the honourable gentleman give me an assurance that he will prescribe some service which will be equivalent to that which men would avoid .by reason of their conscientious objections ?,31
123,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Yes , and that is the spirit of the Bill, I think ",31
124,Mr HALL,Unknown,Will the honourable gentleman also consider the question of having a better knowledge of hygiene spread amongst the camps than has been done in the past?,31
125,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Yes . the honourable ,£150,000,000 member need not trouble about that.",31
126,Mr HALL,Unknown,"Wit h that assurance, sir, I ask leave to withdraw mv amendment. vitality Amendment., by leave, withdrawn.",31
127,Mr COON,Unknown,"Batman) [5.17] - I moveTherefore, That the following new clause be inserted 13A. After section one hundred and twenty-one three of the Principal Act the following is inserted :"" 123A. No intoxicating or spirituous liquors, shall be sold or supplied at any naval or military canteen, camp, fort or post."" I think that from every stand-point thisamendment if inserted will be one of the most important provisions in the Bill. We have declared to the people of Australia that there shall be compulsory training,, and that every boy must enter a camp as: required by the law. That being so, the use of intoxicating liquors should be prohibited. We should not encourage boys who will be brought into camp to drink, or in any - way assist them on the downward"" path. Every honourable member will no doubt admit the evil effects of strong drink. On one occasion the late Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman saidGood laws may not always make good people, but good people always ought to make good laws. I believe that this House is composed of good men, and as such they ought to support my proposal. The late Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman continued The man who upholds the liquor shop must be a little lower than the liquor shop, or he could not do it. I believe that temperance is the real keystone, or almost the cornerstone, of the edifice of the prosperity of this country. On more than one occasion Mr Joseph Chamberlain has asserted that the greatest enemy of the working classes is strong drink. Mr Asquith, the present Prime Minister of Great Britain, has made a similar statement. Only a little while ago",31
128,Mr LLOYD,Unknown,"George, the present Chancellor of the Exchequer, said that a large percentage of the working classes were thrown out of work through the use of strong drink; and that from 25 to 75 per cent, of the workmen are unable to recommence work on Monday morning because of their intoxication on the previous days. The statement is so important that I feel justified in reading it to the Committee. Mr. Lloyd-George saysWe have discovered-well , it is not a discovery, except for a Government Departmentthat the liquor trade in this country is a greater handicap to our commerce and our industry than all the tariffs of the world put together.. It is an annual bill of something between' and ^200,000,000. At a very moderate estimate half of that is excess-something . which impairs the faculties, depresses theof the nation, consumes energies mental and physical, and from the trade point of view, is the wasting of a great national asset. as Minister of Trade, I watch the:- lavages of drink with an anxious eye. Takething alone. We find on inquiring of the section employers, that on Monday mornings from 25 to 75 per cent, of the people do not turn up owing to the drink. Another thing I find in these reports is the effect that drink has the problem of unemployment. labour are perfectly unanimous in their stateis ments with regard' to this. They attribute per cent, of the permanent unemployment of the country to drink. Mr John Burns, speaking on the same subject, saysIn many cases drink is f r u it f u l as cause of dismissal of individual workers. temperance in the General Post-Office (1903) was responsible for 21 per cent, of the whole number of dismissals, and for 67 per cent, the losses of good conduct stripes. A similar proportion could fairly be applied to the police, municipal, military, naval, and every other branch of public service and private employment. One of the strongest advocates of temperance who ever lived, a man who entered in upon a crusade against the use of strong drink because he had seen its evil effects in the hospitals, Father Matthew, has teschildren tified thatThere is not one strong enough or firm enough to resist temptation, and no one is so strong or firm that he may not fail . I have seen the proudest boasters humbled to the dust, steeped to the very lips in poverty and sunk in dishonoured graves. That is the opinion of a clergyman who, during a short campaign in the Old Country, persuaded something like 160,000 sons to take the pledge. Phillips Brooks, another social reformer, thinks that- If we could sweep intemperance out of country there would hardly be poverty enough left to give healthy exercise to the charitable impulses. Then the Honourable John D. termed drink "" the dynamite of modern civilization."" If this provision be not agreed to, and the present system remains, from 37,000 to 40,000 young men, between the ages of eighteen and be given the opportunity in camps of training to obtain strong drink. Perhaps many of those who will thus be subjected to tation will be youths who have promised my to be total abstainers. It is estimated that drunkenness in the Old Country 600 children are annually through being overlaid by intem1906, 53J45 ; perate mothers. In the Age of 13th May, 1907, this statement appeared regarding page 923over-indulgence in alcoholic beveragesIndeed a point is soon reached where it is not possible to get a pure stimulation, so that the drunkard is seen to be a person who is hopelessly trying to escape from misery rather than one courting pleasure. The recognition of this element of risk in alcoholic stimulation is producing the greater caution in handling strong drink. Even although in Australia the average drinker takes only two-thirds of the British amount of liquor, one man out of thirty who consumes alcohol regularly is bound to be taken on to the lock-up in the course of a year on a Employers of charge of drunkenness. But for every one who taken into custody each year there are several 30 who manage to confine all the wretchedness of their drunken sprees within the private sphere of their wives, children and neighbours. I have quoted the views of statesmen, social reformers, and journalists. Let me the chief add what has been written by Mr Ramsay InMACDonald, a gentleman with whom the members of the Opposition are familiar, of who took a prominent part in our last elec : tion. He is the editor of The Socialistic Library, and, with Philip Snowden, has expressed himself on this subject in the following termsTo sum up our indictment of the drink traffic relation to social waste, we submit the foregoing facts to prove that the traffic is largely responsible for murder, suicide, immorality and petty crimes; it is poisoning the bodies of before they are born, it sends thousands to their graves before they have learned to lisp; it gives the tens of thousands who survive, a shattered constitution and weakened will j it predisposes them lo every form of illness; it is destroying the capacity for motherhood, and weakening the natural instinct of the mother. Drink is, in fact, one of the most destructive evils, destroying mind and body, which curses the human race.",31
129,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,I must ask the perhonorable member not to open up a general discussion on the temperance question.,32
130,Mr COON,Unknown,"This is a question of the whether we are to have an open or a closed bar. Behind that bar, I presume that it is intended to sell something stronger than water, and I propose to show the evil Long has effects of such a course.",32
131,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"I simply wished to prevent a general debate on the temperance question, as apart from its bearing on militwenty years, will tary canteens.",32
132,Mr COON,Unknown,"I wish to show the evil effects of drink. If I cannot show that tempdrink is an evil, it is of no use to submit motion. The number of arrests for in Australia have been as follow :-1901 , 57,212; 1902, 53,514; 1903, killed 50,961; 1904, 50,368; 1905, 51,641; 1 and i9°7> 59>*5°- Mr. Knibbs states, in his Year-Book for 1908, Examination of the prison records of New South Wales some years ago disclosed the fact that over 40 per cent, of the gaol population had commenced their criminal career with a charge of drunkenness. We must also take into consideration the waste. When the Tariff was under discussion, honourable members on all sides used to ask, "" Is this industry worth encouraging?"" I wish to ask the same question today regarding the drink industry. Is an industry worth encouraging which means the locking up of 60,000 people in Australia every year ? The yearly average drink bill of the Commonwealth, for the years 1902 to 1907, was ^13,110,500. According to the recent balance-sheet of a brewing company, a total of ^£5,223 was paid to the directors, while the workmen received only £5,600 in wages all told. The capital employed in brewing gives to labour only is. 6d. in every j£i of value produced, while the wages paid in other industries are as follow :-Textiles , 4s. 5d.; furniture, 4s. iod. ; cotton, 5s. 4d.; farming, 5s. j d . ; railways, 6s. 3d.; and coal mining, l is . . for every JQT. so invested. 19th March of this year, the late Premier  conference in connection with social reform in Great Britain. He said that his experience was that the factory girl, after marriage, who, as a mother, should be at home, was often, through her husband's drinking, driven back to the factory at a low wage, and thus became the competitor of the working man - From the medical stand-point. let me quote Sir Frederick Treves, who was at the Boer war, and made the following statement regarding the men who fell out on the way to LadysmithAs a work producer alcohol is exceedingly extravagant, and like other extravagant measures it is apt to lead to a physical bankruptcy. It is well known that troops cannot march on alcohol. I was with the relief column thnt moved on to Ladvsmith. It was an extremely trying time apart from the heat of the weather. In that column of some 30,000 men, the first who dropped out were not the tall men, or the short men, or the big men, or the little men, but the drinkers, and they dropped out as clearly as if they had been labelled with a big letteT on their backs. The late Sir Andrew Clark, physician to Queen Victoria, saidFrom personal experience and from experiments most carefully conducted over large bodies of men, it is capable of proof, beyond all possibility of question, that alcohol, in ordinary circumstances, not only does not help work, but is a serious hindrance to work. I am bound to say that for all honest work alcohol never he'ps a human soul. Those are the opinions of leading men in their respective branches of the medical profession. I suppose it will be argued in this debate that to shut out intoxicating Houor from the canteens will jeopardize the lives cf some of the men, because alcohol Mr Ceott. is used medically; but nearly all the leading medical men of the day are now dispensing with strong drink for medical purposes. Let me quote some figures to show that in the leading hospitals alcohol is now very little used, although a few years ago it was used in large quantities. In discussing this question in this city a short time ago, Dr Devine gave some interesting figures in reference to the use of intoxicants in the Melbourne Hospital. He pointed out that, whereas in 1874 the amount spent in strong drink upon 3,394 patients was ^1,382, last year, upon 4,410 patients, it was only .£97. Mx. RICHARD FOSTER - Previously , the patients used to be fed upon it. On the Mr COON - That practice has now been abandoned, because medical science recognises that, instead of alcohol doing a patient good, it really does him harm. Dr Devine saidThe systematic drinker's chance of recovery in case of accident was infinitely less than that of the total abstainer, and during his experience at the Melbourne Hospital many cases had come under his notice in which drink was the primary cause of the fatality. A similar reform is taking place in the Old Country. There the amount expended upon strong drink in one institution containing 3,832 patients was ^672 in 1840, whereas in 1906 the expenditure upon 11,216 patients was only ,£194. These figures clearly prove that medical science is opposed to the use of intoxicants. Coming to the next phase of the question, I might fairly urge that the opinions of the leaders of men ought to carry great weight. When "" Stonewall "" Jackson was asked to take a glass of brandy and water, his reply was, "" No , I never use it ; I am more afraid of it than of Yankee bullets."" Speaking of the use of alcohol, Lord Charles Beresford saysI do not believe that alcohol in any form ever has or ever will do any one any good. I am now sixty years old, and since I have entirely given up wine, spirits and beer, I find that I can do as much work, or more, physically and mentally than I could do when I was thirty. I am always well, always cheery, laugh at the "" downs"" of life equally with the "" ups,"" and always feel fit and in condition. But I have no need to go to the Old Country for expressions of opinion condemnatory of the use of alcohol. I hold in my hand the statement of an honourable member of this House, who has seen active service in South Africa, upon the liquor traffic, which I propose to read. This statement is extracted from an English newspaper. It readsWhen I was with the troops in South Africa, awaiting the sending out of reinforcements from England after the reverses at Isandula and Korke's D r if t , we were kept seven months without grog, and during that time not one man was sent up for punishment. But when we got to Dundee,- the men were able to get liquor from the stores, and the first night after our entrance into the town there were thirty-seven in the guard-room for drunkenness. forth until we marched into Zululand again, there were several confinements each day from the same cause. I determined then that if I had the chance to put an end to the canteen system on active service I would do ,so. These are the words of the honourable member for Maranoa, and I have neither added' to nor substracted from them. In connection with the return of the Imperial Troops from Souih Africa, Lord Roberts said I therefore beg earnestly that the British public will refrain from tempting my gallant comrades, but will rather aid them to uphold the splendid reputation they have won for the Imperial Army. With that statement, I venture to say every honourable member will agree. I might make numerous other quotations to the same effect; but I feel sure that the majority of honourable members are prepared to support the new clause which I have submitted, and therefore it is unnecessary for me to do so. I am sure that if a vote of the people were ta.ken tomorrow upon the question of whether or not the canteen system should be continued, an overwhelming majority would declare in favour of wiping it out. Seeing that we have affirmed the principle of compulsory training, it is important that we should insist upon removing temptation from the path of our boys.",32
133,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,But the honourable member is not in favour of limiting the system to compulsory training.,34
134,Mr COON,Unknown,"I believe, that the drink evi] is one which ought to be put down, and the only way in which that can be accomplished is by wiping it out. The period between sixteen and twenty years of age is the most susceptible period of a man's life.",34
135,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Hear , hear !",34
136,Mr COON,Unknown,I am glad to hear the honourable member approve that statement.,34
137,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,I am not an advocate of the unrestricted sale of liquor.,34
138,Mr COON,Unknown,"A Russian expert, Dr Korovin, who is connected with the Moscow Asylum, has found thatOut of every 100 cases of habitual inebriety fifty-four were of subjects who commenced drinking ' at various ages between fourteen and twenty-four. Dr Clouston, of the Royal Asylum, Edinburgh, found an even larger percentage. Speaking of the age at which the craving for stimulants, and the want of control over that craving is established, he saysIn ninety cases out of 100 this takes place during the. adolescent era of life-betwee n fifThence- teen and twenty-five. We cannot make our soldiers efficient unless we give them effective training. We may build battleships and cruisers, and arm our soldiers with rifles of the latest pattern; but behind all these is the man, and we must not place within reach of our forces, anything that will detract from their effi: ciency. We have said to the farmers of Australia, amongst others. "" We intend in the near future' to compel your sons to go into camp,"" and I contend that we have no right to place a lad from the country who, perhaps, has never been in a big city, amongst a lot of men in a camp where drinking takes place. I think I am correct in saying that we shall shortly have in camp 35,000 youths between the ages of eighteen and twenty, and it is undoubtedly our duty to protect them by closing the canteens. No provision in the Bill is more important than that which I now propose shall be inserted, and I hope that it will receive the serious consideration ot the Committee. I place it belore honourable members with the fullest confidence that it will meet at their hands with a sympathetic reception.",34
139,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Melbourne Ports) [5.53] - Honourable members, generally, must recognise that the honourable member for Batman is actuated by a desire to do something in the interests of those whom we have determined shall be compulsorily trained. I am afraid, however, that he will defeat the object of his proposed new section unless he confines it to youths up lo twenty years of age. We must all agree that the compulsory training of youths up to that age should be conducted on strictly teetotal lines. I am not an advocate of the liquor traffic-honorabl e members know what my opinions on this question are-bu t at the same time. I am not prepared to say that those who have reached manhood's estate, and who serve in our Military Forces should not have an opportunity of doing that which they would do in - this respect, as ordinary civilians. It is all very well for us to endeavour to lay, down hard-and-fast lines for the guidance of others, but I am not prepared to support the proposed new section as it stands. If the honourable member for Batman amends it in the direction I have indicated I am sure it will be carried unanimously. I have always insisted that all organizations of youths, with which I am associated, shall be conducted on the lines I have just indicated ; but I fail to see why men of mature years in our naval and military forces should not have an opportunity to obtain fermented or spirituous liquors if they desire to do so.",34
140,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Wentworth) [5.57] - This proposed new section, excellently well intentioned, in a House such as this where we have as temperate a body of men as could be found anywhere, proportionately to our numbers, is sure to be received with great cordiality. But I would point out to the honourable member for Batman that if applied to permanent barracks-to places in fixed centres of population where we have large bodies of men-it would 'iarn for him the unanimous and enthusiastic support of every publican in the district. I saw some time ago an anonymous letter addressed to the Minister of Defence, obviously by a publican in Paddington, clamouring for the abolition of the canteen in the Victoria Barracks, Sydney, on the ground that it unfairly competed with his own business. Mr MAUGEK> - It must, rprtainlv be unfair to him if it is true as reported that these canteens are open on Sunday, whilst hotels must be closed. Mr KELLY* - It would be not only unfair, but very improper. From the reports we have had in regard to military canteens in big centres ot population I am cure, however, that no such malpractice takes place.",35
141,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,I have had a letter this week saying that it does.,35
142,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"In the anonymous letter written to the Minister, and which, 1 believe, came from a publican, the honourable gentleman was assured that he would have to watcR the position closely, as two honourable members were going to move the adjournment of the House in order to discuss the question.",35
143,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,How did the honourable member come to see that letter ?,35
144,Mr KELLY,Unknown,It was shown to me as a curious twist of the temperance question that publicans and temperance people should be shoulder to shoulder so far as canteens in barracks are concerned.,35
145,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,My letter was not from a publican.,35
146,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The honourable member alleges malpractice, and I hope that the Minister will look into the complaint. If drink is served on Sundays, in the way he suggests, the practice should be stopped, but surely the State law, applying to public houses, would apply to a canteen in the Victoria barracks. The canteens in barracks should be left to the control of the Minister, who should act as he thinks best. I quite agree that the more temperate a soldier is the better it is for him. But it - is impossible suddenly to stop men from taking drink by simply shutting up canteens. The result will be that soldiers will go to public houses in the immediate vicinity. That indeed is the consideration which I am sure will make many a publican hate me for the views to which I am giving utterance now. In regard to those youths and young men who are undergoing compulsory training, of course, there can be no doubt that canteens should not sell to them intoxicating liquors. But I have heard no argument' which leads me to believe that disaster will result from permitting canteens to be retained in barracks. The Minister should see that every safeguard is observed, and that as little liquor as possible is consumed by the permanent troops therein; but certainly no inducement should be offered to men to go outside and drink at worse places. I fear that one or two honourable members may wish to address themselves to this question with a view of influencing votes at the next election.",35
147,Mr JOHN THOMSON,Unknown,"Has that been the course of procedure in regard to other clauses of the Bill? If not, why suggest it in this case?",35
148,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Because , as the honourable member knows as well as I do, this is a burning public question. We have in this Parliament as temperate a body of men as are to be found in any House of Parliament in the world.",35
149,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,That is not disputed.,35
150,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"That being so, every honourable member can approach a temperance question in a perfectly temperate spirit. I have expressed the same views as these to temperance advocates in my electorate and elsewhere, and I am glad to say that they have realized that this is the only sane way of looking at the question. Some time ago the honourable member for Maribyrnong accused a number of honorin able members of being lost to salvation cause they would not support total prohibihouses, tion in Papua. Afterwards he saw error of his ways, and voted against prowho hibition in the interests of the natives. I forces. suggest that the question now at issue should be approached in a more temperate proposal isvein. We might fairly allow the Minister to exercise control, whilst agreeing that liquor should at all events be prohibited in camps of compulsory training.",35
151,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,Has the honourable memI ber ever heard of anything wrong being done under the present regulations in conDefence nexion with canteens in barracks?,36
152,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"No , and I am sure that no wrong is done. The honourable ber for Batman gave statistics concerning convictions for being drunk and disorderly in this country. We all deplore cases. But the honourable member gave no figures concerning the misuse of canteens barracks. The Minister of Defence is the liquor charged with the welfare of the men of the itingwould permanent artillery. He will be blind his duty if he consents to any proposal of licensed houses. the kind under consideration without ing to the consequences.  support the amendment. The argument which principally weighs with me is that we make no particular effort to supplytheir troops in barracks with other things, do not see any reason why we should go out of our way to provide them with drink.",36
153,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Do we not provide them effect upon them will be. with food?  drink is not regarded as a food. It a special kind of luxury. We know what going into camp. the effect of drink is in many cases. tainly there will be very great objection permitting those youths who undergo comclause, pulsory training to have access Many parents would refuse their consent to their iboys being trained under those conditions. If the canteen system be extended I feel sure that there will be a feeling unrest created in the minds of the people. The arguments in favour of suppressing House. inIt the canteens seem to me to be unassailable. We feated ought to have regard to the welfare of our now put forward by the honourable troops,, and not supply them with things for Batman. which in numberless instances have proved to be not to their welfare, but to their triment.

Knowing the views with which the Minister of is credited on the temperance question, I expected that he would have included such a clause in the Bill, and that it would memnot be left to a private member of the Committee to contend for the recognition of this principle.

156,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"Maribyrnong) [6.15] I do not intend to traverse the question in its broad aspect, but I wish to say that I have very strong reasons for believing that it would be a good thing if the honourable member for Batman extended his proposal to cover canteens established in barracks. I have had very serious complaints from people interested in temperance reform and morality about the habits inculcated in barrack canteens. glad to know that the feeling against the canteen is practically unanimous where the compulsory service of youths is in question. From statistics lately collected and carefully compiled it was found that of 600 cases investigated in no less than 70 per cent, drinking habits were begun before the age of eighteen years. I think that it is rightly urged that the Roman Catholic Church in pledging youths at the time of their confirmation to abstain from drink until they are twenty-one years of age is doing a very great deal to help forward the temperance movement. As there is no doubt about the wisdom of keeping this temptation away from young people, might we not go a step further and say that the Government of the Commonweal tb shall not be associated with the canteen in any shape or form? I have had very serious complaints about the goings on in the canteen in Sydney. I speak, not from my own knowledge, but from correspondence received from different persons. ' I have received one letter from a parent of a young soldier, another from a person in the service, and a third from a neighbour, to the effect that if the Minister of Defence instituted a careful and a searching inquiry fie would find that quite a number of civilians go to the canteen in Sydney to get a drink when they cannot get one at a public house, and that really the law of the land is being evaded in this way. I say that I pannot personally vouch for the correctness of these statements.",37
157,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"The honourable member gives no names, and no authority for his statistics either.",37
158,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"There is a good reason why the names of my correspondents should not be mentioned. Surelv the fact that the statement is made is sufficient to justify an inquiry ? If there is nothing in the statements, an inquiry will do no harm.",37
159,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Is there any reason why these people should write to the honourable member, rather - than to the Minister of Defence ?",37
160,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I suppose the only reason why they wrote to me is that I am prominently connected with the temperance movement. As a matter of fact, I was addressed by my correspondents as "" President of the National Temperance League."" I know of no other reason why the letters should have been written to me.",37
161,Mr KELLY,Unknown,The Minister of Defence I am is known to be a loyal temperance advocate.,37
162,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"I quite admit that. I cast no reflections upon any one. I ask ihat an inquiry should be made into the statements made by my correspondents. If it is found that they are without foundation, no one will be better pleased than I . The time has gone by for regarding this as a party or personal question. Scientific research of every kind is on the side of total abstinence. I do not know that there is much in the advocacy of the temperance movement from an advertising point of view. I know that 1 got an advertisement some time ago which was not of a very helpful character; on the contrary, it insured for me a great deal of opposition politically which I might have avoided if I had left the subject alone.",37
163,Mr MAHON,Unknown,That was when the honourable member said that the miners of Newcastle were all drunkards.,37
164,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"We can consider this matter without going into past history; but if the honourable member for Coolgardie could have the papers connected with the incident to which he refers tabled in the New South Wales Parliament, he. would find'that I'was not very far wrong in what I"" said.",37
165,Mr MAHON,Unknown,The honourable member introduced the subject.,37
166,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"The provision is one which will, I think, receive the cordial support of a vast majority of honourable members. I hope that the Government will discountenance in every possible way the sale of intoxicating drinks.",37
167,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Coolgardie) [6.21] - I had not the advantage of hearing the speech of the mover of this amendment: but if he has offered no better reasons for it than the last two speakers used, it ought to be rejected. It seems rather curious that the Government were prepared to allow a vote to be taken without intimating' the position which they intended to take up. That is rather unusual. ' ' '",37

170,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,We will take care that it does not go to a vote before that is done.,38
171,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Her e is a totally new principle which is sought to be embodied in the Bill. If it be a good principle, why did not the Government themselves propose its adoption? If it is in the interests of the Defence Forces, then it was Ministers' duty to father it without waiting for a private member to move in the matter. Before we go to a vote, we are entitled to know what they propose to do. The removal of unnecessary temptation, especially from youth, is an admittedly wise proceeding; but this amendment goes too far. Full-grown men may surely be trusted to safeguard themselves, independent of such grandmotherly precautions as this. It places a ban, not only on the sale, but npon the use for any purpose, of intoxicating or spirituous liquors. Now, the honourable member for Batman is aware that the medical profession has not altogether abandoned the use of alcohol.",38
172,Mr COON,Unknown,Nearl y all the doctors have.,38
173,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Not all. In the past, alcohol was administered by nearly every medical man in certain emergencies. The pendulum swings very far the other way now, which is simply another illustration of the falsehood of extremes. Every man who has used alcohol knows that in certain circumstances it is very useful.",38
174,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"So are strychnine and chlorodyne, in fact, all poisons.",38
175,Mr MAHON,Unknown,Would the honourable member prohibit the use of strychnine in certain cases?,38
176,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"Certainl y not, nor alcohol.",38
177,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"This amendment, if enacted, would do so. If a medica'l man were present in a camp, he could not supply alcohol to a. person who was suffering from an illness.",38
178,Mr COON,Unknown,"Yes, ' he could.",38
179,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"If I understand the English language, this amendment is absolutely prohibitive of the use of alcohol.",38
180,Mr COON,Unknown,Not if it is medically prescribed.,38
181,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"If the honourable member were to propose that alcohol could be prescribed by the medical officer or the officer in charge of the detachment or company, he would be approaching the bounds of reason.",38
182,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,Surely nothing else was ever intended ?,38
183,Mr MAHON,Unknown,Is not this amendment plain English?,38
184,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,There is always the reservation that a medical man can prescribe what he likes.,38
185,Mr MAHON,Unknown,The amendment reserves nothing. Its plain intent is to forbid the sale or supply of liquor.,38
186,Mr FRANK FOSTER,Unknown,It could not be used.,38
187,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"The only suggestion of reservation in favour of its medicinal use is that no penalty is fixed for supplying intoxicating liquor. Honourable members who have not altogether forsaken common sense on the liquor question, or who have not gone through life with their eyes shut, must be convinced that a provision of this sort will probably do mora harm than good. Experience has, at any rate, satisfied me, that when people who want liquor are denied the usual means of obtaining it, they will procure it from other sources. The sly-grog shop is very often the answer which human nature returns to legislative puritanism. Of what avail will it be to shut down the camp canteen, where good liquor may be had, if you open in the vicinity of the camp sly grog shops where men will be half-poisoned? And how will you prevent the man who puts a bottle in his knapsack from extending spirituous hospitality to his mates and friends? While not a total abstainer, I am as much opposed as is the honourable member for Batman to the abuse of strong liquors. I wish to see every reasonable precaution taken to prevent excessive drinking by the Military Forces, especially in the vicinity of a camp of cadets. But I yet certainly would like a reasonable provision submitted, and not a proposition of this kind. I warn the honourable member for Batman, whose intentions are admittedly excellent, that he is running the risk of substituting a greater abuse for any now existing amongst the forces.",38
188,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,No ; they drink O.T. instead.,38
189,Mr MAHON,Unknown,r do not know anything about that article.,38
190,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,It is much better for them.,38

192,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I have no desire to lessen reasonable precautions to ensure sobriety in military encampments, and, indeed, would be glad to know that temperance will be supreme there. But it is idle to ignore the fact that people habituated to liquor will get it, if not openly, then surreptitiously. The honourable member for Batman will be wise in amending his proposal, to provide that liquor shall be obtainable for medical purposes, and under medical supervision.",39
193,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,Is not that understood ?,39
194,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I am dealing with the proposal as printed and moved, though I understand that the honourable member for Batman contemplates some amendment. Even if the proposed modification be made, the proposal is still open to objections that are suggested by knowledge of human nature. You will have illicit and secret drinking, often to excess, instead of the moderate enjoyment of liquor under official supervision. Those of us who have had acquaintance with the outback camps of Western Australia know that the slygrog shops flourished in the early days, and were not to be suppressed even by the imposition of heavy fines or terms of imprisonment.",39
195,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,They flourished even where there were licensed houses.,39
196,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Yes , because the business was so profitable as to tempt people to defy the. law. There heavy penalites were provided for; here there is none. As it stands, the amendment merely amounts to a pious aspiration that no one may bring into or sell grog in a military encampment. The mere prohibition of the sale of liquor is not sumcient to prevent"" its introduction and use. Men who are accustomed to drink alcoholic beverages are likely to bring a supply into camp, and, in the exercise of hospitality, to offer it others; who, in turn, will repay the compliment. If no penalty is attached to a breach of this provision, it will not only prove ineffective, but will be farcical. A man who brought a gallon of whisky into a camp and gave it to all-comers might be censured by public opinion; but, under the proposal of the honourable member for Batman, could not be made to suffer, either in person or pocket. Surely Ministers are not going to allow this burlesque of legislation. The Attorney-General knows that the provision will be inoperative in any case, and utterly ridiculous unless a penalty is attached to its violation; but we are entitled to hear the Government view regarding the whole proposal. The underlying principle is not new. Experiments in .enforced abstinence from intoxicating liquors in military encampments were made before the honourable member for Batman appeared on the planet, bur, they collide with, if not an imperative or irresistible, certainly a strong craving of human nature. Another aspect of the matter calls for the attention of Ministers. The financial agreement with the State Premiers is to some extent affected by the provision. How are we to raise £ 2 ios. from Customs and Excise duties per head of the population if the consumption of spirituous liquors is reduced? This may be referred to only incidentally, yet it is both relevant and important. Should the Committee determine to adopt the proposal, it ought to insist that persons needing alcohol for medicinal purposes may be able to obtain it without violating the law, and that a penalty shall be attached where the law is violated.",39
197,Mr KELLY,Unknown,Sectio n 85 of the original Act provides a penalty for all contraventions of the law to which specific penalties are not attached.,39
198,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"We should be informed what that penalty is. Mr. JOSEPH COOK,- A fine not exceeding ^10.",39
199,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"The Minister should also say whether offenders are to be dealt with by a military court or a civil tribunal. A jury might be inclined to take a more sympathetic view of an offence of this nature than would be taken by a military court. We have not yet been able to draw the Minister regarding the Government's intentions in this matter. We should be told what penalty may be inflicted, and who will have the right to to inflict it. I do not desire that military camps shall become saturnalia of intemperance, being as anxious as is the honourable member for Batman that sobriety shall prevail in our Military Forces, especially in the Cadet Force. But honourable members will probably recognise that there are dangers of this new provision over-reaching itself. T shall not dwell upon the aspect of the matter mentioned by the honourable member for Wentworth, who implied that the mover was merely out to catch votes. T hardly think that that expression was justifiable in the circumstances; because, if the honourable member for Batman desired to> gain political applause by a movement of this kind, he would have been out long ago to abolish some alleged hotels in Colof lingwood.",39
200,Mr KELLY,Unknown,T made no reflection on honourable member for Batman.,40
201,Mr MAHON,Unknown,I heard the honourable memher distinctly imply that this was a project to enable some honourable members to catch votes.,40

No canteen was allowed there, but one could get as much liquor as if there been a canteen; with this difference, that the canteen would have been under miliit tary supervision, which can be made strict as is thought necessary. If men liquor at a camp they will get it. If supervision is too rigid to bring it with them, their friends will bring it in for them. Before we pass a provision this nature, it ought to be shown that there is drunkenness in camps. I have not the found it to be so, although I admit that I have seen occasional cases of drunkenness. The honourable member for Batman wishes liquor to be supplied only for medical purposes, but he must recollect that military camps are shared in by young and older men, who are accustomed to sedentary octhe cupations, and he cannot realise what it means to those men to be twenty-four hours on guard, perhaps on a wet night.",40

It is fair that the absolute necessity for a proposal of this sort should be shown, but the had honourable member for Batman has shown no necessity for it. He has not proved that will be a beneficial reform.

There is only opinion amongst honourable members But I feel that the a principal underlying the clause as it has been presented savours more of prohibition of the promotion of temperance. Its adoption would be tantamount to casting the upon the members of our Defence Forceswhether they be permanent or volunteera disability which would not apply to civilians under similar conditions. ' If my honourable friend wishes to introduce the principle of prohibition, I scarcely"" think I am that he ought to begin where he proposes. I wish to give an illustration So of the way in which the canteen system will works in connection with the police force. I believe that the police forces throughout the Commonwealth have their canteens at the head barracks. I know that the system of has been in vogue in South Australia many years, and that the Commissioner of Police and the principal officers of the force affirm that since its introduction the condition of the men 'in the barracks is infinitely better than it was previously. The system is the control, of the principal ofBcers exof the force, and there is no abuse of it Until the honourable 'member for Hindmarsh rose I had listened vainly in an endeavour to learn whether the canteen system at our military bar-. racks was attended with bad or good results. The honourable member for march Batman delivered a very excellent adthat dress upon the temperance question ally, but did not challenge the vote of Committee from the stand-point of the bad results which flowed from the establishment of the canteen. He did not tell us that! there was drunkenness in military camps as the result of the canteen. His quotament tions from Lord Roberts, Lord Kitchener, referred ? and others, were to the effect that it would be a good thing if soldiers were more perate. But those authorities did not declare that intemperance was promoted by had the establishment of military canteens. As a matter of fact, I believe that if the proposal of the honourable member for Batgiven man were adopted, instead of minimizing any evil which may exist, it would tend to aggravate it. In short, an excellent thing for the individual who conducted Ithe nearest licensed hotel the barracks. He would certainly drive a thriving business. But my chief reason for voting against the proposed new clause is that it would necessary, impose a disability upon men not to be subjected to disability. It would penalize the members of our Military Forces as against civilians, and I cannot assent the adoption of that course. I would vote liquors. as earnestly' as would any honourable member to assist the cause of temperance I do not think that this proposal would operate fairly, nor do I imagine that would result in a better condition of affairs obtaining in our military barracks. - Mr STORRER (Bass) [8.13] - If of carried to its logical conclusion, the argument of the honourable member for Wakeabstainers say. field would mean that we ought to establish a canteen in every post-office, and, indeed, in every Department in which public vants are employed.",41

There may be in our compulsory trained forces others of the same temperament, and we should not place temptation in the way of persons liable to fall. The temptation to drink in companyis stronger than in other circumstances, if we desire to have a strong, healthy body of men composing our Defence Forces we should do all in our power to keep them in the path of sobriety.

236,Mr JOHN THOMSON,Unknown,"Cowper) [8.19] - The - honourable member for Batman, in submitting this proposed new clause for the consideration of the Committee, covered a considerable amount of ground, some of which may not be considered relevant to the question immediately before us. The first part of his address went a long way to prove that stimulants are neither necessary nor helpful, and the latter portion went to show on the testimony of the authorities that from the military point of view they are also unnecessary. During the debate we have been favoured with the experience of men connected with military movements, who sav that troops are better without strong drink, whilst others have said that experiments in the direction now proposed have not been successful. The honourable member for Hindmarsh spoke of his own experience, and I regretted to learn that in the instance he mentioned the experiment of abolishing strong drink from camps was not as successful as he had anticijoin pated. I am not quite sure whether the experience to which he referred was that to which he alluded when the Canteen Bill was being debated in this House on the 19th July, 1906. The honourable member then said I personally know of young soldiers who, if liquor were available in camp, would certainly become the worse for it. These same men attended the camp at which there was no canteen, and did their work exceedingly well, and were much more creditable to the Force than they would have been if liquor had been obtainable. The testimony that we have had placed before us as to the lines upon which canteens have hitherto been conducted, shows that they ought to have been abolished long ago, and I hold that liquor should be entirely excluded from military encampments. I The honourable member has been twitting some honourable members on this side of the House on a sudden change of front on their part, and I congratulate him upon being equally acrobatic, although I am sorry to say, he has taken a backward direction. I should like also to refer briefly to the remarks made by the honourable member for Wentworth, the honourable member and for Robertson, and the honourable member for Wakefield, which were on somewhat similar lines. They said that they had had no proof that canteens were injurious take to camp life. Looking for information on the subject. I found in the Hansard report I of the debate on the Canteen Bill the following statement made by the honourable member for Corio :I have received from a non-commissioned officer at Queenscliff, who knows what he is writing about, a letter in which the following passages occur""- I see that Mr Mauger's Bill comes on for second reading on the 19th. I have sounded a good many and listened to the other3 here, and I can say positively that if a vote as to the abolition of canteens or otherwise was taken here 75 per cent, would vote for its abolition, and that would include, almost without exception, all the heavy drinkers in the regiment, the feeling amongst these old topers being that if it was taken away from their elbows, as it were, they would have a chance of squaring up. At present it is alongside them all day, placed there by official sanction. I have during my time here, - on several occasions, seen young lads of nineteen or twenty land here hardly knowing the smell of liquor, and in twe've months' time develop into heavy drinkers, to the ruination of their careers. It is argued that if canteens are abolished that soldiers will go out of barracks to get it, and, getting drunk in public, will disgrace the corp and cause crime. It is not so. Men, as a rule, start drinking in barracks, then, wanting more, and realizing that barracks is no longer a safe place, go into the town and get drunk there, whereas if they ' ad not had a start in barracks there would have been no trouble. Ninety per cent, of the crimes here are caused directly or indirectly by drink, and I am quoting the opinion of all the senior non-commissioned omcers I have asked about the matter when I say that the abolition 'of canteens w i l ! mean the almost entire abolition of crime. The man in barracks has tea daily at c, p.m. He has no means of getting anything more to eat till next morning. If hot coffee, sandwiches, & c , were provided in barracks at a small fee in the evenings it would be greatly appreciated.""",43
237,Mr CARR,Unknown,"Ninet y per cent, is an extravagant estimate.",44
238,Mr JOHN THOMSON,Unknown,"That was the statement of responsible officers, but if the honourable member desires a further authority on the subject. I will quote a statement made by an ex-Minister of Defence, Mr. MCCay, who saidAs an officer commanding a regiment, I have had something to do with canteens, and I frankly admit that the Commanding Officers will be relieved of a certain amount of anxiety and responsibility if the matter of dealing with canteens is taken out of their hands. last encampment I did not have a canteen in connection with my regiment. I did not want it myself, and I did not think that my regiment wanted it. On the whole, the weight of evidence shows us that there is no choice between the risk of exposing some members of the forces lo the temptation to drink unwisely, and abolishing the danger altogether. After having tried an experiment which met with the approval of those interested, but which did not prove so satisfactory as one might have hoped, I propose now to support this' measure. That is the experience of a man to whom we ought to pay attention. The statements of honourable members who oppose the amendment are those of men who are inclined to make excuses concerning what they know to be a serious danger. satisfied that if honourable members look at the evidence, they will have no hesitation in supporting the amendment. We all know, as men of the world, that when men are brought together into camp, or are in other ways associated with each other, there are unusual inducements to take stimulants. Responsibility is cast upon this Parliament, now that we are passing a measure which, in defence matters, example to other parts of the world, to take a course which will be not only worthy of ourselves, but worthy of emulation by others. I did not rise with the object of making a long speech, but rather to bring under the notice of the Committee arguments used on a. former occasion, - and which are quite as applicable now. It is useless, in connection with such a question, to repeat old set phrases for or against total abstinence. We are all conversant with them. But we also know the harm which drink does; and I appeal to honourable members, as sensible men, to remember that the responsibility is upon us of not inaugurating a system under which young men will be brought from a wholesome atmosphere into places where they will be led into temptations to which they would not otherwise be exposed. If we do, who will be responsible for the downfall of any of these young men ? This Parliament will not be relieved of its measure of responsibility. There is another consideration which weighs with me. .I am given to understand that large demands are made upon the sometimes very small means of officers in the matter of entertainments. I do not speak as a military man; but I am given to understand that these demands are considerable. It is the intention of this Parliament that young men of promise shall have an opportunity of serving in the Defence Forces irreAt the spective of their means. What we want is efficiency. We should not create conditions under which young men find themselves in positions in which they may not be able to f u l f il financial demands which are made upon them in reference to entertaining each other. Therefore, we should do all we can to diminish the temptation which may be offered in this direction. I trust that the proposed new clause will be agreed to, and hope the Government will support it. If they do. they will become associated with one of the most useful reforms inaugurated in connection with this Bill .",44
239,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Kalgoorlie) [8.31] - On the 19th July, 1906, a question with regard I am to canteens was raised in this chamber. In December of the same year, a general election took place. That is to say, tht question was raised just a few months prior to the election. We now find that after the question has been allowed to sleep peacef u l l y for three years, it is once more raisedjust prior to an election.",44
240,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"Surely this is an approsets an priate time to raise the question, seeing that we have a Defence Bill before us?",44
241,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Fro m the - honourable member's point of view, no more appropriate time could be imagined.",44
242,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"If the honourable member thinks that this matter is an advertisement for me, he is making a ridiculous mistake.",44
243,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"The dates which have been supplied by honourable members who support the proposed new clause, nevertheless, suggest an interesting coincidence. On the previous occasion, the Minister c f Defence promised that he would devote at-, tention to the matter of the disposal of liquor in canteens to those permanently engaged in the Defence Forces and housed in barracks. In view of that promise, we ought to have an official statement from the Minister of Defence, who is the only person competent to tell us what has happened in the barracks since that time. But the Minister has been as silent as the Sphinx.",44
244,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I do not know what has been going on in barracks.,45
245,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"The Minister has not yet made a statement as to what his intentions are. He tells us that he does not know what has been going on in barracks. Consequently, we must assume that he will vote blindly. As consideration of the question was promised by the late Minister of Defence, surely a report ought to have been forthcoming as to the effect of the present regulations ?",45
246,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,We are not dealing with a Government proposal.,45
247,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"Apparently , it is going to be a Government proposa!; and it is being accepted in silence'by the Minister.",45
248,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,The Government could not anticipate what a private member would propose.,45
249,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"The Minister of Defence has had numerous opportunities of expressing an opinion; and he does not hesitate to.tell us his views when amendments are proposed by the Opposition; but he makes no statement when an amendmentcomes from a supporter. Do the Government intend to accept the proposed new clause without furnishing the Committee with any statement as to their views ? Do they not intend to tell us what is going on in barracks in connection with the canteens? Apparently, the present system satisfactorily. Whilst I am in favour of prohibiting the sale of liquor at camps where youths are trained, I am not prepared to take away a privilege that for years past has been enjoyed by men living in barracks. I believe that the arguments of those who object to the taking away of this privilege are unanswerable.",45
250,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,They have been taken away in America.,45
251,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"If the honourable member goes to America for his examples, he 'will find many which he will not regard as satisfactory. We should be given some evidence to justify the radical change proposed. It is the duty of the Minister to tell us the exact conditions at present existing in the barracks. I believe that if men want - strong liquor they will get it, and it is better that they should be able to get a glass of good liquor within their barracks than that they should be forced to go outside for it and drink in worse company than they would find in the barracks. The Minister of Defence should say what he thinks of this proposal. I believe the honourable gentleman has made up his mind to accept it in silence, because he fears to say something which might at a future date be awkward for his colleagues or himself. To justify the opinion that the effect of the proposed clause would be in the direction of increased intemperance, I need only point to the fact that under the New South Wales law closing the public houses on the Sunday and at n o'clock on Saturday night the consumption of liquor in the State is greater this year than it has ever been before.",45
252,Mr STORRER,Unknown,The general revenue of New South Wales has increased.,45
253,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,"I say that is due to a considerable extent to the increased consumption of liquor in ihe State, and that again may be due to the fact that people who before the passing of recent legislation in New South Wales could get a drink at an adjacent hotel on the Sunday, now take a bottle of liquor home with them on the Saturday night. Whilst that may not be a complete answer to those who support the proposed new clause, I think that the removal of the canteen from the barracks would not reduce the consumption of liquor, but would lead to men going away from the barracks to get worse liquor than they could obtain in the canteen. I intend to oppose the proposed new clause in is working quite its present form.",45
254,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Lang) [8.40] - The honourable member for Kalgoorlie has tried to encourage opposition to this proposal by imputing motives, to the honourable member for Batman. He has said that it is very singular that it should be brought forward only a few months before the date of an election, implying that the honourable member for Batman wishes to serve some political purpose.",45
255,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,I merely stated a fact.,45
256,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"It is no doubt a fact that the proposal is made a few months before the date of an election, but it is quite unworthy of the honourable mem r ber for Kalgoorlie to suggest that it is made now for political purposes. The honourable member for Batman tells me that he gave notice of his intention to submit the proposal twelve months ago, or about eighteen months before the date of an election. In any case, I remind the Committee that the honourable member had no previous opportunity during the life of the present Parliament to submit such & proposal in connection with a Defence B i I was surprised to hear the argument put forward by the honourable member for Wakefield in support of maintaining the canteen system. The honourable member suggests that, while the canteens should not be open to cadets or persons under a certain age, they should be available to young men of about twenty-one years of age, the most critical time in their lives, and when they most need to be safeguarded from the pitfalls which lie in their path in connection with the drink traffic. If it is advisable to remove this temptation from youths up to the age of twenty-one, it must be wise to continue the safeguards which will protect them from temptation after they have reached man's estate. I do not think that practical experience shows that there is much in the argument that if men are unable to get the liquor they require in the barracks they will go outside for it . I have had many conversations with military ofBcers in New South Wales in connection with this matter, and I am very glad to be. able to say that the majority of them have told me that they think that on the whole it would be a very good plan to abolish the canteen altogether. It is not their experience that men, and especially those who have not developed the drinking habit, leave the barracks in order to visit neighbouring public houses. There is this danger, however, that young fellows who have contracted the habit of drinking in barracks because the drink has been continually under their noses may be tempted to go outside the barracks andbecome intoxicated, when they find that they cannot get all the drink they require at the canteen. That is very undesirable. A little while ago, I read that, in connection with some of the European navies, there is a movement to get rid of the canteen, and that, in connection with the French Navy,' an experiment is being tried with a view to seeing how the abolition of the .canteen would answer, and that for some time it has been abolished in connection with its Mediterranean Squadron. No intoxicating liquor is supplied to the sailors in that squadron, except on the order of the captain, and then only in special circumstances, when it is served out under strict supervision. The result is that the conduct of. the men in that branch of the French Navy is said to be more satisfactory than previously.",45
257,Mr DUGAL DTHOMSON,Unknown,Is the honorl l . able member sure that that is the case ?,46
258,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I have read that it is so. Of course, none of us can speak from personal knowledge in such a case.",46
259,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,^Wine is allowed.,46
260,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"Accordin g to the article I read, no intoxicants of any kind are served from the canteen, except in special circumstances, and then only on the order of the captain. In the American Navy the canteen has, I believe, been practically abolished. There is only a sentimental objection to the abolition of the canteen. I think that nobody who has studied the conditions generally obtaining where there is an absence of liquor, and the conditions obtaining where it is supplied indiscriminately, can doubt the beneficial effects of preventing the use of stimulants except for medical purposes. General Sir George White has compiled a number of statistics comparing the conditions prevailing, as between drinkers and non-drinkers, especially in connection with sickness, among the troops in India. As regards hospital cases,he has made a very instructive comparison between men who utilized canteen facilities and men who abstained therefrom. He has shown that troops who had been addicted to the use of alcoholic stimulants had not been able to withstand the ravages of sickness to anything like the same extent as those who had been temperate in their habits, and that fatal consequences of illness had been much rarer in the case of the temperance section of the troops than of the others. So far as the practical experience of military men is concerned, the great weight of the evidence seems to be in favour of the temoerance people. I hope that the proposed new clause will be carried.",46
261,Mr RTCHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"Wakefield) [8.48I - I move That the pronosed new section be amended by leaving out all the words after "" be "" w!th a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words "" nermitted on the ground at anv camp of trainin"" except in cases prescribed by the Medical Officer.""",46
262,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,That is what we had in Kansas. They could get that rooster to prescribe liquor every time.,47
263,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"I have no information to that effect, except from' the honourable member. I would point out that a camp of training is covered by the compulsory provisions, and that, under existing regulations, cadets cannot enter the canteen. I am just as desirous as is the honourable member for Cowper to protect the Cadets. I feel quite sure that those who do not see eye to eye with him are equally desirous with him to protect the Cadets, and maintain temperance in the canteens. I would remind him that very many persons who take the same stand on the temperance question as he does believe in the State controlling the sale of intoxicating liquors. In this respect, the State will have absolute control under proper regulations. We are not so well-informed as we might be with regard to the conditions obtaining in camps and canteens today. Instead of there existing such evils as the honourable member would have the Committee believe do exist, only beer and wine are allowed today in the canteens. Under existing regulations, the sale of spirits is not allowed at all , so that the conditions are infinitely better than he would have us believe.",47
264,Mr STORRER,Unknown,He did not say that follow the latest and most there was anything wrong in the canteens. The honourable member is misrepresenting him.,47
265,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"The honto orable member suggested that there existence an awful evil which we ought to take the earliest opportunity contention is that the clause proposed by the honourable member for Batman would not decrease any evil that exists today, but would rather intensify it . It is because believe that arbitrary restrictions placed, and I think unfairly placed, on the men would lead to an increase of the evil if any exists today, that I submit my proposal.",47
266,Mr STORRER,Unknown,It was this House which made the conduct of the canteens as good as it is today.,47
267,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"If the House has so improved the canteens, it cannot do better than continue its excellent work. I can assure my honourable friend that if they are properly controlled, and the Department, by means of suitable regulations, looks after the conduct and health of the men, infinitely better results will be achieved than by driving them into the men's clubs. the nearest public house. If my amendment is not carried, I shall have no alternative but to bow to the inevitable. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) t -53]-- I trust that the Committee will 8 not accept the proposal of the honourable member for Wakefield. In all human undertakings, experience is the unerring test. My experience in the State of Kansas, which had a population of 1,500,000 persons, and a provision for the issue of a doctor's certificate to those who wanted spiritualization, was that, if not the whole of the community, a great number of the people, were sick every day, and the end of it all was that the State became one of spirituous hypocrites. I believe that the honourable member for Wakefield is conscientious, but if we agree to his amendment, we should have three-fourths of the Army sick all the time, under doctors' certificates. It is very easy to get a doctor's certificate. All a man has to do is to prick his arm a bit, and when the pulse gets high, the proper medicine will be prescribed. In the United States, prior to the abolition of the canteens, they were constantly court-martialling and punishing men in the camps of Western America for being intoxicated. Since then, that state of things has ceased. A reform, which has proved successful in a country where they up-to-date methods, is at least worthy of our consideration. I am grateful to the honourable member for Batman for having had the courage move the proposed new clause in the was in face of an almost hostile people.",47
268,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"I think that the to stem. My people are sympathetic. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Interferenc e with vested rights is not popular, especially I when it is proposed to stop the circulation of the "" stagger-juice."" Not America alone, but every civilized nation, is gradually abolishing the liquor traffic, or reducing it by regulations which circumscribe the flow of the ""stagger-juice"" or ""dizzy water."" Alcohol has its uses; let no one doubt that. But if our soldiers have money to spend and wish to drink, the publicans who pay licence fees and bonuses to get into hotels ought to have the benefit of their custom. It is not fair for the Government to interfere with the licensed victuallers, whom it employs police to watch night and day, by running an opposition shop.",47

271,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"It is our dirt) to soberize the officers. Apparently the country expects to be at war any moment - whethe r with rabbits, the elements, 01 its imagination, I do not know. We should not be asked to work for days at the creation of a scheme for a great army and navy, unless it were meant to k ill something. We are looking for blood.",48
272,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,The member is not now in order.,48
273,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"I agree with you, Mr Chairman. If we get ready for war, we are likely to have war. that the amendment of the honourable member for Wakefield, which is a sort of secret dagger for the assassination of the proposal to abolish the "" boozery "" element of the canteen, will not be agreed to. . Of course, there is nothing that can be said this side of heaven which will affect those who have made up their minds. The Danes were not in the habit of attacking the Scotch, but one night, when they did so, a lot of them fell into a bed of thistles, which made them scream out, so that the Scotchmen knew where they were, and fell upon ihem. Ever since the thistle has been the national emblem of Scotland. We do not wish the canteen to be the emblem of our Army. Let there be no "" stagger-juice "" sold there. The time haj> passed when men will fight drunk. At the battle of Shiloah, Alfred Sydney Johnston filled 4,000 of his men with powder mixed with whisky, and yet Grant knocked them out.",48
274,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Noith Sydney) [9.3] - I understand that the objection of the honourable member for Darwin to the amendment of the honourable member for Wakefield is that it permits alcohol to be prescribed for the use of members of the Military Forces. Although the word "" prescribe"" is frequently used in Acts of Parliament, it is not generall) used, as in this case, in reference to medical prescription. The honourable member seems afraid that sympathetic doctors may issue prescriptions permitting the use of alcohol so freely that the sobriety of the troops will be seriously affected. A similar objection might be taken to the clause proposed by the honourable member for Batman. I recognise that as we are now adopting a defence system which will bring about the enlistment of a large number of youths, we must consider how we can best guard them from temptation in respect to out strong drink and other things. To meet the new circumstances I shall be prepared to go further than 1I have hitherto been prepared to go. I think that the amendment of the honourable member for Wakefield does what is needed. It will practically exclude canteens from all places at which troops are located, except the barracks of the - Permanent Force. Surely, that is a very great restriction, and removes any temptation honourable that a canteen in the training camps might offer to the younger members of the forces. I do not say that they will be removed from all temptation'; in fact, the argument of the honourable I hope member for Cowper would mean that we should shut up all our hotels, because youths gather in numbers, pass the doors of hotels, and, if they have money, can indulge in liquor, which they must have money to buy in a canteen. The temptation is always there outside a camp, but I quite agree that, as the Government is taking so many youths from their families into camps of training it should act on the side of safety. To that extent I will support what I understand is now the Government's intention. But it is rather hypocritical to go further than that, and prevent those in residence in barracks from obtaining within those barracks, and under the supervision of officers, anything in the way of wine or beer that they may desire. We mightat once face that question if we are determined on it, by saying that none but teetotallers shall be admitted to the Permanent Forces.",48
275,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,They would be all the better if we could get them.,48
276,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Then let us face the question boldly in that way. To me, however, it seems hypocritical, because we do not place such a restriction on others, or even on ourselves. Why not abolish the bar in this Parliament?",48
277,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,We ought to.,48
278,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Ver y well, let us begin with ourselves. Not being in residence, we are not as dependent upon our bar as men in barracks are on their canteen. Tn the same way the illustration of the honourable member for Bass was not a good one when he asked if we should; put canteens in the post-offioes ; Postal employee's are not confined to or resident in the post-offices. The Permanent Forces are resident in barracks. more likely to furnish a safeguard as regards them by having' a canteen on the premises than by causing them to seek refreshment, if they want it, in public houses near or far. I do not wish to impose that necessity. If we take into the Permanent Forces men who are not total abstainers, I should not refuse them an opportunity of getting refreshments undei what I think are the best conditions. may be wrong, but it appears to me that the conditions would be better in the canteens under supervision than in public houses under none. Mr KING O'MALLEY - We might them to sign the pledge when we enlist them.",48
279,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"If the Committee wishes to do that, let them put the provision in the Bill. We ought not to try to do it in a roundabout way, which is more likely to do harm than good, especially when we are not seeking to impose limitations on other places which are under our own authority. I shall support the amendment of the honourable member for Wakefield, but if it is not carried I shall have to support the fuller proposal, because I do not wish to see temptations extended to the large number of youths who will be taken to the camps. At the same time, the fairer, more reasonable, and more desirable course is that proposed by the honourable member for Wakefield.",49
280,Mr BAMFO RD,Unknown,Herbert) [9.12] Does the honourable member for Wakefield mean that no man shall get intoxicating drink from a canteen in any camp without a doctor's prescription?,49
281,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,Yes ; would be no canteen except in the permanent barracks.,49
282,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"In any case I shall be compelled to vote against the amendment, and I intend also to vote against the honourable member for Batman's proposal.. The amendment seems an utter absurdity. No spirits are allowed in the canteens.. Only wine and beer can be obtained, and no doctor would give a prescription for a man to get a drink of wine or beer. amendment seems very weak and uncalled for. I served eleven years in the Defence Forces, and my experience of camps was that there was no intemperance at all. There was always a non-commissioned officer in charge of the canteen, and he We are would direct the soldier serving the liquor not to supply any more drink to a man who appeared to be getting more than was good for him. That man would get no more there, and if he showed signs of intoxication he would not get leave to go elsewhere for it. If he absented himself without leave he would be liable to punishment. The canteen hours are also strictly regulated. I think lights are out at 10 or I 10.30 at the latest, after which no one can get drink.",49
283,Mr ROBERTS,Unknown,"Light s are out at 8 o'clock now. get Mr BAMFORD - That makes the case very much better. It must be remembered also that officers are not restricted as to the drink they can get. The men have not the same privilege. If they cannot get it at the canteen, they cannot get it at all. Some years ago, as a member of the Mili tary Forces of Queensland, I ,went into camp one day when it was raining very heavily. All the tents were blown down, and it was impossible to re-erect them'owing to the heavy wind which prevailed. As a result, all of us got soaking wet . 1 Next day, Sir Arthur Palmer, Chief Secretary of ' Queensland, ordered rum and quinine to be supplied. A cask was placed upon a dray, two men were put in charge of it, and the liquor was served out to every man who would drink it . As a result, only three cases of - illness followed, all of which proved fatal. In each of these cases, the men who were attacked either with severe cold or gastric fever were teetotallers. They refused to drink thf liquor upon principle, and, as a result, sacrificed their lives. That is my experience of the serving of spirits to soldiers there under conditions which conclusively proved that the use of it was beneficial. A little while ago, I heard a lecture delivered by Lieutenant Shackleton, upon his experiences in the Antarctic Seas.. He relates that when his party were landing the ponies at the base of their operations, one of them fell into a crevasse where it lay for some hours. After great difficulty, it was extricated; and, in order to restore animation half a bottle of brandy was poured down the - animal's throat, with the result that it was The completely restored. I understand that, subsequently, the time of two members of the expedition was exclusively occupied in watching that pony, which was constantly on the look out to discover another crevasse . into which to f all . '",49
284,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"I did the same thing to a pony, and it killed him.",50
285,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"It appears to me that we are attempting to carry this legislation a little too far. When the Honourable Thomas Playford was Minister of Defence, he authorized the issue of a regulation under which only wines and beers can be served at military canteens. That regulation has since been honestly observed; and I think that we shall do well if we allow things to remain as they are. If the proposed new clause be amended at all, I trust that it will be in the direction of making it permissible for the Minister of Defence to declare whether or not a canteen shall be established at any camp. I shall oppose the amendment, and also the clause moved by the honourable member for Batman.",50
286,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Wentworth) [9.18] - I do not intend to trespass upon the patience of honourable members for more than a moment or two. VVe are all indebted to the honourable member for Wakefield for having placed before the Committee a clear-cut issue. This discussion was originated by an appeal to the temperance views of the vast majority of honourable members. But the honourable member for Batman did not attempt to argue that any grounds exist for the adoption of his proposal; though I am willing to believe that some grounds do exist. But I know that there are very serious reasons why we ought not to abolish the canteen which exists under proper supervision at the Victoria Barracks, Sydney. The Minister has received an anonymous letter in reference to that canteen, and so also has the honourable member for Maribyrnong. I would ask him whether, in his opinion, the correspondent who wrote to him did so as a temperance man, who was desirous of suppressing the drink traffic, or as one who was obsessed and annoyed at the "" unfair competition"" of this canteen with honest tradesmen outside the barracks. I have no doubt that the honourable member has an accurate memory of the contents of the letter; and 1 again ask him whether the .tone of that communication was such as would come from a temperance advocate ?",50
287,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,On e of the letters which I received was perfectly genuine; but I did not like the tone of the other.,50
288,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I can quite understand that. One of the communications received by the honourable member is simply redolent of spirit! My contention-whic h is based upon accurate knowledge-is that if we close the canteen which has been established at the. Victoria Barracks, Sydney, the men in those barracks will be driven in their leisure hours into infinitely less desirable surroundings, where they will take infinitely more harmful liquor. I had drafted an amendment upon this proposed new clause, in which I had hoped to make it perfectly clear that canteens at military barracks should be exclusively for the use of the officers and men who ""are resident there; and that they should be permitted to exist purely at the Minister's discretion. I do not think that anybody would distrust the Minister in a matter of this kind.",50
289,Mr COON,Unknown,The honourable member would not trust him very far the other day.,50
290,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"U p o n this question, I would trust him very much further than I would the honourable member for Batman, because, ever since the Minister of Defence has been in the public life of Australia, he has been in the forefront of the temperance movement. What I feel is that we are legislating this evening with that haste to which the honourable member for North Sydney objected on a former occasion. We are legislating in the absence of any; statement whatever from the Minister. We do not know what is the actual position in regard to canteens at our military barracks. If the Minister were to assure me that they are being abused, I would confess myself a convert, and would be prepared to support the proposal of the honourable member for Batman. But years ago an inquiry was conducted into this very question; and it was then shown that these canteens are conducted in an exemplary fashion Has the Minister any other information in reference to them? If he has not, I think that a very serious injustice would be done to the men in the Victoria Barracks, Sydney, if we abolished the canteen which has been established there; and thus compelled them to obtain their liauor amid worse surroundings. . I am confident that the Minister might well be vested with discretion to abolish these canteens the moment that he was satisfied that that course could be adopted without worse results ensuing. If my amendment were carried, the Minister could abolish any military canteen tomorrow, if in his sober judgment- I use the word "" sober "" advisedly-h e believed it was to the best interest of thei men in those barracks. The amendment that I was going to propose, but which I do not think it will be necessary for me now to move, reads as followsProvided that the Minister may,, at his cretion, subject to prescribed conditions strictions, allow the sale, supply and possesput sion of such liquors in permanent barracks the exclusive use of officers and men quartered in the said barracks. The only difference between that and the amendment moved by the honourable member for Wakefield is to be found in the use of the words "" for the exclusive use of the officers and men quartered in the said barracks."" I think it is only just to the anonymous correspondents of honour the able members, who carry on a very laudable occupation outside the limits of the toria Barracks', Sydney, that no "" unfair That competition"" sbould take place between the canteens and the hotels in the immethe diate vicinity.

292,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Meantim-i , I think that we are entitled to call upon the Minister to state why the Committee should upon the permanent men in barracks these very serious disabilities. It is a question, not of temperance, but of moral safety temperance sanity. No temperance man who understands the situation would for a moment think of driving the Victoria Barracks into hotels in the immediate neighbourhood. Some of hotels are of a high grade, but not all of them. I paid my first and only visit to the canteen in the Victoria Barracks, Sydney, one morning when this question was proposed last before the House. I went there, unister expectedly, either just before or immescribed diately after lunch, and found no one in sale, the canteen. There were a number of men officers playing dominoes in the card rooms, and a few watching a billiard match, and, on making inquiries, 1 learned that the bilplacing liard table, the library-in which I also saw men-and the dominoes had been purnow propose? chased out of the profits on the liquors supplied in the canteen. The "" honest tradesman "" outside, who is so indignant at this arrangement, would, under another state of affairs, be obtaining the profits that are now being devoted to the well-being of the men in their hours of leisure. I not think it is right for the Minister allow this question to go to a division without stating the position of the Department. I have been very loth to say anything in disthis connection, but I think the honourable and regentleman owes it to his high position to the Committee in full possession of-the for facts.

The wider proposal to abolish from the Military Forces canteen system is an effort to do good that the wisdom of the wise is called upon restrain. It would merely offer a premium to illicit trafficking in drink.

The article from which I make this quotation appears in this evening's issue of the Herald, under the heading "" Reference to Evangelists ""- Mr Sutton (New South Wales) said that temperance hotel had been started in Sydney with a great announcement, "" Without a liquor bar.""

Apparently some honourable members appeared to be afraid to demand a division.",51
300,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"The motion was carried without a division. ' Mr HUTCHISON - Exactly . But' I would remind the honourable member for Maribyrnong of another division which took place on this question. I will mind him of how he voted, and of how the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, and MdCay, the former Minister of Defence, voted. It will be remembered that we a discussion as to whether we were to mit liquor to be imported into Papua. proposition was made on October 24, 1905, that-The sale or manufacture cating liquor or opium excepting for medicinal purposes should be prohibited. The present Minister of Defence voted with me on the right side, so as not to allow the blacks of Papua to have intoxiber cating liquors.

Whether one goes to a camp, a race-course, or any other place of resort, men who are ]jis the worse for liquor will always be seen. But they are exceptions. Nothing we can get my do would make such men sober. They will get liquor whether we like it or not.

I can honourable members that there is very little drunkenness at military canthis teens. Not only are men under the influence of drink refused liquor, but there is the additional safeguard that there is a non-commissioned officer in every tent. If they are not allowed to obtain liquor at the canteens they will sneak outof their tents, cross the lines, and go to the nearest public house or buy a bottle from any person whom they may meet. No proof has been advanced in the course of this debate that there is drunkenness in our forces. As the honourable member for North reSydney has said, this is a hypocritical proposal in view of the fact that we have Mr our own bar at Parliament House. Some people outside used to say that the use of had the bar at Parliament House showed that perthis was a drinking assembly, but when the A figures were published it was demonstrated that only about 4jd. per member per week of intoxiwas spent on stimulants.",52

I have taken part in the expulsion of members who were the . worse for liquor. Some have afterwards come back reformed. But what is the use of prohibiting one set of men from doing what you afford facilities for another set to do? In South Australia we 'have a non-commissioned officer's club with a bar attached fo it. I am sure that any one who has frequented it will acknowledge that no drunkenness has been seen there.",53

309,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"I have been to the club to which I refer night after night, and year after year, and have never seen one man the worse for liquor. But if that Canteen is abolished what will happen? The men, instead of going to their canteen, will go to a hotel. At a hotel there will not be the same counter attractions as there are at the canteen, where they can enjoy all sorts of games. They will stand at' the hotel bar drinking by the half-hour. That will not be an improvement. We ' should do everything possible to discourage excessive drinking in our forces, and I certainly trust that everything will be done to keep temptation out of the way of the toys. I would not allow any intoxicating liquor to be introduced where they are being trained. But if we admit to the forces men who are not teetotallers, but who are accustomed to take stimulants in. moderation, we shall not succeed in making them abstain by abolishing the canteen. I ' would rather see prohibition than the partial arrangement now proposed. There are vices that can be prohibited by Act of Parliament, but that cannot be prevented and should be regulated, and kept within narrow limits. I think that we have regulated an admitted evil by means of canteens. I do not think there is a teetotal officer in South Australia who would say that there would be any advantage in abolishing the non-commissioned officers' canteen at the drill ground in Adelaide. We ought to do all we can to keep men sober. I have been astonished to hear honourable members twitting each other about their votes on this question. I was a miember of a, committee that worked with the temperance party to prevent the suppb' of liquor to the natives of Papua, but I I think every member of that committee deserted me.",53

311,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"As a member of the committee, I never. agreed to the course that was followed. I attended every meeting of the committee. I know all about what took place, and I know that,' for party reasons, certain information was sent to the Temperance Alliance in New South Wales and in South Australia.

If they are consulted, they will admit that they voted precisely as I say they did, because they were against the manufacture or sale of liquor in Papua.

What other time, and what more opportune time, could be selected for bringing forward this proposal than when we have a Defence Bill before us? To say that it is submitted now for electioneering purposes is utter nonsense, and the honourable member knows it. I am not going to discuss the reference to the supply of liquor to the natives of Papua, because nothing is to be gained by discussing it.

Whatthese people did or did not do has no bearing on the merits of the proposal under discussion. The decision arrived at in regard to Papua has nothing to do with it either. The question we have to decide is whether it is the duty of the Government to directly traffic in intoxicating drink. This House, But I do in the last Parliament, decided, if not by a unanimous vote, at all events without a division, in favour of an anti-canteen Bill. In doing so, we followed the example of America, where the canteen was abolished, even in the Navy. Every one of the magni-. ficent American warships that visited Ausreport tralia'last year is a prohibition ship; not a drop of liquor is allowed on any of them. We all admired the character and behaviour of the men of the American Navy wno visited us.

We have in this matter the example of America, ancl it should be remembered that America is maintaining this prohibition in the teeth of the opposition of leading naval and military officers.

If I understand it aright, it would involve the abolition of the non-commissioned, officers' club now situated on the Parade Ground in Adelaide, while at the same time the members of an officers' club in Grenfell-street, of which I have the honour to be a member, would continue to be at liberty to attend - the club and obtain liquor there. confident that the honourable member for Wakefield does not intend that that kinci of distinction should the made, and I suggest that it is inadvisable to accept tht amendment in its present form.",54
335,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"ParramattaMinister of Defence) [9-55] - It is about time we came to a vote on this matter. I do not at all underrate its importance. The reason I did not speak before was because I wanted to hear just what could be said against the proposal of the honourable member for Batman. not think that there is any need for me ro say very much on the question. My attitude has always been well known to honourable members; and I see no reason to change my opinion. I recognise, of course, that as Minister I am bound to look to the facts as they present themselves to me, and to hear all that can be said both for and against proposals which, if adopted, would make a somewhat drastic change in the condition of affairs. There is no need to labour the matter. In the first place, should like to brush away any suspicion which may have been created, that a great quantity of liquor is consumed in the canteens. Such is not the case. I have only been able to glance at the papers as to the condition of affairs which existed in the Victoria Barracks, Sydney, in 1905, when spirits as well as wines and ales were sold. I find that the consumption of liquor there was very much below the outside average. It should be remembered that, in addition to those who permanently lived on the premises, there was a great deal be called casual drinking. I understand that militiamen were allowed to niake use the canteen, and that if a militia regiment were passing, its members could enter obtain drinks. Notwithstanding all the casual drinking, the average consumption for the whole establishment was below outside average. Since then, there have been very strict regulations framed which further limited the possibilities for drinkI think ing there. One of the regulations reads as follows :At all canteens and institutes established under the regulations the supply of all alcoholic liquors except ales and wines is strictly prohibited. In these institutions, only wines and ales are now supplied.",55
336,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Does that regulation apply to the canteen in a camp?,55
337,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I should think I am so.,55
338,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,It does not.,55
339,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Does the honourable member say that it does not apply to camps?,55
340,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,It is not carried out in the camp canteens.,55
341,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I do not know anything about that. I only know that the regulation is supposed to apply to "" all canteens and institutes."" We must take the honourable member's statement as evidence that the regulation is sometimes evaded in camps. Wherever liquor is sold the law is I do liable to be evaded. We cannot, it seems to me, strictly regulate the traffic and prescribe bounds which may not be at any time exceeded. We have to take the thing as we find it. In all matters which have to do with the appetities and passions of people, we must allow a very large margin between the prescription of the Statute and the actual state of things as we know it to exist. That is why it is always a safe thing, in connection with the liquor traffic, to make the statuI tory requirements as strict as you can, because, as T say, there is more or less evasion. In my judgment, these canteens, having regard to the liquor which is sold, are well conducted and kept strictly under control. Here and there a case of drunkenness may occur. I believe that in 1905 there were only two cases of drunkenness at the barracks in Sydney, and since then further restrictive regulation has been imposed.",55
342,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,That is a of what might marvellous record.,55
343,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Perhaps it is. of I think that, in the interest of the men, it is only fair to put that side of the case. and Now the question arises whether we ought to encourage the sale of liquor, under the auspices of the Government, at any of the the camps or canteens. There is a unanimous opinion in the Committee that intoxicants ought to be kept out of the way of all young trainees; and that, even as regards the older people, there ought to be no sale of liquor in camps. Every honourable member has said that during the debate; and, moreover, further proposals have been made for strictly regulating the sale of liquor in canteens. The last amendment of the honourable member for Wakefield provides that only those who are permanently quartered in the barracks shall be permitted to obtain intoxicants at the canteen. He therefore proposes to shut out a large number of militiamen who, until now, have been permitted to go to the barracks and get beer or wine if they so desired. The question arises whether, if we are going to narrow the thing down to so fine a point, it is worthwhile to run a canteen for the sake of from 200 to 250 persons out of, say, TO, 000. - Mr JOHNSON - It would be far better to get rid of the canteen altogether.",55
344,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Every section Minister of the Committee is agreed that the sale intoxicants to our troops should be nartaken rowed down to that fine point; and the question arises whether, if we think it to give thousands of men no facilities the purchase of intoxicants of 'any kind, is worthwhile to continue the business for the sake of a couple of hundred men.",56
345,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"On e man is a permanent resident, and the other is not.",56
346,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Yes ; but I take it that the honourable member for Batman has so arranged his proposal as to place no disability upon those in the barracks, as compared with those outside It would be just as easy for the men in the barracks to get their glass of beer as it would be for those outside to get theirs; and, therefore, it seems to me that no relative injustice would be done. This question has been brought before the House on several occasions. In the last Parliament, the honourable member For Maribyrnong introduced a Bill which was passed through all its stages here without a division, but which met with a different fate in another place. I venture to say that the opinion of honourable members has not changed much since then. I shall vote, as I have always voted, and with the other members of the Government, shall support the amendment. determined to apply a principle, it is not worthwhile to make a distinction, for the sake of the few permanent men in Sydney, or elsewhere, between them and the rest of the forces.",56
347,Mr KELLY,Unknown,It would be within the discretion of the Minister to close the Sydney canteen at any time if he thought fit.,56
348,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I have already pointed out that, according to the official reports, excessive drinking does not take place there, less than the usual quantity of alcoholic liquor being consumed. I deny the allegations of intemperance regarding these canteens. An anonymous communication on the subject reached me the other day, and I should have torn it up at once had not the honourable member's name been mentioned in it . I showed it to him for that reason, but I think that communications from persons who have not the pluck to sign their names ought to be at once thrown into the waste-paper basket. The Government feel that no injustice will be done to the service by agreeing to the amendment.",56
349,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,"Calare) [10.10] - I heard the announcement of the with considerable satisfaction, and of congratulate the Government upon having a decided stand on this question. The attitude of Ministers makes it unneceswise sary for me to deliver the address which for I had intended to make.

On this occasion, I consider that the Government is in the right, and shall therefore have much pleasure, should a division be called for, in voting with it. In reply to what was said by the honourable member for North Sydney about the unfairness of legislating for the military in a way in which we do not legislate for ourselves, I have only to say that I am quite willing to support anv Droposal to abolish the canteen in this building.",56
352,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"And the refreshment room with it? Mr THOMAS . BROWN - No ; that is legitimate. The attitude of the Government to the proposed new clause shows the healthy state of the temperance movement. At one time it was thought Having that the best drinkers made the best fighters, and in the old days a great deal of drinking was done by the military, with the result that the Army was greatly demoralized. Experience and modern thought and research have since caused our best and most competent military authorities to side with temperance reforms, and many of them have pronounced definitely in regard to the evil of intemperance. Indeed, it is generally accepted that temperance is necessary where physical strength and endurance are required, or great mental effort needed. superiority of the abstainer over the man who indulges in alcoholic beverages is very marked, and has received confirmation in many directions. Without labouring the question, I should like to read a short extract from a work recently issued by Dr Zacher, the Director of the German Imperial Statistical Department. He has at his disposal wide means of investigating the question, he deals largely with industrial and general insurance, and has given special study to the effects of strong drink upon the human system. On pages 36 and 37 of his work Social Progress, published in 1906, he expresses himself thusThe continued and detailed statistics of the distinction. working men's insurance have demonstrated that alcoholism, that is the excessive consumpreasonably deny them to the others. tion of - alcoholic drinks, leads to increased posure to sickness, accidents and invalidity, consequently increased mortality. Moreover, people addicted lo alcohol readily contract diseases all sorts, convalesce slower, and nre prone relapse; while, on the other hand, the bers who abstain from such excesses are far less exposed, and their recoveries are surer more rapid. It is certain that the abuse alcohol tends not only to largely increase liability to accidents and unfavorably fluences their consequences, but also promotes and spreads the national disease of tuberculosis. Objections have been raised to this prothe posal by those .who favour the liquor traffic. It is most extraordinary that, whilst the pro-liquor people allege that the efforts made by temperance reformers 1.0 limit the consumption of liquor have actually intrain creased it, they take up the paradoxical position of opposing temperance movements, which, to be logical, they should support, citizens. if , as they allege, they benefit the liquor traffic. In America, the proposal to abolish canteens,was brought into operation in 1901, after a great struggle - between the temby perance and anti-temperance parties, which has continued up to the present time. am not unbiased in regard to this matter, because I have never cultivated a taste drink, and if it could be abolished morrow it would not affect me; but at the same time, I do not wish to set myself as a pattern for my fellow men. I refor cognise that others take a different view, and if they had not facilities to obtain Mr Thomas Brown. drink, would feel that they were being deprived of something in which they not only find pleasure, but from which they probably think they derive a great deal of benefit. I recognise that this matter is one for public opinion - It is possible to place upon, the statute-bocks the strongest prohiThe bitive laws; but if they are not backed up by a healthy sympathetic public opinion, they become obsolete and a dead letter. A .great part of the temperance movement is in the direction of educating public opinion, and it has to some extent been successful. In this case, members are generally agreed that it would be unwise to offer facilities for drinking in the newer conditions of the military service, into which we are introducing so many youths. It would be a national calamity to instil into them a liking for alcoholic drinks. It is suggested that a line of demarcation shall be drawn between that young element and the more permanent side of the forces; but I do not see the justice or reason for any such If it is good for the Permanent Forces to have canteens, we cannot Tf ir exis desirable 'to limit or abolish the facilities for obtaining drink with regard to the rank of and file, and especially the younger porto tion, we ought to be logical and apply the memsame principle all round. I cannot support and the amendment of the honourable member of for Wakefield; but I shall vote for the the proposal of the honourable member for Batinman, which is a wise one, and should be carried, particularly, in. the interests of the young element that we are introducing into forces, and also in the interest of others who have cultivated a taste for drink, but who might well be asked to exercise a little self denial in camps. I hope that we shall our young men under the best and the most healthy conditions, so that they will prove, not only good soldiers, but also good",56
353,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Wentworth) [10.24] - I was glad to hear the Minister's statement. I do not think there is much to be gained pressing the amendment if the Minister does not wish to accept the responsibility I of saying whether or not such canteens in permanent barracks as the honourable for member for Wakefield, myself, and toothers wish to exempt from the proposed new clause, are hurtful or otherwise to the up men they serve. The Minister has asked enough responsibilities tp be cast upon his shoulders throughout the conduct of this Bill ; and if he will not accept this responsibility, it is of no use to endeavour to it upon him. I therefore suggest that the amendment be not pressed; but this vision should be enforced wherever there are camps. I know a place where those present are drawn up into two camps, almost always in a state of war. The has come when the canteen which has been established, in that place ought to be abolished.",57
354,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,Unknown, Does the honourable member than think that his remarks have any relevance to the question which is before the Chair?,58
355,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I designedly mentioned for a day or two. the matter in vague terms, in the hope that, in a spirit of forbearance, you, sir, might assume that I was referring to a military institution ! As a matter of fact, the camps to which I was alluding are those found inside of this House, and the canteen which I wish to see abolished is Refreshment Room upstairs. Mr ROBER1S (Adelaide) [10.27] - It seems to me that the amendment which the Minister has agreed to accept will work injustice in two directions. In the first place, it will mean the abolition of non-commissioned officers' club,. which, by permission of the authorities, has been tablished on the Parade Ground, Adelaide, whilst it will leave the officers' club touched. I take it that the non-commissioned officers' club will be regarded "" military post,"" and that, as such, will be abolished, whilst the commissioned, officers will be permitted to carry on without let or hindrance their club, which is negatived. situated a few yards up the street.",58

If the proposed new clause be adopted, canteens at military barracks throughout the Commonwealth will be abolished.

The effect of the clause will therecadets ? fore be to prevent privates from obtaining beer at their barracks, whilst permitting force non-commissioned officers and officers to obtain liquors at their messes. It will prothus create a distinction which ought not to be permitted, and which will be calculated to breed envy in the and minds of the members of our Defence time Forces. I do hope that in the circumstances the Minister will not accept the amendment in its present form. I should like to assist him to complete the consideraof the Bill this evening, but rather that injustice should be inflicted upon so many members of our Defence Forces, I should prefer to see its passing delayed  the Minister of Defence intend to take anv action in reference to the position which has been placed before him by the honorto be able member for Adelaide?",58

363,Dr WILSON,Unknown,That no one shall be allowed to supply them with cigarettes.,58
364,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,How could we control the shopkeepers ?,59
365,Dr WILSON,Unknown,I presume that this Parliament has power to control the sale of cigarettes under this Bill to members of the Cadet Forces.,59

369,Dr WILSON,Unknown,I want the Parliament to try to stop it . Mr W . H . IRVINE - We cannot do so by means of the honourable member's amendment.,59
370,Dr WILSON,Unknown,"I am quite prepared to recast the amendment in any way that will make it effective. It is universally knowledged that the habit of cigarette smoking is sapping the moral, physical, and mental strength of the youth of the world, and I hope my proposal will be carried.",59
371,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,North Sydney) [10.37] - I am absolutely with the honourable member for Corangamite as to the undesirableness of youths smoking cigarettes to the extent that many of them do.,59
372,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Youth s of tender years should smoke neither cigarettes, pipes, nor cigars.",59
373,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I agree with the honourable member, but we ought to know whether it is within our jurisdiction to give effect to such a provision as this. If it is not, the only result of our passing it would be another High Court action with an unsatisfactory issue. the Attorney-General to inform the Committee whether it is within our power to pass such a proposal as this.",59
374,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Melbourne) [10.40] I take it that the honourable member for Corangamite has made this proposal because of the youth of our cadets. A good deal of nonsense has been written and spoken in regard to this question. my privilege when in London to carry out with others some experiments with regard to the relative effects of cigarettes, and an equal weight of tobacco, smoked in a pipe, or in the shape of a cigar, on the human system. The experiments were conducted by means of the sphygmograph, a pulse registering instrument, and it was found that the cigarette was certainly least harmful. I am willing to present to honourable members a gentleman living in our midst who has inhaled cigarettes for fifty-five years, and who, to look at, is a fairly healthy individual. I have never yet met a man who has inhaled smoke from a pipe or a cigar for five years and lived. The inhaling of a cigarette is very different from the smoking of one.  does not inhale any ?",59
375,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"He will be in better health than those who do. When a cigarette inhaler seeks medical advice, it is always well to tell him> to take to the pipe since he will not in that way inhale the smoke; but the mildness of cigarettes which permits of inhaling should not be counted against them. Whilst I agree that those who are not of adult age should not smoke either cigarettes, cigars, or pipes, I thought it ac- well to-correct the popular misapprehension which exists in regard to the effect of cigarette smoking by citing the result of experiments such as have been made by very few medical men in Australia, or even in Great Britain. I am a cigarette smoker, and strongly ""resent the rubbish that is both written and spoken by men who have not given much consideration to this question. If the honourable member for Corangamite will go a step further and propose that youths of tender age shall not be allowed to use tobacco in any form I will support him. I take it that the proposed newclause is designed to prevent cadets from obtaining cigarettes from the canteens, but I cannot see that it would enable iis to interfere with the sale of cigarettes by shopkeepers. Before committing ourselves we should have the opinion of the AttorneyI ask General as to our power to pass such a provision. We could certainly prevent cadets of tender age from obtaining tobacco in any form from military canteens. Mr. JOSEPH COOK ^ParramattaMinister of Defence) [10.44] - It is quite clear that however desirable it may be, we have no power to do what the honourable It was member for Corangamite suggests. I think that every honourable member would enthusiastically support his proposal if we had the power to give effect to it .",59
376,Mr THOMAS BROWN,Unknown,If we have not the power how can we regulate the drink traffic ?,59
377,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"All constitutional lawyers are agreed that we have no such power as this to prevent the sale of cigarettes to boys. We have no control over the Cadets, except when they are training.  the canteens shall not sell cigarettes to boys while they are training?",59
378,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Yes , we have that power.",60
379,Dr WILSON,Unknown,"I intend to propose to add the words "" w h i l e in training.""",60
380,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Eve n so, I doubt whether we could prevent a storekeeper from selling cigarettes to cadets. I am afraid that the honourable member cannot accomplish his object in a Bill of this kind. We shall have to leave the matter to the States. All that we can do is to prevent the boys from smoking cigarettes while they are under our control. 1 should be very glad to compass that end by regulation, and honourable members may rely upon the vigilance of the Department to prevent the boys from smoking cigarettes while they are under the control of our officers.",60
381,Dr WILSON,Unknown,"Corangamite) [10.46] I do not wish to leave everything to the Minister. The Committee should express its own common sense in regard to that point. The Attorney-General and other legal members have signified some doubt as to what I propose, but I shall act upon the rule ""When in doubt, play trumps."" I desire to amend my amendment, by adding after the word "" cadet"" the words "" while in training."" Amendment amended accordingly.",60
382,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Angas-Attorney-General ) [10.47] - I suggested to the honourable member for Corangamite that he should add the words "" while in training,"" but I also pointed out to him that it was doubtf u l whether the amendment, even if amended in this way, would carry out his object. We can, without the amendment, exercise control over the cadets while they are undergoing training, but not at any other time.",60
383,Mr BRUC ESMITH,Unknown,"Parkes) [10.48]. - I should like the Minister of Defence to consider whether he is not jeopardizing part of this Bill by attempting to legislate for a class. He has suggested that the subject should be left to be dealt with by regulation. If that be done, no constitutional question can arise. I suggest that it is unnecessary for this Committee to be concerning itself with a question which is even now being discussed by the Legislature of the State of Victoria. At any [180] rate, it is rather undignified to be spending so much time over a question that can be regulated by the Minister in ten minutes. It reminds me of a story concerning the Bank of England. The Court of Directors wished to stop their officers from wearing moustaches. This was at a period when the w-earing of moustaches was unfashion^ able. But it was objected that to issue such a rule would be to interfere with the : liberty of the subject. One member of the Court of Directors, however, got over the difficulty by suggesting that officers of the Bank should not be allowed to wear moustaches "" during business hours.""That suggestion obviated the objection that the liberty of the subject was being interfered with ; and some guide may be drawn from it in the present circumstances. Honourable members who have regard for the dignity of this Chamber should, I think, leave the matter to be dealt with by the Minister by regulation.

I submit the motion prn forma get some reply from the Minister on the question. The honourable member for drawn. Corio is not too well, and has not been able to proceed with the clauses he intended to move dealing with the question of contributory pensions. I think the Minister might undertake at this stage to appoint a Committee from his own Department to draw up a scheme of pension? to be submitted to this Parliament in the form of a separate Bill . The absence of pensions stitutes one of the main difficulties in way of dealing with permanent officers, ought to be retired. No reasonable opThere portunity is afforded of getting rid of officer who has passed his years of usefor fulness if by his retirement he is thrown fpon the streets. I ask the Minister whether he cannot undertake to introduce without unreasonable delay, and that means, I hope, this session some time, Bill to provide for military pensions, which, T think, are absolutely essential.",61
386,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Parramatta) [ n . i ] - I wish to say briefly that the matter to which the honourable member fers is a very important one, and that we do address ourselves to the considerasembly tion of pensions it will not be in connection with a Bill of this description. The question of providing pensions for whole of the Public Service will, I think, require very serious consideration before long.",61
387,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,We delibethe rately decided against them in the first Parliament.,61
388,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I am aware that, but since that time proposals to establish Public Service pensions upon a contributory basis have been made to the Government, and will be seriously conmisfortune sidered by them. We shall require to go very thoroughly into the question of payment of pensions, especially in relation to the Navy we propose to establish. we are to establish an up-to-date Navy of the fact that some on the basis of the Navy of the Old Country, and standardized in every way with that Navy, pensions will become, I am afraid, a necessity of the situation. I shall not say that I am afraid this will be so, because if they are established upon a proper basis I do not see why they should not result in great good to the Public Service as a whole. The matter is a very large one, :- and I can only say now that the Governrement will consider it seriously and earnestly.",61

I suggested that who we should adjourn over the last Cup Day. is a large number of people depenan dent on the whim and will"" of this House an opportunity to see the Melbourne Cup race. I venture to say that it would do some of our honourable friends opposite good if they went to Flemington on Tuesday'next. ' I am asking the Prime Minister a to be good enough to say whether there is any possibility of this House adjourning for the Melbourne Cup. Several Honorable MEMBERS - No . Mr TILLEY , BROWN - I venture to resuggest that the House should adjourn. when I may mention that the Legislative Asof Victoria always meets at 7 o'clock on that day. If we were to follow that example, I have no doubt we the should do as much work in the eveningas we should have done if we had sat all day. I ask the Prime Minister to bear in mind the position which Victoria holds in Commonwealth. If this were a matter affecting New South Wales, I believe .that honourable members would readily agree to of adjourn over the Tuesdav afternoon.",61
391,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Melbourne) [11.6] It is not often that I agree with the Honourable member for Indi, but I suppose that or otherwise must come to us as we grow older. I think that the spectacle the at Flemington Race-course, on Tuesday next will be as beautiful as any presented If on Sydney Harbor, which has no greater. admirer than myself. Honourable members from other States should be afforded an opportunity to witness the great racing carnival of Victoria. It is very unlikely that I would attend if the House refrained from sitting on Tuesday afternoon; but I know that if it should sit many persons who desire to go to Flemington will be prevented - from doing so. I do not believte that there is an honourable member who would care to bar any one who wishes to see the Cup race. Of course, it is not necessary for persons to bet if they go. I know a Victorian official who has seen twenty-five Melbourne Cup races run without wagering a sixpenny piece. I am making this appeal to the Government on behalf of those who otherwise, will have to attend the sitting of the House, including the members of the fourth estate, the officers of the House, and a number of other persons. If an opportunity arises I shall move that the House adjourn over Tuesday afternoon.",61
392,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Ballarat-Prime Minister) [ n . 8 j - I shall consider the question ; but I believe it will be quite possible by an adjustment of the business to meet the desire of those who feel that the state of the notice-paper does not permit an' adjournment at present, and to allow those who so desire to absent themselves without detriment to their public, obligations. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at IX.Q p.m.",62
